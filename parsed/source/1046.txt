TEXT:
from this morning's meeting.   Erskine asked for feedback on whether to
have one or two meetings in the morning and/or on whether to take other
steps to improve staff morale.   I don't think he expects feedback from
everyone, so if you have nothing to say on this important issue, I suspect
that's fine.
