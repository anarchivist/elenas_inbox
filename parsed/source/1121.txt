                                DECLINING MINORITY COLLEGE ADMISSIONS

          Background: Recently the Washington Post reported that the number of black students
          admitted to UCLA law school dropped by 80% in one year and is now the lowest since the early
          1970s, UC Berkeley admitted just 14 black students out ofa class of792, down from 75 in 1996,
           And at the University of Texas, nearly 400 fewer blacks and Hispanics have been offered
          undergraduate admission, a 20% drop in one year. Meanwhile, white and Asian admissions are
          up in both states, In both states the sharp declines in minority admissions are attributed to roll-
          backs of affirmative action--in California, by the UC Board of Regents, and in Texas by the 5th
          Circuit's Hopwood decision,

          Question:      Are you concerned about recent reports of declining emollments of minority
                         students in postsecondary education?

          Answer:        These declines are disturbing and completely unacceptable, Educational
                         opportunity is the touchstone of the American dream, and figures like this raise a
                         serious concern that the doors of college education are being closed to minority
                         students, In addition, diversity in education helps prepare all our students to be
                         productive citizens in the 21 st century, so these developments should concern
                         every American,


          Question:      What is your administration doing to address this problem?

          Answer:        We are working on several fronts to address this issue:

                 ·       We will continue to intervene in litigation in support of appropriate affirmative
                         action programs, The Department of Education is looking for a good opportunity
                         to challenge the Hopwood decision, and .the Department of Justice has filed a brief
                         challenging California's Proposition 209,

                 ·       The Office for Civil Rights at the Department of Education is conducting a review
                         of the Texas higher education system to ensure that Texas has eliminated all
                         remnants of its former de jure segregated system,

                 ·      And, more broadly, the Administration is pressing higher education officials to
                        pmaintain and expand diversity, and offering assistance to them to do so, For
                        example, we have called on colleges and universities burdened by new legal
                        restrictions to develop new and creative approaches to achieving diversity, such as .
                        aggressively recruiting in secondary schools with high percentages of minority
                        students and forming educational partnerships with such schools,




                                                                      Automated Records Management System
                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion
