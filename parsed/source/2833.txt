     I've got to say that this seems to me woldly disproportionate as a
     political matter (putting aside whether it's also disproportionate as a
     matter of constitutional law).  What do other peple think?

     It does, in fact,       appear to be right.

     Title IV of ESEA (Safe and Drug Free Schools) has two provisions that deal
     with tobacco-free schools.

     The first is a requirement that schools that are applying for SDFS grants
     certify in their applications that they have a policy prohibiting the use
     of tobacco by students and adults at all times in school buildings and on
     school grounds, consistent with the Tobacco-Free Schools Act.

     The Tobacco-Free Schools Act is defined further down in the bill (Section
     D Related Provisions).   This section would add new language to the ESEA
     requiring that each SEA and LEA that receives ESEA funds have a policy
     that prohibits the use of tobacco, in any form, at any time, and by any
     person, in school buildings, on school grounds, or at any school-sponsored
     event.    [The actual langauge reads that "SEAs and LEA receving funds
     under this Act must have a policy ... " which OMB reads as meaning-ESEA,
     although it could mean under the SDFS section.    I've asked Education for
     clarification on what they intended to do here] .

     This language would replace similar language under current law in the
     Pro-Children Act of 1994 (which basically prohibits smoking in schools or
     other indoor facilities that receive federal funds from Education,
Agriculture or HHS) .  The proposed new language would also impose more
stringent requirements than the Pro-Children Act, in that: (1) the
Pro-Children Act pertains only to smoking, whereas the proposed new                               [oof}
language would prohibit smoking as well as the use of smokeless tobacco in
schools; and (2) the Pro-Children Act prohibitions on smoking pertain to
indoor facilities only and apply only during the school day, whereas the
proposed new language would prohibit the use of tobacco on school grounds
as well as in school buildings, at any time, or at any school-sponsored
event.

 In our earlier SDFS meetings, Education had not previously indicated that
they would condition ESEA funding on an expansion of the Pro-Children Act
(I will work with Cynthia to determine how much of an expansion from
current law this would represent). In my discussions with OMB, they have
indicated that they will not be commenting to Education on this section
(staff felt this would be a DPC call) .

Subj ect:           ESEA - - anti -smoking programs

This is to pass on to you, from Randy Moss, a concern re the forthcoming
ESEA reauthorization proposal that OLC expressed to Dept of Education, was
rebuffed, and wants the White House to be aware of for our consideration.
               The proposed bill, as I understand from Randy, would condition
substantial ESEA funding on the states 'adoption of school anti-smoking
programs. OLC has no problem with tying some ESEA funding to state
antismoking programs, but worries about proportionality -- i.e., whether
the sanction for not adopting the anti-smoking programs, in terms of loss
of all ESEA funding, is too -large given the small size of the antismoking
program.           They recommended to Dept of Ed that they put only a smaller
subset of ESEA funding at risk. The OLC recommendation was made, not
because they think the original proposal is indefensible, but to reduce
litigation risk. For in the Supreme Court's leading decision on this
issue, South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203, 211 (1987), the Court, while
upholding the legitimacy in general of using federal funds as ·an
inducement to states to do what the feds want, warned that "in some
circumstances the financial inducement offered by congress might be so
c.o.e.r:.c.;i.y.eJs_t9_p,a,S_!L_.\:JJ..e-.Jloint at which 'I2ressure turns into com ulsion. ' "
                                          P6/(b)(6)




                                     P6/(b)(6)


        Dept of Ed said no, and they and we may well feel that
anti-smoking stuff is important enough that we want a big
club/inducement.    Randy and OLe think we'd be safer if we tailored to
sanction more. They are not saying this is a "must" (and they are not
retaliating for Helms v. Picard !), but wanted to see what we think.
         I personally doubt that the risk is great enough here -- given the
popularity of school antismoking programs -- to justify pressing this
point, but you guys can decide!
