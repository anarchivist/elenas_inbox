TEXT:
The meeting was fine -- not great, not bad.  It focused on fairly
short-term things -- in particular, on whether the AMA policy can be
reversed at its convention on June 23.  We agreed to do a bit of thinking
about whether we (in truth, HHS) could contribute to that effort.   Chuck
and I are meeting with the AG on Tuesday; Donna offered to send over some
doctors this week (though we don't know who or when) to give a medical
briefing.  I think we all could use a briefing from the legislative
people, but I lean toward asking for this at one of the morning meetings,
rather than calling a separate meeting for the purpose.
