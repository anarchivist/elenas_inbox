If they're fine with this, we're fine with it (though if they would prefer
to be briefed today, we might still be able to do it). Chris is the
indispensable person, so you have to check his schedule. Thanks.

I have taken the liberty of taking a postponement from NGA. Mickey and I
are scheduled for 45 minutes Tues am at 10:30 to do an overall SOTU
briefing. Want to add one of you to ]Oln us and do tobacco at that time?
Gives us a little more time.  What do you think?
