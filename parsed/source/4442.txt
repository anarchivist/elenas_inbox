Subject: INS reform -- legislative strategy

Maria,
Elena held a meeting with Peter Jacoby, Michael Deich, Steve M., Ingrid
Schroeder and Chuck Kieffer this afternoon to decide our legislative
strategy re: INS reform.  We decided that Peter would ask Justice to write
a letter (from the AG) strongly opposing the Rogers legislation for two
reasons: (1) the appropriations process is not the right vehicle for doing
this; we have made good progress toward a bi-partisan bill and we should
pursue that; etc.; and (2) the bill has substantive problems; e.g., it
needs to include an equivalent office for immigration benefits and someone
to coordinate the two halves of immigration policy.  According to Peter,
the mark-up for the Rogers bill will likely be put off until next week,
but we still want DOJ to draft the letter as soon as they can. Also,
Peter is going to suggest to DOJ that Eric Holder make calls to some
Republican members on the House Judiciary committee, asking them to
support not reporting the Rogers bill out of committee.
