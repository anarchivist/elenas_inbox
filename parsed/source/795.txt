It appears that we are actually close to being able to release the A.G. 's
interim verification guidance for benefits eligibility.  So there will be
a meeting tomorrow, April 9th, at 3pm in rm 211 OEOB to dis.cuss plans for
the interagency rollout.    DOJ has requested that the various WH offices
bring to the meeting any lists of individuals and organizations that
should be invited to the briefings.

I hope that you can make it.           Thanks.
