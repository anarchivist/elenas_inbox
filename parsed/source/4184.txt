TEXT:
Audrey is very welcome to atend our welfare meetings. Just so everyone is
on the same page on this issue: We are extremely sympathetic to Sen
Murray's goals, and we agree with her on some broad principles.  But we
have never expressed public support for Sen. Murray's actual amendment;
neither have we ever told Sen Murray or her staff that we would support it
in the future.  To the contrary, we consistently have stated concerns with
her legislation and indicated that we prefer to proceed by our own (i.e.,
HHS'S) regulation (which is now under review by OMB). A few days ago, in
order to be as helpful as possible, we and OMB gave Sen Murray's staff
legislative language we could live with (based on the HHS reg, though
different in some details).  We have heard she did not like our proposal
and told the conference that she wished to push forward with her own
amendment. That leaves us about where we have always been.
