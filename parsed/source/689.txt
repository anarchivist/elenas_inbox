Many thanks. We'll get you and Bruce a draft when we get it done (most
likely tomorrow) .'

Also many thanks for your proposal itself!  I think, as did the group it
seems, that your proposal was an excellent step in the direction we need
to go with this thing.  It astutely identified the strengths of the
President and the weaknesses of the other proposals.  Moreover, it was
refreshing to move our discussion beyond the box shuffling debate of
commission vs. council.
