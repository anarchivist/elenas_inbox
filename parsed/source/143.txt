PRINTER FONT 12 POINT COURIER
QUESTION: Doesn't a ban on contributions from non
o
-citizens raise
constitutional difficulties?
RESPONSE:  It is unfortunately true that almost any meaningful
campaign finance reform proposal raises constitutional issues.
This is a result of the Supreme Court's view -- which I believe
to be mistaken in many cases -- that money is speech and that
attempts to limit the influence of money on our political system
therefore raise First Amendment problems.  I think that even on
this view, the Court could and should approve this measure
because of the compelling governmental interest in preventing
corruption. But I also think the Court should reexamine its
premise that the freedom of speech guaranteed by the First
Amendment entails a right to throw money at the political system.


QUESTION: How does the Supreme Court's decision in Colorado
Republican Campaign Committee v. FEC affect the Mccain
o
-Feingold
bill?
RESPONSE: The Court's recent decision in Colorado Republican
Campaign Committee v. FEC, which disapproved non
o
-voluntary limits
on uncoordinated e~penditures by political parties, has little or
nothing to do with the key elements of the McCain
o
-Feingold bill,
including voluntary campaign spending limits, restrictions on
PACs, and broadcast and postage discounts.  It is possible that
the decision will require amendment of certain less crucial
provisions of the bill, but even this is a complicated legal
question needing close scrutiny.
