       Irene:

       We need to speak w/Bruce about this, and I may want to speak w/Michael
       Deich, too. This shouldn't move forward until then.

Subject:         Detention Amendment Moving Out Very Soon

It appears that the INS detention amendment is likely to be transmitted to
the Hill in the next several days. Director Lew is about to forward the
amendment to the WHo  We have left messages with you or your staff. This
note is simply to confirm that you have no problem with the amendment,
including timing.
