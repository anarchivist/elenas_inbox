                                           Pay Equity Initiative

      On April 2, 1998, the President issued a proclamation designating National Equal Pay Day in
      which he urged all employers to review their wage practices and to ensure that all their
      employees, including women, are paid equitably for their work. The typical woman who works
      full-time earns just 74 cents for each dollar that the typical man earns. This gap is in part
      attributable to differing levels of experience, education, and skill. However, even after accounting
      for these factors a significant pay gap still remains between men and women in similar jobs.

     To address this problem, the President's FY 2000 budget proposes a $14 million pay equity
     initiative to focus additional resources on providing employers with the necessary tools to assess
     and improve their pay policies, and educating the public (including employers, employees, unions,
     and advocacy groups) on the importance of this issue as well as their rights and responsibilities.
     Specifically the budget requests:

      ·     $10 million (4 FTE) for the Equal Employment Opporfunity Commission's (EEOC) wage
            discrimination initiative which will:

            -- provide necessary training of enforcement staff in identifying wage discrimination cases;

            -- increase outreach, education, and technical assistance including funding public service
            announcements to educate the public on the importance of this issue as well as their rights
            and responsibilities, and developing training programs for employers, employees, unions
            and advocacy groups on pay issues; and,

            -- fund research on how pay disparities arise and where they are most prevalent in order to
            better target resources in the future.

      ·     $4 million (20 FTE) for the Labor Department's Office of Federal Contract Compliance
            Programs' (OFCCP) pay equity initiative, which is part of its overall initiative to increase
            compliance through enhanced compliance assistance. The pay equity initiative will:

            -- continue monitoring of pay equity to reduce occupational segregation and to assure that
            appropriate criteria are used for setting salaries for women, minorities, and persons with
            disa bilities;

            -- provide enhanced technical assistance through technology, specifically by developing and
            providing guidelines via the Internet that address pay issues, including industry best
            practices;

            -- increase outreach and education efforts, such as research and public education grants on
            corporate management reviews (glass ceiling reviews), as well as technical and educational
            brochures that will keep the public informed about the various OFCCP requirements; and,

            -- provide a focused effort on women in non-traditional jobs which will challenge
            discrimination by identifying best practices and assisting contractors in identifying
            resources for recruiting and developing qualified individuals in non-traditional occupations
            thereby improving women's access to and experiences in non-traditional occupations.
                                                                             Automated Records Management System
                                                                             Hex-Dump Conversion
