           Sorry to belabor this, but you may hear from Chater, Apfel, and
           others that we need to nail down now the day for the SSI children
           announcement.  Ken really wants this discussed at the 7:30 (not
           sure why Raines can't raise it).

           SSA thinks next Wednesday is rotten because it is so close to
           Chater's departure, but they will accept it.  They would prefer
           Monday or Tuesday (day of President's press conference, as you
           obviously know) .
