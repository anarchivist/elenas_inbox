Subject: Q&A on Press Reports of H-1B policy Discussion



You mentioned that you had done a Q&A on how to respond to press
inquiries regarding the NY Times (and today's Wall St. Journal)
article on the H-1B policy deliberations.  I assume that we should be
saying much of the same thing to Congressional inquiries.  Could you
send me a copy of your Q&A so that I could put it in Ray Uhalde's
briefing book?

I will send to you and others several other Q&A's that we are
preparing for Ray later this af"ternoon for your review and input.

Thanks

Subject: voice mail for job seekers

Bruce/Elena:

FYI. I have had a preliminary discussion with Tom Kalil about looking
into the idea of providing voice mail services to those seeking work
(either welfare recipients or a larger group of poor job-seekers without
phones). On Wed. and Thurs. of this week, there is a conference (unsure
who is the sponsor) on telecommunications access for the poor.   According
to Tom, the VP will attend part of it.  Once that is over, I will try to
follow up with them on ideas/strategies for this.   Also, there is a group
in Seattle that is working on a project to provide voice mail to the
homeless who may be helpful in thinking about this.

Julie
