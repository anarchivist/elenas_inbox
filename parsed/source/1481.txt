  TEXT:
  where are we on these? I know i missed a meeting last week.   Diana, you
  asked me after that meeting about grandfathering waivers and said you'd
. send me some materials to jog my memory.  Do I have those somewhere? And
  are there any other issues? And does Sally Katzen now have this reg, or
  are we doing a kind of pre-OMB review first?
