TEXT:
He really did. Although we focused on the PG rating, he did call for the
industry to reevaluate its whole ratings system.  I think it would seem a
bit weird to come out now with another specific suggestion for changing
the system -- even though it makes perfect sense.

Didn't the President's challenge on Saturday address the ratings issue?
