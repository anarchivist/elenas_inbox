Subject: HHS Tobacco and Food Safety Budgets

Here is an update on HHS's tobacco and food safety budgets.  I am
concerned that these programs are in trouble and in need of your help to
receive adequate funding in the President's FY99 budget.

Tobacco

For FY99, OMB is recommending a $30 million increase ($21M for CDC for
state programs and $9M for FDA). HHS is currently requesting on appeal to
OMB an increase of $120M over the FY98 level ($74M for CDC and $46M for
FDA). FDA's increase will enable it to contract with all states to
effectively enforce its tobacco rule. As you know, effective enforcement
is essential to making access restrictions work.   CDC will put $49M toward
state programs, $20M toward counter advertising, and $5M toward
surveillance and research.   At this funding level, CDC will provide each
state wit~ $1 million on average, which is less than the $1.2 million
average the 16 ASSIST states currently receive.   Studies indicate states
need about $10 million each to replicate the reductions in youth smoking
that California and Massachusetts have achieved.   I believe HHS initially
requested an increase of $136 million over FY98 for tobacco.   For FY98,
FDA received $34 million for tobacco, which is an increase of $29.1
million over FY97.   CDC received $28.4 million, which is an increase of $7
million over FY97, however the President had requested a $15 million
increase. NIH received $25 million f?r the ASSIST program the same as in
FY97 (beginning in FY99 ASSIST will move to CDC -- the CDC budget request
reflects the move) .

Food Safety

For FY99, OMB is recommending a $30 million increase for HHS ($5M for CDC
and $25M for FDA). HHS is currently seeking $44 million on appeal ($5M
for CDC and $39M for FDA ($22M for imports and $17M for domestic)).  I am
trying to determine whether the HHS appeal is on top of the OMB $30
million or instead of it.    HHS initially requested a $109 million
increase ($21M for CDC and $88M for FDA ($27M for imports and $61M for
domestic) ). At OMB' s currently recommended level of funding' the
Administration will not be able to achieve many of goals we have already
promised in the President's Food Safety Initiative.  $5 million would not
enable CDC to put in place the early warning system the President promised
last January, and $25 million for FDA, depending on how it is divided
between imports and domestic, either is just short of what FDA needs to
implement the produce initiative the President announced in October with
no new money for the programs the VP announced in May, or well short of
what is needed for imports and also well short of what is needed
domestically.
