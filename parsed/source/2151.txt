Please explain that they do not want us to re-write their memo (and they
don't have to put Bruce's name on it if we don't like the way it's
written.)  They have turned it in, but if she has some important edits we
can just resubmit the memo, no problem.  If there are lots of edits we
should just take Bruce's name off (I think.)

               NATIONAL TEACHER OF THE YEAR A WARD CEREMONY

                            DATE:                  April 24, 1998
                            LOCATION:              Rose Garden
                            TIME:                  3:00 pm

1.    PURPOSE

      To honor the 1998 National Teacher of the Year, Philip Bigler and the State Teachers of
      the Year from around the country; and to use this opportunity to highlight some of your
      education initiatives.

II.   BACKGROUND

      This event provides you with an opportunity to honor the national and state teachers of
      the year, to underscore your commitment to a broad agenda to improve public education,
      and renew your veto threat over the Senate measure passed Thursday. You can use the
      Senate action this week, and House action earlier this month, to make a clear delineation
      between your vision and Congress' vision for education.

      This week, the Senate voted down efforts to modernize more than 5,000 public schools
      and reject a Sense of the Senate resolution supporting efforts to reduce class size to a
      national average of 18 in the early grades by hiring 100,000 additional teachers. Instead,
      the Senate measure would block national tests, eliminate the "safe and drug free schools"
      program and other education programs by turning them into a block grant, and provide
      an average of $7 in tax savings to families with children in public schools. You also can
      comment on the House bill to eliminate funding for the National Board for Professional
      Teaching Standards and block your efforts to help 100,000 master teachers seek board-
      certification by the year 2006.

      This is an important education event for the White House. Three years ago, for the first
      time, we invited State Teachers of the Year from each state. Their participation created
      extensive local press coverage which helped to send a strong message throughout the
      country about your commitment to education. Each year, after attending the White
      House ceremony and learning more about the Administration's education agenda, these
                                                               Automated Records Management System
                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion
       communities
       Now in its 47th year, the National Teacher of the Year Program seeks to recognize and
       honor the contributions of the American classroom teacher. Sponsored by the Council of
       Chief State School Officers in partnership with Scholastic, Inc., this program is the oldest
       and most prestigious awards program to focus public attention on excellence in teaching.


       Each year, every state selects a Teacher of the Year who then enters the national
       competition. An independent selection committee, representing fourteen major education
       organizations, selects finalists and then the National Teacher of the Year. This year's
       other finalists were from New Mexico, Iowa, and Kansas. This is also the 47th year that
       the President has introduced the National Teacher of the Year to the nation.

       This year's National Teacher of the Year is Philip Bigler. Philip entered the teaching
       profession in 1975 as a history teacher at his Alma Mater, Oakton High School in Fairfax
       County, Virginia. In 1982, disillusioned with his career, he left the classroom to become
       historian at Arlington National Cemetery. He returned to the classroom in 1985 and
       since 1991 he has taught Humanities at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and
       Technology in Alexandria, Virginia. His innovative and rigorous activities led to his
       choice as this years National Teacher of the Year. In his classroom, interactive historical
       simulations are the basis of his courses. In World History, his students become members
       of a Greek polis and the debate the great issues of the day. While studying Islamic history
       and culture they make a sacred pilgrimage to Mecca. In American History and
       Government, students argue the intricacies of Constitutional law before a mock Supreme
       Court, conduct the court-martial trial of Lt. William Calley and wage a computer
       campaign for the 1960 presidency. He takes pride in that his students learn that human
       civilization rests upon the foundations of the past. He will be accompanied by his parents
       and brother and sister-in-law.

       Fifty-four State Teachers of the Year including DOD schools, Guam, Puerto Rico and the
       District of Columbia will be represented at today's ceremony.
