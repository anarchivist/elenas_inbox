Any progress?   Elena -- my understanding is that Sally asked for an FDA
briefing on the issue.  Is that /did that happen(ing)? Do you need me to
staff? Chris tells me Sally is on board (yeh!).   Feeling the need for me
or Jen to get back to Ped. AIDS Foundation on this given that they are
holding back at our request -- let me know how I can be helpful.
