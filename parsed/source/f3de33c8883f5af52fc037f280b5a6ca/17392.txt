                                                                        aex.Dump Conversion
    Possible Non-Budgetary Policies re: Fathers

    In the context of the race initiative, policies to promote the role of fathers in the lives of their
    children could be proposed either 1) as an appeal to the values of family that is shared across
    racial and ethnic lines in our nation; or 2) as a recognition that African American and Hispanic
    children are more likely to live without their fathers.

    1)     "Appeal to Parenting" Public Service Campaign: President and/or First Lady could
           appear in a public service campaign urging parents to be emotionally and financially
           responsible for their children. The Families, inc. film and television production
           company in New York has written to the First Lady to ask for her and the President's
           participation. The producers are reaching out to as many high profile parents, including:
           The President and the First Lady; The Vice President and Mrs. Gore; Mayor Guiliani and
           his wife; Michael Jordan and his wife; Patrick Ewing and his wife; Sylvester Stallone and
           his wife; Denzel Washington and his wife. (The proposal has not yet been vetted.)

    2)     "Don't Drop the Ball" Public Service Campaign: Work with the National Football
           League to expand nation-wide a public service announcement campaign conducted in
           Florida featuring pro-football players with their children with the slogan "Don't Drop the
           Ball: Support Your Children." (The Florida campaign was organized by the child
           support enforcement unit ofthe Florida State Department of Revenue. There have not
           yet been any discussions with the National Football League.)

    3)     Involve Fathers in Children's Education: Call upon schools to send report cards to
           noncustodial as well as custodial parents, to follow upon the report recently released by
           the Vice President and Secretary Riley that shows that children whose fathers are
           involved in their education do better in school. (This was one ofthe recommendations
           of the May 1996 conference on fathers chaired by the Vice President. We need to check
           to ensure that we have not already recommended this.)

    4)     Congressional Task Force for the Promotion of Fatherhood: The President could do a
           roundtable or other event with the bipartisan Congressional Task Force for the Promotion
           of Fatherhood, formed this June and chaired by Rep. Mike McIntyre (D-NC) arid Rep.
           Joseph Pitts (R-PA). Both Speaker Gingrich and Minority Leader Gephardt are
           members. The mission of the task force is "to confront the growing problem of father
           absence, and ... seek to increase the number of children growing up with committed
           fathers." The task force will promote fatherhood by arranging public awareness
           campaigns, educating Members about the problems of fatherless homes in America,
           organizing conferences and forums, and by encouraging television stations, local leaders,
           and community groups to promote fatherhood.
