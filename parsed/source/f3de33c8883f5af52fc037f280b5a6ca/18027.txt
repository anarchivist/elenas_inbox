     Brown University. On November 24, Angela Oh was the closing speaker for the
     Asian Pacific American Heritage celebration at Brown University. She spoke to
     50 students, faculty, and administrators about the Initiative and the role of
     Asian Pacific Americans in the Initiative. She urged the students to become
     actively engaged in the Initiative.

    Town Hall Meeting. On December 3, you hosted your first Town Hall Meeting in
    Akron. Over 5,000 people attended and it aired live on C-Span. In attendance from
    your Advisory board were Chairman Dr. John Hope Franklin, Angela Oh, Rev. Suzan
    Johnson Cook, Governor William Winter and Linda Chavez Thompson.

    K-12 School Visits. Visits by each Advisory Board Member to schools in their
    respective cities are being arranged for the next three weeks. The purpose of these
    visits is to provide each Advisory Board member with a real experience of race in
    schools today.

OFFICE OF THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR

    Asian American Academics. On November 22, I met with the Director of the
    UCLA Asian American Studies Center to discuss the Initiative and how best to create
    partnerships to access the expertise of Asian American academics.

    NAACP Roundtable. I briefed a group of 25 NAACP leaders from across the
    country who were convened for the purpose of discussing the future of the
    organization. I recounted the Presidential Town Hall meeting and participated in
    dialogue aimed at making the NAACP a more racially inclusive organization.

    OUTREACH
                                                                  Hex-Dump Conve:sion

CEO Roundtable. Secretary Slater moderated a meeting of more than 80 corporate
CEOs in Miami. Advisory Board Member Bob Thomas and Deputy Director Mike
Wenger organized this event. Republic Industries and its CEO Wayne Huizenga
hosted the Roundtable. The next Roundtable will be held in January.

RESEARCH AND POLICY PLANNING

Policy. We are continuing to plan and organize the December 17 Advisory
Board meeting which will focus on issues of race in public primary/secondary
education. We are in the process of drafting a proposed agenda, which will
include dialogue with the Board about both the challenges facing
primary/secondary education in America as they intersect with race (e.g., urban
segregation, insufficient resources in terms of teaching and facilities) and about
promising practices in dealing with those challenges. Attached is a proposed
agenda for this meeting.

In preparation for the January Advisory Board meeting on employment issues, we met
DOL and DPC representatives to identify topics for discussion. We will follow up
the planning task with a larger group meeting with senior DOL and EEOC officials
next week.

Research. The Policy staff reviewed the Council of Economic Advisors (CEA)
chapter on Race as part of the President's Economic Report.

Promising Practices. On December 3, the working group highlighted another 26
examples of promising practices on the PIR web page, which bring the current total to
40. Ten organizations which have been highlighted as promising practice from
across the country also participated during the Dec. 3 town hall meeting. The group
plans to highlight another ten examples of promising practices by Christmas.

Data. Staff met with the PIR data working group members and briefed them
on CEA's new role in data analysis and coordination of the fact book.

Fairfax. Staff reviewed and provided commentary on a draft of the Fairfax
case study authored by Policy Studies Associates (a contractor). It is scheduled
to be unveiled right before the Dec. 17 Advisory Board meeting as a related
event.

COMMUNICATION

PSA. On Tuesday, December 2, 1997, we unveiled a public service announcement
(PSA) that was developed by the Ad Council in consultation with the Leadership
Conference on Civil Rights and the White House staff. The PSA targets Young
America. The PSA features young people who talk about the values they have in
                                                                        hex-DiJiT:p Cunv;',slon
    common while asking viewers what they would do to help build One America, The
    PSA also has a web-site listing.

    Watch Parties. Approximately 100 Town Hall Watch Parties were held across the
    country. Over 20,000 Americans viewed the town hall meeting through these watch
    parties. There will be a minimum of 54 town meeting sites in sixteen states. We've
    asked people to hold their own discussions after listening to the Town Hall Meeting
    and then fill out a report to the President letting him know their thoughts about the
    issue of race.

    Bi-Weekly Report, On November 25, The One America on the Move bi-weekly report
    went out.

    One America Conversations. On November 24, Maria Soto and Tamara Monosoff
    conducted a One America Conversations at Mount Saint Mary's College in
    Emmitsburg, MD.

    Blastfax_ On November 22, the second America On the Move document, which
    updates our Initiative accomplishments was faxed to community leaders across the
    nation.

WORK TEAMS

    YOUTH

    On Friday, November 28, 1997, a letter from the President was mailed to 25,000
    young leaders asking them to join the President in his efforts to examine the current
    state of race relations in America. This letter provides a call to action to young
    America and was targeted to high school senior class presidents, University and
    College class presidents, and leaders of national and local community organizations.

    On Monday, December 1, 1997, Vice President Gore will host a briefing with youth
    and youth-oriented media (i.e. MTV, Rolling Stone, Vibe, Essence) where he
    discussed the importance of having young America involved in this initiative. In
    addition, we featured a local high school football captain who has organized other
    high school captains to become involved in the Initiative.
