TEXT:
As we work through this tough issue, how do we respond to concrete
problems currently encountered out in the field?  For example, LA Unified
is trying to implement a social promotion policy including summer schools,
except that LA has year around schooling in order to ease overcrowding so
there's no space for summer school; there's also an acute shortage of
qualified teachers for regular schooling let alone remedial, support
programs. Lastly, they estimate that it would cost $18-20 million more to
try to provide these additional programs (assuming they could find the
teachers).  How would LA be treated under our new proposal? Thanks (by
the way I'm seeing Wade and Charles this evening, so I'll let you know
what I learn.)
