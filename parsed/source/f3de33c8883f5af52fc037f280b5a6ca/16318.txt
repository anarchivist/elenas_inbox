TEXT:
Here's what the Welfare to Work Partnership is planning for the mid-August
St. Louis event, which some of us will discuss with them at today's 4:00
meeting w/Ann Lewis et. al.

The St. Louis event which will be part of a "Welfare to Work Week" of
probably three events
(we would be involved only in the St. Louis event):

        The St. Louis event, which will launch their local welfare to work
campaign which will
                 in time include 6 to 12 cities;
        A press club event in D.C. with small business, releasing data
from Coopers and
                 Lybrand survey showing many small businesses want to hire
welfare recipients,


                but see challenges in doing so, and underscoring the
partnership's commitment
                to providing them with technical assistance to be
successful;
        A media event in Milwaukee with the mayor and Governor Thompson on
August 22nd
                celebrating the success of welfare reform in that city.

In St. Louis, the partnership wants to:

        1) Release its print and radio public service announcements with a
"This is good for business, and good for the country" theme, and providing
a toll free number (1-888-USA-JOBS) number for companies to call who want
to learn more about hiring welfare recipients.

        2) Release its Blueprint for Business, a 50 page guide for companies who
want to hire and retain welfare recipients

        3) Unveil their web page (www.welfaretowork.org), which will
contain a copy of the Blueprint, forms for companies to sign up as Welfare
to Work "partner" (what they call companies that have made the
commitment), and other information.   (Eventually, companies will be able
to accept the database of services through the web site, but they don't
expect to have that ready by mid-August) .

        4) Announce 300 plus corporate commitments in St. Louis and
release the packet of information they've prepared for these companies,
outlining service providers, state assistance, and local success stories.
They are working to secure a commitment from the Ford Foundation, Strive,
and others to provide funds for services in the 6-12 cities; if they're
ready, they'll announce that too.

They plan the day itself to look like:

        8:00 - 11:00 am: Session for local business and service providers,
with breakout sessions, addresses by the mayor and Eli Segal to be held at
the downtown Marriott.

         Early afternoon: Event at Keiner Plaza, and open air amphitheatre
in downtown
St. Louis.    Like on May 20th, they're planning a very long program:  the
CEO of Monsanto; a local success story; the mayor; Eli Segal; the
Governor; the President.    They have a plan for a high tech visual which
will project behind the speakers the signatures of the St. Louis companies
pledging their commitment during the event ( the CEOs would be signing
during the event, and as they signed, the signatures would appear on
stage) .
