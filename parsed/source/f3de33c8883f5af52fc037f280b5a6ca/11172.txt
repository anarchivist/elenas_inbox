Subject:    Tobacco Recoupment
Author: Bill Corr
Date:       2/11/99 2:42 PM

As many of you know, as a consequence of the settlement between the states
and
the tobacco companies this November, the issue of Medicaid recoupment is
now
before Congress.   Unfortunately, due to the impeachment proceedings, we
have
not been able to give this issue the attention we would have liked prior
to this
time. We appreciate that your Governors may be looking for direction and
feedback on this issue from you.

Accordingly, in the interest of preparing for this debate when we return
from
recess, we wanted to give you our perspective on the key issues, and get
your
input.

One approach, spearheaded by Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, is to allow the
states


to keep the entire   settlement, including the federal share that is due the
federal government   under current law.   This approach has had appeal to
some
Democratic offices   because their states have already indicated their
intention
to use some of the   money for tobacco control.

Another approach is to allow the states to keep the federal share of the
settlement, but with limited and appropriate restrictions on the
expenditure of
the federal share, and to use the recoupment issue to push for a broader
youth
smoking bill.   Senator Daschle, Congressman Gephardt and the
Administration
have expressed their commitment to youth smoking legislation, including
FDA's
jurisdiction of tobacco products, and measures to help tobacco farmers.

One of our priorities when we return from recess is to consider the
recoupment
issue with the help of the tobacco task force.  We would like your
feedback on
what you have been hearing from your states and whether there are
conditions on
the federal share your Senator believes are appropriate.

The Administration would like to meet with Senators and staff with respect
to
this issue. We will be contacting you shortly about meeting information,
and to
hear your ideas.   Please contact Andrea LaRue, on our staff, at 4-2321
should
you have questions in the mean time or if you need information on your
state's
tobacco plans.

In sum, this is an extremely important issue, and we hope to have your
help.
