TEXT:
I went to the Patinkin show last night and went backstage to meet him and
see if he had interest in participating in an event here that would
promote donations. He said absolutely--he's wonderful, and very
knowledgeable about the issue. He said when he had his first eye surgery
that the organ donor activists reported a large increase in donations.
This is definitely an area where leadership on the issue can make a huge
difference. He also mentioned that the VP had talked about this at one
time, so if POTUS doesn't work, I guess we could look at that.   I have
his contact numbers. He also knows some wonderful "real people" stories.
