   Subject: Re: Civil Rights Coordinating Council Subgroups Reports

   I appreciate the reminder that the Civil Rights Coordinating Council
   (CRCC) subgroups is focused on enforcement activities and not on policy
   issues and will make the appropriate changes to the reports.   I just
   received copies of the reports from other subgroups written by Counsel's
   office staff and these reports do raise some policy issues.   Based on
   these reports, I think there is some confusion by the subgroup leaders
   what they should be doing since they include policy issues.    I will make
   copies for you, Elena and other DPC staff (Paul, Tom, Tanya, and Jon) .

   Speaking as a DPC staffer (not as the lead of these subgroups), I think
   that there are some policy issues that we should explore in the areas of
   worker exploitation and language rights. As a DPC staff person, I would
   like to begin a process to explore policies in these areas.   I may work
   with the some subgroup members but I will be very clear that I am
   exploring these policy issues as a DPC staff and not the lead of the CRCC
   subgroup.

   Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.    Thanks.

       Those reports seem fine, but these subgroups are supposed to focus on
       enforcement activities, not developing legislative proposals or
       communications strategies.   We need to protect the policy councils'
       prerogative to develop policy, and remind everybody involved that the
       Coordinating Council is not a policy council.
