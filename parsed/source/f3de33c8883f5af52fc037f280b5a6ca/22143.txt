         deepen our understanding of our Nation's history in order to represent the
         contributions and experiences of all.  The Commission will submit their
         recommendations in a report to the President in March of this year.

         The Commission is reaching out to individuals across the country for ideas
         and suggestions on how best to celebrate the role of women in American
         history.   In that spirit, we cordially invite you to the LAST Commission
