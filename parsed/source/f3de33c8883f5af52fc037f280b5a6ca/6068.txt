TEXT:
Elena,

Last week in the Silicon Valley, in response to a question regarding Sen.
Abraham's proposed legislation that would raise the number of H1B visas
(temporary visas for "specialty workers" -- generally higher skilled),
Commerce Secretary Daley made a comment that the Administration would
oppose raising the annual number of these visas.  Historically, we have
not used the full number of H1B visas, but the cap (now at 65,000)  was
reached for the first time in FY 1997.

CNN has called John Frazier at Labor to ask whether someone from there
would appear (unclear on what program) tomorrow to comment on this.
Frazier is going to inform them that Labor has not seen the legislation,
and cannot comment. We also put in a call to INS public affairs to alert
them to this.

Julie
