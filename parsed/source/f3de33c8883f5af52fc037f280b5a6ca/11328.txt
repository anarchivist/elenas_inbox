Lately, the NEC and DPC weekly reports have included substantial overlap.
I was hoping there might be a way to coordinate the reports a bit more
before they come down to me.

I understand that many of the issues are handled jointly, so I'm not
trying to force ownership to one council over another, but I don't think
the President needs to read the same thing twice.

For example, in last week's report, the paragraphs on Medicare and the
Kennedy-Jeffords disability bill were nearly identical. There were a
couple of things the previous week as well.

I understand that there are some sensitivities here, but I'm just trying
to save the President some time.  Thoughts?
