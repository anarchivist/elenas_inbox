TEXT:
The problematic rule and these two bills are now expected to come up on
the House floor tomorrow (Thursday); Andy Blocker has confirmed that
Democratic leadership will be opposing the rule; the question is whether
any moderate Republicans who support charter schools and don't want to
mess up the Riggs-Roemer bill will vote against it as well.  Jon Schnur is
letting John Doerr's folks know about this, because they have a strong
interest in charter schools, and is also getting the word out to some in
the charter schools community, who probably wouldn't want to see the bill
fouled up.

Subject:         House Vouchers/Charters

fyi -- As we had heard was a possibility, for House floor consideration,
Goodling has requested a '!self-executing" rule, under which the voucher
bill (HELP) would come up first, then the charter schools bill, and then
once both bills have passed the voucher bill would automatically be added
to the charter bill before it goes over to the Senate.
