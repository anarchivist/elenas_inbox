TEXT:
Education released the third-year charter schools report.

Following our staff meeting last week, we had a conference call with
Education and Jen Palmieri to discuss releasing the charter schools report
in a highly visible manner.  We reached agreement with the Department that
they would find a date when Riley could do an event and the President
would release a corresponding statement   (most likely the week of the
10th). Yesterday the Department notified us that they planned ·to release
the report Friday (today). Jon asked them to hold off, and they agreed to
page one of us if they were going to go ahead and release the report, so
that we could determine if it was still necessary to hold it for a Riley
event. This afternoon Education called again to say that they had
released the report to Ed Weekly -- along with a press release including
an uncleared quote from the President (which looks ok enough) -- and have
done a few interviews with the trade press on the phone, but there hasn't
been much interest.

Given that this is already out, we don't think there is much to be done.
Nonetheless, Jon Tanya and I are all dismayed that the Department violated
both the agreement reached last week and various assurances they gave us,
including yesterday evening.

While, this is obviously not the way we had planned or agreed to do this,
we could have the Department take action such as sending out state or
regional press releases.  Please let us know if you would like us to
pursue an approach like this, or anything else.  Thanks!
