                                          Roundtable Topic:
                               The Value of Diversity in Higher Education

               Colleges and universities that promote diversity can greatly contribute to
       improving race relations in the 21st Century and to creating a stronger, more just, and
       more united American community. Minority participation in higher education has
       increased dramatically in the last several decades, though disparities still remain.
       Studies indicate that this increased racial diversity can yield substantial educational
       benefits for all students. By bringing together students of different backgrounds,
       colleges and universities are teaching students critical lessons about how to live and
       work together, and they are exposing students to new perspectives that enrich the
       learning environment. Increased minority participation in higher education can
       also help overcome racial disparities in society by providing quality education to

      traditionally underserved groups. There are many colleges and universities across
      America that have developed and are continuing to develop policies and programs
      that can foster these benefits of diversity. At its November t9 meeting, the
      Advisory Board will discuss the value of diversity in higher education and will
      identify existing programs, policies, and partnerships that are promoting the value
      of diversity on campuses across America.
