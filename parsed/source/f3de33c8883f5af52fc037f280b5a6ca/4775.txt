 Elena and Bruce --

 Here is a decoded copy of the draft letter in case the version George sent
 came over encoded, which it did on my computer.

 The Honorable Tom Harkin
 united States Senate
 Washington, D.C. 20510

 De~r   Senator Harkin:

         Thank you for your letter of September 18, 1997, requesting an
 answer to the question of whether the federal government will be bringing
 a lawsuit against the tobacco companies for health care costs caused by
 tobacco related diseases. As explained in my previous letter, the
 Department of Justice along with the involved agencies have considered
 such suits and, to date, have not elected to attempt to recover these
 costs through direct litigation.

         This Administration believes that our efforts should be directed
 at reducing teen smoking through comprehensive tobacco legislation. As
 the President said, "Reducing teen smoking has always been America's
 bottom line." That is why the President on September 17th called for
 comprehensive tobacco legislation with the goal of reducing teen smoking
 by 50 percent within seven years.
         The President announced five key elements that must be the heart
 of any national tobacco legislation:

         1.      A comprehensive plan to reduce teen smoking, including
 tough penalties if targets are not met;

            2.        Full authority for the FDA to regulate tobacco products;


        3.      Changes in the way the tobacco industry does business;

        4.      Progress toward other public health goals; and

        5.      Protection for tobacco farmers and their communities.

        Reducing teen smoking is most important because it will save the
lives and health of our children. Financially, reducing teen smoking
would be the most significant step that the Administration and Congress
could take to save future health care costs.

        Crafting the comprehensive tobacco legislation that will
successfully reduce teenage tobacco use, is an enormous challenge.
Forging such legislation will necessarily balance the competing interests
of many different goals and policies. We believe the consideration of the
costs incurred by federal programs in treating tobacco related diseases
should be addressed through the comprehensive tobacco legislation.

        Until that process is concluded, however, it would be inadvisable
for the Department to explain why it has not attempted to recover such
costs through direct litigation because events and facts may develop which
would call for a different course in the future.  Pronouncements at this
time could impede the Department's ability to change course at that time.

                                               Sincerely,



                                               Janet Reno
