     Question:         Are you concerned that states won't meet the welfare law s WorK JOn
                       participation rates, particularly the ones for two parent families?
                       Aren't states supposed to report data by October lst?

     Answer:          States must report data on work participation by November 14th for the fiscal year
                      1997, which ends September 30th. Thus, we will not know for several months
                      which states met the work participation rates (which in 1997 were 75% for two
                      parent families and 25% for all welfare families). Not all states will report data
                      on November 14th, because of different TANF plan start dates, and those that do
                      will report only three months or less (see chart below).

                       We believe the welfare law's work ~ates are tough but fair. The law gives states
                       new flexibility to spend funds on innovative programs to promote work but holds
                       states accountable for results.

     Background: State Data Reporting Requirements

     States must report welfare program data every quarter. The quarter ending September 30th is the first one for which
     some states will report work participation data (see chart below). States have until November 14th (45 days after
     the end of the quarter) to report the data. The 34 states that began T ANF before January 1, 1997 will report three
     months of data (7/1/97-9/30/97); the 6 states plus D.C. that began T ANF between January and March will report less
     than three months of data; the 10 states that began T ANF in April or later won't report any data this quarter. (These
     differences are due the provision which subjects states to reporting requirements after six months of program
     operation.)
