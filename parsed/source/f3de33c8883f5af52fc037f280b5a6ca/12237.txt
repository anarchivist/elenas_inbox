Teens light up name brands Heavy advertisers get most smokers

By Wendy Koch

   WASHINGTON -- Most teen-age smokers continue to choose cigarette
brands that are heavily advertised, despite repeated tobacco industry
denials that it markets to kids, says a government study that
Vice President Gore will release today.

   The study finds that 88% of 12th-graders who smoke, 86% of lOth-grade
smokers and 82% of eighth-grade smokers choose Marlboro, Newport
or Camel -- brands that are among the most advertised.

   Marlboro ranks first overall, picked by three of every five teen
smokers, including girls. Newport is the top brand among African-American
teens. The menthol cigarette appears to be heavily marketed in
the black community.

   The 1998 findings closely resemble those of the last similar study,
done in 1993 by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

   But in the intervening five years, the industry has faced mounting
pressure not to target kids. Under a settlement reached last year
with 46 states, the industry can be taken to court if it does.
It's now banned from using cartoon characters in its ads, and
must take down the last of its billboards by April 23.



   Anti-smoking forces say the industry is still going after kids.
"Our children are targets of a massive media campaign to hook
them on cigarettes," Gore says. Today, he'll talk to teens in
Akron, Ohio, at one of 1,200 anti-smoking events nationwide marking
the fourth annual "Kick Butts Day." Health and education groups
are sponsoring the events, organized by the Campaign for Tobacco-Free
Kids.

   "The new study puts a tremendous onus on Philip Morris," the
nation's largest tobacco company and .maker of Marlboros, says
Bill Novelli, the campaign's president.

   The company recently began a $ 100 million campaign of anti-smoking
TV ads nationwide geared towards kids. Critics question, though,
whether the industry is trying to woo public opinion and avoid
pending anti-smoking efforts.

   Scott Williams, an industry spokesman, says tobacco companies
don't target kids. He says that just because teens use advertised
cigarettes does not mean they are targeted. "They will probably
buy the market leader of any consumer product," he says.

   Last year, after the Sena~e killed a broad anti-smoking bill,
President Clinton ordered annual government-funded studies of
teen smoking.

   The new study was conducted by the University of Michigan's Institute
for Social Research, which does annual surveys on teen use of
illicit drugs, alcohol and cigarettes. More than 7,000 teens who
smoked at least one cigarette the previous month participated.
The surveys show teen smoking rates dipped slightly in 1998.
