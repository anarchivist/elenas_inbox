     TEXT:
     We will be meeting with representatives of the Human Rights Campaign and
     staff from the offices of Congressmen Gephardt, Frank and Hoyer to discuss
     strategy around efforts to repeal the President's non-discrimination
     executive order on Thursday, July 9th at 3pm, in the Ward Room.  Either
     please plan to attend or send an appropriate representative.  Thanks.
