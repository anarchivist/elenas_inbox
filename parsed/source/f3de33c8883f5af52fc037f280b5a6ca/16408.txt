TEXT:
The Administration's 150 political Regional Administrators will be in 450
OEOB on Wednesday, July 30th from 9 to 5 for their annual WH brfg. The
POTUS and FLOTUS will be addressing the group during the day.   This would
alsobe a great opportunity to meet the administrators and brief them on
the DPC's initiatives for the upcoming year.  We would like to invite you
to address the group from 10-50 to 11.10 am on July 30th.

This group has been phenomenal in amplifying our message throughout the
country.  You may remember that this was the group that helped us set up
100 satellite sites for the 0-3 conference. They stand ready to help us
on other initiatives.

Hope you can make it.
