                                   Food Safety Vote in the Senate

On Thursday afternoon, Senator Harkin offered an amendment to restore $68
million for funding of your food safety intitiave.   The amendment received
strong bi-partisan support and passed 66-33.   We worked closely with the
Senate and consumer groups in promoting the amendment, and the Los Angeles
Times published a strong editorial in support of your program. Rahm
worked with the press office to put out a statement emphasizing this as a
victory for good government over partisanship, and we will continue to w
ork with the news media to stress the importance of this issue in
conference.   Senator HarkinD,s amendment required USDAD,s tobacco program
administrative costs to be fully-funded by the tobacco industry, and used
the savings to offset the cost of expanded food safety programs for both
USDA and FDA.
