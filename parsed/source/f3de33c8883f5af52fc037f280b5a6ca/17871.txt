TEXT:
I will be reachable through Signal (I will have a sky pager) and will be
staying Friday night at the Wyndham Milwaukee Center Hotel
 (414/276-8686). I'm visiting with the local Wisconsin Works program,
touring the local YMCA,  and speaking to the national symposium of urban
Ys on Friday night.  Oh joy (why did I agree to this?)
