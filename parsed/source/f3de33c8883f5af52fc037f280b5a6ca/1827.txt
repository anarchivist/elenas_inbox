                                     INTERNAL


Q    What is the role of the federal government?

A.   This coalition came together in response to the First Lady's call in January and the
     President's America Reads Challenge. The First Lady held a meeting of nearly 20
     groups and spoke repeatedly about the need for such an effort.

Q.   Is this a part of America Reads?

A.   Yes, we see it as part of America Reads. All efforts responding to the President's call to
     help ensure that third graders can read well are part of America Reads. The President's
     budget proposal contains funding both to support programs that help parents be their
     children's first teacher, and to help mobilize 1 million volunteers to tutor k-3 graders after
     school. This is the type of national effort that would be considered for America Reads
     Parents as First Teachers Challenge Grant funding.

Q.   Is this eligible for federal funding?

A.   Many of the individual members already receive federal funding, such as community
     health centers and libraries.

Q.   Is a new 501 (c)3 forming to do this?

A.   No. The members making the initial commitments will form a steering committee to
     coordinate and implement their actions. They will develop a strategic plan in the next 4
     weeks to guide their actions.

Q.   How will the books be distributed?

A.   Qualifying local programs will be shipped directly from the publishers. The partners
     will help them selected appropriate books for each age and community.

Q.   Who should people call for more information?

A.   There is an 800 number set up to answer people's questions and for people who want to
     get involved. The number is 1-800-905-4363. People can also be directed to any of
     the partnership's members, and especially its leaders:

     First Book, 202-393-1222
     Scholastic Books, 212-343-6586
     Reach Out and Read, 617-534-5701
                                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion

Q.   What is the relationship of this Prescription for Reading Partnership and Reach Out and
     Read?

A.   The partnership will replicate and build on Reach Out and Read, and help build a
     community network around each Reach Out and Read program.

Q.   Is Scholastic's donation in addition to the 1 million they donated to America Reads under
     the volunteerism summit?

A.   The 100,000 is part of their commitment of 1 million books. Their pledge to match
     additional pledges of funding with books are in addition to the 1 million books.

Q.   Where will the other 900,000 books pledged for America Reads go?

A.   Scholastic and America Reads will work together to determine their best use and
     distribution.
