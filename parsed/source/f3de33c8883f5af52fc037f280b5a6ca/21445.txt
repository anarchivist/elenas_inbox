ability to lead this country and to get things done in Washington?

ANSWER: No. First, the President is playing a central role in shaping the many appropriations
bills that are pending in Congress. These bills contain several of the President's key priorities for
this year and we are working to ensure Congress funds the President's requests in such
areas as education, training, health, crime and drugs, children and families, the
environment, and community empowerment. In addition, the President has signed into
law several important pieces of legislation in the past three months. For example,
tomorrow the President will sign the Higher Education Act Reauthorization which includes
his initiative to slash the student loan interest rate. Earlier this year, he signed legislation
modeled on his GI Bill for America's Workers which gives Americans new opportunities
and choices to train for the jobs of the future. Other bills the President has fought for and
Congress enacted include: The Credit Union Membership Access Act; the IRS
Restructuring and Reform Act; and the Homeowners Protection Act.

And in those areas where Congress has not heeded the President's call for action, the
President has led by taking unilateral steps to insure a better way of life for all Americans.
For example, the Administration is in the process of bringing Federal health plans into
compliance with the Patient's Bill of Rights.

Finally, he has also continued the job of putting 100,000 police on our streets. The
Administration has now funded over 89,000 new officers and crime rates are down to their
lowest level in a generation. And he has continued policies to reducing the number of guns
on our streets when he banned the importation of more than fifty types of modified assault
weapons.
