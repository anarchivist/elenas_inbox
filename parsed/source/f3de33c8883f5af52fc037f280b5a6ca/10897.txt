 Subject:         Social Security and the House Dem Retreat

 This is an attempt to begin to reach some closure on the Issues Retreat
 coming up at Wintergreen on Monday Feb 8th.

 A panel discussion entitled "Understanding the Numbers and Discussing the
 politics of Saving Social Security" is scheduled from 8:30 to 10:00. This
 will be attended by all members (approx. 130). The Caucus has invited Sec
 Rubin to appear on this panel.  My understanding is that the Sec. is
 considering this request. Goode: What is Rubin's status? I have not
 determined who else will appear on this panel.  I will do so and let
 everyone know.  Larry, Gene: If Rubin does not attend, who do we want to
 suggest?

 After this session five breakout sessions will be conducted from 10:00 to
 11:00. possible Admin participants at these sessions include:

                    Sperling
                    Apfel
                    Summers
                    Stein
                    Lew
                    Rubin.

 It is my understanding that Apfel has already accepted.  Larry and Gene:
 Does this look right to you? Gene: Do you want to attend? Given the 3
 hour drive, it probably involves going down on Sunday.  I'll talk to Linda
 Roberston about Summers.  Larry: Do you want to talk to Jack?

 The Caucus is looking for us to start finalizing things; they're willing
 to allow us to. bring the folks we want at the sessions.



    The Caucus will pay for food                and lodging for any participants. However,
    they will not finance travel                other than the buses going down on Sunday
    (late morning) and returning                Tuesday noon, after the President's address.
    The Vice President addresses                the caucus at dinner on Sunday night at 8:00.
