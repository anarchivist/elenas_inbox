Subject: Conservatives vow effort to undo directive on gays

WASHINGTON TIMES, July 7, 1998
(http://www.washtimes.com/)
Conservatives vow effort to undo directive on gays
By Sean Scully
THE WASHINGTON TIMES

         Christian activists say they will launch a major effort when the
House
returns to Washington to overturn President Clinton's executive order
banning
discrimination against homosexuals.   "It gives the stamp of U.S. government
approval to behavior that is immoral and destructive to individuals,
families
and communities," said Robert H. Knight, director of cultural studies for
the
conservative Family Research Council. "The government simply can't
facilitate
this immorality without opposition."

         In May, Mr. Clinton issued an executive order adding sexual
orientation to
the federal government's nondiscrimination policy. Some individual federal
agencies had already adopted such a policy, but it was not consistent
across
the executive branch.   "Individuals should not be denied a job on the
basis of
something that has no relationship to their ability to perform their work,"
Mr. Clinton said at the time.   The previous policy, established by
President
Nixon, banned discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, national
origin, disability or age.

        Some members of Congress objected to Mr. Clinton's directive, on
both moral
and constitutional grounds, saying the president had exceeded his
authority.
When the House returns on July 14, it will confront a proposal by Rep. Joel
Hefley, Colorado Republican, to undo the order. Mr. Hefley sponsored an
amendment to the Treasury Department appropriation bill that would forbid
the
federal government to spend any money to enforce the president's executive
order -- in effect, nullifying it.  "We hope we are moving in this country
toward a time when there will be no need to grant special rights and
privileges to any group over any other," Mr. Hefley and three other
members
wrote in a June letter supporting the amendment. "While we do not support
discrimination, we also do not believe in giving special protected status
because of sexual orientation or for most other reasons."

        Homosexual rights groups say they are launching an equally
vigorous effort to
defend the president's order. Wayne Besen, spokesman for the Human Rights
Campaign, calls the order a "good-government measure" because it


streamlines
and clarifies the former patchwork of agency policies.  "Some of the
opponents
are trying to demagogue this issue to score political points," he said. "If
the truth means anything, this political football won't have any air in
it. II

      opposition to the executive order comes at a time when congressional
Republicans are increasingly vocal about homosexual issues.   In June,
Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott, Mississippi Republican, compared homosexuality
to
kleptomania and alcoholism.   "You should not try to mistreat [homosexuals]
or
treat them as outcasts," Mr. Lott said in a TV interview. "You should try
to
show them a way to deal with that problem, just like alcohol ... or sex
addiction ... or kleptomaniacs." House Majority Leader Dick Armey, Texas
Republican, promptly came out in support of his colleague, saying "The
Bible
is very clear on this."

        The Senate, meanwhile, is locked in a battle over homosexual
activist James
C. Hormel, heir to the meat-packing company fortune and Mr. Clinton's
nominee
to become ambassador to Luxembourg.  Senate leaders, including Mr. Lott,
have
refused to allow a vote on the nomination, saying Mr. Hormel's advocacy of
homosexual causes makes him an inappropriate representative of the United
States.  "There is a philosophy in our society today that suggests
individuals
can define what is right and wrong for themselves," Mr. Lott wrote in a
recent
newspaper column. "But in my view, right and wrong is ultimately outlined
by
our maker, not individuals."

        Democrats and homosexual advocates have seized on the GOP
positions, saying
they show the disproportionate influence of the religious right.  GOP
leadership "has decided in order to mobilize its base in the upcoming
election, it's going to have to throw some red meat," Mr. Besen said,
predicting the strategy would backfire.

        But conservatives say the Democratic strategy is risky. Mr. Knight
said
Americans are uncomfortable protecting homosexuality on the same level as
race
or ethnicity.  "I think [the Democrats] are so far out of touch . . . . They
don't realize how odd their views would seem to the average American," Mr.
Knight said.
