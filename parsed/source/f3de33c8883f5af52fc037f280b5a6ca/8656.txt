                       Starving Food Safety

                                     American~   now enjoying their summer picnics may
      suffer a
                                     glimmer of anxiety over recent outbreaks of
      food-borne
                                      illness: 6,500 people became sick in Illinois
      last month after
                             eating commercial potato salad, and E. coli
      bacterial contamination
                             occurred in fruit juice and lettuce that originated
      in California. Today,
                             the u.S. Senate can take a big step to combat food
      contamination by
                             restoring all or most of the $101-million initiative
      the Clinton
                             administration has proposed to improve food safety.
      The money
                             would go to hire new safety inspectors, upgrade
      technologies and
                             bring coherence to disjointed oversight.
                                  So far, the Senate has allocated only a
      piddling $2.6 million for the
                             initiative at the u.S. Department of Agriculture and
      nothing at all at
                             the Food and Drug Administration. The shame of this
      penny-pinching
                             is that it comes when lawmakers are spending like
      drunken sailors
                             elsewhere, for instance in the pork-laden
      transportation bill.
                                  The need for better food safety oversight could
      not be stronger.
                             The Centers for Disease Control estimated that this
      year 9,000
                             Americans will die and millions will fall seriously
      ill because of tainted
                             foods, numbers that have been growing. CDC officials
      aren't sure

,.
                             why those statistics are rising, though they suspect
     part of the reason
                             may be improved detection and the increase in
     imported foods
                             bearing bacteria and other pathogens to which
     Americans have little
                             resistance. Food imports have doubled in the last
     seven years and are
                             expected to increase by one-third in the next three
     years.
                                  The administration's Food Safety Initiative
     would get at this
                             problem first by hiring new inspectors. Less than 2%
     of imported
                             food is inspected now because the FDA's budget has
     not grown
                             along with imports. Sen. Thad Cochran (R-Miss.), the
     chairman of
                             the Senate committee that decided not to fund the
     initiative at the
                             FDA, suggested that some of the FDA's duties be
     delegated to states
                             and local governments, but the increasing movement
     of food across
                             state lines and national borders argues for just the
     opposite: a
                             coordinated national strategy.
                                  National planning, for instance, is the only
     way to successfully
                             deploy new technologies like DNA fingerprinting,
     which within hours
                             allows federal inspectors to trace the genetic
     signature of, say, a
                             dangerous bacterium on apples marketed in the West
     back to the
                             farm where the fruit was harvested in Maine. Funding
     the initiative
                             would enable federal agencies to continue efforts to
     install such
                             technology in sites around the country and train
     workers to quickly
                             identify and track food pathogens. And Congress
     needs to consider
                             pending bills to give the FDA and the USDA the power
     to recall food
                             and to create a single food safety agency to
     consolidate scattered
                             oversight.
                                  Food safety is an unassailable cause. There are
     some things that
                             only government can do, and guaranteeing the
     wholesomeness of our
                             food supply is one of them.
