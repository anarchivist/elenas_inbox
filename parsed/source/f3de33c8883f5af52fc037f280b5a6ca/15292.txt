TEXT:
This is very quick, rough, off the top of my head, and uninformed. If I
haven't distanced myself from this far enough already, page me, and I'll
provide additionl caveats ...


The President would deliver a major address exploring the ethical
questions raised by new scientific breakthroughs.   Genetic mapping,
cloning, other new technologies raise all sorts of complex moral and
spiritual questions. Some practical: What do insurers have a right to
know about the potential for terminal disease in those they cover? Some
that go to the core of our beliefs: What is a soul?

At Morgan State the President could begin to help us lay a map thorough
this moral maze, using two topical -- and related    developments as
guideposts. He could discuss the cloning report, due May 25, and use that
discussion to lay one side of the ethical boundary: human cloning, given
what we know today and believe as a society, goes too far. And on the
other hand, he could make a major announcement about genetic screening to
demonstrate how new science can be used to help people live better, longer
lives -- fully in accordance with our basic moral code.   (Even in
fulfillment of it ... )
