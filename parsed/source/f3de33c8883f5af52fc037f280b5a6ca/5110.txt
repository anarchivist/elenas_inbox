TEXT:
The rule linking the Riggs-Roemer charter schools bill -- that we support
-- with the Riggs HELP voucher bill -- that we oppose -- passed by 214 to
198, with roughly 8 Republicans voting against the rule, and 2 Democrats
voting for it.   At the conclusion of debate, Gingrich spoke in favor of
the rule.

Yesterday we issued a SAP indicating that if the charter bill were amended
to include the voucher bill, senior advisors would recommend a veto.

These bills are scheduled to come up for individual consideration Tuesday
evening.
