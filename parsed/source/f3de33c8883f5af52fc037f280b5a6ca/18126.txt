TEXT:
Julie and I are working with the Corporation to retool our MLK Day service
proposal for the President, in light of his lack of excitement about the
DC Reads idea the Corporation came up with, and his interest in Steve
Waldman's ideas. (Steve says that, instead of talk or traditional policy
proposals, the race initiative should bring diverse groups together to
serve and solve a common problem, and suggests the President should start
partnerships, e.g., with black and white churches to fight drug addiction,
or with Hispanic and non-Hispanic high schools to renovate housing.)

Harris suggests we build on a CityYear initiative called Young Heroes.   On
10 consecutive Saturdays, CityYear members will mobilize junior high
school students of different races to work together on a common problem
(not defined).  Harris says we could make this bigger by having
AmeriCorps' NCCC program do the same thing, and try to make it even bigger
by asking the National Council of Churches if they would mobilize their
"education award" AmeriCorps members (that we launched at the summit) to
do it as well.  That way, the event is less of a photo op since we could
note that this work will continue for the next 9 weekends in locations
around the country.  The service itself could focus on kids/the 5 goals,
making a service summit connection.

In the meantime, a cast of thousands from the WH & race initiative will
meet on Monday to discuss options for that day.  Service is definitely a
serious option in everyone's minds, but doing a town hall is even more of
a given, with or without service.  This seems at odds with a service
message to me, but we're trying to learn more about their logic.
