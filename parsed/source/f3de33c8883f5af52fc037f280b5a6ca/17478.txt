David Satcher was reported out of the Labor and Human Resources Committee by
12-5 vote.  The vote makes it very possible that we could have a confirmed
Surgeon General by the time Congress goes home for the winter.

There appears to be one major issue that might get in the way.  Prior to the
vote, Senator Coats made a big deal about Dr. Satcher supporting the
President's position on the partial birth issue. Rich Tarplin and I are
somewhat concerned that some of the right-leaning Republicans may, once again,
take the opportunity to use the final Senate floor vote on Dr. Satcher's
confirmation as a vehicle to hit the President again on this issue.   Worse
case scenario, of course, is the politics of partial birth has the impact of
delaying the final vote until next year.

At this point, we may be being overly paranoid/cautious, but we felt -- at the
very least -- we should be prepared to answer questions on this issue one more
time.  I assume it would be a reiteration of the President's position, which of
course Dr. Satcher supports, and a criticism that certain members are -- once
again -- trying to politicize "America's doctor" and delay the valuable service
he can provide.  If we hear anything new on this front, we will advise
     "
