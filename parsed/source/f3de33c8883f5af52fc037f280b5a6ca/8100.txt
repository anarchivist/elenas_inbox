TEXT:
The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force recently issued an important
survey overview of public opinion relating to gay and lesbian issues.
The authors of the report, which contains an impressive analysis of much
of the existing polling information, will be here for a briefing of
interested white House staff on Thursday, June 11th at 3pm in Room 180 OEOB
   I hope you can join us.
