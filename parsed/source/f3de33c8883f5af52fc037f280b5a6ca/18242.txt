Elena,

Beverly Barnes called me asking for some information to prepare Erskine
for a press interview.  Accroding to Beverly, he will be asked what policy
actions the President is likely to undertake that will be part of the
fabric of the Race Initiative.  I am not sure how specific we can be about

like you to take a look at it.  Beverly wants the items by noon tomorrow
(Wed.).  Thanks.

Julie
