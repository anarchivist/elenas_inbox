(How's that for a catchy "subject?")

I have a couple additional names for our friends at SSA to call or meet
with on the OSI/Nazi deportation issue.

1.         Andy Baker
           American Jewish Committee
           202.785.4200

2.         Union of American Hebrew Congregations (UAHC)
           Rabbi Saperstein
           Director, The Religious Action Center
           202.387.2800


I've spoken with many of the other organizations.   Most of them asked if
I had checked with the World Jewish Congress/World Jewish Restitution
Organization and suggested I call them regarding this issue.

Please let me know if you need additional names.

Thanks.
