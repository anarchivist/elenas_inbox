TEXT:
In light of our conversation this morning regarding a clearance
process for CEQ contact with the Department of Justice on matters
which are in litigation, I am informing you that I am chairing an
interagency meeting today to address a National Environmental
Policy Act issue, at which DOJ will attend. Three agencies, EPA,
Commerce/NOAA, and DOl, have asked DOJ to appeal a Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission order to the 9th Circuit regarding FERC's
interpretation of "baseline" for a relicensing project under NEPA.
The three agencies disagree with FERC's interpretation, and have
asked CEQ for its interpretation. DOJ would like CEQ's input as
well before making a decision to appeal this issue.
