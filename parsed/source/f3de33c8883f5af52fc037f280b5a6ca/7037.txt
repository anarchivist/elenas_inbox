TEXT:
Thurgood suggested I forward you the following.   I received it in my
request for hot issues for the President's trip to Kentucky.

Smoking Debate:  Perhaps the biggest current issue for Kentuckians is the
struggle between tobacco int~rests and anti-smoking advocates.  Progress on
a national tobacco settlement has been closely followed in the media, with
a lot of attention going to the predicament of tobacco farmers and
tobacco-dependent communities. Tobacco is Kentucky's biggest cash crop by
far.  In addition, tobacco manufactures have traditionally provided some of
the state's highest wages, 65% higher than the average for all Kentucky
manufacturing industries. Obviously, a trend toward reduced smoking could
have a major impact on economic conditions, especially in rural areas of
the state. There is no agreement on the best course, even among farmers
themselves.  Some growers want an up-front buyout so they can leave the
tobacco business altogether. Others want to keep the tobacco price support
program, maintaining an option to be bought out later.  Kentucky Senator
Wendell Ford and Representative Scotty Baesler, both Democrats, have
proposed bills to help Kentucky farmers and to provide assistance to
tobacco communities.
