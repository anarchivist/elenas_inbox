BR/EK:

I sent over the latest version of the Leahy amendment yesterday.  If you
haven't had a chance to look at it, what it does is make direct grants to
state and local law enforcement (as administered by DOJ or Treasury --
still up in the air) one of the four activities eligible for a minimum of
17.5% and maximum of 22.5% of the public health funds.  However, the
amendment also strikes the language guaranteeing FDA a minimum of these
funds. As I understand from Team Leader Rice, the minimum for FDA
enforcement was very important to us -- and that we expected FDA to get
more than 40% of these funds (or about $1.2 billion of an estimated $2.9
billion).  Is this a deal-breaker for us supporting Leahy? Should someone
visit w/Leahy's folks on this issue?

Jose'
