TEXT:
After 4 hours of debate and learning that former AMA CEO, Jim Todd had
passed away, the AMA did adopt HR 1122 as policy. They adopted a
resolution to work with Federal and State officials to address the
criminal penalties issue. The AMA also agreed to work with ACOG and AMWA
on issues of intent and vagueness. The vote was by voice vote and was not
close.

Nancy Dickey, Chair, Board of Trustees, AMA, who lead the AMA review and
recommended passage of HR 122, was elected at the meeting to become the
first women President of AMA for 1998-1999.
