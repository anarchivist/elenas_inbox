We discussed on Monday the SG's draft Op-Ed on tobacco.

I wanted you to know that the SG made the edits we wanted, including
explicitly making a pitch for Congress to ensure settlement funds are used
to prevent youth smoking, and has begun to shop the piece, starting with
the Post, but don't expect any reaction until at least early next week.
