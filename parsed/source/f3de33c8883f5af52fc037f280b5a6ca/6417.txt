TEXT:
DoJ reports that Judge Russell has died of lung cancer and Judge Hall is
quite ill. These are the two judges who were leaning against us.   There
is no way to know what stage the decision is at.  It could be at the
printers or the case might be reassigned and the case may have to be
reargued.
