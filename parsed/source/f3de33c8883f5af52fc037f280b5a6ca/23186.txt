                          MEDICARE COMMISSION TALKING POINTS



     Senator Beaux has made a constructive contribution toward addressing the challenges
     facing Medicare. After more than a year of work, the Medicare Commission has helped to
     focus long-overdue attention on the need to modernize the program and prepare it for retirement
     of the baby boom generation. Many of its recommendations represent sound policy that should
     be seriously considered by the Congress. I want to thank Senator Beaux, Congressman Thomas
     and all the members of the Commission, particularly my appointees (Laura Tyson, Stuart
     Altman, Bruce Vladeck and Tony Watson), for all their hard work.

     The Beaux-Thomas plan, however, falls short in a number of key areas which explains why
     I cannot support it. In January, I outlined the principles that I would use to evaluate the
     Commission's work product. This plan does not appear to include elements that are essential to
     strengthening Medicare and better preparing it for the twenty-first century. Key concerns
     include:

     ·      Does not provide necessary new revenues for Medicare and passes up an historic
            opportunity to dedicate 15 percent of the surplus to the program. Every
            independent Medicare expert agrees that the program cannot provide the baby boom
            generation with Medicare benefits without substantial new revenue. Unfortunately, the
            Commission plan does not present options for new revenues. Instead, it recommends
            waiting and acting when Medicare's solvency is at risk. Waiting not only makes the
            problem harder to solve, but shifts more of the burden to our children. This is wrong.
            This is why I proposed to dedicate part of the surplus to Medicare immediately, to save
            some oftoday's prosperity for tomorrow's needs.

     ·      Increases Medicare eligibility age without a policy to protect against large increases
            in the numbers of the uninsured. As you know, I am deeply concerned about the
            trends in the uninsured, particularly among older Americans. That is why I proposed
            allowing some people ages 55 to 65 to buy into Medicare. These problems will only get
            worse under a proposal that postpones Medicare eligibility without providing premium
            assistance for alternative health coverage.

     ·      Premium support proposal that raises questions about whether premiums for the
            traditional Medicare program will increase and current benefits are guaranteed. I
            am committed to adding competition and private sector approaches to Medicare, but not
            if this hurts the existing program or its beneficiaries.

     ·      Inadequate coverage of prescription drugs. While I want to recognize Senator
            Beaux's leadership in acknowledging the need for prescription drug coverage, his
            proposal does not provide an accessible, affordable option for all beneficiaries. As Laura
            Tyson, Stuart Altman, and other respected health economists agree that the current
            system's patchwork coverage of prescription drugs is highly inefficient and expensive.
                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion ·

      I will build on the Commission's work and develop and propose a plan that can go the next
      step in attracting even greater consensus. I have instructed my health care advisors to take
      the best ideas from the Commission plan, from those not voting for the Commission plan, and
      from Congress to craft a proposal that can receive bipartisan support and truly prepare Medicare
      for its future challenges. Medicare is not and should not become a partisan, political issue and I
      am determined to work across party lines to strengthen and improve the program this year.
