TEXT:
Elena,
The following are the two issues to be resolved at this afternoon's
meeting with Labor and Commerce.

1.         Recruit and retain

          Commerce would prefer a scheme that lists acceptable
  recruitment/retention practices, and requires the employer to attest to
  having complied with a subset of these.  Thus, as long as the employer
. recruits (regardless of whether the employer eventually hires a qualified
  U.S. worker found through this recruitment), they are o.k.   Labor prefers
  a "performance" based attestation -- one that requires that the employer's
  recruitment fails to turn up U.S. workers that are qualified to do the
  job.

2.         No lay-off

          Labor wants this provision to protect against an employer firing a
  U.S. worker in order to hire an H1B worker, but wants the burden to be on
  the employer to demonstrate that the U.S. worker and the H1B worker did
  not have substantially equivalent education and experience.  Commerce's
  suggested language only requires that if an employer lays-off a U.S.
  worker,  they must recruit within their company to fill the position --
  something that would already be required by the recruit and retain
  provision.  It seems that Commerce's biggest concern is not wanting the
  Labor Department to have too much discretion to decide whether a laid-off
. employee is "substantially equivalent" to an H1B employee.

        We have suggested to Labor, and will suggest to Commerce, that we
could leave the lay-off language as is, and limit
enforcement/investigation to cases where (1) there is a complaint filed ;
(2) a certain number or percentage of employees have been laid off; or (3)
where the employers workforce is more than x% H1B. This would allow
investigation of the bigger cases, while mostly limiting the Department's
enforcement of the more routine employment decisions.

Julie
