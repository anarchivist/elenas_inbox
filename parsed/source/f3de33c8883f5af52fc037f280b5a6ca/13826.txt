Elena--
A few weeks ago, we briefly discussed a letter William S. Lerach, who wrote in
support of the President's veto of the product liability legislation. We agreed
that the President could send a shortened version of our general product
liability letter. Accordingly, I sent my shortened version to Jennifer Dudley
to see if it was okay for Presidential signature.   Yesterday, she suggested that
I run it by you for clearance. will you please look at this draft and let me
know if it is sufficient?
thanks for your help--
Jeff
Thank you for your letter regarding the Product Liability Legal
Reform Act of 1996. As I'm sure you know, I vetoed this
legislation on May 2, and I appreciate having your perspective on
this issue.
I believe our legal system needs reform, and I have repeatedly
urged Congress to pass limited, meaningful product liability
measures. However, I vetoed the product liability bill Congress
sent to me because I concluded that it failed to provide adequate
protection either to consumers or to the interests of
manufacturers and sellers.
Congress could have sent me limited, but balanced product
liability reform, and if they had done so, .r gladly would have
signed the legislation. As I continue working with Congress
toward this end, I appreciate knowing your thoughts.
