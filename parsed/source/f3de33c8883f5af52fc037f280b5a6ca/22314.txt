TEXT:
Bruce you asked yesterday if we have an estimate of Medicare
tobacco-related costs.

If we need to use a number we and OMB (Mendelson) are comfortable using
"tens of billions of dollars a year."

Here's why:

(1) The best estimate we have is that tobacco-related health problems cost
Medicare $10 billion in 1993. This estimate was published in CDC's
Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report in 1994, and was cited by CBO in its
April 1998 report on the proposed tobacco settlement.

(2) CDC and OMB both think this estimate is conservative. Besides, we
don't want to pre-judge what a suit may ask for once estimates are
updated.  Thus, we'd propose to be general. Mendelson particularly made
the point that OMB wouldn't sign off on using a particular number but
would be ok with "tens of billions of dollars."   Currently our budget
Medicare paragraph says "billions of dollars each year."

Estimates of total tobacco-related health costs (federal, state, private)
range from $45 to $75 billion a year.
