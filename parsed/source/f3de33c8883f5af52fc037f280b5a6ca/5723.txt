TEXT:
We had a good meeting with Nickles tobacco staff guy, Eric Ueland. Things
of note:  they would like to do a bill early, they would be looking to the
House for the base bill first, could do Senate bill on the ISTEA (base
bill) or reconciliation model, there is some pretty mixed feelings on
giving industry immunity, and they may request more company documents.

Also, he said a couple of times that the members were looking to the SOTU
to see how President sets a non-partisan tone.  They have a pla=ing
meeting 1/30 with members.  He said there was interest in sending (before
the SOTU) the President a formal letter requesting an executive branch
bill.   He suggested that it would help set a common course if the
President felt like calling Nickles. He said that right after mentioning
that he knew the President had talked to Lott. As Rich said later, if we
are going to do that, Hilley might talk to Lott's guy so there is no
misunderstanding. Regards, Tom
