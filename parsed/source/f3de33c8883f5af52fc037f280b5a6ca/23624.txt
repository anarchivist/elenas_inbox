1. Take the VP out of the list and just note that he will be reading it.
THe VP may see the memo and find the idea that it has to be considered
whether he reads it disconcerting ... even though we know that is not what
is meant, could be misread.

2.  I don't know what others think, but I think there may be a few folks
that we call and talk to before the book goes to print not just a few
days.  e.g. Wade Henderson. Don't know that we need to mention in the
memo, but maybe.

3. You may want to list the people that were consulted to make the
recommendation so the POTUS does not need to ask for instance "what does
Bob Nash think"
