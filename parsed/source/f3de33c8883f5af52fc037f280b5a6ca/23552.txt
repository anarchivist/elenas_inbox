     Attached for your clearance is the draft letter from Sec Riley directed to
     the conferees on H.R. 800 ED Flex Partnership Act of 1999.  In the draft,
     Sec Riley states, "The Senate bill, however, contains unacceptable
     provisions regarding the class size reduction authority that are unrelated
     to the expansion of ED-Flex authority and, if adopted, would force me to
     recommend to the President that he veto the bill." The conference report
     is scheduled for House consideration on Friday, April 16th.   We would
    'like to get this letter out today.  Please respond to me with your
     comments and/or sign-off as soon as possible. My apologies for the short


turnaround.   Thank you.

    Dear Conferee:

    I am writing to express my views on the House-and Senate-passed versions of H.R. 800, the
    Education Flexibility Partnership Act of 1999. As you know, "ED-Flex" authority permits
    States to waive certain statutory and regulatory requirements that apply to Federal education
    programs in a manner that complements State educational reform efforts and promotes
    achievement to high standards by all students.      The Administration has long supported the
    concept of expanding ED-Flex authority beyond the 12 States allowed under current law, so
    long as that expansion does not undermine the purposes of those Federal programs and
    maintains a high degree of accountability for results. I am very pleased, therefore, that both bills
    would expand eligibility for ED-Flex status to all the States, as well as the District of Columbia
    and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and couple that increased flexibility with a serious
    attention to maintaining accountability at the State and local level. The Senate bill, however,
    contains unacceptable provisions regarding the class size reduction authority that are unrelated to
    the expansion of ED-Flex authority and, if enacted adopted, would force me to recommend to
    the President that he veto the bill.   I urge the Conferees to avoid such a disappointing and
    unnecessary result.

    Turning to the ED-Flex provisions, I am very pleased that both bills have strong provisions for
    ensuring State monitoring of local ED-Flex activities and termination of waivers that have
    inadequate or harmful results.   With regard to the following provisions, I offer the following
    vIews:

           Public notice and comment. I am pleased that both the Senate and House versions contain
           provisions to enhance parental involvement in the ED-Flex waiver process. In order to
           maximize parental involvement and improve ED-Flex waivers, I support the Senate's
           provision on this issue, with the addition of language included in the House bill
           requiring the public notice to contain a description of any expected improvements in
           student performance and the public comments received by the State and local education
           agencies to be made available for public review.

           Expansion of ED-Flex Authority. With regard to the expansion of the ED-Flex
           authority, I support the Senate version of the bill, which would make very clear that a
           State may not waive Federal requirements applicable to the State as a whale itself.

           Accountability Provisions. With respect to State eligibility for ED-Flex status, I support
           the more rigorous conditions in the House bill, as they apply to implementation of
           standards and assessments under Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act
           of 1965 (ESEA). With respect to the State's application for ED-Flex status, I support the
           language in the Senate bill, which focuses on how ED-Flex authority will assist in
           implementing the State's comprehensive reform plan. Regarding the renewal of Ed-Flex
           authority, I support the more rigorous requirements in the House version that require the
           State to show measurable progress toward achieving the State's educational objectives.
                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion
       Targeting Provisions. With respect to waivers that would not be authorized, I strongly
       support both the House and Senate versions ~egarding school eligibility for Title I Part A
       since both these pro¥ision provisions target funds more directly eR to high poverty
       schools.

       State Reporting. I believe that complete State reporting of ED-Flex results is important
       and so support the provisions of the House bill relating to annual State reporting to the
       Secretary about the numbers and characteristics of waivers granted.

       Sunset Provision. Finally, I strongly support the provision of the House bill that would
       "sunset" this Act upon enactment of the upcoming reauthorization of the ESEA, because
       it is vitally important that continuation of ED-Flex authority be made consistent with
       changes to the underlying Federal programs to which it applies.

Class Size

Last fall, Congress enacted and funded, on a bipartisan basis, a down payment on the President's
plan to help the Nation's school districts reduce class sizes in the early elementary grades.
Regrettably, the Senate bill contains amendments to the class size reduction authority that would
undermine its impact by permitting local school districts to use funds received under that initiative
not to reduce class size, but to meet obligations they are already required to meet under Part B of
the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. The value of reducing class size in the early
elementary grades is supported by 4e research, and doing so is one of the most important things
we can do to honor our national commitment to ensuring equal educational opportunity for all
our children. Moreover, reducing class size in the early grades allows teachers to identify, and
work more effectively with, students who have learning disabilities, thereby potentially reducing
those students' need for intensive special education services in the later grades. Rather than
undermining the bipartisan effort to reduce class size--and setting parent against parent in school
districts across the country--I would have supported a bill that extended the President's initiative,
so that school districts could plan to hire additional qualified teachers, provide additional
classrooms, and take the other steps necessary to reduce class size. I certainly cannot support a
bill that contains these Senate amendments and would recommend that the President veto it, if it
were presented to him.

The Office of Management and Budget advises that there is no objection to the submission of
this report and that from the standpoint of the Administration's program, enactment of H.R. 800
containing the Senate's amendments relating to the class size reduction initiative would not be in
accord with the President's program.


                                                      Yours sincerely,
     ~,
