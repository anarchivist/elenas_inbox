                      New York Times to refuse
                      tobacco ads

                      April 28, 1999
                      Web posted at: 12:46 PM EDT (1646 GMT)

                      NEW YORK (AP)    -- The New York Times plans to ban
 advertisements
                      for cigarettes, cigars and other tobacco products in its
 pages effective
                      Saturday.

                   The Times decided on the ban, the first by a national
 newspaper, because of
                   concerns about the harmful effects of smoking, New York
 Times Co.
                   spokeswoman Nancy Nielsen said.

                      "We don't want to expose our readers to advertising that
 may be dangerous
                      to their health," Ms. Nielsen said.

                      Tobacco advertising accounted for less than 1 percent of
 the newspaper's
                      $1 billion in ad revenues last year.

                   More than a dozen other u.S. newspapers refuse to
 publish tobacco ads.

                      The Seattle Times refuses ads for tobacco, handguns and
 pornographic
                      movies, while The News & Observer of Raleigh, N.C.,
 refuses ads for
                   bingo, fortune tellers and 900 telephone numbers,
 according to the industry's
                   Editor & Publisher International Yearbook.

                      Mark Smith, a spokesman for the tobacco company Brown &
 Williamson,
                      called The New York Times' new policy "pathetic. Isn't
 it ironic that a
                      pUblication that trumpets freedom of the press would

"
        trample on the freedom
                          of commercial expression?"

                            Times publisher Arthur o. Sulzberger Jr. said that the
        First Amendment
                          "gives the press the right to publish what it chooses
        to. It doesn't force the
                          press to publish something, whether that's a news story
        or an advertisement."

                          The Times likely has already run its last cigarette ad.
        A full-page color ad for
                          Carlton cigarettes ran Monday, and no others were
        scheduled before the
                          ban takes effect. The Times, which also shuns ads for
        handguns and tear
                          gas, will continue to accept tobacco company ads that
        don't promote
                          smoking.

                          Last year, the tobacco industry reached a $206 billion
        deal with 46 states
                          that had sued to recover health costs associated with
        smoking. The deal
                          bans outdoor cigarette ads and forbids ads targeting
        children.
