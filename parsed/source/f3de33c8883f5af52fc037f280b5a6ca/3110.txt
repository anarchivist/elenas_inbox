TEXT:
Emil and I had an interesting meeting today with the President of the
University of Miami, Edward Foote. He thinks universities are a great
untapped resource for the welfare to work effort.  Not only are
universities usually one of the largest regional employers, but they are
well connected with local leaders and have an army of possible student
volunteers.

Foote had met yesterday with Eli and Lyn and was familiar with our efforts
to mobilize the business and non-profit sectors and he thinks that
university presidents would respond to some sort of similar effort.  (I
understand that the Welfare to Work Partnership is considering whether or
not to include large non-profit institutions in its fold.  However, Foote
thought that an effort more clearly targeted on universities which would
recognize their roles as more than just employers might be more
effective) .

I think this is worth pursuing.  Foote will be meeting during the next
several days with some of his counterparts, and he'll try to get a read
from them of their interest. We may then want to sit down with the
relevant association (American Council on Education) and think about
scheduling a working session with the President or Vice President for
sometime in the fall.   What do you think?
