TEXT:
I am going to try to get an hour on your calendar in the next few days to
have the summit on voluntarism CEO come in and talk to us about how the
summit is structured.   If you don't have time, just let me know and I'll
do it myself, but I thought you might find it useful.   This is the guy
 (Stuart Shapiro) who works for the summit itself, rather than the Corp.
for National Service.
