TEXT:
Below is the draft Rules SAP for Transportation Appropriations, FY99.  The
language is virtually identical to the House Committee letter that was
sent 7/21/98 (we took out the PLA language because we do not expect an
amendment to be offered). The Rules Committee is scheduled to meet at 4pm
today (this could be postponed).  Please provide comments/clearance by 3pm
today.  Thank you.

DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION
         AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS BILL, FY 1999
(Sponsors: Livingston (R), Louisiana; Wolf (R), Virginia)


        This Statement of Administration Policy provides the
AdministrationD,s views on the Department of Transportation and Related
Agencies Appropriations Bill, FY 1999, as reported by the House
Appropriations Committee.   Your consideration of the Administrationu,s
views would be appreciated.

         The Administration appreciates efforts by the Committee to
accommodate certain of the President's priorities within the 302(b)
allocation such as funding for Amtrak.   However, the allocation is simply
insufficient to make the necessary investments in programs funded by this
bill. As a result, a variety of critical programs are under-funded.    The
only way to achieve the appropriate investment level is to offset
discretionary spending by using savings in other areas.   The President's
FY 1999 Budget proposes levels of discretionary spending for FY 1999 that
conform to the Bipartisan Budget Agreement by making savings in mandatory
and other programs available to help finance this spending.   In the
Transportation Equity Act, Congress -- on a broad, bipartisan basis
took similar action in approving funding for surface transportation
programs together with mandatory offsets.   The Administration urges the
Congress to consider such mandatory proposals for other priority
discretionary programs, including those funded through this bill.

        The Administration is concerned that the Committee bill could
seriously compromise the Coast GuardD,s and the Federal Aviation
AdministrationD,s (FAAD,s) operations and modernization projects,
compromise highway safety, and harm other important programs.   The House
could partially accommodate the funding increases recommended below by
adhering more closely to the PresidentD,s request for the Airport Grants
program, High Speed Rail, Coast Guard Alteration of Bridges, and other
programs. The Administration is pleased that the Committee has not
included language limiting the use of project labor agreements.   However,
the bill does include a number of objectionable language provisions.   The
AdministrationD,s concerns are discussed below.

Essential Operations

        The Administration strongly urges the House to fully fund the
request for Coast Guard and FAA operations. We ask that the Committee
restore the $72 million reduction to Coast Guard Operating Expenses and to
eliminate the CommitteeD,s direction to reallocate funds among programs.
The Committee mark would force the Coast Guard to lay up certain cutters
and aircraft and decommission one of the NationD,s three polar


icebreakers, which would, among other effects, compromise the integrity of
our Exclusive Economic Zone and leave critically depleted fish stocks
under-protected.

        Likewise, we ask the House to restore the $56 million reduction to
FAA Operations·. These funds are necessary to ensure that the FAA can hire
the safety inspectors and security personnel needed to meet the demands
from increased air travel.

Coast Guard and FAA Modernization

        The Administration urges the House to fully fund the request for
Coast Guard and FAA modernization to ensure that the infrastructure
necessary to fulfill their missions in the future is available.  The
Administration urges the House to restore the $54 million reduction to
the request for Coast Guard capital replacement funding.   This funding is
necessary to complete projects that will reduce the Coast GuardD,s future
operating costs, improve mission performance, and provide adequate
facilities and housing for Coast Guard personnel.  We are particularly
concerned about large cuts to the seagoing buoy tender replacement, the
Deepwater Capability Replacement Analysis, and family housing.  These cuts
ultimately would adversely impact all Coast Guard activities, including
drug law enforcement.  In addition, we urge the House to fully fund the
PresidentD,s request for the Nationwide Differential Global Positioning
System and for adding a second civil signal to the Global Positioning
System.

        The Administration urges the House to provide an additional $130
million for the FAA Facilities and Equipment account.  Funding at any
lower level could delay National Airspace System Modernization.   In
particular, full funding is required for the Host Computer replacement and
other Year 2000 conversion activities. The Administration objects to the
elimination of funding for the Flight 2000 program. This program is a key
element of the FAAD,s plans to make a transition to a more efficient, user
involved, satellite-based air traffic control system to meet the air
traffic needs of the next century.

Amtrak

         The Administration appreciates the CommitteeD,s support for Amtrak
funding.   We urge the House to allow Amtrak to invest these capital funds
flexibly, as provided in the Senate bill and.as presently done by Federal
Transit Administration grantees.    In addition, the requirement that the
House and Senate Appropriations Committees approve a Capital plan for
Amtrak constitutes a legislative veto. The Administration will interpret
this provision to require notification only, since any other
interpretation would contradict the Supreme Court ruling in INS vs., Chadha.

National Highway Traffic Safety Administration

         To protect the safety of automobile travelers adequately, the
Administration asks that the House work with the authorizing committees
and provide an additional $12 million for high-priority National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration programs. These vehicle safety and consumer
information activities are essential to provide consumers with up-to-date
safety information, to conduct critical research on advanced air bag
systems and the biomechanics of injury, and to develop improved crash test
dummies.

Access-to-Jobs
 ,                                                                           Page 5 of5



        The Administration requests that the House provide an additional
$50 million to fully fund the PresidentO,s request of $100 million for the
Access-to-Jobs program.  This program is a critical component of the
AdministrationO,s welfare reform effort.  The additional resources are
essential to helping more individuals in communities around the country
make a successful transition from welfare to work.

Office of the Secretary

        The Administration urges the House to provide the President",s
requested $62 million for salaries and expenses of the Office of the
Secretary and to delete the CommitteeO,s recommended new account structure
and limitation on political appointees.  These adjustments to the
Committee bill are necessary to avoid a reduction-in-force and to allow
the Secretary to manage the Department effectively.

Earmarks

        The Committee has earmarked almost 300 transit projects, as well
as many airport, Intelligent Transportation System, and rail projects.
Consistent with the AdministrationO,s objection to earmarks in TEA-21, the
Administration believes that funds should not be directed to projects that
cannot meet established selection criteria.

Language Provisions

        The Administration requests that the House delete the provisions
in both the Coast Guard and FAA operating expenses language that would
prohibit the Coast Guard and the FAA from evaluating options for
collecting fees for their services.  User fees may be a critical means in
the future for ensuring that the Coast Guard and the FAA have adequate
resources to meet their operating and capital needs without significantly
reducing other vital transportation programs.

        The Administration strongly objects to the Committee prohibition
of any future changes to automobile fuel economy (CAFE) standards.  This
significant policy issue should be addressed analytically through the
process in place under Federal law and not preemptively settled through
the appropriations process.


        Finally, the Administration is pleased that the Committee recognizes the
need to review the Coast GuardO,s roles and missions but objects co the
CommitteeO,s proposed blue-ribbon panel.  This proposal would add
significant administrative and procedural requirements to the process,
delay the Deepwater contract by at least a year, and be more costly than
the AdministrationO,s proposed advisory council.  The advisory council
would provide an objective, third-party assessment of the Coast GuardiJ, s
roles and missions in a time frame consistent with the planned Deepwater
procurement.
