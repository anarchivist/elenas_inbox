TEXT:
CBO Projects $2.6T Federal Surplus

                            By ALAN FRAM Associated Press Writer

                            WASHINGTON (AP) -- Unleashing figures certain to
fuel this
                            year's budget fight,   the Congressional Budget
Office projected
                            Thursday that federal surpluses will total $2.6
trillion over the
                            next decade, hundreds of billions of dollars
more than was
                            expected just five months ago.

                            Significantly, the nonpartisan budget office
also said that
                            discounting the mammoth annual surpluses Social
Security is
                            running, the rest of the budget will fall into
balance in 2001.

                            Over the decade ending in 2009, CBO said nearly
one-third of
                            the $2.6 trillion -- $787 billion -- would come
from the
                            non-Social Security side of the budget. The mere
expectation of
                            that enormous sum is already opening the door
for a bitter
                            partisan fight over what to do with that money.

                            After a year of President Clinton insisting that
lawmakers should


                            save Social Security first, "    many Republicans
in Congress
                          generally agree that surpluses generated by
Social Security
                          should be set aside for the massive retirement
program.

                          But Republicans have signaled they want to use
the rest of the
                          surplus for tax cuts, a position they reiterated
Thursday.

                          "We've clearly succeeded in our long battle to
balance the
                          budget, "   Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete
Domenici,
                          R-N.M., said in a statement.

                          "Now we have a new test -- what to do with the
$787 billion in
                          excess federal tax revenues, money the
government doesn't need
                          to maintain current services,"     Domenici said.
"We better send it
                          back to the taxpayers quickly, or Washington
will spend it. It
                          shows we can save SS and cut taxes."

                          Sen. Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey, the top
Democrat on the
                          Senate Budget Committee, said the figures showed
Clinton's
                          policies were working.

                          "Now we have to build on them and prepare for
our nation's
                          future,"    Lautenberg said in a statement. "That
means saving
                          Social Security, strengthening Medicare and
cutting taxes for
                          ordinary Americans to encourage savings.' ,

                          In his State of the Union address on Jan. 19,
Clinton proposed
                          setting aside $2.7 trillion over the next 15
years for Social
                          Security. He would use the rest of the surplus
-- about $1. 7
                          trillion      for Medicare,   the health insurance
program for the
                          elderly; to help set up private retirement
accounts for Americans;
                          and for defense and domestic programs.

                          An aide to Lautenberg said the senator's
reference to cutting
                          taxes indicated support for the retirement
accounts plus other
                          reductions like tax breaks for long-term health
care, which


                                 Clinton also has proposed.

                                 Clinton will release his own budget for fiscal
     2000 on Monday.
                                 It will include his own updated surplus
     projections, which
                                 analysts expect to roughly track the CBO figures.

                                 The Congressional Budget Office numbers were
     expected for
                                 weeks as analysts concluded that the healthy
     economy was
                                 continuing to pour money into federal coffers
     faster than
                                 previously expected. That same phenomenon
     produced a $70
                                 billion surplus for fiscal 1998, which ended
     last Sept. 30, the first
                                 federal surplus in three decades and the largest
     ever.

                                 Even so, the new numbers are impressive.

                                 Just three weeks ago, Clinton announced that the
     1999 surplus
                                 would be at least $76 billion. But CBO projected
     that figure
                                 would be $107 billion -- more than 50 percent
     above the 1998
                                 total.

                                 CBO projected a 2000 surplus of $131 billion.
     Through the
                                 following nine years, the budget office
     estimated that the figure
                                 would rise annually, hitting $381 billion in
     2009,   the last year for
                                 which numbers were calculated.

                                 Last August, the budget office projected $1.5
     trillion in surpluses
                                 between 1999 and 2008. It also projected much
     lower
                                 surpluses for the non-Social Security part of
     the budget then: a
                                 10-year total of just $31 billion.
