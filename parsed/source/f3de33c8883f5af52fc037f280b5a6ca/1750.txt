           CLINTON ADMINISTRATION EFFORTS TO SUPPORT THE
            DEVELOPMENT OF AMERICA'S YOUNGEST CHILDREN


 "Learning begins in the first days of life. Scientists are now discovering how young
 children develop emotionally and intellectually from their very first days, and how important it is for
 parents to begin immediately talking, singing, even reading to their infants .... We already know we
 should start teaching children before they start school. "

                 -- President Bill Clinton, State of the Union Address, February 4, 1997



Preparing our children for the 21st century is among our most important national priorities.
Over the past few years, scientific research has demonstrated that the earliest years of life --
before children reach school age -- are critical to their cognitive, emotional, and physical
development. President Clinton is meeting the challenge to improve those years by investing in
research, supporting parents and caregivers, and strengthening programs that provide early
intervention to disadvantaged families.

Increased participation in Head Start, created Early Head Start for 0-3 year oids, and
improved program quality. For more than thirty years, Head Start has been one of our nation's
best investments. By ensuring that low-income children start school ready to learn, Head Start
can pay for itself. For that reason, President Clinton has made expanding and improving Head
Start a priority of his Administration. Over the past four years, funding for the program has
increased by 43%, and in fiscal year 1997 Head Start will serve 800,000 low-income children
four years old and younger. Initiated in 1994, there are now 142 Early Head Start programs
across the country, expanding the proven benefits of Head Start to low-income families with
children under three. Over the last three years, the Clinton Administration has also invested
significantly in improving program quality, providing local programs with the resources they
need to attract and retain high quality teachers and ensuring the safety of Head Start centers. The
President's 1998 budget proposal provides a $324 million increase in Head Start's budget so that
it will remain on course to serve 1 million children by 2002.

Increased participation in WIC program. WIC Supplemental Nutrition Program provides
nutrition packages, nutrition education, and health referrals to low-income pregnant women,
infants, and children. Over the past four years participation has expanded by 1.7 million from 5.7
to 7.4 million women, infants, and children. The increase in the President's budget proposal
fulfills his commitment to achieving full participation in WIC by the end of 1998. Research
shows that WIC prenatal services save Medicaid much more than they cost by reducing health
care expenses in the first 60 days after birth.



Raised Childhood Immunization Rates to an All-Time High. The President's Childhood
                                                Hex·Dump COiiversion ·

 Immunization Initiative focuses on five areas: l)improving the quality and quantity of
 vaccination delivery services; 2) reducing vaccine costs for parents; 3)increasing community
 participation, education and partnerships; 4)improving systems to monitor diseases and
 vaccinations; and 5) improving vaccines and vaccine use. This initiative has achieved notable
 success: in 1995, seventy-five percent of two-year olds were fully immunized -- an historic high.
 Funding for childhood immunization has doubled since fiscal year 1993.

 Improved Support/or In/ants and Toddlers with Special Needs. Under the Individuals with
 Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), the Infants and Families Program supports the continuing
 efforts of States to implement high quality statewide early intervention services for infants and
 toddlers with disabilities. Over the past four years, funding for the program has increased by 48%
 or $102.5 million. During the same period, the number of children served increased by 21.5
 percent. An estimated 191,000 children will be served in fiscal year 1998.

 Enhanced Family Literacy Program. Even Start Family Literacy is a family-focused grant
 program to improve the educational opportunities for children and their parents in low-income
 areas by integrating family literacy activities, including early childhood education, adult
 education, and parenting education. Since 1993, funding for Even Start has increased by over
 40% to support programs in every state and the District of Columbia.

  Improved Child Care in Public Housing. The Early Childhood Development Program helps to
. provide quality child care for families living in public housing communities, as well as families
  who are homeless or at risk of becoming so. The program allows parents or guardians who live in
  public housing to get and keep jobs by ensuring that their children are cared for. In 1996, $21
  million was awarded to public housing sites across the country -- three times mort; than in 1994.

 Providing Funding for Parent Resource Centers.in 42 States. In addition to involving parents in the
 development of state and local education plans, the President's Goals 2000 program provides
 funding to establish parent resource centers that help parents learn how to help their children
 meet high standards. The centers provide training, distribute resource materials, and support a
 variety of programs that strengthen family involvement in education. In fiscal year 1997,
 funding is available for support centers in 42 states, 14 more than in 1996.

 Promoting Parents as First Teachers. The President's America Reads Challenge, a campaign
 to ensure that every child can read well by the end of the third grade, includes Parents as First
 Teachers Challenge Grants to fund proven local, regional and national programs that provide
 assistance to parents to help their children become successful readers. The grants can be used to
 expand successful programs such as the Home Instruction Program for Preschool Youngsters
 (HIPPY) and the Parents as First Teachers (PAT) program. They will also fund national and
 regional networks to share information on how parents can help children to read.

 Supported Over 90% 0/ all Children's Research. In fiscal year 1995, the federal government
 spent an estimated $2 billion on research and development directly related to children and youth.
   Spending at The National Institutes of Health (NIH) alone increased 25% between 1993 and
 1997. This research has contributed to the recent advances in understanding early learning and
 language development.
 Maintained the Commitment to the Medicaid Guarantee/or 10 Million Children Under 6

Years Old. This Administration has protected and, preserved -- and now will improve on -- the
guarantee of Medicaid coverage for 36 million Americans, including 9 million children under the
age of 6. In 1995, the President vetoed the Republican Medicaid block grant proposal that would
have ended the guarantee of coverage for up to 4 million children by 2002. At the same time,
the President worked with states by granting IS comprehensive Medicaid waivers and approving
many more state plan amendments that improve and expand coverage for children.

Seeks to Extend Health Coverage to Up to 5 Million Children. Although this Administration
has made great strides in protecting the health of America's neediest children, there is still much
to be done. In 1995, more than 10 million American children, 80% of whom have working
parents, had no health insurance. The President's budget takes three important steps to address.
the problem of children who lack health insurance coverage:
I)      Provides annual grants to states to cover health insurance premiums for families of
        workers who are in-between jobs;
2)      Utilizes state partnership grants to help working families who are not eligible for
        Medicaid to purchase private insurance for their children; and
3)      Expands Medicaid coverage by allowing states to continue Medicaid coverage for up to
        one year even iffamily income changes, intensifying outreach to children who are
        currently eligible but not enrolled, and continuing current law expansions of coverage to
        reach poor children between the ages of 13 and 18.

Increased Child Care Funding. Since 1993 federal funding for child care has increased by 22%,
providing quality services for over 660,000 children of whom 65% are under 5 years of age.
The newly established Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) has made available $2.9
billion to states. This new program, authorized by the new welfare law, will assist low-income
families and those coming off welfare to obtain child care so they can work or attend school.

Eliminating Childhood Lead Poisoning. The Administration has launched a major new effort
to eliminate childhood lead poisoning. The campaign includes notification and disclosure to
parents who buy or lease older homes so that they get the information they need to protect their
children, grants to states to control lead-based paint hazards in low-income privately-owned
dwellings, development of a consensus on lead safety standards, and technical assistance to
ensure that lead hazard control work is done safely and efficiently.
