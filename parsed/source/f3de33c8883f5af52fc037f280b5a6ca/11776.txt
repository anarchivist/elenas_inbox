                                   PATIENTS BILL OF RIGHTS
                                        March 17, 1999


    Q:   What is the President's response to the Patients' Bill of Rights legislation that will
         be marked up by the Senate Labor Committee this Wednesday?

    A:   Today represents the first test of this new Congress to see ifit is serious about patient
         protections. The President is urging that the Committee take the steps it needs to take to
         pass this test.

         Unfortunately, while we have not seen the details of the legislation Senator Jeffords
         intends to mark up today, all indications are that it will fall far short of passing the test of
         seriousness when it comes to meeting the needs of patients in a rapidly changing health
         care system. We understand that the Chairman's plan:

         1. leaves tens of millions of Americans without protections because they will not be
         covered by the legislation;

         2. does not have a standard to prevent HMOs from making arbitrary coverage decisions;
         and

         3. has a wholly inadequate mechanism for enforcing patients' rights.

         This helps explains why every major patient, doctor, and nurse advocacy organization has
         concluded that Chairman Jeffords' proposal is flawed and will not adequately protect
         patients.

         Senator Kennedy and the rest of the Committee Democrats are planning on offering
         amendments that, if passed, would make this legislation acceptable to the President
         by addressing these issues. It is our hope that Senator Jeffords and the rest of the
         Committee will work toward passing a strong, comprehensive, and bipartisan Patients
         Bill of Rights that the President can sign.
