TEXT:
1.  Immigration.  Things were a little crazy today so I didn't get to call
you about immigration.  I do need to tell Rob Malley ASAP whether we think
we should meet with the outside groups on the suspension of deportation
issue. My inclination is that we should meet with them, but only if we
can be sure that they know we are there in a listening capacity only, and
will not be commenting on potential changes to Administration policy.   Rob
thought this would be possible.

2.   Crime meeting. We are changing the meeting time again.   Can yo~ let
me know if you are available at 10:30am on Thursday?  (I thought Laura
said you were, but she left before I could confirm this and re-send the
meeting notice.)

THANKS!
