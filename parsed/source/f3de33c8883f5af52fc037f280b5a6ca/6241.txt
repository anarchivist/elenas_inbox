TEXT:
States would like to talk tobacco next week--specificallly, they'd like to
understand our policy (how is tis the same/different from AG agreement,
etc) and to talk about what they feel they will need to do at NGA and how
we can survive that.  Seems to me its in our best interest to have this
conversation.  Elena--are you up for this? I'd like to set it up for early
next week. Thanks.
