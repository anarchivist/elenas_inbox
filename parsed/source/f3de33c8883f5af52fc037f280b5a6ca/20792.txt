TEXT:
1. Re the language that DOL was so concerned that Treasury had dropped:
Treasury dropped it because they thought DOL would like it better that
way.  I'm triple-checking this, but it appears they would be happy to add
it back in if that's what DOL wants.

2. Arnold & Porter is tentatively Monday morning at lOam, Don Lubick's
office, room 1000 of main Treasury. Bill Marshall says he can attend.
