     TEXT:
     Attached are draft responses to 3 tobacco farmer letters:   (1) one from
     Senator Edwards that concerns recoupment from the states' settlement; (2)
     one from Senator Robb that concerns the federal legislation and obtaining
     two internal DOJ documents on our right to sue; and (3) one from Reps.
     Boucher, Jenkins, and Hilleary that concerns federal legislation. These
     letters have been reviewed by DOJ, OMB, Cynthia, and Tom, and have been
     approved by Elena. The only outstanding question is whether these letters
     should come from the President or someone else (like Bruce) .   Legis
     Affairs didn't think these letters required a Presidential response.     I
     will fax over copies of the original letters as well.  Let me know, Mary ==========

Dear Senator Edwards,

       Thank you for your thoughtful letter expressing concern about the future of tobacco
fanners in this country. As you know, I have made protecting tobacco fanners and their
communities one of the key components of my Administration's policy to reduce youth smoking.
 While we must work to reduce youth smoking, we also must ensure that we protect tobacco
fanners and their communities.

        I agree that any recoupment from the state settlements should take into account effects on
tobacco farmers. My Administration has proposed an approach that gives states flexibility and
discretion over how these funds will be spent. Specifically, we have proposed that states keep
100 percent of the tobacco settlement funds in exchange for a commitment to use a portion of the
proceeds to reduce youth smoking, protect tobacco farmers, improve public health, and assist
children. We look forward to crafting legislation with the states, members of Congress, and
with representatives of tobacco farmers. Without such legislation, not a single penny of tobacco
settlement funds would have to be used to reduce youth smoking.

       It is possible to protect tobacco farmers and their communities, at the same time that we
dramatically reduce youth smoking. I am confident that we will be able to reach agreement on
recoupment. I look forward to working with you on this important issue.


                                     Sincerely,
                                                                          Hex.()ump Conversion

Dear Representative Boucher,

       Thank you for your thoughtful letter expressing concern about the future oftobacco
fanners in this country, particularly small fanners. As you know, I have made protecting tobacco
farmers and their communities one ofthe key components of my Administration's policy to
reduce youth smoking. While we must work to reduce youth smoking, we also must ensure that
we protect tobacco fanners and their communities.

         I agree that tobacco fanners and their communities must be protected from the effects of
all tobacco litigation. As was done in the settlement with the state attorneys general, I believe
that in connection with any judgment or settlement of Federal claims there should be established
a fund to protect them from the unintended consequences of that lawsuit. I am committing my
Administration, as any Federal litigation proceeds to judgment or settlement, that we will make
sure that adequate funds are set aside by legislation to ensure the financial security of tobacco
farmers and their communities. We would of course develop this legislation in close
consultation with you and other members of Congress, and with representatives of tobacco
farmers, their families, and communities.

       It is possible to protect small tobacco fanners and their communities, at the same time
that we dramatically reduce youth smoking. I am confident that we will be able to reach
agreement with respect to any judgments or settlements of federal claims. I look forward to
working with you on this important issue.


                                     Sincerely,
                                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion
