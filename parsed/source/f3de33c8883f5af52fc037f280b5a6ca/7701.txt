TEXT:
In addition ot the procedural surprise tonight, we have a few other things
going on with farmers.

1. The farmers and health groups are having a noon press conference to
counter Lugar/McConell tomorrow.  The theme is farmers vs. companies
Ford's bill helps farmers, Lugar's helps the companies at $1 billion a
year.

2.  Ford was planning on working the floor himself tomorrow with our
letter and one from the health groups.

3. USDA has been doing a count of D's, tonight they mostly got uncertain
answers. We are working with Jacoby on this.  Ford had votes he felt
confident on, but was hoping to get all D's.

4. Lugar/McConnell didn't seem confident of their votes during the press
conference today. Their main argument for the bill was to say the money
got to farmers quicker so it was actully more "real" money than Ford.

5. Glickman is going to make calls (from Geneva) to key Ag. Senators
Tuesday -- we've given him a short list.
