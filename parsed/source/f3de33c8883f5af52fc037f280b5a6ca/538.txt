Reminder:
There will be an interagency meeting tomorrow (Tuesday) from 12-2 in Room 180 to
open a discussion on Senator Craig's public lands bill. The purpose of this
meeting is to give everyone a chance to get background on this bill before the
Congressional Session begins in earnest.
I expect that Katie McGinty will open the meeting, USDA and DOI will give
presentations on the bill, what is driving its consideration, etc. There will
be some time for questions and discussion.
This is NOT a meeting to decide the Administration's strategy on the bill.
