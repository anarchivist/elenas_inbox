EK:

Spoke to Jim Dobbins at NSC on the status of the proposed SWB process. He
said McCaffrey told Chuck Ruff that he would not agree to cede any
authority to the NSC on this issue, and that he fully intended to go
through with his process.  Nonetheless, Jim Dobbins is scheduled to meet
with him today, and will try and see if he can get McCaffrey to
reconsider.  If not, it looks like will be revisiting this at the end of
McCaffrey's process.

I'll let you know if I here anything else. You may want to check-in
w/Chuck and see if he has any additional thoughts on this.

Jose'
