MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:

SUBJECT:                   Executive Order to Protect Children from Environmental
                           Health Risks and Safety Risks

ACTION FORCING EVENT

       We are presenting for your decision an Executive order that seeks to heighten
substantially the protection of children from safety risks and risks in the environment.
This executive order will build on your commitment and the First Lady's commitment to
protecting children. This policy announcement would add substantially to the
upcoming Conference on the Brain.

BACKGROUND

         There is a growing body of evidence that demonstrates that children face a
disproportionate risk from their environment, and federal policy does not account for
this risk. Children's disproportionate risks stem from several fundamental differences
between children and adults. Children are still developing, and are neurologically and
immunologically more susceptible to certain risks. Children eat, drink and breathe
more for their weight, exposing them to greater amounts of contamination and pollution
for their weight. Children are less able to protect themselves by use of judgment and
skill (e.g. navigating traffic, reading and following warnings).

        Concurrent with this new scientific understanding of mechanisms that make
children more vulnerable, scientists have documented an alarming increase in the
incidence of certain diseases in children which can not be explained with current
scientific knowledge.
·       The incidence of childhood cancer is going up at the alarming rate of 19.6% per
        generation, almost 1% per year. Nearly all of this increase is accounted for by
        leukemia and nervous system tumors. While treatment may be possible,
        particularly for leukemia, treatments (radiation and chemotherapy) are traumatic
       and life-defining experiences for children and families.
·      The severity of childhood asthma has increased substantially in the last decade,
       and the mortality has increased 118% percent since 1985. Approximately 10%
       of hospital care for children is for asthma.
·      Accidents are the leading cause of death for non-infant children and teenagers.
                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion

       Transportation accidents alone caused over 9,000 children's deaths and 975,000
       children to be injured in 1995. (These figures are for those under age 20.)

       While there has been a leap in scientific recognition of these issues, federal
policy has been inconsistent in accounting for new information about children. Some
agencies are responding vigorously to the challenge posed by the new science--taking
action to protect children's heath in the new Food Quality Protection Act, accounting for
children in the development of new standards for passive restraints in cars, and taking
administrative action to protect children from tobacco, lead, and other hazards. While
there have been successes, there is no overall, coordinated approach to children's
issues that highlights their priority, coordinates federal research or ensures that federal
regulations consistently account for disproportionate risks to children.

       The proposed Children's Executive Order seeks to fill those gaps with provisions
on policy, research coordination and federal regulatory decision making.

          Policy: The Children's Executive Order requires all agencies to make the
protection of children a high priority in implementing their statutory responsibilities and
fulfilling their overall missions.

       Research Coordination: The Children's Executive Order creates an interagency
Task Force with responsibility to establish a coordinated research agenda, to identify
actions the Administration will take to advance the protection of children's
environmental health and safety, and to reach out to the public.

       Federal Regulatory Analysis: The Children's Executive Order would, for the first
time, require agencies to analyze and explain the effects of their rules on children. The
primary goal of this provision is to link policy decisions to the emerging science
regarding children's environmental health and safety. This provision also ensures
accountability to the public and helps agencies to identify their research needs.

DISCUSSION AND RECOMMENDATION

      All agencies and White House offices support the Executive Order, however
some have raised concerns regarding the wisdom of including the provisions regarding
Federal Regulatory Analysis.

Option 1: The Executive Order should include the provisions requiring federal regulatory
analysis.

       There is substantial bipartisan support for requiring special regulatory analysis
with respect to children. The last Congress unanimously passed the Food Quality
Protection Act and the Safe Drinking Water Act, both of which require heightened
analysis to protect children. This provision will build on the public and bipartisan
congressional support for filling the gap in federal policy with respect to children.
                                                                Hi                 Management System
                                                                 ex-Dump Conversion

       The key conclusions of the National Academy of Sciences and the interagency
report Investing in our Children (attached) are that the federal government needs to
better support research in this area, and needs to strengthen the link between the
science regarding children and policy decisions. This requirement to analyze and
explain the impacts of federal actions supports both of these goals. First, a
requirement to analyze effects on children is likely to identify the most important
investments agencies need to answer these basic questions. Second, the analytical
requirement will ensure that agencies explicitly consider the emerging science
regarding children when making regulatory decisions.

       This requirement could also yield cases in which the federal government will be
forced to acknowledge that we do not know enough to analyze or explain the effects of
our actions on children. The question of whether this is a wise requirement is primarily
a philosophical one. Those.in favor of the requirement argue that the government has
the responsibility to be open about its shortcomings and to give the public information
even if it may be used to hold government accountable for its actions.

        This requirement will not lead agencies always to impose the most stringent
regulatory option. First, agencies are constrained to consider factors established
within their own statutory framework, which often require findings related to cost and
feasibility. Second, data may suggest different approaches that account for children's
vulnerabilities that are not more stringent (like warning parents not to seat children in
front of air bags, or depowering air bags). This analytical requirement simply brings
agencies' consideration of children on par with other important policies that agencies
are required to analyze separately--like costs, benefits, and effects on small business.

Agencies supporting this view include: [[EPA, DPC, CEQ, OMS and NEC.]]

Option 2: Do not include the provisions requiring federal regulatory analysis.

       There is a danger that this provision will be criticized as a back-door way to
tighten all federal environmental and safety standards, and will contribute to
accusations that the Administration does not account for the costs to industry of its
actions.

       This requirement will make it difficult for agencies to make reasoned decisions
that balance the protection of children with other important policy goals. The emotional
power of accusing an agency of failing to protect children counsels caution in moving
forward. The requirement to compare the effectiveness of the options at protecting
children will, in effect, create an untenable choice between admitting that a regulation
does not fully protect children or choosing an option that may not support other
important policy goals--like imposing only reasonable costs, protecting other
populations, and maximizing efficiency and flexibility.

Agencies supporting this view include:
