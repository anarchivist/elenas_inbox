  TEXT:
  Shortly, you should be receiving a Department of Justice draft bill for review.
  Comments are due by 5:30 p.m. today.
  The Justice draft bill would amend the Child Support Recovery Act to make it a
  felony offense for a person who willfully fails to pay child support to a child
  in another state if there has been an egregious failure to meet these
  obligations. The draft bill was prepared in response to a July 21st
  Presidential memorandum to Attorney General Reno that directed the Department to
  draft this legislation.
  Justice plans to transmit the draft bill as soon as possible tomorrow morning.
  We appreciate your expedited review.
