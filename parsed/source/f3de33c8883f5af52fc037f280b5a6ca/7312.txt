I understand that you are doing remarks for Monday's minority tobacco
event. We wanted to make sure the President includes the impact on
American Indians and Alaska Natives in his remarks. This is one of four
subgroups referred to throughout the Surgeon General's report.
FYI -- there will be a number of Tribal Leaders at the event. Thanks
