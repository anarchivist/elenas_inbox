I incorporated the changes Ann Lewis wanted and made a few more.  I think
we need to recirculate internally even though there were no substantive


 changes made.   We're looking at monday to get this out.

 Kate, can you put Ann and Toiv on the circulation list?    I'll run it by
 Larry.

Draft:June19,1998

Honorable Trent Lott

Honorable Tom Daschle

Honorable Newt Gingrich

Honorable Richard Gephart

Dear:

        As you know, there have been a number of recent tragedies across the country that
involve hate crimes. Last week, for example, a man in Jasper, Texas was killed after being
dragged behind a truck. While this shocking event serves to focus America's attention on the
problem of hate crimes, too many of our fellow citizens are subjected to some kind of violence
on account of their race, color, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, gender, or
disability.

        Whether it is the gay American murdered as he walked home from work or the Jewish
American whose house of worship was desecrated by swastikas, these acts are not acts of bias
and bigotry -- they are crimes. They strike at the heart of what it means to be an American.
They are the antithesis of the values that define us as a Nation and I know that most Americans
find these acts abhorrent. That is why I believe now is the time for us to take strong and
decisive action to fight these hate crimes and to put a stop to this intolerance.

         I am writing you today to restate my deeply-held belief that the Congress must act quickly
this year to pass the Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 1998. This crucial legislation would
expand the ability of the Justice Department to prosecute hate crimes by removing needless
jurisdictional requirements for existing crimes and by giving federal prosecutors the power to
prosecute hate crimes committed because of bias against a person's sexual orientation, gender, or
disability.

        There is nothing more important to the future of this country than attacking the
divisive issue of intolerance, prejudice, and violent bigotry. This legislation will lead the
way in making sure people feel more safe and secure in our country, whatever their race,
color, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, gender, ~r disability. I implore you to
move this vital piece of legislation through Congress without delay.


                                      Sincerely,




cc: Hatch, Leahy, Hyde, Conyers
