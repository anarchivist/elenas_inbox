RE: New Department of Labor Regulations


In this week's radio address, you are currently scheduled to announce the release of a new
Department of Labor (DOL) regulation that will require all self-insured health plans, which
cover over 50 million Americans, to provide a standard internal appeals process for enrollees.
This action builds on the series of initiatives Federal agencies have taken in response to your
Executive Memorandum that instructed all Federal health plans to come into compliance with the
Quality Commission's Patients' Bill of Rights. Because DOL can do no more than require an
appeals process, your announcement underscores the need for Congress to pass a strong,
enforceable Patient's Bill of Rights.

Background on Executive Action on Patients' Bill of Rights

Over the past few months, you have made a number of announcements to bring Federal health
plans, which serve 85 million Americans, into compliance with the Patients' Bill of Rights
consistent with your directive. In June, in response to your Executive Memorandum, the
Department of Health and Human Services released new regulations to bring Medicare into
compliance and will implement similar regulations for Medicaid in late September or October.
In July, you announced that the Department of Veterans' Affairs began to put in place a new,
rapid, extemal appeals process for its 3 million beneficiaries. In August, you announced that the
Department of Defense issued a memorandum directing all military health plans, which serve 8
million Americans, to come into compliance with the Patients' Bill of Rights. At your Kentucky
rally you announced a new regulation prohibiting "gag" clauses for plans participating in the
Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP), which serves 9 million federal employees
and their dependents. Office of Personnel Management will take other steps to bring FEHBP
into virtual compliance by late September.

The Department of Labor has the responsibility and authority to regulate self-insured plans.
These plans, generally provided by finns of over 100 employees, have elected to self-insure to
avoid state regulations and premiums and to have more flexibility to design health plans for their
employees. The Department of Labor has extremely limited authority to bring these health
plans into compliance with the Patients' Bill of Rights. They cannot require plans to provide for
most consumer protections outlined in the Patients' Bill of Rights, such as access to specialists,
emergency care protections, or an external appeals mechanism. Moreover, current law prevents
DOL from implementing Federal enforcement authority for all these rights. However, because
DOL has specific authority under ERISA to regulate how plans evaluate claims, they can require
all health plans to provide an internal appeals process and basic infonnation about these plans to
all served employees.
                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion
Department of Labor Internal Appeals Regulations

The DOL regulation you are scheduled to announce would: First, make sure that enrollees know
of their appeals' rights under the plan and how to access them; second, the regulation drastically
reduces the time that plans must respond to non-emergency appeals (from 90 days to 15 days)
and includes a 72 -hour deadline for emergency claims; third, it gives enrollees greater access to
documents used in reviewing their claims; finally, ifthe plan wants to terminate or reduce
benefits for an enrollee in urgent circumstances they must allow for a full appeals process
before any termination is executed

Expected Reaction to This Regulation

Ironically, the business community can be expected to be generally supportive of the regulation
since they believe the existence and application of this authority bolsters their claim that Federal
legislation is not needed. precludes the necessity for Federal legislation. They have consistently
opposed Federal legislation for the Patients' Bill of Rights and believe that DOL's regulatory
authority in this area is more than adequate. However, it is evident that DOL's authority falls far
short of addressing the consumer protections that Americans need as outlined earlier.

Consumer groups believe this regulation is long overdue and will give patients must needed
protections to address grievances with their health plans. They will be nervous about this
regulation only to the extent that it strengthens the business community's argument that federal
legislation is unnecessary. They will want to make certain that we clearly articulate the
limitations of our authority in this area and continue to strongly advocate a strong, enforceable
Patients' Bill of Rights.

Conclusion

As such, in releasing this regulation, you will be underscoring two important points. First, you
continue to be committed to taking all the action under your administrative authority to bring
every federal health plan into compliance with the Patients' Bill of Rights. Second, by
illustrating the limits of administrative actions, you will be highlighting the need for Federal
legislation to ensure that all Americans have the protections they need.
