TEXT:
I asked Karl Scholz, the DAS in Treasury who is overseeing the IRS work
for FLSA, about the timing of their work.   He said he will get me a hard
estimate of when the IRS will be ready on Monday. But he complained that
we are expecting too rapid a turnaround, said that DOL had 6 months to
ponder their position, said he had tried in vain to alert folks here
 (Elena and Ken) a few months ago that Treasury needed to get involved, and
that he suspects the IRS won't be ready with paper next week.   He said
they do understand that this is a very high priority.

We agreed that rather than duking it out about a theoretical timeline, he
would first get us a realistic timeline and then we could fight about it
if we want to.

So not an encouraging start, but let's see what he says on Monday.
