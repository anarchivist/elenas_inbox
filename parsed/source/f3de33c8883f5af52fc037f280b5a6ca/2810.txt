                      PRESENT ATION OF THE CLONING REPORT

                              DATE:          June 9, 1997
                              LOCATION:      Rosegarden
                              BRIEFING TIME: 11 :00 am - 11 :30 am
                              EVENT TIME:    11:30 am - 12:10 am
                              FROM:          Bruce Reed

I.     PURPOSE

       To receive the National Bioethics Advisory Commission (NBAC) report on the possible
       cloning of human beings, and to announce your response to the NBAC recomendations.

II.    BACKGROUND

       In February, following reports of the first successful cloning of an adult sheep, you asked
       NBAC to review the profound ethical issues raised by the possible cloning of human beings.
       At this event, Dr. Harold Shapiro, the Chair of the Commission and President of Princeton
       University, will formally present you with their report.

       The NBAC report makes three key recommendations: (I) Legislation to prohibit for 5 years
       the use of somatic cell nuclear transfer to create a human being, (2) Keep in effect a
       moratorium on the use of the "somatic cell nuclear transfer" cloning technique in humans. [n a
       unanimous vote, NBAC concluded that it is morally unacceptable to create a child by using
       technology that created Dolly the sheep, and (3) Finding that the new technology may have
       agricultural and medical benefits, NBAC recommends that the cloniing of DNA, cells, tissues,
       and animals unsing somatic cell nuclear transfer and other cloning techniques is not ethically
       problematic and should not be banned.

       You will be making the following announcements to respond to the NBAC recommendations:
       ·      Propose legislation banning the use of the new technology to clone human beings, and
              consistent with NBAC's recommendation, prohibit for 5 years the use osomatic cell
              nuclear transfer to create a human being without interfering with the beneficial
              biomedical and agricultural uses of the technology. The legislation also directs
              NBAC to report back in 4/1/2years on whether to continue the ban.
       ·      Continue to keep in effect the moratorium you put in place in March so that no federal
              funds will be used to clone human beings,
       ·      Urge privately-funded scientists and clinicians to adhere to the voluntary
                      moratorium you called for in March.
