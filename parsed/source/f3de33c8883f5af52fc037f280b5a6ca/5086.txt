TEXT:
I called Ray Uhalde to tell him we want to delay the DOL reg until Nov.
17th. He's gone home for the night and won't be in ~omorrow.     I started
to think about how the normal process (reviewing changes, arguing about
targeting) will take a day or two, forcing us to miss the Monday deadline
anyway ... at which point we could say "let's hold until the 17th." A
little underhanded, but it might help us get what we want.
