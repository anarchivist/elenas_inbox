We haven't released how much money is in the budget for food safety but I
think its worth saying its going to increase "substantially." The last
number I heard was an increase of approximately $100 million.==================== AT

Q:   What steps will the Clinton Administration take to improve food safety?

A:   Last year we were able to increase spending on food safety by approximately $40 million.
      This year, our budget will seek an even more substantial increase in resources to
     improve food safety. The resources will go to a variety of initiatives, including:
     implementing our aggressive fresh produce plan to hire FDA inspectors to improve the
     safety of our nation's fruits and vegetables, both domestic and imported; increasing the
     risk assessment on beef, chicken and pork to better determine the source of the greatest
     risk of contamination; developing more tests for meat and poultry for federal inspectors
     and others to detect food-borne illnesses; improve educational outreach on proper food
     handling; and expanding CDC's surveillance activities for food-borne illnesses.


Q:   Why is your Administration proposing these actions?

A:   We have the ability to help Americans stay healthier and increase their confidence in the
     safety of the food they eat. We also need to keep up with the changes in the agricultural
     marketplace, and in our diets. For instance, there have been dramatic changes in the
     produce department of the grocery store. Thirty years ago, most produce sections only
     had around a dozen items year round, increasing to as many as 50 in the summer. Today,
     the chances are that there are 400 or more items in the produce section and they are there
     all year round. Last year, 38 percent of the fruit and 12 percent of the vegetables
     Americans ate were imported.

     We have changed as well. Americans are eating more fresh fruits and vegetables than
     ever before, and our nation's health experts tell us we will live longer, better quality lives
     as a result. Our environment is also changing. We are finding "new" exotic bugs such
     as cyclospora and E. coli 015 7:H7 on our food that once were not there.

     We must ensure that these changes do not increase the risk to consumers of food borne
     illnesses.


Q.   Is this a new issue for the Administration?

A.   No, our actions are part of a continuing effort that has seen real accomplishment every
     year:

*       October, 1997. President announces new initiative to enhance FDA oversight
over imported foods and to develop guidance on good agricultural and manufacturing
practices for fruits and vegetables; to seek legislation to give FDA the same authority that
USDA has to inspect imports; and to seek funds to greatly expand FDA's inspection
force.

*      January, 1997. Administration announces comprehensive new initiative to
improve the safety of nation's food supply detailing a $43 million food safety program,
including measures to improve surveillance, outbreak response, education, and research.

*       August, 1996. President signs Safe Drinking Water Act of 1996. The law
requires drinking water systems to protect against dangerous contaminants like
cryptosporidium, and gives people the right to know about contaminants in their tap
water.

streamlines regulation of pesticides by FDA and EPA and puts important new
public-health protections in place, especially for children.

*       July, 1996. President Clinton announces new regulations that modernize the
nation's meat and poultry inspection system for the first time in 90 years. New standards
help prevent E.coli bacteria contamination in meat.

Utilizes HACCP regulatory programs to require food industries to design and implement
preventive measures and increase the industries' responsibility for and control of their
safety assurance actions.

*      1994. CDC embarks on strategic program to detect, prevent, and control
emerging infectious disease threats, some of which are food borne, making significant
progress toward this goal in each successive year.
