     ANNOUNCEMENT OF FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION AND DEPARTMENT OF
        JUSTICE STUDY ON THE MARKETING OF VIOLENCE TO CHILDREN

                               DATE:                          Tuesday, June 1, 1999
                               LOCATION:                      Rose Garden
                               BRIEFING TIME:                 11 :OOam - 11 :25am
                               EVENT TIME:                    11:30am-12:15pm
                               FROM:                          Bruce Reed


I.      PURPOSE

        To announce that the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice will
        conduct a joint study of the marketing practices of entertainment industries to determine
        whether these industries are marketing to children violent and other material that is rated
        for adults.

II.     BACKGROUND

        As part of your continuing efforts to reduce youth violence, you will announce today that
        the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice will conduct a joint study of
        the marketing practices of entertainment industries to determine whether these industries
        are marketing to children violent and other material that is rated for adults. You will also
        challenge retailers to enforce age restrictions on adult-oriented media, so that
        inappropriate material is kept out of the hands of children.

        Helping Parents to Make the Right Choices for Their Children. Numerous studies
        have shown that violent programming increases children's aggression toward others and
        desensitizes them to violence. If and to the extent that the video game, movie, and
        recording industries market to children violent and other materials that are rated for
        adults, they undermine current content-based ratings systems, make it harder for parents
        to control the movies, music and games their children see, and increase the likelihood of
        children being exposed to inappropriate materials. Therfore, you will announce today
        that the Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice will conduct a study to
        determine whether and how the video game, motion picture, and recording industries
        market to children violent and other material rated for adults. The study will examine,
        among other matters, whether sectors of these industries advertise violent material rated
        for adults in media outlets in which children comprise a substantial percentage of the
                                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion


       audience or whether they otherwise use marketing practices designed to attract children to
       violent material. The study also will examine whether these industries have adopted
       procedures restricting the sale of products rated for adults to children and the extent to
       which these procedures are effective in ensuring that children do not have access to adult-
       oriented material.

       Challenging Entertainment Industry Distributors to Enforce Ratings. A key to
       shielding children from exposure to excessively violent media is to halt their access to
       these products at the point of sale. Too many children can purchase or rent violent video
       games and films intended for adults from retailers who do not check identifications. In
       fact, according to a study conducted last year, only nine percent of retail stores that rent
       video games refused to rent to minors games that are rated as suitable only for adults. As
       part of an effort to address this issue, the Washington State Retail Association and the
       Interactive Digital Software Association are working together to create a point-of-sale
       system that will notify and remind clerks to ask for identification from buyers. Because
       you have argued that it is wrong to sell or rent the most violent video games and movies
       to children without their parents' approval, you will challenge the nation's retailers today
       to follow the lead of those in Washington State and enforce the ratings systems when they
       sell or rent any adult-rated material to children.

       Event Participants:
       The First Lady
       Attorney General Janet Reno
       Federal Trade Commission Chairman Robert Pitofsky
       Arthur Sawe
              Arthur is a nine-year-old, lh grade student from Seattle, WA. Last year. at the
              age of eight, Arthur bought a video game magazine in the hopes of learning about
              new video games on the market. He was so disturbed by the violent ads in the
              magazine he took it to his mother, concerned that it was not appropriate for him
              to have it. Arthur's mother, Caroline, agreed with Arthur and contacted Mothers
              Against Violence in America. Arthur's concerns inspired a Seattle Times
              editorial, which led to legislative proposals in Washington and the voluntary
              pledge by the Washington Retailers Association to push for enforcement of the
              video game ratings.
                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion
