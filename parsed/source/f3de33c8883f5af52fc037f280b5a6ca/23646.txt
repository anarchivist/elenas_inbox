TEXT:
I didn't call her for this purpose, but I gave Kit Seelye a hard time
about her story today.   She was talking before I even had a chance about
how irritated hse was with her story being cut in half without her being
consulted.   She said she had a lot more in there about what we've done on
this issue as well as a number of interesting quotes from him that were
knocked out.   So I don't know if our complaint is necessarily with her
personally.
