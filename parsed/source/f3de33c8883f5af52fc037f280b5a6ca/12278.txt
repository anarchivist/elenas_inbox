TEXT:
We had discussed more than two weeks ago DPC preparing an options memo for
president on what the exec order on racial profiling should look like,
understanding that all agencies and the vast majority of White House staff
recommend an executive order on data collection; however, President should
know that there is a vocal minority who would like something more than
data collection.  It appears that we're on a track to present the
President with a fait accompli on an executive order on data collection.
That's not what we had discussed.  Let's get the DPC/DOJ proposal into the
President in a way so that he has more than a few hours notice.
Especially since we've been pushing on another front to have the executive
order used as a message event in the near future.  What's your timetable?
