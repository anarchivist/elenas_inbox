 Mike and Elena--

 I spoke with Dawn about this again today.   She is satisfied that the
 analysis of ED and DOJ that the reducing/preventing/eliminating racial
 isolation aspect of the program meets the compelling interests test under
 Adarand is consistent with the way the Administration has approached
 similar issues, in light of the Magnet Schools program's statutory
 grounding and history. Therefore, she will be clearing this notice to go
 forward.

 The issue of how this applies in the 5th Circuit is not directly addressed
 by the notice and Dawn feels it isn't necessary to resolve that prior to
 allowing the notice to go out. She wants to let ED and DOJ sort this out
 some more before we weigh in.



Thanks.

-- Bill

Art Coleman in OCR called the other night to give us a heads-up about
this, which involves breaking some new legal ground.   Dawn Chirwa left me
a message Friday that she was reviewing the application. Do you have any
gut reactions/concerns on this issue? Art's summary of the issues and
status follows.  Thanks.

     Bill, it was good to talk with you last night, and as we discussed,
     I'm forwarding a recap of the overview of where the Department is re
     the magnet school application process.

     WHAT'S NEW

     The federal register notice announcing this cycle of grant


     applications (which occurs every three years) will for the first time
     include a discussion of strict scrutiny (compelling interest/narrow
     tailoring) standards that must be satisfied in the event that race is
     a factor in the admissions of the proposed grantees. This
requirement
     stems from the Adarand case. The last such notice, three years ago,
     pre-dated Adarand.

       In addition to the remedial and diversity interests that are
       identified as compelling, we are setting forth the interest of
       "reducing, preventing, or eliminating" minority group isolation as a
       compelling interest.  Based on desegregation law as well as specific
       language from the authorizing legislation, this represents a new
       position by the federal government.

       PROCESS

      We have been in conversations with the Department of Justice for
      months ·regarding these issues, and have complete agreement regarding
      the standards and application of those standards with civil Rights
      Division, OLC, and the Associate Atty General's office. We are
      awaiting a final word from the SG before proceeding with the
     publication of the notice. Our best read at this point is that the
      basics outlined above will be approved, with the question of whether
      this comprehensive standard will apply in the. Hopwood states.
      (Although the notice doesn't address this level of specificity, it's
      important that we see this the same way.   Thus far, there is
agreement
      in ED and DoJ that Hopwood, for a host of reasons, is distinguishable
      and would not control our analysis here.)    Also, the Department has
      discussed this, in general terms, with legal counsel in the WH--Dawn
      and Rob.   Dawn has a copy of the draft notice.   (If you want the
paper
      on this, let me know.)

       There is real urgency in getting closure around these issues, as we
       need to get the notices out so that the reviews and awards can be
made
       by mid-summer.  The Department has been criticized in the past
       regarding delays here, and all are working earnestly to ensure that
we
       build in enough time for the (increasingly) complex legal reviews of
       the applications that will be required.

       At the briefing with the Secretary yesterday,. he underscored his
       support for the positions we are taking, and urged expedition in our
       move forward.

       REACTION

       We can expect some critics to complain that any use of race in this
       context is unwarranted/uncalled for--in the post-Adarand/Hopwood
       world. We can certainly expect some reaction on the new point
       regarding the compelling interest of eliminating racial isolation.
       Some may also question the "new" strict scrutiny requirements.


       Don't hesitate to call any of the ususual suspects if you have
       additional questions or need more information.
