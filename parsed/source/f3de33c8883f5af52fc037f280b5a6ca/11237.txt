TEXT:
John is scheduled to speak to the Democratic Governors on Saturday. As
you can see from Fred's e-mail, in addition to providing a broad agenda
overview, John is supposed to speak specifically on tobacco recoupment.  I
need to provide John with talking points for the event by this evening
(2/18). Can you provide me with some appropriate points that John should
make on tobacco? Thanks very much. k

We would like John to do a more comprehensive opening - and specifically
include tobacco recoupment (which we do NOT want sec Shalala to do) - and
then calIon Riley for Education and then Shalala for other health care
topics (CHIP etc.)   The other WH participants would only be there to
answer questions.
