TEXT:
Hate to be the bearer of bad news, but the Uniform Division of the Secret
Service will be protesting outside the WH on June 17th. The FOP already
announced this on Bloomberg radio today. ·Gil Gallegos, the FOP President,
will be coming in town for the event.  I think we should talk about this
-- and we should definitely make sure not to do the vest bill signing on
t-he same day.
