The following are rema1n1ng Medicare concerns of the key senior groups
after the Senate Finance Committee Mark last night (in priority order) :

AARP:

l.   Premium Protections for low income seniors.    (AARP's Top Priority)
2.   Means Testing
3.   Balanced Billing Protection
4.   Raising Eligibility Age to 67
5.   Home Care Co-Pay
6.   Home Health Reallocation

Anticipating that the Congress will move quickly to complete work before
the July 4 recess, AARP reports they will move agressively during the next
two week, and their field organization will be doing phone-trees and
alerts. Their print ads will continue with the theme, "Keep the [Budget
Agreement] Promise."

National Committee to Preserve social Security and Medicare:

l.   Means Testing (National Comm's Top Priority)
2.   Seek to Eliminate MSA
3.   Balanced Billing Protection
4.   Premium Protections for low income seniors.

Means testing is the defining issue for the National Committee, and they
will oppose legisaltion that includes means testing. Their phone
operation will start on Friday, will target House leadership, and will
focus on means testing.

National Council of Senior Citizens (Labor)

l.   Means Testing (National Comm's Top Priority)
2.   Premium Protections for low income seniors.
3.   Seek to Eliminate MSA


National Council on Aging

l.   Premium Protections for low income seniors.
2.   Means Testing (National Comm's Top Priority)
3.   Raising Eligibility Age to 67
