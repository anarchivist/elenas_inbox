TEXT:
USDA and Secretary Glickman are wrestling with a difficult question they
will have to answer early next week and are interested in getting our
advice. The amount of quota (the amount farmers can grow) for next year
is to be announced December 15 by USDA, and at present the results will be
quite dramatic: about a 33% decline in quota.  Anywhere near that figure
is likely to be viewed as a catastrophe by farmers, who will also view the
Administration as having let them down.  In addition, Dallas Smith predic
ts such a quota cut may well lead farmers to vote to end the program.

The quota figure is set by three variables -- two of which the government
has no control over,  official company purchase intentions and an average
of exports over the last three years. The third variable is what is in the
government reserve stocks. At present, the stocks hold 265 million pounds
of flue cured tobacco, far above the 121 million pounds the quota formula
calls for.

The sales of these stocks would have to be made by December 15 to change
the quota level for next year.   Glickman has the right to discount the
sale of the stocks. The Flue-Cured Stabilization Board has proposed an 18
percent reduction in current list prices without any positive response
from industry.  In turn, the industry has requested a 25 percent discount
from current list prices.

If Glickman does approve a discount he is likely to be accused of selling
cheap tobacco to industry, saving them something on the order of $110
million.  If he does not approve the discount, farmers will complain that
the government has abandoned them, causing hardship despite the
opportunity to help via a program farmers are financially responsible for.

USDA staff argues discounting probably makes the best of a bad situation.
If that is the decision, it could be justified on the following grounds:
1. the companies are squeezing the farmers, driving prices ever lower and
hoping to cause an end of the program; 2.   If the companies are successful
and end the program, tobacco prices will plummet even further and there
will be no limits on the amount of tobacco grown; 3. Monies to be used
for the discount were paid by farmers through the no net cost account.
Alternatively, if the program ends, it is likely the taxpayers who will be
forced to cover the cost of selling the tobacco at a future deeper
discount.



OMB has also called me about this issue today.   I'll be getting some more
information over the next few days.
