TEXT:
There's an adoption issue headed Counsel's way (among others --
I'm in on this too a bit, as well as Bruce Reed, Jen and some
others). Chris Cerf used to handle the issue -- maybe you could
get into it if you're interested.  I can fill you in on the
background, though I'm not sure of the details right now.
Legislative (Janet Murghia) is pulling a meeting together for
later this week and I told her she should have someone from
Counsel's office and mentioned you -- but she'll just talk to Jack
or Kathy and let them assign someone, I'm sure.  tds
