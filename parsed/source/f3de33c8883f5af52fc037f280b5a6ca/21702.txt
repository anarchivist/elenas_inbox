    Part Human/Part Cow Stem Cell Research Update. Following troubling reports about
    research that produced an embryonic stem cell that is part human and part cow, we worked with
    OSTP and NIH to develop a recommendation to you for an appropriate, but strong response.
    As you know, this work concluded with your approval ofa letter to the Chair of the National
    Bioethics Advisory Commission, Dr. Harold Shapiro, which outlined your serious concerns
    about the most recent report. In the letter, you requested that the Commission analyze the
    implications of the human/non-human stem cell research during their previously scheduled
    meeting next week and to report back to you shortly thereafter. You also requested a
    comprehensive review of other, more promising types of stem cell research, which appear to
    have great treatment potential for illnesses such as cancer, diabetes and heart disease, "balancing
    all ethical and medical considerations." This latter request has implications as it relates to the
    Congress' current prohibition against any embryo research. Ifthe human-only stem cell research
    falls under this prohibition (as may well be likely), there will be growing pressure to develop a
    more carefully constructed and narrow prohibition from the research community (including NIH
    Director Varmus) and many patients' advocates. If you have an interest in moving in this
    direction, the Commission's findings and recommendations to your second request could well
    provide the ethical and scientific justification for a change in current law.
