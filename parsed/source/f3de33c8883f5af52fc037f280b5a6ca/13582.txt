TEXT:
If there is anything we want to establish for legislative history
in the signing statement, especially re waivers or any otber areas
where there is a policy question, we have the opportunity to do it
although the window will close before noon tomorrow. Maybe
Dellinger should be consulted on the waiver aspect?
(Bill not expected to be taken up until 10pm tonight; POTUS to
sign first thing in the am.  Signing statement need not be done at
the same time, but should go out fairly promptly thereafter.)
