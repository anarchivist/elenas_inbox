 TEXT:
 Elena, I need your call on this issue in the next day or two, if at all
 possible.

 HHS would like to release ASAP its interpretation of what the welfare law
 means when it says that "non-qualified aliens" are not eligible for
 "federal public benefits." It has taken them forever to get to this
 point, but now they are ready.  The pressure to get this out is that DOJ
 wants to issue its "interim verification guidelines" on how to interpret
 all the welfare law's benefit restrictions for immigrants. HHS is not the
 only agency affected by this, but it is the primary one, so other agencies
 are looking to HHS to take the lead. There has been no movement to have
 DOJ do a common definition.

 I think what HHS wants to do makes sense, but it does keep certain
 benefits open for illegal immigrants, so I need to flag that for you.     OMB
 has signed off on it.

 Welfare Law
 The question arises because the welfare reform bill states that "an alien
 who is not a qualified alien [for example, an illegal immigrant) is not
 eligible for any Federal public benefit        " The law defines "public
 benefit" to mean (among other things):

 "any retirement, welfare, health, disability, public or assisted housing,
 postsecondary education, food assistance, unemployment benefit, or any
 other similar benefit for which payments or assistance are provided to an
 individual, household or family eligibility units by an agency of the
 United States or by appropriated funds of the United States."

 The law specifies exceptions to this ineligibility for emergency Medicaid
 services, immunizations, treatment of communicable diseases and some other
 items.

 HHS' Interpretation Minimizes Administrative and Health Burden of the Term
 HHS' representatives said that they set about interpreting this language
 to minimize the administrative burden on the programs and the public
..
      health impact of the law.

      They said that the term "public benefit" as used in the law is ambiguous
      and requires interpretation. They get some help interpreting the term
      from Section 432, which requires the Attorney General to "promulgate
      regulations requiring verification that a person applying for a Federal
      public benefit ... is a qualified alien and is eligible to receive such
      benefit."    This implies that a "benefit" is something that requires an
      "application." And an application requires provision of information for
      the purpose of determining eligibility.

      Therefore, to minimize administrative burden, HHS thinks that no program
      that currently does not verify eligibility should begin doing so.  So
      programs that have no eligibility requirements, or which do not verify
      eligibility as a matter of course, are not "public benefits" for the
      purposes of welfare reform.

      HHS Programs That Aren't Public Benefits By This Definition
      Under this definition, Community Health Centers, the maternal/child health
      block grant, substance abuse grants, Administration on Aging, HUD homeless
      shelter assistance and some other aging programs would not be "public
      benefits" and would be available to non-qualified aliens.

      HHS Programs That Are Public Benefits By This Definition
      Other programs would clearly be "public benefits" under this definition,
      and denied to non-qualified aliens: TANF, Medicaid and Medicare, Indian
      Health Service programs,LIHEAP and Ryan White, among others.

      It does not appear that Labor or Do Ed programs would be affected by this
      definition. Housing is partially grandfathered by the law.
