TEXT:
After you had to leave our TANF rule meeting, Bruce raised whether the
distinction we're creating between workfare and other subsidized
employment might lead to a constitutional challenge to time limits that we
need to worry about -- i.e. person A in workfare has the clock ticking,
person B in subsidized employment does not,  so person A raises an equal
protection claim.
