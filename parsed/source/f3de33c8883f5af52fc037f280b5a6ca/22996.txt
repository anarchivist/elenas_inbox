Here's how we've responded to date to the "how can these be Medicaid
claims" question

A few additional facts that might be helpful:

The nation's leading expert on tobacco-related costs, Leonard S. Miller of
the University of California, estimated that tobacco cost Medicaid $13
billion in 1993 -- far less than the $8 billion a year the states settled
for.   (The article was published in the March/April 1998 Public Health
Reports and was cited by CBO in its tobacco analysis last year.   Miller is
the same expert the states relied upon to provide state estimates that
formed the basis of their settlement formula).

The states gave up both state and federal Medicaid claims in exchange for
the tobacco settlement funds -- the November settlement document releases
the tobacco companies from all claims that the states "directly,
indirectly, derivatively, or in any other capacity ever had, now have, or
hereafter can, shall or may have" against the tobacco companies -- which
includes Medicaid claims. Thus all states gave up their Medicaid claims
in exchange for the settlement funds they received.

The Medicaid statute (Title XIX of the Social Security Act) says:

The state plan must provide that "the State or local agency administering
such plan will take all reasonable measures to ascertain the legal
liability of third parties .... that in any case where such a legal
liability is found to exist after medical assistance has been made
available on behalf of the individual and where the amount of
reimbursement the state can reasonably expect to recover exceeds the costs
of such recovery, the state or local agency will seek reimbursement for


such assistance to the extent of such legal liability." (section
1925 (a) (25) of the Social Security Act)
"Expenditures for which payments were made to the state under subsection
(a) shall be treated as an overpayment to the extent that the state or
local agency administering such plan has been reimbursed for such
expenditures by a third party pursuant to the provisions of its plan in
compliance with section 1902 (a) (25) ."  (section 1903 (d) (2) (B) of the
Social Security Act)

                                 Tobacco and Medicaid in California
                                     February 22, 1999 POTUS


      Q:   How do you answer Governor Gray Davis's comments that California is not getting
           reimbursed at all for Medicaid costs because they took Medicaid out of their suit?

      A:   Both the Justice Department and HHS have analyzed the issue of tobacco recoupment
           carefully and concluded that the settlement is for Medicaid claims.

           First, states have an obligation under Medicaid law to pursue funds owed to the Medicaid
           program. Thus, states that sued for tobacco-related health costs should have included
           tobacco-related Medicaid claims in their suits -- as all or almost all did. Moreover, states
           cannot sue only for state Medicaid costs; they are obliged by Medicaid law to sue for the
           federal costs at the same time. Since the federal government pays on average 57 percent
           of Medicaid claims, the states are obliged to share those recoveries with the federal
           government.

           Second, the states gave up both state and federal Medicaid claims in exchange for the
           tobacco settlement funds. For example, the November 1998 settlement document
           releases the tobacco companies from all claims that the states "directly, indirectly,
           derivatively, or in any other capacity ever had, now have, or hereafter can, shall or may
           have" against the tobacco companies -- which includes Medicaid claims. Thus all states
           gave up their Medicaid claims in exchange for the settlement funds they received.
