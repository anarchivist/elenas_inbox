    TEXT:
    I have reviewed a recent draft of the EO that has been under development
    for several weeks.  I do not know the results of your meeting on Friday,
    but understand the process is moving along.  I will not be able to attend
    your Tuesday meeting either, but will be sure that Carrie or someone on
    our staff is present.

    I continue to support the overall objective of this proposed EO, but also
    continue to have difficulty with some of its specifics.   Let me mention
    three:

    Section 304 -- is the requirement more exhaustive than it need be? This
    asks agencies to identify and report "all data needs that have arisen".
    Can't we be more flexible and ask them to report in a more general way,
    such as to report "key data needs that have arisen", or some other phrase?
    Section 4 -- this sounds like it could be a massive database undertaking.
    Has anyone estimated how big it will be, how much it will cost, and who
    will be responsible for it? I worry, too, that it could be duplicative of
    other databases. This is described in very comprehensive terms, covering
    all federally-sponsored research in the area, as well as aiming to include
    private and academic research, and making it all available to the public.
    Section 501 -- do we want this worded the way it is? I will defer to
    Sally Katzen and OIRA, but this seems to be structured to imply that we
    are not choosing the. most protective alternatives, and therefore that we
    need to identify more protective alternatives and explain why we did not
    select them.    Couldn't we do this in a more positive manner, and perhaps
    cause less new work for the agencies, by directing that they explain how
    the proposed action provides appropriate protection for children and what
    alternatives were evaluated and why they were rejected.    This formulation
    is more positive and would allow agencies to explain that they rejected
    less strict alternatives, too.


     Section 603 -- Now that I see the substance of the prior EO, 12606, I do
     not think we should revoke it as part of this action.   I had supported
     that before on the understanding that this orie really did replace the old
     one, but it is clear from the details that E012606 is broader and covers a
     number of subjects related to families that are not dealt with in this new
     draft EO at all.
