TEXT:
I understand DOT may be putting in a request to have POTUS announce naming
of the Access to Jobs grants for Rosa Parks and Delores Huerta in the
SOTU, with them in the Gallery.  Presumably this would be packaged with
announcing proposal to fully fund the program (at $150 million authorized
level rather than the $75 million guaranteed funding level).
