Robert Pear just called.   He is doing an article on Medicaid and
where we are going to end up re savings and per capita cap/DSH
policy.   (Melissa S. told me last week that he was fishing around
the Department for info) .
He did not mention any savings number, nor even ask me to give him
one. However, he seems to be doing an article that focuses on the
per capita cap issue and the negative response the Hill Democrats
and the advocates group have to reports that we are maintaining
our past policy.   I said I could neither confirm or deny that was
the case.   I did say that our past policy had a combination of
savings from a per capita cap and DSH savings, and that we always
say that our next policy will start with a review of our last
budget. He said it did not matter because he has it on "good
authority from other Administration sources" that we are
maintaining our per cpaita cap proposal.


  He also was fishing for a story about how Donna Shalala was the.
  only Administration rep who opposed the per capita cap, but that
  her views were shoved aside by the White House.   I did not play
  into that game.
  I do not think there is anything we can do on this one.   In the
  end, it might not end up being so bad for us.   However, I thought
  I should give you all a heads up.  I am always concerned whenever
  Robert is about to write a story.
