TEXT:
FYI, industry plaintiffs have filed a (first, I'm sure) set of
interrogatories which, among other things, ask for the
identification of the "highest ranking officials" in the Executive
Office the President who are personaly and directly responsible
for implementing the provisions of the rescission bill relating to
the 318 sales.
There will be a general attempt to say the WH improperly or
inappropriately directed the agencies in their compliance with the
law. This is part of an overall ~trategy that ties into a
corresponding pounding from Congress.
Oral argument for the contempt motion has been set for .
Halloween!
Fun crowd!
