The Honorable Janice Lachance
Director, Office of Personnel Management
Theodore Roosevelt Federal Building
1900 E Street, N.W.
Washington, D.C. 20415

Dear Ms. Lachance:

        On May 28, 1998, the President issued Executive Order 13087. It amends Executive
Order 11478, regarding discrimination against federal employees. Federal law has long
prohibited discrimination for or against an employee or applicant based on "conduct which does
not adversely affect the performance of the employee or applicant or the performance of others."
5 U.S.C. 2302(b)(1O). OPM has interpreted this statute to prohibit discrimination based on
sexual orientation, and that has been the policy of this Administration from the outset. Most
federal agencies and departments have issued regulations or other directives to implement this
bar on discrimination. The new Executive Order is intended to restate and make uniform across
the Executive Branch the pre-existing policy prohibiting discrimination based on sexual
orientation in federal civilian employment. I am writing to provide guidance on the intent
behind this Order.


Definition of Sexual Orientation

      The President intends the term "sexual orientation"to have the common meaning stated in
the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, "homosexuality, bisexuality, or heterosexuality."

Responsibilities of Agencies

        The President intends that all agencies take appropriate actions, including the
development of policy statements and guidance for agency managers and other employees, in
order to carry out this order. OPM can playa useful role in providing guidance to agencies as to
how to implement the order.

        The purpose of Executive Order 13087 is to bar discrimination based on sexual
orientation by amending Section 1 of Executive Order 11478 to add sexual orientation to the
categories for which discrimination is already prohibited. Executive Order 13087 does not
authorize affirmative action policies, such as recruitment, reporting, or goal-setting based on
sexual orientation. Federal agencies are not to take steps to determine which employees or
prospective employees are homosexual, or how many homosexual or bisexual employees they
have hired.

     Procedures for Enforcing Prohibition

            The Executive Order does not create any rights to file a complaint with a court or with the
     EEOC. In addition, the Order does not authorize appeals of agency actions to the EEOC. The
     Order leaves intact the current procedures for dealing with such complaints. An employee who
     believes he or she has been discriminated against may seek redress under procedures now
     available within each agency. OPM can playa useful role in informing federal employees about
     those procedures, including the way in which claims may be raised by individual employees.

            The President appreciates your assistance in implementing this important order. Please let
     let me know if you have any questions about the meaning or appropriate implementation of this
     Executive Order.

                                                         Sincerely,


                                                         Charles F.C. Ruff
                                                         Counsel to the President
