Subject:         Read-out of stake-out following Crime and Drugs event

Miraculously, today's crime and drugs announcement was the sole topic of
discussion at the stake-out (though Sen. Leahy walked out the door of the
West Lobby about halfway through the stake-out, and got mobbed by
reporters near pebble beach) .

General McCaffrey opened the dialogue by giving context on today's
announcement.  He noted that drug abuse leads to crime and that at least
half of those in prison are there for reasons related to drug abuse.   He
also emphasized that the President announced a 40 percent increase for
next year in drug treatment initiatives in the justice system, and that
the initiatives announced today will help break the cycle of crime and
drugs.  Representative Rangel then reflected on his experiences as a
prosecutor and echoed General McCaffrey's statements. Maryland Lieutenant
Governor Kathleen Kennedy Townsend then emphasized that we must end the
useless debate between treatment and punishment, and said that today's
announcement guarantees better results.  Laurie Robinson, Assistant
Attorney General, Office of Justice Programs, agreed and emphasized that
we need to use every opportunity to coerce drug abusers to change
behavior linked with crime. Judge Jeffrey Tauber, President, National
Association of Drug Courts, and Mayor Jeff Griffin of Reno, NV echoed her
comments.
