FYI --



On Thursday June 25th, the Senate Committee on the Judiciary is scheduled

to

markup S. 1645, the child custody/abortion bill.    This bill is almost

identical

to HR 3682, which is currently being marked up in the House.    Did a copy

of the

Chief-of-Staff's June 17th letter go to Senator Hatch?    If not, are we

planning

to send the Senate Committee a letter prior to Thursday's markup?    Thanks.
