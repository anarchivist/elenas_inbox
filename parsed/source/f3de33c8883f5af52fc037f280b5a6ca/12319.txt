TEXT:
Given that the President and the First Lady may well be participating in
events to address the recent school shooting in the coming week, I
recommend that we save the after-school .grants announcement ($100 million
to public schools around the country to start or expand before- and
after-school enrichment programs) for an appropriate POTUS/FLOTUS/vp venue
and not have the VP announce them while travelling in Iowa on 4/28.    The
Dept of Ed can have them ready mid- next week for release.
