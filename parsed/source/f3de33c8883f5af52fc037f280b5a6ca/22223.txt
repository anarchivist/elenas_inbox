  I'm not entirely up to speed on where we are but I'm inclined to agree
  with Deich.  I'm worried that we may not have all our numbers nailed down
  and feel that OMB should be comfortable because Jack will take the heat
  otherwise and he's got other issues pending with the Hispanic Caucus.

  Subject:         Re: Naturalization

  Folks--she called me yesterday and made her arguments that she really felt
  it necessary to brief the congress because she's on the line re the
  numbers and I am sympathetic, but if deich and mertens feel that ins does
  not have its story together, that is pretty compelling.  I'd like Janet to
  weigh in here --remember jack also put his credibility o~ the line about
  the management changes that would ensure real progress on the delays in
  naturalization

  Subject: Naturalization



 FYI. As you know, OMB has been in discussions with INS and DOJ re:
 whether INS is going to meet their naturalization productivity projections
 for the first quarter of FY 1999. As of today, INS has yet to produce a
 briefing for OMB that describes, in detail, where they are and how they
 intend to meet their goals. However, because the new naturalization fee
 takes effect at the end of this week (Friday), Doris wants to brief the
 Hill asap on the status of their naturalization effort.  OMB (Deich) and
 DOJ (Colgate) are very opposed to her doing any kind of briefing on the
 Hill before we have a better sense of the numbers and before we are all
 comfortable with how they are telling this story.

  I just wanted to give you a heads up on this in case Doris contacts you
  re: this issue.
