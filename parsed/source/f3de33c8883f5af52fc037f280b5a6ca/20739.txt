ATTENTION SENIOR STAFF!

In an effort to let you know what your colleagues are saying "on the air",

message out there, and listening to interviews is the best way to learn
how to deal with radio hosts!

The Radio Office will update the line as interviews occur and we will
e-mail you when something new is available. We encourage you to call in!
