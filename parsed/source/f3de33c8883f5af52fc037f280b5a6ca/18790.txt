 MC:

 Can you share the following crime items for this week w/Rahm:

 1. FDA Drug Testing Reg.   I told HHS that Rahm thought Shalala should
 brief the day FDA releases its interim drug testing reg, but they don't
 want to.  Instead, they prefer to have McCurry make a comment about the
 reg at the top of his brief tomorrow and leave it at that.   I believe Lori
 McHugh (FDA Press) has talked to McCurry about this, and is forwarding a
 statement for him to read tomorrow.  If Rahm still wants to push this,
 he'll need to speak to Lori (301-827-6250) or McCurry today.   I'll drop
 off HHS's talking points/Q&A for your information.

 2. Assaults Report.   Treasury is hedging more than I would like on having
 the Assaults report ready by 3/14.  I told them Friday about Rahm's
 insisting that it be ready on time, but they're waffling a bit.  I've
 asked Elena to touch base w/Neal Wolin on timing, and I intend to touch
 base w/Mike Froman in the Secretary's Office.  It might help if Rahm spoke
 to Ray Kelly and/or Neal, too.

 3. Crack Letter.   I'd like to get the President's response to the
 Lott/Hatch/Abraham letter out this week.  Does Rahm have any comments.   A
 slightly re-worked version is attached.  (EK: Do you have an edits,
 comments?)


 4. McCaffrey Testimony. Just an FYI for Rahm, McCaffrey is scheduled to
 testify before the Senate JUdiciary Committee on our Drug Strategy.  I've
 read the 20 plus pages of testimony that ONDCP circulated and it's
 harmless enough; however, there is no predicting what he might say on a
 series of controversial drug issues -- crack, tobacco and drugs, needle
 exchange, etc. Rahm may want to speak to McCaffrey before Wednesday, just
 to see where he's at.

 Thanks,
 Jose'

Trent Lott
Majority Leader
United States Senate
Washington, DC

Dear Mr. Leader:

       Thank you for your letter regarding crack cocaine sentencing. I am pleased that you,
Senator Hatch, and Senator Abraham all agree that the current differential between crack and
powder cocaine penalties is too great and creates some unfairness. I also appreciate your
willingness to support legislation to correct this unfairness.

        As you know, Attorney General Reno and General McCaffrey have recommended to me
that the current penalties for crack and powder cocaine trafficking should be revised by: (1)
significantly reducing from 500 to 250 grams the amount of powder cocaine required to trigger
tough mandatory sentences; and (2) slightly increasing from 5 to 25 grams the amount of crack
cocaine required to trigger the same sentence. Such a revision would reduce the current
sentencing differential by 90 percent, maintain stiff penalties for all cocaine traffickers, and target
federal law enforcement resources to mid- and high-level traffickers. This is a sound
recom-mendation, and I hope you will reconsider your concerns and work with Attorney General
Reno and General McCaffrey on this issue.

       Ifwe are truly committed to building on the success we have had in fighting crime and
drugs over the past 5 years, however, we need to do much more than revise federal cocaine
sentences. We need to take the larger problem of gangs, guns and drugs head on. That is why I
strongly urge you and your colleagues to enact the following proposals this year:

       (1) Juvenile Gangs. Last year, I issued an Anti-Gang and Youth Violence Strategy
       calling for comprehensive juvenile crime legislation that would target gangs and violent
       juveniles by: helping communities hire new prosecutors and expand anti-gang task forces;
       establishing gun and drug courts to promote tough and appropriate punishment for
       juveniles; and expanding the use of federal racketeering statutes against gang members
       and curbing witness intimidation by gangs.

       (2) Kids and Guns. Juvenile access to firearms is at the heart of our youth crime and
       drug problem. Teenage homicides by firearms tripled between 1984 and 1994, and the
       number of juveniles actually killing with guns quadrupled during the same period. That
       is why I have proposed banning violent juveniles from owning guns when they become
       adults, and that is why my budget includes $28 million for the Bureau of Alcohol,
       Tobacco and Firearms (BA TF) to crackdown on illegal gun traffickers.
                                                                            Hex-Dump Conversion
       (3) Drug Strategy. This month General McCaffrey and I released an unprecedented
       National Drug Control Strategy with the goal of cutting drug use and availability in half.
       Among other things, the Strategy includes more funds to: make sure that kids get the
       anti-drug message every time they tum on the television, surf the "net," or listen to the
       radio; expand and improve the Safe and Drug-Free Schools programs; hire 1,000 new
       border patrol agents and help close the door on drugs at the Southwest Border; hire new
       DEA agents to crackdown on methamphetamine and heroin; and help states demand that
       drug offenders remain drug-free through testing and treatment

       (4) After School Programs. Keeping schools open later to provide youth with adult
       supervision between the hours of 3 and 8 p.m. -- when most violent youth crimes are
       committed -- must also be a part of our effort to reduce juvenile crime and drug use. Just
       this past month, more than 170 police chiefs, sheriffs, and prosecutors called on the
       federal government to increase support for such efforts. That is why my budget proposes
       quadrupling funds for Department of Education-sponsored afterschool programs, as well
       as including afterschool initiatives as part of our juvenile crime legislation.

        Again, thank you for your letter. I hope we will be able to work together on all of these
issues before the 105th Session of Congress adjourns.

                                      Sincerely,
