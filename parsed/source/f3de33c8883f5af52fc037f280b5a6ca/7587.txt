TEXT:
Laurie McHugh, press at FDA, reports the following on what the different
papers and networks are planning: Wall Street Journal won't be doing a
story, the Post is planning on using a wire story, USA TODAY talked to FDA
and they will probably do a story highlighting the dangers and secondarily
noting the need for legislation. CNN's supposedly running a mixed story
-- which I haven't seen yet. CBS and ABC are planning stories and have
talked to Friedman/FDA.  Needlesstosay, FDA has been trying to downplay
the alarmist part and emphasize the need for legislation.
