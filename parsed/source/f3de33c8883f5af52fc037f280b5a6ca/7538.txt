TEXT:
Josh says Raidt called, and asked us to bring up our pricing folks to meet
with the CBO estimators tomorrow morning at 9:30 to essentially try to
talk them into using assumptions more like ours.

I assume we should do this, and that I will attend unless one of you wants
to. We would have Gotbaum, Gruber, Scholtz, and Wolin (because of their
smuggling estimates) .

Subject:         JCT estimate of McCain bill could be $2 or more.

Based on staff conversations and using more conservative assumptions about
pass-through, smuggling and coverage of products other than cigarettes,
JCT will likely estimate a real per pack increase of "$2 and change" under
S 1415 by 2003-2008.  (CBO contracted out the revenue part of the estimate
to JCT, as Karl predicted.)

We'll know more tomorrow.
