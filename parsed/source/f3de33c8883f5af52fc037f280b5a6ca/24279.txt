DRAFT


Senator Orrin Hatch
Chairman


 Senate Judiciary Committee
 u.S. Senate
 Washington, DC

 Dear Mr. Chairman,

 I am writing to express the AdministrationD,s general views on consumer
 bankruptcy reform proposals currentiy under consideration in the
 congress.

 Over the past two decades, consumer bankruptcy filings have risen
 sharply. While there are many contending theories on the cause of that
 increase, it is clear that there is no single explanation. Nonetheless,
 the growing number of filings, examples of abuse of Chapter 7 and state
 exemptions, and evidence of imprudent extensions of credit suggest some
 changes to the consumer bankruptcy laws are appropriate. The lack of
 definitive evidence about the reasons for the rise in bankruptcies means
 that it is difficult to predict the effect of reform efforts.   The
 Administration, therefore, has developed the following set of principles
 to guide its review of changes to the consumer bankruptcy laws.

 1.      Access to Chapter 7 should not be governed by an arbitrary means
 test; the court must have discretion to fairly account for the great
 variations in circumstances that bring debtors into bankruptcy (including
 medical expenses, unemployment, divorce, responsibility for the care of
 others, etc.)     To promote more uniform application of bankruptcy
 standards, this determination should take place within indicative or
 presumptive guidelines established by Congress that take into account
 factors such as the debtorD,s income and ability to repay a portion of the
 debt.

 2.      National bankruptcy policy can respect state variation in
 exemption levels without allowing state exemptions to be used to shield
 luxury assets from creditors.

 3.      It is appropriate to expect   debtors who can afford to repay a
 portion of their debts (taking into   account all relevant circumstances) to
 act responsibly; but the bankruptcy   and credit reporting system should
 reward those who complete a Chapter   13 plan.

 4.      Bankruptcy reform should not create opportunities for creditors to
 coerce debtors to forgo bona fide rights in bankruptcy.

 5.      Bankruptcy rules should discourage bad faith repeat filings and
 other attempts to abuse the privilege accorded by access to bankruptcy.

 6.      Child support and alimony payments should be carefully protected.

           We must ensure that reforms have no unintended adverse impact on
 debtorsD, ability to meet these, and other, priority payments.

 7.      Bankruptcy data collection and accuracy must be improved.

          Analysis and understanding of the forces affecting bankruptcy
 filings are impeded by the lack of high-quality, nationally uniform data.
 Better data collection and verification procedures should be incorporated
 in any reform proposals. Such data can be used to assess and monitor the
 impact of reform legislation.

 8.      Scrutiny must also be given to credit industry practices that


 have led some borrowers to overextend themselves.

         While some of these issues may fall outside of the Judiciary
CommitteeD,s jurisdiction, Congress and the Administration should consider
proposals to ensure that consumers are well informed about the dangers of
excessive debt accumulation and understand the implications of their
credit agreements.

The Clinton Administration is open to responsible consumer bankruptcy
reform that meets these principles. We have reluctantly concluded that we
cannot support H.R. 3150 in its present form.  We would look forward to
working with Congress toward legislation more similar to the approach of
S. 1301 -- with modifications necessary to meet the principles articulated
above.

                                                 Sincerely,
