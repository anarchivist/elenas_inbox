TEXT:
The group could be health care professionals who are lobbying the hill.
The VP could talk with them about the areguments and substance necessary
to effect Congress. Maybe have a lobbying packet that could be handed out.
They could also inform him of their efforts and have a discussion about
what works.

Bruce: I want to make sure    that the VP is doing something public to try
to push the bill along (and   so that there are no claims that he and POTUS
were AWOL if the bill flags   this week).  I also, of course, do not want to
do anything provocative for   our efforts.

What do you think of bringing in some groups to meet with him in the
Roosevelt Room on Thursday or Friday; and then having a pool spray at the
top where the VP just says, 'I hope the Senate will work hard to make as
much progess as soon as possible. '
