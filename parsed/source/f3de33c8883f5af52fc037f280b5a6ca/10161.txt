TEXT:
I will be sending you a draft of the Interagency Plan on Native American
education that was required as the result of the President's executive
order on Native American education. The plan recommends two initiatives
to meet the goals of the order:   (1) 1000 new Native American teachers for
the Native American community and (2) continued support for funding for
Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) school construction and repair.

We still need to do some minor editing on this draft and vet it through
Interior and Education. However, the agencies plan on sending this to the
President later this week or sometime next week.  Let me know if you have
any comments on the draft. Thanks, Mary
