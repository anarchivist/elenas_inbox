     Bruce:

     Wecome back! Hope you had fun -- mine's just about to start.   I though
     I'd leave you some notes on some of the miscellaneous outstanding crime
     team related items:

     1. COPS Report. We had a meeting w/Kent and various reps from Justice to
     keep pushing for a beefed up version of this report to release on the
     crime bill anniversary. You and/or Leanne will want to touch base w/John
     Hart at the COPS Office to make sure this is on track and satisfactory.

     2. Juvie. Not much too report. DOJ has put together an appropriations
     strategy (Rahm and Leanne have if you don't) that stresses priorities such
     as research, evaluation and technical assistance ... ugh. I've spoke w/OMB,
     though, and their clear on our priorities -- (I) discretionary $ for
     prosecutors/courts, if possible; if not, add to Senate and House versions
     of juvie block grant; and (2) Senate's $75 million in discretionary funds
     for at--risk youth (House has $100 million block grant) .

     3. Crack.   Liz Fine has taken a crack -- forgive the pun -- at some
     overall talking points and strategy for our review. She's_ working with
     ONDCP on this now, and will be scheduling meetings every 2 weeks. We
     should attend. The next meeting should be the week after next.

     4. Sex Offenders. DOJ and Correspondence are reviewing a draft of Rahm's
     proposed POTUS letter to the govs, and the federal directive has been set
     for some time. Leanne can bring these to closure next week if you/Rahm
     want to finally get them out.

     5. Youth Crime Gun Interdiction. Our funds to expand this to 10 new
     cities were spent- for other purposes by the Hill just prior to the break.
     Treasury and OMB are aware of this and trying to fix, but I thought you
     should know if it comes up.

     6. Military Surplus Guns.   Senator Lautenberg intends to fight Rep.
     Murtha's rider to the Treasury~postal approps to force ATF to let certain
     military surplus guns to be imported into the country for sale. Treasury
     intends to work with him to defeat this amendment, and WH legis. affairs
     has informed Murtha of our strong opposition. You can talk to Beth Weaver
     at Treasury about this (622-2011).

     7.       Prison Drug Testing/Treatment.   DOJ is taking a cut at a directive to


    change the guidelines for prison grant $ to require states to -- (1)
    establish baselines to measure prison drug use; (2) to improve upon those
    baselines each year; and (3) to crackdown on guards who help bring drugs
    into prisons. Rahm has expressed that he wants to do this pretty soon,
    and have the AG and McCaffrey the same day with an event/speech. Leanne
    can follow-up on this for you w/DOJ.

    Finally, I'm sure I've forgotten something, so please   don't hesitate to
    call if you need me.  I'll be staying at the Hacienda   Beach Resort in Cabo
    San Lucas, Mexico. Leanne and Signal have the number    if you need it.
    I'll be there from about 2pm on 8/31 until 12 noon on   9/7, and my flight
    won't arrive in DC until late Sunday.

    I'll miss you all ...

    Jose'
