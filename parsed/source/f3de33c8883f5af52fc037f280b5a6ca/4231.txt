TEXT:
We couldn't get POTUS to do the dinner for   NAPO on Oct. 9, but he is
scheduled for a photo-op with the NAPO Top   Cops earlier that day.  I think
we should wait before telling NAPO in case   things change, but wanted to
let you know.  If we had a strong message,   we could try to turn this into
a message event -- it would certainly be a   nice picture.  Let me know.
