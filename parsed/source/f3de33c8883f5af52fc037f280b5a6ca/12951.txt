Increasing Trust Between Communities and Law Enforcement:
Combating Racial Profiling
June 9, 1999

Today at a Justice Department conference, President Clinton will chair a
roundtable discussion with leaders from civil rights and law enforcement
organizations on ways to build trust between police and the communities
they serve.  To address the issue of racial profiling, the President will
direct federal law enforcement agencies to begin collecting and reporting
data on the race, ethnicity, and gender of the individuals they stop and
search. The President also will calIon Congress to pass legislation to
promote data collection and reporting by state and local law enforcement
agencies.

Getting the Facts on Racial Profiling



Leading by example. No person should be targeted by law enforcement
because of the color of his or her skin.  Stopping or searching
individuals on the basis of race is not consistent with our commitment to
equal justice under law and is not effective law enforcement policy.
Racial profiling is simply wrong. As a necessary step to combat this
problem, we need to learn the hard facts about when and where it occurs.
That is why the President will direct the Departments of Justice, Treasury
and Interior to:

(I) begin collecting data on the race, ethnicity, and gender of
individuals subject to traffic and pedestrian stops, inspections at
entries into the U.S., and certain other searches; and

(2) after one year, report on the findings of the new data collection
system and make additional recommendations based on those findings on how
to ensure greater fairness in federal law enforcementO,s procedures.

Helping states and localities. The President also will support
legislation introduced by Representative John Conyers (D-MI) to establish
a new federal grant program to assist state and local law enforcement
agencies to implement similar data collection systems.  This legislation
also will authorize the Attorney General to develop a nationwide sample
and issue a report on the number and nature of traffic stops conducted by
state and local enforcement throughout the country.

Surveying the American public. As recently announced by the Attorney
General, this year the Justice Department will amend its National Crime
Victimization Survey and begin asking Americans about their experiences
with traffic stops, police use of force, and police misconduct. This new
information will help measure our success in building trust and improving
relations between law enforcement and the community.

More Progressive Policing for the 21st Century

Continuing the community policing revolution.  To make our communities
safer and stronger, we must enhance our commitment to community policing.
The 21st Century Policing Initiative contained in the PresidentD,s crime
bill extends his successful community policing initiative and contains
several measures to help strengthen the integrity and ethics of police
forces across the country.  Specifically, his crime bill includes: (I) $20
million to expand police integrity and ethics training; (2) $20 million
for police scholarships to promote the best educated police force
possible; (3) $2 million for improved minority recruitment to help make
sure police departments reflect the diversity of the communities they
represent; (4) $10 million to help police departments purchase more video
cameras to protect both the safety of officers and the rights of the
individuals they stop; and (5) $5 million to establish citizen police
academies to engage community residents in the fight against crime.
