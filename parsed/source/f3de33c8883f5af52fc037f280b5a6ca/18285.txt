                            PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
                             CHILD CARE ANNOUNCEMENT
                                  THE WHITE HOUSE
                                   JANUARY 7, 1998

        Throughout our history, our mission as a nation and as a people has been to honor and
live by our most cherished and enduring values. Through transformations in our economy and
in society, we have always risen to challenge of keeping the American Dream alive for every
person willing to work for it. And we have always found ways to ensure that family remains the
backbone of our society.

        Today, we are in the midst of a new social transformation. Our new economy -- powered
by rapidly advancing technologies -- has brought unprecedented prosperity to our country. But
the new economy has also imposed new demands on working families. With more women
entering the workplace than ever before, more families relying on two incomes and working
longer hours to make ends meet, millions of children must spend at least part of their day in care
outside the home or away from their parents. And millions of parents must spend their days and
nights worrying -- worrying about finding good care, about paying for it and having enough left
over for the groceries, about protecting their children from the kinds of child care tragedies
making headlines across the country. Too many parents find themselves walking a precarious
tightrope between unstable child care arrangements and the often uncompromising demands of
work. For many families, the search for affordable, high-quality child care has become a
stubborn obstacle to achieving the American Dream.

        No government can raise or love a child. Mothers and fathers do. But government can
help provide parents the tools they need to meet this most vital responsibility and succeed at
work. So today, I am proud to propose a comprehensive $20 billion plan to make child care
more affordable, accessible and safe for American families. It will be the single largest child
care investment in the history of our nation. Child care is an issue that touches nearly every
family in America, one that should rise above politics and partisan interests. And I fully expect
bipartisan support for this measure.

        This proposal will be an important part of the balanced budget I plan to submit to
Congress later this month -- the first balanced budget in 30 years. The budget will build on the
achievements of the year just past -- one that was very good to working families. The historic
balanced budget agreement I signed last summer boosted many family budgets with a $500 per
child tax credit. We helped more Americans afford college through education IRAs, expanded
loans, Pell Grants, Hope Scholarships and other tax credits. We worked together to expand
children's health insurance so that five million uninsured children can now get the medical
treatment they need when they become sick. For the fourth year in a row, millions of Americans
could take time off to care for an ailing loved one without fear oflosing a job because of the
Family and Medical Leave Act. The expanded Earned Income Tax Credit continued to help
                                                           Automated Records Management System

       In accomplishing all these things, we successfully abandoned the false choices of the past.
 We proved that we could indeed balance the budget and invest in our people and the future.
And we showed that it is not only possible, but crucial to the survival of the America Dream that
we help our people meet their responsibilities to their children and fulfill their duties at work.

          No parent should have to choose between work and family, between earning a decent
wage and caring for their children. And with this new proposal, they won't have to. This
initiative builds on my Administration's previous efforts to strengthen and expand child care.
Since I took office, federal funding for child care has increased by 70 percent, helping parents
pay for the care of some one million children. Two years ago, we worked hard to ensure that the
welfare reform law boosted child care funding by $4 billion over six years.

        My new proposal has four fundamental goals. First, we must make child care more
affordable and available to all Americans. In my balanced budget, I will double the number of
children receiving child care subsidies to 2 million with a $7.5 billion increase in Child Care and
Development Block Grants to states. Recognizing that different communities have different
child care needs, we will leave it up to the states to distribute these funds in ways that best serve
needy families. We will help three million more working families meet their child care
expenses through a $5.2 billion child care tax credit. And, to encourage more businesses to
provide child care for their employees, I am supporting $500 million in tax credits.

         Second, we must raise safety standards and improve the quality of child care by
strengthening enforcement of state codes and licensing requirements, weeding out bad providers
through tougher criminal background checks, and encouraging talented caregivers with
scholarships to pay for better training. There is still so much we do not know about child care in
our country. That is why I am proposing the creation of a National Center on Child Care
Statistics to gather information and support a national child care hotline for parents who need
advice finding quality care.

        Third, we must make sure that our children begin learning from their earliest days and
that the child care they receive only advances their development. As we learned at last year's
White House Conference on Early Learning and Brain, how our children are cared for and what
our children learn in their earliest years can have lifelong consequences. I am proposing the
creation of an Early Learning Fund that will support a variety of community-based efforts, from
reducing child-to-staff ratios in child care centers to training child care workers to educating
parents about good care. We must also double the number of children in Early Head Start, so
that our neediest children can begin getting ready for school from their first days oflife.

       Let me also take a minute to thank our states for leading the effort to improve child care
and promote early learning across America. In North Carolina, the Smart Start program
has helped thousands of children gain access to quality child care and health care. In
                                                                Automated Records Management System
                                                  2             Hex-Dump Conversion
ensure that all children come to school ready to learn. The state of Minnesota has taken a
leading role in mentoring parents and teaching them to encourage the emotional and
intellectual development of their infants. And in Washington, four-year olds from low
income families are eligible for early education, health care, and other services. I know
many state child care leaders are here today and I thank you for your hard work.

        Finally, we must make sure that every school age child has a safe and enriching place to
go after school. As the Vice-President said, too many children are left to fend for themselves in
the hours between three and seven o'clock. Too many children are roaming the streets, idling in
front of the TV, and getting into trouble. That is why I am proposing the expansion of before-
and after-school programs to help more children say no to drugs and alcohol and crime and yes to
reading, soccer, computers and preparing for the future.

        We are living in the most exciting era of human history. But even as time and
technology continue to alter the way we live, work and do business, even as they make some jobs
easier and render others obsolete, nothing can diminish the joys, responsibilities and challenges
of parenthood. No raise or promotion can ever top the joy of hugging a child after work.
Nothing is more bittersweet than sending the child you once carried in your arms off to test her
own wings in college. And nothing weighs more heavily on a parent's mind than the safety and
well-being of a child while he or she is in the care of others.

       Today, let us pledge ourselves to helping all parents do the best jobs they can at home and
at work. Let us pledge ourselves to providing all children the care, nurturing and education they
need to thrive in school and make the most of their potential. And let us all work to build a
future where all Americans who work hard and play by the rules can live the American Dream.
