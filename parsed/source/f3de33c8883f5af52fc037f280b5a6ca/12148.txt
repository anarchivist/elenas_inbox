TEXT:
As I mentioned Monday, Rep Cardin wants to introduce our Welfare-to-Work
reauthorization proposal. However, he wants to make two changes:

        1) Add stand-alone training as an allowable activity (now training
is allowed only as a post-employment activity for someone who is working);
and
        2) Add youth aging out of foster care as an eligible population

Frankly I think both of these detract from our work-focused program for
long-term welfare recipients.  However, so far we have few champions for
our $1 billion reauthorization proposal (except for the fathers piece and
as I mentioned Monday, Republicans are pushing to re-program 1999 funds
instead of using new dollars), and we need Cardin's help.   Secretary
Herman supports the first change (will probably call you Bruce) and is
agnostic on the second.   These changes will give us more things we could
drop in future negotiations.  Cardin wants to drop the bill in the next
two weeks, so it will be out there before the April 27th W&M subcommittee
hearing on fathers (at which DOL has been asked to testify) .

When we thought Cardin was going to introduce our bill as is, we were
considering skipping the formal transmission of the language to the Hill
and just giving it to Cardin informally.  However, now I think we should
transmit it, so it's clear what our proposal is (however, Leg Affairs
think that would be somewhat obnoxious since Cardin is helping us by
pushing what is 99% our proposal) .
On the Senate side, Robb may be our lead sponsor.  Republicans range from
indifferent (Roth) to critical (Voinovich).
