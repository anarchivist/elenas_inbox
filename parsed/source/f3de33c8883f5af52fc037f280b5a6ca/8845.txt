Subject: FRC Press Release on Hefley Amendment

FAMILY RESEARCH COUNCIL

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: July 27, 1998

CONGRESS SHOULD SAY NO TO SPECIAL RIGHTS FOR HOMOSEXUALS, FRC
SAYS

WASHINGTON; D.C. - "The U.S. government should not be in the
business of promoting homosexuality.  By equating sexual
orientation with race, sex and religion, President Clinton
acts as the public relations arm for radical homosexual
activists," Family Research Council President Gary Bauer said
Monday.  "Congress should seek to prevent the federal
government from discriminating against people with traditional
views of sexual morality."

On Tuesday, Congress is expected to vote on the Hefley
amendment to the Commerce-Justice-State Appropriations bill
(H.R. 4276).  This provision would overturn Clinton's
executive order adding 'sexual orientation' to an earlier
executive order, NO. 11478, signed by President Richard Nixon,
which mandates affirmative action for federal employees.

"President Clinton's action is not synonymous with the action
taken by President Nixon when he issued his 1969 executive
order," Bauer said.  "Congress laid a foundation for Nixon's
action by passing the civil Rights Act of 1964. President
Clinton, however, had no basis for his action. Neither the
House nor the Senate has passed legislation to add 'sexual
orientation' to our nation's civil rights laws.  In fact, the
Senate rejected such a proposal in September 1996.  President
Clinton's unilateral action is an affront to the democratic
process and reveals that our president is intent on forcing
acceptance of homosexuality on everyone, regardless of their
most deeply held beliefs."



While supporters of Clinton's executive order have sought to
target debate on the hiring practices of.federal agencies, it
is important to recognize that the order would also affect the
private sector by requiring companies seeking to contract with
the federal government and grant recipients to submit to the
edict.  "Homosexuality is not like skin color, or ethnicity or
place of birth.  It is defined by conduct, which is subject to
moral concerns," Bauer said.  "The Hefley amendment would
maintain the proper balance of power between the legislative
and executive branches of government.  It deserves the strong
support of both Houses of Congress."
