TEXT:
Per our prior conversation, I hope that Jose was able to catch up with
Chris regarding meetings over the next two days.

If not, I spoke with Chris and he asked me to pass this on:

He would like to have general brainstorming sessions with you and agency
policy people, as discussed in last week's race initiative policy
meeting.   (He has a number of people in mind.)  He hopes that one of you
or both of you have time tomorrqw.   If not, he would still like to pursue
conversations with these folks.   Wednesday is very good for him.  On
Thursday, he is only available from 3 - 5 pm.

Please let me know what you are able to work out.    THANKS.
