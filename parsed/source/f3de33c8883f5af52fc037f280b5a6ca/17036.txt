                                        September 22, 1997



      Question:   What is this "vast database of all new hires" described in today's
                  New York Times?

      Answer:     The National Directory of New Hires is part of the welfare law's new tools to
                  collect child support from deadbeat parents. The best way to collect child
                  support is to take it right out of parents' paychecks; a process called "wage
                  withholding." Before now, it was easy for the 30 percent of parents who live in a
                  different state from their children to avoid wage withholding because the state
                  where their children live couldn't access their wage data. The National Directory
                  of New Hires, which will go on-line October 1st, will change all that. The
                  Department of Health and Human Services estimates that the new hire directory
                  will increase child support collections by $6.4 billion over the next ten years.

      Question:   What exactly is the National Directory of New Hires?

      Answer:     Whenever a new employee is hired, employers will report six types of data --
                  employee name, addresss, Social Security number and employer names, address,
                  and federal employer identification number -- to a state new hire database. Each
                  of the fifty states will then report that data to the National Directory of New Hires,
                  where it will be matched against records of parents who owe child support to
                  locate and begin collection procedures against them.

      Question:   Aren't there privacy concerns raised by such a database?

      Answer:     Federal law requires the Department of Health and Human Services to establish
                  safeguards to protect privacy and ensure the data are used only by authorized
                  persons for authorized uses. These issues were reviewed in great detail as the
                  child support legislation was considered in the last Congress, and there was strong
                  bipartisan support for the establishment of the new hire directory and other new
                  child support enforcement measures.
