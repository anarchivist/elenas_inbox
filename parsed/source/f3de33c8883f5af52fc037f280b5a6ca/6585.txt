TEXT:
Elena,

I spoke to Peter last night reo EEOC.  He said that Tracey Thornton was
the right person on the Senate side, and that they have not yet hired a
replacement for who is the right person on the House side.  I spoke with
Tracey this morning.  She is going to consult with Martha Foley (leg.
budget person on the House side) and get back to me later this afternoon.
I asked whether we (leg., us and EEOC) should get together to develop a
legislative strategy.  She informed me that there is a mark-up next week
on the budget resolution, and that this in the relevant context for our
making a deal with the Republicans.

Julie
