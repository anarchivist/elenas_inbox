TEXT:
I have no idea what's in the Treasury memo, but Jim Pasco from the FOP
talked to Sylvia Mathews last week and she said she read the memo and felt
that neither side would end up happy.

Also, Jim told her that the one item he didn't want to be put forth as a
compromise was the "focus groups" Merletti is holding with the Secret
Service. Apparently, Merletti has started holding "focus groups" with the
Uniform Division which Jim suspects they will try to hold up as a
concession, and Jim keeps reiterating that this is the same kind of thing
the President threatened to veto the Team Act over.

Also, I just want to make sure you are aware that the Teamsters are
competing for the FOPs membership -- the Teamsters have had 6 elections
against existing FOP units in the last 6 months -- so the FOP is looking
closely at anything we do for the labor unions.  (At one point they were
working on a press release from the AFL-CIO speech where the President was
talking about his support for the collective bargaining process, but it
was probably just a threat!)
