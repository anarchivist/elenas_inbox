TEXT:
Colleagues:

While DOJ and Treasury have been working hard on the final assaults report
-- and the 5-model option does not seem to be in question -- Treasury (Ray
Kelly's office) called to say that Ray was trying to reach Rahm to tell
him it doesn't look like they'll be ready by Friday after all.  Treasury
tells me this is a Rubin decision to not hurry the report, and that he
believes it can wait 'til the President's returns from Africa.

Rahm should return Ray's call -- or call Rubin directly -- on this.

Jose'
