TEXT:
FYI, as you may know, New Mex. has problems with their TANF block
grant because their case load is increasing. So, unlike most
states, the block grant squeezes them.
Domenici is trying to find a fix for them.   His latest idea is to
let them tap into the contingency fund.   However, HHS has advised
Domenici that they're not sure that works until New Mex. files a
TANF plan and becomes a TANF state, which the state doesn't plan
to do for some time.
