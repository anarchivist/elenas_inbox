TEXT:
We had thought about trying to get another event out of the Administration
piece of the announcment for Equal Pay Day.   However, if we don't
announce the BLS study along with the Daschle bill, we will not have a
data analysis component. And without the BLS study, the rest of the
announcements -- an MOU, best practices, OPM Guide to Recruitng Women, and
self-audit don't seem like they would be enough of an announcement to
stand on their own.  In addition, the Taking the Daughters to Work Day,
which is a day we thought we could use these announcements for, is already
being plannned with a childcare announcement.  So it is probably best to
leave the package as it is. Let me know if you have any problems with
that. Mary
