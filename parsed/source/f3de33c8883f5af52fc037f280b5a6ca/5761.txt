     TEXT:
     In response to this note, Barry wrote that there is $24 million already
     appropriated on the mandatory side, specifically to study welfare to work
     success or failure over the next few years.  That's in addition to $31
     million on the discretionary side for welfare research annually and "more
     is not called for."

     I noted that "child only" cases are not subject to the five year .time
     limit and that many grandparents caring for grandchildren fall into this
     category.

     But we are on notice that Rep. Waters is looking for more action in this
     area. Note that Sylvia plans to call Ray Scheppach.

     its baaaack

     At the meeting today with the Director, Sperling, the COS, and Sylvia
     Mathews, Mrs. Waters and her staff reiterated their interest in doing
     something on this issue. She noted that these grandparents are subject to
     the time limits, that HHS had provided a lot of information, but that "we
     are not done" with this issue. Sylvia suggested that her staff contact
     Ray Shipock (sp?) at the NGA to see if they could get it into their policy
     mix for the new year's initiatives.

     Also she was interested in getting funding for a study for welfare to work
     to see how we are doing with implementation. Everyone seemed to agree
     that was a good idea, but wondered if it had been included in the welfare
     bill by Shaw. Keith do you recall this? If it was in there are we

·
    funding it and moving on it?
