TEXT:
There was a huge demand for the publications we handed out at yesterdays
events, and I literally only have one or two copies of each publication -
except for about 50 additional America Reads Kits. I of course can make
copies of the materials we produced and handed out at the event. All of
those documents were in the packet of stuff I left for you all the morning
of the conference. Feel free to email me names and faxes or addresses of
folks that need the external documents and I can send the info. out and
put it in the White House folders if you would like.

Also, you can refer anyone who wants copies of the publications to the
following contact people:
