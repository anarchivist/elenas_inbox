TEXT:
I just got from OMB a letter that the Secretary want to send to states
tonight if possible about the Federal share of any tobacco settlements.
It is clarifying the claim that we have on the Medicaid recoveries as well
as the process by which this is collected.  I am working now wiht OMB and
HHS on making it somewhat stronger, but there are obviously larger
ramifications. States have not always acknowledged this claim and this
could be news. Chris has not seen it (we are only learning of this now),
but tends to think that it is a good marker to lay down if it does not
weaken our position. We are inclined to let it go.

Any reason from your perspective to pull this?    I am faxing it over now.

Jeanne
