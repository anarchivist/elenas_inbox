TEXT:
With respect to zones, I think it will be next to impossible to fund it
out of any already authorized program, in large part because we know the
Obey and Porter are opposed to this.  Before sending up Zones legislation,
we considered seeking funds for it under the Title 1 Demonstration Progam,
which would be the only appropriate existing authority.  However, this is
the same authority that Obey&Porter used for their new comprehensive
school reform program last year--and they are not going to fund our progra
m as well out of the same authority.  Riley talked to Obey about this in
the beginning of the year.  Obey was adamantly opposed to this approach,
which is why we wound up seeking separate authorization rather than going
the appropriations route in the first place.

We can and should try again, but I think it will be an uphill fight.   I
think the first step here is to see if Obey is more open now than
before.
