                                    Q&A on Tobacco                   Hex-Dump Conversion
                                     April 22, 1998

Q_   What do you think of the House Republican proposal to link drugs and tobacco in
     a single bill?

A.   There is no question that we should be tough on drugs. But that is no excuse not to be
     tough on youth smoking. We need to pass strong, comprehensive tobacco legislation
     this year which raises the pack of cigarettes to $1.10 over five years, imposes tough
     penalties on companies which fail to reduce youth smoking, grants the FDA full authority
     over tobacco, restricts advertising and marketing to kids, and provides assistance to
     farmers. The McCain bill which passed the Senate Commerce Committee by a 19-1 vote
     three weeks ago is a strong step in that direction. If Republicans want to add anti-drug
     provisions to a comprehensive tobacco bill which addresses all of the President's five
     priorities, then we will take a look at it.

Q:   What exactly is the President's strategy on drugs?

A_   This past February President Clinton released the 1998 National Drug Control
     Strategy, a comprehensive ten-year plan to reduce drug use and availability by
     50% --to a historic new low. The strategy is backed by a $17 billion anti-drug
     budget, the largest ever presented to Congress, with a $1.1 billion increase over last
     year's budget.

     While the strategy incorporates specific goals and objectives in the areas of drug
     treatment and prevention, domestic law enforcement, interdiction, and international
     programs, its number one goal is to educate and enable our youth to reject illegal
     drugs as well as alcohol and tobacco. That is why the largest budget increases
     (15% over last year's funding levels) are targeted for this purpose.

     Key initiatives in this year's drug strategy include:

     Protecting Kids:
            $195 Million National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign to make sure that
            when kids turn on the television or surf the "net," they learn about the
            dangers of drugs.
            $50 Million for School Drug Prevention Coordinators to improve and expand
            the Safe and Drug-Free Schools program by hiring more than 1,000 new
            prevention professionals to work with thousands of schools in preventing
            drug use.

     Strengthening Our Borders:
           $163 Million for Border Patrol to hire 1,000 new Border Patrol officers and
           for "force multiplying" technology.
           $54 Million for Advanced Technology for the Customs Service to deploy
                                                            Hex-Dump Conversion

            advanced technologies, such as X-ray systems and remote video surveillance.
            $75.4 Million to Support Interdiction Efforts in the Andean region and
                   Caribbean, and to train Mexican counterdrug forces.

     Strengthening Law Enforcement:
            $38 Million to Crack Down on Methamphetamine and Heroin by hiring 100
           new DEA agents, expanding the Administration's anti-methamphetamine
           initiative, and targeting heroin traffickers.

     Breaking the Cycle of Drugs and Crime:
           $85 Million to Promote Coerced Abstinence to help state and local
           governments implement drug testing, treatment, and graduated sanctions for
           drug offenders.

     Reducing the Supply of Drugs and Enhancing Multinational Cooperation:
           $45 Million for International Programs for the Department of State to
           support nations involved in interdiction and counterdrug law enforcement.

     Closing the Treatment Gap:
            $200 Million Increase for Substance Abuse Block Grants to help states close
            the treatment gap.

Q:   Are you concerned about the information reported in today's New York Times that
     young African Americans are smoking more to enhance the high from marijuana?

A:   This Administration has long recognized that cigarettes, alcohol and illegal drugs all pose
     a serious and common threat to our youth. Studies have shown that kids who make it
     to their 21st birthday without having smoked a cigarette, taken a drink or turned to drugs
     are almost certain to avoid chemical dependency throughout their lives. That is why our
     goal must be to keep teenagers from having that first drink, trying a cigarette or
     experimenting with illegal drugs before they are old enough to know better and to realize
     the consequences of their decisions.

     There is no question that we should be tough on drugs. But that is no excuse not to be
     tough on youth smoking. Weare greatly concerned by new data released earlier this
     month showing smoking among African American youth has increased by 80 percent
     over the last six years. We need to do everything we can to reverse this trend. As the
     The New York Times article points out, advertising and other media messages have a
     great impact on young people. The researcher interviewed in the article, Dr. Robin
     Mennelstein of the University of Illinois, said advertising has a strong influence on youth
     behavior. This is reinforced by the facts, discussed in the article, that minority youth
     tend to smoke Kool and Newport, brands advertised with minority images, while white
     youth smoke Marlboro and Camel, whose ads feature white characters.

     These facts underscore why we need comprehensive legislation to stop young Americans
                                                       Hex-DiJmp Conversion .

from smoking before they start, by raising the price of cigarettes, putting into place tough
restrictions on advertising and access, imposing penalties on the industry if it continues to
sell cigarettes to children, and ensuring that the FDA has authority to regulate tobacco
products.
