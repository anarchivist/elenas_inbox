TEXT:
1.    OSHA came·by and discussed what they would brief Chafee about for his
field hearing on smoking and air quality. They won't endorse any
concepts, etc. They think Waxman may be interested in putting more of the
rule implementation under EPA, rather than OSHA.   They would like to
encourage Chafee to be specific 'in his bill about what the agencies should
do in order to avoid getting bogged down in rulemaking.

2.   possible New Issue. OSHA has an indoor air quality regulation that
has been stalled for ten years in administrative rulemaking. (The largest
record in OSHA history).    Indoor air pollution obviously hits people
where they work.   Its connected to approximately 500,000 cases of heart
disease a year, and they say, 4.5 million "respiratory ailments"
(ill-defined) .   Their regulation requires certain regular checkups on the
devices that effect air in buildings and that the devices, such as air
conditioners, work up to the levels they worked when new. What do you
think of looking instead at an executive order for federal buildings with
a less bureaucratic requirement (perhaps a standard of air quality goal)
but also a publication of a checklist of what makes a healthy building,
and make it available for private entities and citizens.   I'm not sure
that is the right approach, but I think the issue is potentially good.
They are also sending me all their on-going worker health ideas.
