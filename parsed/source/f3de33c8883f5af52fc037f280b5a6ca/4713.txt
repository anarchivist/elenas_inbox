Spending
                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion
Make flexible funding available for second-round urban empowerment zones. Although the
Administration requested $100 million in flexible urban EZ funding for FY 1998, the FY 98
VA-HUD conference report includes only $5 million in EZ planning funds, with no guarantee of
actual program funding for FY 1999.

Housing portability/choice. The package could include the following elements, among others:

1)     Provide $20 million in the FY 1999 budget to increase the number of Regional
       Opportunity Counseling (ROC) sites. Under the ROC program, public housing
       authorities partner with nonprofits to provide counseling to Section 8 certificate and
       voucher holders, to ensure that they are aware of the full range of housing options.
       When Section 8 families are ready to move, they tend to search for housing in areas
       similar, and in close physical proximity, to their original high-poverty neighborhoods.
2)     Encourage the use of exception rents (i.e., up to 120 percent of the "fair market rent") as a
       tool for opening up more expensive suburban housing markets.
3)     Eliminate obstacles to portability of Section 8 vouchers.
4)     Support voluntary efforts to establish and maintain integrated communities, through, for
       example, the Fair Housing Initiatives program (FHIP) or mortgage loan funds.
5)     Reduce racial disparities in mortgage loan denial rates through a partnership with the
       mortgage and real estate industries.
6)     Expand the number of Homeownership Zones from six to about 26. HUD will provide
       $10 million in FY 97 and has requested an additional $50 million in FY 98 and FY 99.
       This program enable cities to undertake large, single-family developments in inner-city
       neighborhoods. These developments are designed to attract stable, middle-income
       families to, and retain them within, central cities.
7)     Implement Homeownership Vouchers. This initiative would allow recipients of Section
       8 tenant-based assistance to use their vouchers and certificates for mortgage payments,
       rather than strictly for rent.                           .

Fair lending/fair housing initiative. This initiative could include:

 1)    An examination of the impact of credit scoring and risk-based pricing on the availability
       of credit/capital to lower-income and minority individuals;
2)     A Presidential call to banking regulators to obtain more data on reasons for home
       mortgage loan denials (OCC and OTS already collect such information);
3)     A Presidential request to Government-Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs--Fannie Mae and
       Freddie Mac) to retain loan denial data for further analysis oflending patterns; and
 4)    Increased resources for HUD and Justice testing efforts, with particular attention paid to
       mortgage lending.

Provide additional funds for job-creating projects in urban areas. The Administration would
request new Economic Development Administration (EDA) funding dedicated to infrastructure
and other projects that will stimulate private sector job creation in especially distressed urban
                                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion
areas. Projects in disadvantaged urban communities which were also found to be trade-impacted
would be given preference for these funds.

Capital access program. This would be a national pilot program under Treasury's CDFI Fund
to test a model that has proven effective at the State level. The program, rather than providing
loan guarantees, would match loan insurance premiums put up by the borrower.

Expand DOT's Livable Communities initiative.

Childhood lead poisoning prevention bonus program. Under this performance-based program,
communities would receive bonuses for reducing childhood blood lead levels, especially those of
children in large central cities. The program might also reward communities for progress with
regard to other home health hazards such as rat infestation. This initiative would create jobs in
the lead hazard evaluation and control field, as well as addressing a grave threat to children's
health.



Ease tax code constraints re: public-private infrastructure development.
       a)     Raise the current cap on "private benefit" from tax exempt debt; e.g., from 10 to
              20 percent;
       b)     Increase the cap on transportation bond proceeds usable for non-transit purposes
              from 5 to 20 percent; and

These two proposals are intended to stimulate retail and other spinoff development from transit
projects.

Urban intercity bus facilities redevelopment. The 20 percent commercial historic rehabilitation
tax credit could be extended to intercity bus facilities which are not on a historic register and do
not contribute to the character of a historic neighborhood (the criteria for the current credit). A
provision in the NEXTEA proposal would make intercity bus facilities eligible for Surface
Transportation Program dollars; this item is not included in the House bill.

Little or no budgetary impact

Voluntary CRA-type provisions for non-bank financial institutions. The largest providers of
several types ofloans (mortgage, car, institutional real estate) are often not covered by CRA.
For example, according to Treasury, 60 percent of home mortgages are made by mortgage
companies. Given that an increasing percentage of financial services business is now in the
hands of institutions other than banks, it is appropriate to explore methods of extending CRA
principles to these entities, on at least a voluntary basis. It is necessary to tread carefully here,
since this issue is a political minefield.

Voluntary agreement by private sector vendors to allow targeted entities (e.g., providing jobs,
training or other services) in distressed areas to purchase from the GSA schedules. An
                                                                        Automated Records Management System
                                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion
    informal estimate by GSA suggests that entities such as small businesses and community
    development corporations in distressed areas could realize savings of 15 to 30 percent on
    information technology and communications items by purchasing from the GSA schedules.

    Outreach to financial institutions about eRA credit for transportation infrastructure projects.
     According to DOT, many financial institutions are not aware that they can receive eRA credit
    for investment in transportation infrastructure and mobility enhancement projects.

    Make electronic funds transfer (EFT) regulation into a major announcement on the
    "unbanked." The proposed regulation was issued in September. In January the 90-day
    comment period is over; by March the proposal will be finalized. As a result of the new
    regulation, up to 10 million individuals may be brought into the banking system.

    Public education campaign on financial literacy and services. Treasury received $2 million in
    1997 for the campaign. The Department is planning to start the campaign in late fall or early
    winter. The campaign's goal is to improve understanding, especially among the "unbanked", of
    financial products and services. Treasury will circulate pamphlets through banks and credit
    unions, labor unions, Federal agencies such as Veterans' Affairs and Social Security, the
    American Bankers Association, consumer groups, etc. Treasury will also do public service
    announcements.
