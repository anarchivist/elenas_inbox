Daily Report -- 8121197


        Legal Immigrants and Food Stamps -- Today, five advocacy groups held a press
conference in the Senate Russell building to call upon Congress and the Administration to restore
food stamps to legal immigrants. As we noted in our weekly report last week, about 900,000
legal immigrants will lose food stamps this month, because the welfare law required states to
drop legal immigrants from the rolls within a year after enactment. At today's press conference,
the National Council of La Raza, the U.S. Catholic Conference, and other groups praised us for
restoring disability and health benefits to legal immigrants in the budget, but said the
"anniversary of welfare reform act is no cause for celebration" because ofthe food stamp cuts.

        In preparation for the new food stamp rules, the Department of Agriculture has
undertaken an extensive outreach campaign to inform legal immigrants of the 14 other nutrition
programs for which they are still eligible (including WIC, School Lunch and Breakfast, Child
and Adult Care Food Program, Nutrition Assistance Program for the Elderly, and the Emergency
Food Assistance Program). This outreach campaign includes publishing an informational op-ed
in Spanish language and other speciality newspapers, releasing an issue brief to the media,
advocacy groups, and state and local government officials, and providing Hispanic radio stations
with taped informational announcments. In addition, as we noted in last week's report,
Congress at our urging recently enacted legislation allowing USDA to sell food stamps to states
for distribution to legal immigrants and other individuals made ineligible by the welfare law.
Washington State, Massachusetts, and New York already have signed up for this option and
other states have expressed interest. An additional six states (CO, FL, MD, MN, NE, RI) are
using state funds to provide nutritional assistance to legal immigrants in other ways.
