TEXT:
We're going to run over copies of Maxine Water's statement today--woosh!
I also heard that McAffrey is going to be meeting with the Washigton Times
editorial board Tuesday.  Now do you think that's a coincidence with the
vote scheduled Wednesday on the Solomon needle exchange bill???? This is
getting a little tedious.
