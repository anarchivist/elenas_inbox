TEXT:
FYI.  I don't know if this is helpful or not, but Olsen at USDA just left
me a message saying two things: he thought CSPI (the consumer group) was
suspicious about HACCP for fruits and veggies because they weren't ready
and that farmers would be nervous about it too. If you are getting
pressure for a very rigorous program this would argue for some caution
because of domestic concerns. Hope things are going fine. Tom

FROM:      OMB LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS

DATE:      SEPTEMBER 23, 1997

SUBJECT:          LEGISLATIVE REPORT


The House Ways and Means Committee marked up compromise legislation today
to modify provisions related to farmers cooperatives and deferral of
overseas taxes that were item vetoed by the President.  It is possible
that the bill will be considered on the House suspension calendar early
next week: Prospects in the Senate are less clear.

Highway Bill: House Transportation full committee markup Wednesday
morning at lOam. As of early this evening, Transportation Committee staff
expect that the committee will vote on reporting a 6-month short-term
extension; and will consider, but will stop short of reporting, the
multiyear bill.   Instead they will vote on a committee resolution
endorsing the principles of the six-year bill (which may include a trigger
to reduce spending·if deficit targets are breached).  On the Senate side,
on Thursday, the Senate Banking Committee will markup a committee
amendment to the highway bill -- which was reported last week by
Environment and Public Works Comm. -- to reauthorize transit programs
(over which Banking Comm. has jurisdiction) .

On Wednesday morning at 10:00 am, the House Budget Committee will hold the
first hearing in a series this fallon the Social Security System.
