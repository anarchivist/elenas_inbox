TEXT:
this was Brian Johnson's draft last night (our communications
person).  I suggested [protect] instead of [determine] in whatever
bullet that is and there might be a few other minor changes.  I'm
not exactly sure who this was.sent to last night - Brian just said
he was putting it up and through his usual clearance process.
Sorry I didn't zap them over to you - I was still trying to figure
out the disconnect between DOJ and us.

PRINTER FONT 12 - POINT- ROMAN

DRAFT TALKING POINTS FOR DOJ

o       The Clinton Administration takes great pride in having
restored the balance between economic activity and
environmental protection in the forests of the Pacific
Northwest through the President's forest plan.
o       The President directed the Secretaries of Agriculture and
Interior to implement the provisions of the recently passed
rescission law in an environmentally sound manner to protect
those gains.
WIN     The judge's decision today means that we will, indeed, be
able to use good science to [determine] [protect] the
habitat of threatened or endangered bird species.
LOSE    Obviously, we are disappointed, but we feel that our case is
strong and the law is on our side.  It is silent on the
question of when birds are "known to be nesting." We
believe, therefore, that the determination regarding nesting
is properly made by agency scientists. Further, it is our
belief that releasing the sales at issue would seriously
jeopardize the continued existence of marbeled murrelets,
impede our ability to provide regulatory flexibility under
the Endangered Species Act, and exacerbate the renewal of
conflicts over the use of these ancient forests.   We will
appeal the Judge's decision.
 '.
o       We remain seriously concerned, however, about the impact of
Judge Hogan's earlier decision interpreting this provision
to apply to many more sales than we had contemplated when
discussing this matter with the Congress. We do not believe
that this extreme expansion of ancient timber sales was
authorized by the 1995 Rescission Act. Therefore, as the
President has said, we will actively pursue a legislative
remedy to correct this extreme result.
