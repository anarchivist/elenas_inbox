TEXT:
NGA will hold an marathon conference call with their state welfare and
labor commissioners and Governors offices on Thursday without us. On
Monday, NGA would like to do a call with us and 6 off their folks, Elaine
Ryan from APWA, Sherri Steisel from NCSL.  They'll do an agenda that we
can look at on Friday.  I've told them its their meeting.

Bruce is surely excused, but I think we should have Ken and Elena.   I plan
on inviting 2 each from HHS and Labor to be in the room with us.   Ken or
Elena-- you need to be prepared to say something to open this up. I think
the goal is here is not to freak the state folks out any more than
absolutely necessary. To achieve that, we need to do a quick 15 minute
premeeting with the agencies.
