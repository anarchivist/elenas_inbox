TEXT:
Message Creation Date was at 26-FEB-1997 20:20:00

TO:   DIRECTOR FRANK RAINES
  DEPUTY DIRECTOR JACK LEW
  DEPUTY DIRECTOR JOHN KOSKINEN

FROM: OMB LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS

DATE: FEBRUARY 26, 1997

SUBJECT:   LEGISLATIVE REPORT


Director Raines testified on the PresidentO,s Budget this morning before the
Joint Economic Committee, as part of a series of three hearings following the
release of the PresidentO,s Economic Report.  The first hearing featured former
CEA Chairman Joseph Stiglitz, and in the third hearing, Chairman Greenspan will
testify before the Committee in March.

Senator Torricelli held a press conference today at 3:30 pm where he announced
that he will vote against S.J.Res. 1, the Balanced Budget Amendment (BBA) , as
introduced by Senator Hatch.  In the press conference, he stated that the BBA,
unamended, does not meet the standards to amend the Constitution.  In the hour
before his press conference, the Senate defeated TorricelliO;s amendment by a
vote of 37 to 63 (see description below) .

The House Democrat CoalitionO,s 22 members unveiled their O&Common Sense
Balanced Budget for FY 1998" in a Press Conference this afternoon.  In their
Press Release, the Coalition characterized their budget as a O&plan that not
only balances the budget by 2002 with a surplus, but also balances in 2005
without relying on the Social Security trust fund and balances by 2007 without
relying on any trust funds at all.OB (Please call our office at 5-4790 if you
would like copies of their package.)

CONGRESS TODAY (2/25):

SENATE:
Tabled (67-33) Feinstein substitute amendment to the BBA;

Failed to pass (37-63) the Torricelli amendment that would have permitted
capital budgeting, amended the military waiver, and provided majority waivers
for recession;

Tabled (59-41) the Dorgan substitute amendment, which, like the Reid amendment,
would have excluded the Social Security trust fund from the resolution.  (The
Reid amendment was a perfecting amendment rather than a substitute.)

Tabled (40-60) the Boxer amendment

Under a UC agreement, Members had to submit any amendments to the BBA by 5:00
pm this afternoon. (Republicans reserved 4 unspecified amendments.  Hollings
did not offer his amendment regarding campaign finance.)

HOUSE:


Suspended the rules and passed the following bills:
(416-0)   H.R. 624, Armored Car Reciprocity
 [SAP sent, 2/26: No objection]
(417-0) H.R. 497, To repeal the Blue Cross / Blue Shield Charter
 [No SAP]
(347-73) H.R. 66B, Airport and Airway Trust Fund Tax Reinstatement Act of 1997
 [SAP sent, 2/25: Administration strongly supports]


CONGRESS TOMORROW (2/27)

the past, would eliminate judicial impoundment and enforcement

At 4:00 pm, stacked votes on the Kennedy amendment (10), the Feingold amendment
(13), and the Feingold amendment (14)

2 hours of debate on the Bumpers amendment (12), which would chage the BBA to a
