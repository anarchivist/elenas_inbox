 TEXT:
 You asked about Labor's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs
 (OFCCP) request to collect wage data from contractors scheduled for
 compliance reviews at an early stage of the compliance review process.
OFCCP is asking for companies to send in this data to them so that they
.don't have to go onsite to as many contractors.  Unless Labor asks for
 another extension, the issue of whether Labor's request falls under the
 Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) must be resolved by May 31. Josh Gotbaum
met with Labor last Friday to go over the outstanding issues.
The main procedural issue is whether this request falls within the
 "administrative action or investigation" exemption of the PRA.   If
 Labor's request is exempted from the PRA, then Labor does not need to
weigh the burden hours to federal contractors in complying with Labor's
 request for data.  Currently, as written, Labor's request asks for
 individual pay records for every employee at specific locations of about
 4000 federal contractors.   Sally Katzen and OMB both believe this request
 should be covered by the PRA and the burden to employers should be
weighed.

On the merits, OMB does not disagree that Labor can ask for pay data at
this early stage of the compliance review process.   However, OMB would
disagree with the contractors having to provide the individual pay records
from every single employee at a certain location. OMB would suggest that
these 4000 or so contractors instead provide a summary form showing the
average pay for each occupation or some other method that would be less
burdensome to the contractors and more useful to OFCCP, e.g., doing some
kind of subset of the 4000 contractors. OFCCP has indicated informally
(the Solicitor's Office may not agree) that they may be amenable to
limiting it to employers above a certain size.

Chuck Ruff is going to meet with Sally Paxton on Wednesday to go over this
issue. He is expected to agree that this should be covered by the PRA.
