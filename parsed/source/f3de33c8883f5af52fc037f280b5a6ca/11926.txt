TEXT:
To my knowledge, a decision has still not been made about whether we
announce the nursing homes portion of the crime bill around the bill
signing on Thursday. One potential venue was a tarmac statement in
Cincinnati.  If the decision is made for the President to announce this,
we will need to draft/clear paper tomorrow for the announcement.

Is it possible for someone to raise this at the senior staff meeting
tomorrow to attempt to get closure on whether or not we announce this on
Thursday? Thank you.
