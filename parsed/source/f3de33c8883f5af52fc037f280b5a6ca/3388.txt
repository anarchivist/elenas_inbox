TEXT:
Despite Erskine's initial interest in killing it altogether, the Pediatric
Labelling Event is pending for an event in August or a Radio Address in
the next couple weeks. August is very tough, so I think we should push
hard for a Radio Address.

The Immunization Event is confirmed for the 23rd with Shalala, Slaughter,
victim, and POTUS. Ann has said the three announcements are 1) HHS Report
& supporting the Senate Legislation, 2) the Child Health Regulation, and
3) Date of the Child Care Conference.   If the announcement around the
child health regulation changes (like to an e.o.) we should let Ann know.

Also, we are close to getting a date for the Eli welfare event in St.
Louis. They want Political Affairs to organize some events while POTUS is
in St. Louis, so scheduling is working with Craig on a good date.
