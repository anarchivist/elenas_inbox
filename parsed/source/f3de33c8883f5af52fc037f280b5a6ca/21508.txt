TEXT:
Rep. Sheila Jackson-Lee just called to strongly request that in lieu of
the recent brutal killing of Matthew Shepard of Wyoming,  we push hard to
include the Administration's Hate Crimes legislation (H.R. 3081) into the
final omnibus appropriations bill..  She asked me to call her back as soon
as possible with feedback from our principals on the prospects for this
happening. JM.
