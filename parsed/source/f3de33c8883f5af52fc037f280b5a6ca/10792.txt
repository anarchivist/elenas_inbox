TEXT:
The NGA briefing was uneventful with regard to our education agenda.
There were only 2-3 questions. Engler's staff wanted to make sure that our
requirements not interfere with state efforts already underway to
intervene in failing schools or issue report cards. I assured her that
our intent was to make our requirements fit with reasonable state
approaches, not to upend them or require a parallel federal approach.   I
also subtly indicated that we would not accept just any state approach.
Carper's staff asked how we would force compliance.  I did our song and
dance about states wanting to do this, etc.  Carper's staff thought this
worked well, and would minimize Republican opposition.

In addition. O'Bannon's staff asked privately for help so O'Bannon could
sell Dem. gov's on class size and school modernization when they meet
during the nga meeting next month. That is a vast improvement over the
last time Fred and I discussed our agenda with them.

Finally, Scott Fleming reports that Riley had a very positive discussion
with Goodling about our proposals. Goodling is pleased that POTUS has
"finally gotten the workd about rewarding excellence."
