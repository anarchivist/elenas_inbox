TEXT:
There are a few proposals that are moving through the Administration on
Native Americans that may be of interest, including two executive orders
being drafted by the DPC's interagency working group on Native Americans
and Alaska Natives.

Here are summaries of the proposals:

1.      Executive Order on Comprehensive Indian Education:  This proposed
executive order provides that each agency will appoint a senior official
to serve as a liaison for Indian education activities.  The executive
order also contemplates that a Board, under the auspices of the National·
Advisory Council on Indian Education (NACIE), will be appointed to monitor
and report on the progress made by the agencies in fulfilling the purposes
of the executive order.   Each agency will be tasked with drafting a
5-year strategic plan to promote educational change, systemic reform, and
         .r
                                                                                     Page 2 of2


         student achievement. In drafting the strategic plans, agencies will
         promote the President's national education goals.

         2.      Executive Order on Indian Youth. This proposed executive order seeks
         to improve the quality of life for Indian youth by coordinating and
         expanding services related to health, community empowerment, crime, and
         education. This executive order also contemplates that each agency will
         appoint a senior official to be a liaison from the agency to promote the
         goals of the executive order. The order also establishes in HHS a
         Presidential advisory committee entitled the Federal/Tribal Partnership
         Council to be comprised of tribal representatives and members of various
         Native American groups.

         3.      Indian School Construction Legislation. One group from the Loneman
         School Corp. is working on proposed legislation to issue bonds to pay for
         school construction for federally-funded Indian schools. This group is
         working on the debt and bonding issues and has met with Bob Shireman of
         the NEC and Hill staff.

         4.       Crime in Indian Country.   The President has tasked DOJ and Interior
         to report on ways to curb crime on reservations. A report with options is
         due by the end of the year.


         Timeframe: With respect to the two proposed executive orders, the working
         group plans to have final drafts by the middle of October. The working
         group will then present these drafts to Secretary Babbitt. The group then
         plans on presenting these drafts to the white House for vetting.

         The National Congress of American Indians, which includes approximately
         250 tribes, is holding its annual conference in Santa Fe from November 16
         through 21.   This conference could be used to announce some policy, as
         the result of the race initiative or otherwise.
