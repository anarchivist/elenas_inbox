TEXT:
FYI:  The Advisory Board E.O. was circulated today by OMB and they have
incorporated minor comments from DoJ (the only comments received). OMB
will be sending it to Staff Secretary soon, who should circulate it to
staff this evening.  So, please be on the look-out for it.  It is
important that we get any comments back as soon as possible so that it's
ready for the trip.

For those of you who saw an earlier draft, you may note that the preamble
paragraph was taken out. This was at the strong suggestion of OMB who
thought it was more appropriate for a press release about the E.O. than in
the legal document itself. Any questions, please call.
