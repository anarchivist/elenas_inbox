TEXT:
We should probably try to send Cynthia, since the Pres will spend two
nights in LA.  If you want to go instead, that would be great too -- Vegas
is a drag, esp. in the summer, but Tahoe would be nice even for just an
afternoon.

It's partly a political trip, so they might be reluctant to send anyone at
all, which could mean they'd say no to Cynthia but yes to you.
