Surgeon General ConfIrmation. The Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee held its
confirmation hearing for Dr. David Satcher this Wednesday. The hearing went extremely well,
and Senators on both sides of the aisle praised Dr. Satcher. Few controversial issues were
raised. He was not questioned on many of the high profile issues we were expecting, including
needle exchange and AIDS research in Africa. It appears likely that the final full Senate vote on
Dr. Satcher's confirmation will take place as early as the week of October 20th.

New York Provider Tax. On Thursday HHS met with Governor Pataki and members of the
New York delegation as it released its announcement of how the Administration will work
towards ensuring that all states' provider taxes are in compliance with the law. Clearly
Governor Pataki chose to portray our response as being completely unsatisfactory. This is the
case despite the fact that our position on provider taxes is the most favorable position we could
have taken for New York (and all other states with potentially impermissible provider taxes)
within the constraints of the law. If this wasn't the case, we would not be having to ask for
legislation to give the Secretary authority she does not now have to waive up to all past liability
for currently impermissible taxes. It is further validated by those staff members of the House
Committee of Jurisdiction (who hate provider taxes) who are criticizing us for being too
favorable to New York and resentful that we are pushing a legislative strategy. All things
considered, however, we believe that our positioning on this issue is as well as could be hoped
for and most realistically positions us to eventually and most expeditiously ensure that all states
come into compliance.

FDA Reform. FDA reform passed the House this week and is now moving into conference.
We are hopeful that the outstanding issues will be resolved in conference and that you will be
sent a bill that we would recommend signing.

Kassebaum-Kennedy Implementation. As you know,there was a story in The New York
Times last Sunday that reported that some insurers are giving agents incentives to not enroll
high-risk populations. Such actions are completely inconsistent with the spirit of the
Kassebaum-Kennedy law. We are meeting with HCFA, the agency responsible for
administering this provision of the new law, to review all of the Federal and State statutory
authority to stop such practices. We will keep you apprised as we move forward.

ConfIrmation of Nancy-Ann Min DeParle as HCFA Administrator. Nancy-Ann Min
DeParle, your new appointment for HCFA Administrator, has had two Senate holds placed on
her confirmation. Senator Harkin (D-IA) has placed a hold because of his frustration with the
Administration's lack of enforcement ofhis fraud and abuse priority initiatives. Senator Kyl
(R-AZ) has just placed a hold apparently because of his concern about the Administration's
opposition to his amendment to reopen up the balanced budget act to allow physicians negotiate
private contracts with Medicare beneficiaries.

On Wednesday Nancy-Ann met with Senator Harkin's staff and made a commitment to address
many of the Senator's priorities. The Senator and his staff seemed quite pleased and it appears
likely that Harkin will soon release his hold. Since Senator Kyl's hold was placed on Thursday
of this week, we have not had the opportunity to arrange an acceptable arrangement to remove
                                                            Hex-Dump Conversion


his hold. We are still conducting a thorough policy review on the Kyl Amendment, but are
concerned that it could lead to more fraud and abuse in Medicare and dramatically increase
beneficiary out-of-pocket costs.

We believe that the fact that Nancy-Ann has not been confirmed undermines her ability to be as
effective as possible in administering one of the most complex and complicated agencies in the
Federal government. We have and will continue to make her confirmation one of our highest
priorities this fall.
