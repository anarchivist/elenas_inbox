Health CarelTobacco Concerns of Asian Americans:

        Immediately after this week's release of the Surgeon General's report on tobacco,
a number of members of the minority caucuses wrote Dr. Satcher to raise concerns about the
lack of data on the insular areas, particularly on residents of the Pacific Islands. They urged
the Surgeon General to ensure that future health reports incorporate this data, so as to inform
health care providers and other experts about the extent of the problems for this population.
They strongly feel that such information is necessary to create a baseline of understanding of the
challenges these populations face, which they believe is essential to learning if various
interventions are actually improving the situation:

        Although Asian American Members of Congress and advocates frequently raise the need
for better data collection, they are extremely happy with your focus on race and health disparities.
 In particular, they were pleased you highlighted Asian-American-specific data in your radio
address and in your speech as you received the Surgeon General's report. (There has been a 17
percent increase in smoking among Asian American high school students; the Surgeon General's
report chronicled how tobacco companies have promoted their products by sponsoring numerous
ethnic activities and events, such as Chinese New Year festivities and events related to
AsianlPacific Heritage month.)

         Some members of the Caucus are searching for funding set-asides in the tobacco
legislation. This may be unconstitutional; even if it is not, it would be extremely difficult to
pass this Congress or not even particularly advisable. We are working with numerous
organizations to develop the best alternatives to ensuring that the needs of special populations are
adequately addressed in any tobacco legislation.

Talking Points:

·      I have found the information on the increases in smoking amongst all our high school
       children in the last several years to be shocking. We cannot tolerate the fact that there
       has been a 17 percent increase in smoking by Asian American high school students.
       This is the time, this is the year, for comprehensive tobacco legislation. It would be the
       most significant public health achievement any of us could be a part of.

·      I acknowledge that we need better data and a greater commitment to collecting health
       care information on populations living in the insular areas, particularly for the Pacific
       Islands. I am well aware of your letter to the Surgeon General and look forward to
       working with him and the rest of the Department in doing a better job in this area.

·      . I want to work with you on the tobacco bill, as well as on my race and health initiative, to
         ensure that we are crafting the strongest possible legislation to address the many health
         care challenges facing Asian Americans and all minorities. The health care disparities I
         have documented in the past are an embarassment to the whole nation; we can and should
        do better. I am committed to that end.
