TEXT:
Bruce, you passed along to me an invitation to appear on a panel at next
week's meeting of the state welfare directors. At first, I assumed I'd do
it; now I'm reconsidering whether it's a good idea.

It's not that I mind appearing on a panel with Robert Rector and Bob
Greenstein about the goals of welfare reform; it's that I'd hate to have
the White House put on the spot on workfare, minimum wage, worker
protections, privatization, etc. just as we're immersed in delicate
negotiations. The Administration will be well represented elsewhere at
the conference (by Olivia Golden and others) .

I can still get out of this.   I think I should.   Do you?
