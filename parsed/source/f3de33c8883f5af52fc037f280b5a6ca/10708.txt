TEXT:
Eric Olsen from USDA just called with what they call a "clarification for
adulteration policy for E Coli 01577:H7 in beef."    Since 1994, FSIS has
considered raw ground beef contaminated with E Coli 01577:H7 adulterated
unless it is processed in a manner to make it safe (e.g., fully cooked).
In 1998, an advisory committee said this policy should apply to all raw
beef that has been cut, injected, sectioned etc. (non-intact beef), not
just hamburger.   The notice, scheduled to be put on display tomorrow, will
clarify FSIS's policy to state that all non-intact beef contaminated E
Coli 01577:H7 is adulterated unless processed so as to be safe. The
notice seeks ·input from the public about regulatory requirements that
might be appropriate. Simultaneously, FSIS will publish a guidance in the
Federal Register to beef grinders for minimizing the impact associated
with food safety hazards in raw ground beef.    The decision by FSIS took
Eric by surprise, the Secretary recommends we don't try and hold FSIS back
-- it probably will get some attention but be somewhat controversial and
USDA fears a leak saying a valid safety move is being held up for
political machinations.

Also Glickman wants to leak to the food reporter at the NYT today that
they are going to let meat and poultry to be able to bear the qertified
organic label - - this will make the organic industry and some members of
Congress happy. USDA is just letting companies make the label claim -
they don't think it will get as much attention as the e-coli thing does.
