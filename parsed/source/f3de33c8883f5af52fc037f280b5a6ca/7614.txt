TEXT:
Given that this is Police Officers Memorial Week and every law enforcement
leader will be in town, I think we should try to quell the groups concerns
about the tobacco deal.  I would recommend that we pull together a meeting
of all the cop groups and Bruce and Rahm this Thursday afternoon -- b/c
they will be at the Memorial all day Friday.   If this is not possible, I
think we need to fax them talking points or something that outlines our
position this week at a minimum.  This is the week the groups all meet
with their membership and Members of Congress.   Although Jose has spoken
to each of the groups, they need as much specific information as possible
from us -- and they need to see us making a serious effort to address
their concerns -- before they completely join forces with Hatch on this
and other issues.  FYI: Hatch is meeting with all the groups on the 20th.


it is important that they feel that we are making a serious effort to
address their concerns.
