MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

RE:            DPC Weekly Report


         School Safety -- White House Conference on School Safety: On Thursday, October
15 you will host the White House Conference on School Safety in the East Room. You will
be joined at this event by the Vice President, the First Lady, Mrs Gore and 120 participants
including experts in education and youth violence, practitioners, local leaders, teachers,
parents and students. You will make remarks and host a panel discussion that will be
satellite down linked to almost 600 locations -- including Jonesboro, Paducah, Pearl and
Springfield. The conference will also be cybercast over the Internet.

        At the conference you will release of the first Annual Report on School Safety, and
announce: (1) a plan to create a federal School Crisis Response team, which will assist local
communities in much the same way that FEMA assists in response to natural disaster; (2)
$60 million to provide schools with serious crime problems with 2,000 school safety
officers; (3) a commitment to trace all firearms recovered in schools; (4) a plan to overhaul
the Safe and Drug-Free Schools program so that it better targets funds to communities with
greatest needs, requires schools to provide school safety report cards to parents and the
public, and helps keep schools safe and drug free through proven practices; (5) a
demonstration program, with coordinated funding from programs in Education, Justice,
and HHS, to help schools, law enforcement agencies, mental health agencies, general
government and community-based groups such as Boys and Girls clubs develop and
implement coordinated, community-based efforts to address school safety and youth
violence problems; (6) a commitment by four retailers (K-Mart, Walmart, DockerslLevi
Strauss and JC Penney) to give back a percentage of the profit from the sale of school
uniforms to schools for the development of comprehensive school safety plans and to
encourage the adoption of school uniforms; and, (7) a year-long public awareness
campaign by MTV focusing on the problems of and solutions to school and youth violence.

         Health Care -- Appropriations Update: As ofthis writing, there are a number of
controversial health issues left to be resolved in our appropriations discussions on the Hill. High
visibility issues related to Medicare include, potential responses to reimbursement issues for
home health care and skilled nursing facilities, as well as Pennsylvania disproportionate share
hospital payments. On these issues, we are viewed by supporters as being helpful. Outstanding

Medicaid cost savings proposal and CHIP fixes for Washington, Puerto Rico and Wisconsin.
Public health issues of interest include organ allocation, needle exchange, assisted suicide, and
your race and health initiative. We will keep you apprised of final outcomes ofthese issues
when they are resolved.

        Education -- Charter School Bill: The bipartisan "Charter School Expansion Act of
1998" was approved by the Senate Thursday evening on a voice vote, debated on the House
floor Friday afternoon, and is expected to pass in the House on a recorded vote late on Friday.
As you know, the bill would amend the federal charter school grant program to strengthen
accountability and flexibility in charter schools, ensure that charter schools receive their
commensurate share of funding from a range of federal education programs, and provide new
support to help high-performing charter schools revitalize other public schools.

         Education -- Vocational Education bill: The Carl D. Perkins Vocational and
Technical Education Act of 1998 was passed by the Senate and the House Thursday night. The
legislation promotes accountability for results and flexibility, professional development for
teachers, and will help students achieve challenging academic and technical standards through
improved preparation for college and careers. It provides the third and final bill -- following the
workforce investment act and the adult education act -- carrying out your "G.I. Bill for Workers"
proposal. Specific provisions in the bill include making it possible for vocational education
funds to support the continuation of School-to-Work and "Tech-Prep" activities and requirements
that states develop performance plans that include indicators related to academic achievement,
technical skills achievement, and entry into post-secondary institutions and employment.
Coupled with the workforce investment act, the bill also provides financial incentives for states
that meet or exceed ambitious performance goals.

        Tobacco --CDC Report: The Center for Disease Control's Morbidity and Mortality
Weekly Report released Thursday confirmed that more than 3000 children begin smoking
regularly every day. In 1996, 1.8 million Americans became regular smokers, of whom 66
percent, or 1.2 million, were under the age of 18. Between 1988 and 1996, the number of
children who become regular smokers increased by 73 percent, and this increase resulted in 1.5
million more children becoming regular smokers over the eight year period. Finally, the report
restated previously released data which found that young people who smoke regularly vastly
underestimate the addictiveness of nicotine -- of those who think that they will not smoke in five
years, 75 percent are still smoking five to six years later, and 70 percent of adolescent smokers
wish they had never started in the first place.

        HousinglWelfare Reform-- Welfare-to-Work Housing Vouchers: Congress has
approved your full request for 50,000 welfare-to-work housing vouchers. This is the first
significant, real increase in housing vouchers in four years, and the first time vouchers have been
directly linked to welfare reform. This connection presents an exciting opportunity to improve
how local welfare, employment, and housing agencies work together. We are working with

vouchers.

        Welfare Reform -- Welfare to Work Partnership Survey: The Partnership's second
survey of businesses shows success in employment of welfare recipients as well as remaining
challenges. The survey, conducted by the independent Wirthlin research group, polled 300
Partnership member companies and 300 similar companies who are not members. Most
Partnership companies are hiring welfare recipients for full-time positions (76%), at an average
starting wage of$7.20 per hour, both of which are comparable to other entry level hires. These
companies also provide health benefits to former welfare recipients similar to other entry-level
hires: 73% offer full coverage after 3-6 months, 61 % cover at least half the premium and 28%
cover the entire premium. Three-quarters of the Partnership companies promoted former
welfare recipients over the past year, at a significantly higher rate than non-welfare hires in other
companies. Partnership companies are more likely to provide mentors for their welfare hires,
and find this improves jobs performance. Only about one-third of the companies offer help with
child care, but those who do find it improves performance and retention. The companies
continue to report transportation and child care as significant barriers, but there is a large gap
between acknowledging the problem and providing these services for reasons related to cost and
fairness. The survey found that while Partnership members were more successful in hiring former
welfare recipients, other companies are also actively hiring -- one-quarter had hired someone off
welfare in 1997 and one-third expected to hire in 1998.

       Children and Families -- Appropriations: This week Congress passed the Coats
Human Services Reauthorization Act of 1998. This bill includes Head Start, LIHEAP, the
Community Services Block Grant, and individual development accounts (IDAs). We hope to
have a signing ceremony that would highlight improvements in Head Start as well as the first
authorization for IDAs.
