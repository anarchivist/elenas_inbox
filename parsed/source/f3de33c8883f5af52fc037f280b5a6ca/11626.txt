 TEXT:
 This is perhaps a bit Quixotic, but I implore you to read the material
 below on teacher testing. It is a wonderful illustration of the
 implementation politics surrounding testing.

 »   Dear Professor Walter Haney:
 »
 »        Recently, a copy of the Boston Globe article, "Teacher Test
 Called
 »Unfair and Unreliable," was sent to me by a family member living in
 »Pittsfield, MA. After reading the article, I knew that my discussions
 »with the Office of Testing and the Office of the Commissioner of
 Education
 »would interest you and your study.
 »                As a frame of reference, I am a certified elementary
 teacher in
 »the state of New Jersey.    I teach K - 8 computers and I am my school's
 »Technology Coordinator.    I graduated from XXXXXX University in 1994 with
 »degrees in Political Science and Communications.    For three years, I
 »worked in research management. During the last year and a half I
 returned
 »to school in the evenings to complete XXXX University's Post-
 »Baccalaureate program in Elementary Education. In February of 1997, I
 took
 »the three main sections of the National Teacher's exam and received
 scores
 »that passed in every state that required one or more of these tests.
 »(General Knowledge - 673, Communication Skills - 673, Professional
 »Knowledge - 674)    Last May I completed the certification program with a
 »4.0 average.
 »
 »              Last October 3rd, I took the Massachusetts Teacher Test
 in the
 »hopes of moving back to the area in which I was raised. On the
 elementary
 »test I scored an 80. In the reading subtest, I scored and 89 and in the
 »writing subtest I scored a 69. To say I was surprised would be mild.    I
 »contacted an aunt in Pittsfield, who has some connections in education,
 »and asked if she knew anyone I could call to question these results.
 »Unfortunately, my scores were not the most shocking part of the last few
 »months. My aunt gave me the number for David Driscoll. The
 conversations
 »with his staff and the staff at the testing office left me speechless.
 »
 »      On 11/23/98, I spoke with David Driscoll's office and was told
 »they have no information or input regarding the tests. Dr. Driscoll's
 »secretary transferred me to a woman in the Office of Teacher Testing
 »regarding the results of my scores. After explaining the situation, I
 was
 »told that "Although the score on the writing test are not consistent with
 »your other scores from this or other tests, there are three possible
 »reasons for the grade of 69."
 »
 »              First, I was asked if I had written an introductory,
 middle and
 »concluding paragraph.  I explained that I had written 4 paragraphs, one
 »which was an introductory and one which was a conclusion.  I was then
 told


 »that if   I had exceeded the 250 word limit or if I was under the 150 word
 »minimum   that I would have been automatically failed.  She continued by
 »reading   that the test clearly states, "The essay should be approximately
 »between   150 and 250 words in length."
 »
 »        Finally, I was told the third and most appalling reason for
 »failing.    "If the level of the vocabulary or word difficulty used
 exceeded
 »the average standard set forth by the state testing department, then that
 »would mean, to the graders, that you had taken the ideas from another
 »source, that you had previously read, either that day or on another day.
 »And that the use of long or more challenging words eliminated the
 »possibility that the thoughts could have been original."
 »
 »              At this point, I was angered and insulted. On 12/1/98, I
 »contacted Dr. Driscoll's office and again relayed the conversation to
 his
 »secretary.  I was put on hold and then transferred to Ms. Joy Simon, at
 »the Office of Testing. Ms. Simon identified herself as a supervisor and
 »asked me to ~elate my concerns.   I discussed point by point each of the
 »three items and after each item, I was told that those were the correct
 »possible reasons. Ms. Simon also said that a grade of 69 denotes
 »automatic failure, therefore those we're the only possible reasons.  I
 »questioned the validity of the third reason, vocabulary choice, and I was
 »again told that " ... high level vocabulary use allowed the graders to
 »easily eliminate plagiarized thoughts." I was so angry at having my
 level
 »of intelligence insulted, I hung up.
 »
 »              I do not know what type of teachers the schools of
 Massachusetts
 »are looking for, but from my conversations, I would guess they are
 focused
 »on finding average people.  I hope the information I have sent is in some
 »way helpful to your study.  Please contact me if you need further
 »information.  I would also be interested to know any further developments
 »as a result of your work.
 »
 »                                         Thank you!
