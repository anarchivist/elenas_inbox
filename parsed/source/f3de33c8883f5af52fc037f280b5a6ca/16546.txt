TEXT:
An all-points bulletin:

Ron Klain is hoping to find some. solid events for the VP to do, with hard
news value, the first week of September (when the President will still be
on vacation).  In particular, he thought it made sense to find things we
could do to show that we were implementing the budget agreement --
demonstrating how people can claim the HOPE scholarship, rolling out more
detail of the welfare-to-work provisions, announcing what's happening on
child health, etc.

Any ideas or proposals?

Many thanks ...
