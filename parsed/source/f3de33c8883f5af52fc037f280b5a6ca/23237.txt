                                    March 18, 1999


Q:   Yesterday, the Institute of Medicine (10M) released its study on medical marijuana_
      Can you tell us what it says and whether you will adopt its recommendations?

A:   Yesterday, 10M released its report on medical marijuana. The ONDCP Director
     McCaffrey asked for the study in January 1997, and we have been awaiting the report
     since then.

     We will carefully review the findings and recommendations ofthe report and will pay
     special attention to the 10M's call for more research into the effects of using marijuana.
     This is because the 10M emphasized in its report that although cannabinoids may help
     control pain and nausea, smoked marijuana is a crude drug delivery system that delivers a
     significant number of harmful substances, and that research may yield alternative delivery
     systems of cannabinoids that are safer and more reliable.

     More generally, our primary focus in this area is and must be to prevent youth use of
     marijuana by ensuring that youth know about this drug's dangers. We will continue our
     youth drug prevention efforts, including the Anti-Drug Media campaign, and continue to
     send the clear message to kids that drugs are wrong, dangerous, and can kill you.


Q:   You speak a lot about the will of the voters. Doesn't this report validate the
     message sent by the voters in the states that passed medical marijuana initiatives?

A:   Science, not the ballot box, should determine the practice of medicine. The report makes
     clear that there is little future for smoked marijuana as a medically-approved medicine.
     The report concludes that because of the health risks associated with smoking, smoked
     marijuana should not be generally be recommended for long-term use. Although
     marijuana smoke delivers THC and other cannabinoids into the body, it also delivers
     harmful substances, including most of those found in tobacco smoke. And to the extent
     that the report recommends certain clinical trials of smoked marijuana, it is not with the
     goal of developing marijuana as a licensed drug, but as a first step toward developing
     delivery systems that do not involve smoking, but alternative delivery systems that can
     deliver cannabinoids quickly, such as inhalers.


Q:   Will you reverse your position on medical marijuana or commit to more research as
     a result of the 10M report?

A:   We will continue to rely on science and the judgment of public health officials to guide
     our policy. And we will continue to support bona fide medical research of marijuana. It
     is important to note, that obtaining funding from NIH is a highly competitive process and

The federal government has established a process for determining the safety and efficacy
of drugs. It is a process that has been in place and has proven to work and protect the
American public. The 10M report provides important information on the scientific
benefits and risks into marijuana -- and will allow us to move on the use of marijuana and
cannabinoids for medical purposes based science, not politics.
