MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

fROM:                     Bruce Reed
                          Elena Kagan

SUBJECT:                  DPC Weekly Report


        1. Tobacco -- Record Verdict: A jury in San Francisco awarded a fonner smoker
$1.5 million in compensatory damages and $50 million in punitive damages in her lawsuit
against Philip Morris Co., the largest award ever in a suit filed by an individual smoker. The
verdict sent tobacco stocks reeling, and stunned tobacco analysts who considered this a
relatively weak case. This award could open the floodgates to similar claims against tobacco
companies and may increase the pressure on the tobacco industry to settle the federal claims
being brought by the Justice Department.

         2. Crime -- NY Gun Verdict: On Thursday, ajury in the Federal District Court in
Brooklyn found 9 gun manufacturers collectively liable for shootings with illegally obtained
handguns due to their negligent marketing and distribution practices. The case, Hamilton v.
Accu-Tek, represents the first time a jury has found gun makers liable on a theory of negligent
distribution. The suit was brought on behalf of 6 homicide victims and a severely wounded
teenager, all of whom were shot with illegally obtained handguns. The plaintiffs argued that
gun manufacturers oversupply the market in southern states with weak gun laws, enabling
traffickers to move guns up the "iron pipeline" to New York. Even though the plaintiffs
could not prove which manufacturers' guns were used in any of the specific incidents, they
argued that the defendants marketed and distributed handguns so negligently that they
contributed to the illegal gun trafficking that ultimately resulted in the shootings. Of the
more than 25 gun manufacturers named as defendants, the jury found 15 negligent but only 9
liable for any of the shootings. However, the jury awarded damages only to one plaintiff --
the surviving teen -- in the amount of $3.95 million, of which he is expected to collect about
$500,000. The Justice Department is currently reviewing the details of this decision, and we
intend to meet with them soon to discuss its implications on similar lawsuits recently filed by
New Orleans, Chicago, and other cities.

       3. Health Care -- Ganske HMO BiD: On Wednesday, Rep. Ganske and 10 other
Republicans introduced a new version of the Patients Bill of Rights, which denies access to
punitive damages for individuals suing plans for actions that result in harm. Although there
were other modest changes to the underlying bill, the legislation effectively retains the core
protections that Rep. Dingell has been advocating. Ganske and Dingell are contemplating a
                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion

                                                                                                     2

joint press conference after the recess to highlight the similarities of the two bills and to
underscore their belief that a compromise is easily within reach that can attract far more than
the 218 votes necessary in the House. In the Senate, however, any bill will have a much
lower threshold of protections. Our strategy should be to expedite House action in order to
influence the Senate bill.

        4. Health Care -- Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit: Chris Jennings reports that an
internal committee of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers Association (PhRMA)
will recommend that the association endorse the development of a Medicare prescription drug
benefit that would be administered privately. This recommendation apparently will be
forwarded to PhRMA's Board of Directors this week, and they may endorse the proposal as
early as Thursday of next week. If true, such an endorsement will increase momentum for the
inclusion of a prescription drug benefit in any Medicare Commission recommendation. On
Wednesday, Rep. Allen and 65 Democratic cosponsors introduced legislation that allows
pharmacists to provide prescription drugs to Medicare beneficiaries at Federal supply schedule
prices, creating a system similar to the one used by the Veterans Administration. Chris
believes that despite the fact that the drug industry can defensibly label this as something very
close to price controls, the bill will provide pressure to move forward with a more realistic
Medicare drug benefit. Chris is also hearing that some Republicans, like Senator Roth, are
also interested in a Medicare drug benefit for all beneficiaries.

        5. Children and Families -- FMLA Verdict: Kevin Knussman, a Maryland state
trooper who was denied the right to take 12 weeks of paternity leave, won a $375,000 jury
verdict against the state of Maryland. You met Knussman in August 1995, and the First Lady
wrote about his story in It Takes A Village. A state trooper for 18 years, Mr. Knussman
needed to take 12 weeks of family leave when his first daughter was born in 1994, but his
employer allowed him only 2 weeks because he was a man. The jury found that this conduct
violated the FMLA and constituted unlawful sex discrimination under Title VII. Maryland is
expected to appeal.

         6. Welfare Reform -- Elaine Kinslow: You recently asked about a news story
noting that Elaine Kinslow, the welfare-to-work success story from Indianapolis you saluted
in last year's State of the Union, had to change jobs when her employer lost its govemment
transportation grant. We have been in communication with that company, Pathfinder
Transportation Service, many times over the past year. As you may recall, Pathfinder ran a
van service for welfare recipients going to work, but lost its contract when the state decided
not to use state funds for this purpose and wrongly contended that federal rules prevented the
use ofTANF funds. To correct this misunderstanding, we worked with HHS, Labor, and
DOT to issue official joint guidance last spring explaining how TANF and other federal
resources can be used to address transportation challenges for people moving from welfare to
work, and made sure Pathfinder as well as the right Indiana state officials received copies.
You sent a letter to every governor stressing the importance of investing TANF savings in
                                                             Hex-Dump Conversion

                                                                                                     3

transportation, child care, and other services. Despite this infonnation, Indiana decided not
to continue the contract with Pathfinder. However, Pathfinder does receive funds from local
employers and job placement agencies, and is part of an Indianapolis consortium applying for
a federal Access to Jobs grant that DOT will consider this spring.

        7. Welfare Reform -- Washington State: A recent survey of individuals leaving welfare
in Washington shows high rates of employment and earnings, even as caseloads continue to
decline. Most people left welfare for employment (67 ), with the next most common
reasons being increased income through child support or SSI (9 ), and conflict with program
requirements (8). Seventy-one percent of those who left the rolls between April and August
1998 were still working when they were surveyed in the Fall of 1998, at an average wage of
over $8 an hour. Washington systematically contacts people once they've gone to work to
help them find opportunities to increase their skills through short-tenn community college
courses or other training and to find better jobs. The state also is investing TANF savings in
extensive supports for working families, and recently reallocated TANF funds to increase
reimbursement for child care providers who accept infants or provide care during
non-standard hours.
