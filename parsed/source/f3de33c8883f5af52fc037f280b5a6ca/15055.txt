TEXT:
I understand from an email Jim Dorskind forwarded to me that I am to
coordiante with you in drafting a response to the March 27 letter (which I
believe you have all seen) from Mary Francis Berry.  Please let me know
what you have in mind as far as the response language goes so that I can
begin work in drafting our letter.                .

Thanks,
Kyle Baker
