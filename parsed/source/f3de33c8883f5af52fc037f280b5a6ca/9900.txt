PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
TALKING POINTS FOR GLEN FOREST ELEMENTARY SCHOOL
OVERFLOW EVENT
FALLS CHURCH, VIRGINIA
October 31, 1998

        Acknowledgments: Principal Susan Fitz; Fran Jackson (teacher); Lori
Kuzniewski [kuz -nin-ski 1 (O&Mrs. K., 08 teacher in trailer) .

        I want to start by wishing all of you a Happy Halloween! You just
heard my weekly radio address, but I wanted to talk to you for just a few
more minutes about the issues that are at stake in the upcoming election
-- and the responsibility every American has to vote.

        This is not an ordinary time -- and this is not an ordinary
election. The congress we elect on Tuesday will be the first Congress of
the 21st century. The result of that choice will shape the way we live
for years to come.

        For nearly six years I have worked to bring this country together,
to move it forward, and to be a force for peace and freedom throughout the
world.   Today, because of the hard work of the American people and the
policies we put in place, we have nearly 17 million new jobs ... the
lowest unemployment in 28 years ... the highest homeownership in history
... the smallest percentage of our people on welfare in 29 years ... the
lowest crime rate in more than five years. And because we have held fast
to fiscal responsibility, we have the first balanced budget since Neil
Armstrong walked on the moon, and the smallest federal government since
John Glenn first orbited the earth.

        But this past year, extreme partisanship in Congress threatened the
progress we have worked so hard together to make. As I said in my radio
address -- we donO,t need two more years of partisanship -- we need two
more years of progress.

        We need a Congress that prepares our children for the future by
honoring its commitment to put 100,000 teachers in the classroom,
modernizing our schools, and insisting on high academic standards -- not a
Congress that wants teachers to do their job in trailers.   The last
Congress tried to slash our investment in education by more than $2
billion dollars -- we stopped them this year, but next year we need a
Congress that strengthens education.

        We need a Congress that ensures 75 million Baby Boomers can retire
in dignity without burdening our children by saving social Security first
   not a Congress that wants to squander our hard-won budget surplus on an
election year tax plan. And we need a congress that helps older Americans
live longer and healthier lives by passing my plan to let 55 to 65 year
olds buy into Medicare.
        We need a Congress that gives American families the security they
deserve by passing a Patient sO, Bill of Rights that protects your right to
see a specialist, to be treated in the nearest emergency room, and to have
the same doctor throughout a course of treatment -- not a Congress that
thinks accountants should make medical decisions.

       We need a Congress that protects our children from the deadly harm
  ·
of tobacco by passing comprehensive legisiation that prevents big tobacco
companies from targeting their multi-million dollar marketing schemes at
teenagers -- not a Congress that would stand by while 3,000 children start
smoking every day.

        We need a Congress that honors work and family by raising the minimum wage
 -- not a Congress that stands of the way of higher pay for 12 million
Americans.

        We need a Congress that restores the American peopleD,s faith in
government by passing meaningful campaign finance reform -- not a Congress
in debt to special interests.

        To prepare America for the 21st Century, we need a Congress that
puts progress ahead of partisanship.   This Tuesday, you have the power to
elect that Congress -- but only if you go out and vote.

       Thank you, Happy HalloweD,en, and remember to vote!
