TEXT:
Update:

As expected, OMB approved the draft directive.  Phil Caplan has it and
said it shouldn't be a problem getting it signed on Monday "assuming
everything checks out." Thanks for the vote of confidence, Phil!

Are we going to issue a separate statement?   Is there other paper I need
to prepare for Monday? Let me know.

Thanks.
