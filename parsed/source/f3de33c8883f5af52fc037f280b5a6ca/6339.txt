TEXT:
1.  Leslie Thornton and team were in NYC tOday meeting on single-sex
schools.  Both she and Norma Cantu report that the meeting went
well--Leslie says there is genuine openness to both an all boys school
(apparantly Crew has been thinking about this for some time, just doesn't
want to do it in response to OCR) and to a remedial justification.   Leslie
says the atmospherics were quite good, though the NYC lawyers are at least
as much of a problem as ours, if not more so.

Norma says the the ACLU is po'd at ED because it isn't proceeding on the
complaint. I take this to be a good sign.

There were some small items in the NYTimes and the NYPost indicating that
a federal team was coming up, and there may be some press tomorrow as well.

I've asked Leslie to e-mail you, Chuck and me a summary of what happened.

2.  Pauline Abernathy is setting up a briefing for a few ED staff on
tobacco with Josh Gottbaum; the impetus is to make sure they can brief
Riley before the NGA meeting on general tobacco issues.  He will be
dealing with gov's all weekend and wants to be prepared.  Do you think
you, Bruce or Tom need to be a part of that in any way?
