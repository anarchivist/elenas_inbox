As Children Are Cut From
                           Disability Rolls, New System Is
                           Challenged

                           By Barbara Vobejda
                           Washington Post Staff Writer
                           Wednesday, December 17, 1997; Page A14

                           Marion Cooper, a state disability officer in
Massachusetts,
                            recently pored over the file of a 15-year-old
high school
                            sophomore, trying to determine if the boy's
family should keep
                            receiving a monthly disability check from the
federal
                           government.

                           The teenager plays on his school basketball team
and gets
                           along with his classmates. But his IQ is low,
around 80, and he
                           has problems expressing himself and concentrating
on his
                           reading and writing assignments. That makes it
hard for him to
                           finish his homework, said Cooper, who could speak
about


                       children she reviews only if she did not reveal
their names.

                       When the boy's family applied for benefits six
years ago, he
                       was also disruptive in class. That, combined with
his IQ and
                       learning difficulties, made him eligible for
assistance. But now,
                       Cooper has determined, the boy no longer
qualifies.

                       Other than his behavior, which has improved a
bit, his
                       problems are largely unchanged. What has changed
is the
                       definition of what it means to be disabled: His
problems are
                       classified as "moderate" under a new law, and
that means his
                       benefits are being cut off.

                       The teenager is one of more than 135,000
low-income,
                       disabled children across the country who have
recently lost
                       Supplemental Security Income, a federal program
that sends a
                       monthly check averaging $436 to help families pay
for a child's
                       medical expenses, equipment or therapy, or to
allow parents to
                       stay home and care for their children.

                       But the process, stemming from enactment of the
1996 welfare
                       law, has triggered a major controversy in recent
weeks, with
                       thousands of pro bono lawyers mobilizing across
the country to
                       help families 'argue that their children are being
unfairly denied
                       assistance.

                       Advocacy groups have established toll-free phone
lines to
                       connect families with legal aid and some members
of Congress
                       are gearing up for a new round of hearings on the
subject next
                       year.

                       Not only do critics of the SSI cuts argue that
the law itself is
                       taking aid away from families who deserve it,
they also contend
                       that the federal government and state agencies
have botched
                       implementation of the measure. Children are being
denied


                       assistance based on hurried, inadequate reviews
of their cases,
                       advocates argue, and many are being discouraged
from
                       appealing if their benefits are denied.

                       "Tens of thousands of families with seriously
disabled children
                       have been denied due process and a fair chance to
appeal and
                       ov:erturn very wrong decisions," said Jonathan
Stein, a leading
                       advocate with Community Legal Services in
Philadelphia.

                       As evidence of the problem, advocates point to
discrepancies
                       among state agencies deciding the cases. In
Texas, for
                       example, when officials reviewed the cases of
more than
                       11,000 children, they decided that all but about
one-fifth of
                       them should lose their benefits. But in the
District, California
                       and a few other states, three-fifths or more of
the children were
                       allowed to keep their aid.

                       Those numbers, say the critics, prove that the
new law is being
                       arbitrarily enforced. And the stakes are high,
they argue,
                       because the decisions of these state officials
can translate into a
                       devastating loss of income for families who rely
on the check.

                       But precisely because the program does involve
substantial
                       money, many conservatives in Congress have
questioned
                       whether families in some cases have come to view
the check as
                       a steady source of income when their children do
not suffer
                       from major disabilities.

                       The issue arose several years ago amid concern
that the SSI
                       program for children was growing rapidly, from
300,000
                       children in the early 1990s to about 1 million
last year, with an
                       annual price tag of $5 billion. That growth had
followed a 1990
                       Supreme Court decision expanding the definition
of eligible
                       disabilities.


                         In response to that concern, Congress tightened
eligibility last
                         year, a move that was estimated to save $8
billion through
                         2002.

                         Among those who lost assistance is a 4-year-old
Phoenix girl,
                         Sarah Jean, who is being raised by her aunt,
Sherry Howard.
                         Sarah weighs just 29 pounds, has trouble speaking
and is still
                         not toilet trained, all the result of multiple
physical and cognitive
                         problems she has suffered since birth.

                         When Howard, a 42-year-old single mother, was
notified that
                         Sarah's benefits were ending,   "I was in a panic,"
she said. She
                         said she earns $800 a month working part time as
a private
                         health aide, taking care of another disabled
child. Working part
                         time allows her to ferry Sarah and another niece
she is caring
                         for, who also has developmental problems, to
therapy, special
                         schools and medical appointments.

                         She uses the federal aid to replace her lost
income and to buy
                         diapers and food supplements to help Sarah gain
weight.

                         "If she's so normal, why isn't she potty
trained?" Howard said.
                         "Why doesn't she ride a tricycle or play on
equipment at
                         school?"

                         Howard said she has tried to follow the steps to
appeal the
                         decision but has run into all sorts of obstacles.
She telephoned
                         for instructions on how to fill out one form,
only to have it
                         returned in the mail with a note that she had
filled it out
                         incorrectly. She loaded the children in the car
to take her
                         appeal papers to one Social Security office,
where she was
                         told she needed to deliver them to another
location 28 miles
                         away.

                         Stories like Howard's and the discrepancies in
cutoff rates
                         among the states prompted newly appointed Social


Security
                           Commissioner Kenneth S. Apfel to order a "top to
bottom"
                           review of the law and how it is being
implemented. That report
                           is scheduled for release in the coming days.

                           Apfel said in an interview that generally, most
decisions are
                           being made fairly.   "Some problems have been
identified," he
                           said. "Where problems are documented and changes
need to
                           be made, we will make them."

                           Apfel's report may address some immediate
questions, but the
                           broader issue is more complex: When are a child's
physical,
                           mental and emotional disabilities severe enough
to warrant
                           federal aid? How low must their lQs be? How
disruptive their
                           behavior?

                           Under the interpretation of the law issued by the
Clinton
                           administration, only children whose problems
cause "marked
                           and severe functional limitations" are now
eligible for SSl.

                           That means many children suffering from
behavioral and
                           attention problems or learning disabilities, and
some who are
                           mentally retarded, are losing their benefits.

                           The lS-year-old boy reviewed by Marion Cooper, for
                           example, has several problems deemed "moderate"
or "less
                           than marked." But under the new standard, they
must be more
                           severe.

                           "The most I could squeeze out of this kid was a
                           'less-than-marked' " problem with learning and a "
                           'less-than-marked' " problem with concentration,
said Cooper.

                           Such decisions can be trying for state officials,
who see lots of
                           borderline cases and must sort through
conflicting evidence.

                           Cooper ran into that problem when she reviewed
the files of a
                           lS-year-old girl who, according to her mother,
often shows
                           bizarre behavior, hears voices and suffers from


traumatic
                           nightmares. But the girl's teacher sent in an
"almost glowing"
                           report, saying the girl was doing well in school
and got along
                           well with other students, Cooper said.

                           Confused by the contradictions, Cooper sent for
another
                           report, this one from the girl's therapist. The
therapist reported
                           that the girl had been diagnosed with a psychotic
disorder and
                           was on medication to control it.

                           That, Cooper said,   "sent it over the edge."
Cooper allowed the
                           girl to continue receiving benefits. But even
now, she said,   "I
                           wonder if that was the right thing to do."
