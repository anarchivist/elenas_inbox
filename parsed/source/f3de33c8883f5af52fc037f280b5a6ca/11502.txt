TEXT:
I modified slightly our one pager from last week slightly for the VP press
paper including state-by-state #s.   I thought you might want to take a
look at this, and I also wanted to make sure the strategy I outlined in
the e-mail to you and Bruce last night sounded all right.

    VICE PRESIDENT URGES SENATE TO ENACT CLASS SIZE INITIATIVE TO
                PROVIDE (state # of teachers) NEW TEACHERS

            Gore Visits New York School To Call For New Efforts to Help Children Learn to Read

"Let's seize the moment to make a commitment to our children's education and America's future. Smaller
classes in the early grades can help children learn to read well, master the basics, and get the foundation
needed to slIcceed throughout their lives."
                                                                                   -Vice President Gore

An Opportunity for Bipartisan Progress in Education. With a key vote on the
Clinton-Core class size initiative expected next week, Vice President Gore called for the
Senate to take action to reduce class size in the early grades to a national average of 18 by
hiring 100,000 well-prepared teachers across the nation. Last year, with bipartisan
support, Congress enacted an important down payment on the Clinton-Gore plan by
approving a one-time $1.2 billion appropriation to help communities hire and support
30,000 teachers across the nation. Next week, Senators Murray and Kennedy will offer a
measure to help finish the job by authorizing $11.4 billion more to support 100,000
well-prepared teachers across the nation over the next six years.

Supporting Effective Local Planning. Under the initiative enacted into law last year,
school districts will begin to receive funding this July 1 in order to hire teachers to begin
reducing class sizes this fall. While last year's one-year appropriation provided an
important start on President Clinton's seven-year initiative, Congress has the chance to
support effective local planning by giving school districts the confidence they need that
funding will be available under this initiative for years to come. Communities will soon
begin to make decisions about how to implement this new initiative, and they will not be
able to use these funds as effectively as possible unless Congress makes a clear, long-term
commitment to reduce class size.                                                           .

Increased Funding for Communities Across the Nation. In this year's budget, President
Clinton and Vice President Gore proposed $1.4 billion to hire a total of 38,000 teachers
nationally and an estimated (#) teachers in (state.) Enacting the Murray-Kennedy amendment
would help finish the job on the Clinton-Gore plan by authorizing funding for school districts
across (state) hire (# ) teachers over the next seven years with funding levels rising to (# for
appropriation in FY2005)

Small Classes Make a Difference. Studies show that smaller classes help teachers provide
more personal attention to students and spend less time on discipline; as a result students learn
more and get a stronger foundation in the basic skills. According to studies, students from
smaller classes in North Carolina, Wisconsin, Indiana, Tennessee, and across the nation
outperformed their peers in larger classes. Moreover, research shows that reduced class size
makes the greatest difference for minority and disadvantaged students. For example, a national
study of 10,000 4th graders and 10,000 8th graders found the greatest impact of smaller classes
on inner-city youth.
