 TEXT:
 The attached languishing sex offender letter (which came out of the
 languishing sex offender directive) may actually be released soon.
 Contrary to the number on the document, it may be the tenth version!   I
 think Jose' sent you this last draft a while back, but just in case he
 didn't, here it is.   Rahm and Justice are ok with this version.

                                                     DRAFT

        Dear Governor _ _ _ _ __

                I write to you again to seek your assistance and cooperation on one of our most important
        responsibilities -- protecting our children from violent, sexual predators. Nothing is more
        threatening to our families and communities than criminals who move from neighborhood to
        neighborhood looking for children to prey on. That is why we must do everything we can to track
        these offenders and keep them away from our children.

                With your support we have already enacted criticallegislation-- such as the Jacob
        Wetterling Act, the Pam Lychner Act and Megan's Law -- to help our communities guard against
        repeat sex offenders. These laws now serve as the foundation for many state sex offender
        registration systems and for notifying communities of released sex offenders. Congress is now
        considering -- and I strongly support -- additional legislation to help states implement these
        registration systems and to make sure that sex offenders convicted in federal or military courts
        are covered by these laws.

                Equally important, my administration has worked hard to defend the constitutionality of
        state sex offender registration systems and community notification laws. And I am pleased to
        report that three federal courts of appeal have now upheld sex offender statutes in New Jersey,
        New York, Connecticut and Washington against constitutional challenges. My Administration
        will continue to fight to uphold these laws in the courts, including -- if necessary -- the United
        States Supreme Court.

                Last year, I directed the Attorney General to create a national sexual offender registry to
        join together the efforts being made in all fifty states to track sex offenders. Our national
        registry Will only be effective if every state participates and shares its data on sex offenders with
        other states. Although our interim registry became operational this spring, only 11 states are
        currently participating. With an incomplete registry, the law is unable to follow dangerous sex
        predators wherever they go -- state by state, neighborhood by neighborhood. I urge you to move
        expeditiously to participate in our national registry for the safety of the public and our children.

                I can not emphasize enough how important your continued support and personal
        involvement is to the success of these initiatives. Through our combined efforts, we can be
        confident that we will have taken decisive steps to help families across the country protect their
        children.
~,
                                                                                       Page 1 of2
