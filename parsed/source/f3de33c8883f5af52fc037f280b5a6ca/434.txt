SUBJECT:Possible Q&A on President's Campaign Finance Reform Aimouncement


QUESTION: Why are you announcing this now?

RESPONSE: This announcement is consistent with the President's had a long-standing
commitment to campaign finance reform and to changing business as usual in Washington. In
the last three years, the President repealed the tax loophole for lobbyist deductions, enacted
legislation to make the Congress and the White House live by the same laws Washington applies
to rest of the nation, signed legislation to require lobbyists to disclose how much they spend and
what they spend it on, enacted the line-Item Veto, and made it easier for millions of Americans to
register to vote.

In 1992, the President made campaign finance reform a central piece of his agenda and
throughout his first term he pressed the Congress to pass real, bipartisan legislation.

QUESTION: Both parties have been unable to resolve the campaign finance reform issue for
years, why should the American people expect you and Congress to take action next term?

RESPONSE: Last Congress we enacted Lobbying Disclosure, the Gift Ban, Congressional
Accountability Act, the Line-Item Veto. We have a proven track record of getting the job done
on political reform. Campaign finance reform is the last step, and most important step. I
believe that the Congress should and must make passage of McCain-Feingold a priority. I
challenge Congress to pass McCain-Feingold in the first six months of the 105th Congress, and
not deny the American people any longer.

QUESTION: There has been a lot of controversy about foreign contributions to the DNC
Do you think it is wrong to accept contributionsfromforeigners?

RESPONSE: I do believe the system is broken, and needs to be fixed. The voting public must
have confidence that the process is fair and works for them. That is why I agree with Senators
McCain and Feingold that real, bipartisan campaign finance reform must include effective
limitations on foreign contributions. If you can't vote you cannot contribute.

QUESTION: Does your support for limitations on foreign contributions mean that you will
direct the DNC to stop taking such contributions immediately and return those contributions
                                                                                 ex-Dump Conversion

received this elections cycle?

RESPONSE: It clear that the system is broken and that the rules need to be changed. I
support banning these contributions by law. We need quick action by Congress on this issue as
part of comprehensive, bipartisan campaign finance reform. (Question: should the President
commit to endorsing a ban on accepting contributions from all non-citizens -- on a unilateral
basis -- until Congress acts?)

QUESTION: How will you enforce this ban, and how broad will it be? For example, would
the ban include U.S. subsidiaries offoreign-owned corporations?

RESPONSE: Many of the specific details of the ban would have to be worked out with
Congress. However, the principle is clear, if you can't vote, you can't contribute -- individual
contributors would have to certify citizenship.

With regards to corporate contributions, the McCain-Feingold bill would ban PACs and
eliminate the current "soft money" system. Therefore, no corporate entity, foreign or domestic,
could make a Federal campaign contribution.

QUESTION: If you believe it is wrong to accept foreign campaign contributions, is it wrong
to accept foreign contributions to your legal defensefund?

RESPONSE: I do not allow the Legal Defense Fund to accept contributions from registered
lobbyists and P ACs. In addition, contributions are limited to $1,000. (Additional recommended
response is: "In the future, my legal defense fund will not accept contributions from foreign
donors.)

QUESTION: Aren't you, by endorsing the bipartisan commission as a fallback position,
undermining any real hope that McCain-Feingold will pass?

RESPONSE: I have been and remain a strong supporter of McCain-Feingold, and believe the
principles of that legislation are the key elements of real reform: spending limits; curbing PAC
and lobbying influence; free and discounted broadcast time; and ending the "soft money" system.
 I support a commission only as a last resort, if the Congress lacks the political will to pass
McCain Feingold. The benefit ofa Commission is that it takes the politics out of the reform
effort.

 QUESTION: Mr. President, you are challenging Congress to pass McCain-Feingold in the
first six months of the 105th Congress. Will this be a number one priority for your
 administration?

RESPONSE: This will be a key priority in my second term. I have long felt that this is one of
the most important issues facing the American political system. We must restore the faith of the
American people in their political leadership in order to build a bridge to the 21 st century.
