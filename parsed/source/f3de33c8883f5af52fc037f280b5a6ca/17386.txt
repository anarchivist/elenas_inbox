TEXT:
Harris Wofford's chief of staff (John Gomperts, a good guy) was about to
call Judy Winston so that Harris could sit down with her and brainstorm on
the race initiative. Now that Gomperts knows of our interest, he would be
happy to meet with us instead, or to meet with Winston and us together.
Any preference, to make this more of a DPC thing first, vs. bringing
Winston in right away?
