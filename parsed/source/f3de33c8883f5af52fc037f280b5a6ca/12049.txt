Here is the information you and Chris spoke about:

Medicare toll-free line is now available nationwide. The new
Medicare+Choice toll-free telephone line, 1800 MEDICARE, is now available
nationwide to help Medicare beneficiaries make informed decisions about
their health care. Callers to 1800 MEDICARE can:

Talk to a customer service representative in English or Spanish to get
general information about Medicare

Get updated information about Medicare health plan options in their
community

Get specific quality and satisfaction information about managed care plans

Receive referrals to agencies that can help with questions about Medicare
bills or more complex questions about health insurance.

The new toll free line is part of the National Medicare Education Program,
a comprehensive communications effort to help Medicare beneficiaries
better understand the new health care options that are part of
Medicare+Choice.

Chris wanted to make sure you knew that HHS is a little concerned that the
line may not be adequately staffed to handle the influx of calls that will
likely be associated with a Presidential announcement.

Please call with questions --   thanks.

Devorah
