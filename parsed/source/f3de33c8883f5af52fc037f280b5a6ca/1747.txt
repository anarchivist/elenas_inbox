TEXT:
Just wanted to make sure you were aware that we did submit three
scheduling requests for the President to do something for victims rights
weeks and they were all turned down. We asked tor him to do a ceremony, a
photo, and then a video.  The VP has agreed to do a photo-op on Friday,
April 18th, but it is a closed press event. Also, that day the Attorney
General is holding a ceremony at DOJ.
