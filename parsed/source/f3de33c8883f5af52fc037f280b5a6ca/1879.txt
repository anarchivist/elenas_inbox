                                Questions and Answers on Tobacco
                                          April 18, 1997


    Q.   Are you pushing for a tobacco settlement?

    A.   My staff are staying informed of the talks. From the beginning, we have said we would
         be willing to consider legislation if it was brought to us and it measured up to the final
         FDA rule. Any legislation would have to be as strong, comprehensive, and effective as
         what we are doing. The parties in these negotiations know our bottom line is protecting
         kids and reducing smoking among youth. And we are focused right now on defending
         our rule in court and moving forward to implement it.

    Q.   Should the tobacco companies get immunity as part of a global settlement?

    A.   I understand that the parties involved in these negotiations have talked about immunity.
         Any agreement will have to take into account the needs of all who are affected, and it's
         too early to tell what the terms might be. Let me tell you my focus: protecting children
         and the public health. That is what we are doing with the FDA rule to restrict access and
         limit advertising and appeal. We have 3,000 children and young people becoming
         regular smokers each day, and nearly 1,000 of them will have their lives cut short. We
         simply have to reduce the number of children who start smoking.

    Q.   How involved are your staff in these negotiations?

         We get regular and frequent updates about the status of the discussions. We have
         consistently impressed upon the parties that any agreement must be in the public interest
         and must lead to a reduction in the number of our children who start smoking.
