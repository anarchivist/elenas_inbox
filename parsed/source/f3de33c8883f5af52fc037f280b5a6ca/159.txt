     TEXT:
     The following revised draft SAP contains two changes, shown in bold:  (1) a
     reference to the Lott substitute that was adopted by the Senate on Thursday;
     and (2) a statement that the Department of Justice has proposed amendments to
     strengthen the bill against constitutional challenges. We expect to reseive
     from Justice today a letter to Senators proposing such amendments. We will
     circulate it with a short deadline as soon as we get it.  Please direct any
     comments on this revised SAP to Tim Johnson or to me by 11:30 today.  Thank
     you.   [Text follows.]
     PRINTER FONT 12 POINT ROMAN
     S. 1219 - Senate Campaign Finance Reform Act of 1996
     (McCain (R) Arizona and 4 cosponsors)

     The Administration strongly supports Senate passage of S. 1219,
     as amended by the Lott (for McCain, Feingold, and Thompson)
     substitute.
     This bipartisan legislation includes many proposals that have
     been endorsed by the President since 1992.  It will limit
     campaign spending, provide free and discounted broadcast time to
     candidates for Federal office, curb the influence of political
     action committees and lobbyists, and put an end to the "soft
     money" system.  S. 1219 will open the political process and shift


power from special interests to ordinary citizens.
The Department of Justice has proposed amendments to s. 1219 to
strengthen it against constitutional challenges.
