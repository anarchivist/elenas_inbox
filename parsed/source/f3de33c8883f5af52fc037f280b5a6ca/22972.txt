POTUS Statement on Title I
March 1, 1999


Todayu,s news of improvement in achievement for students in high-poverty
schools is welcome, but we must not be satisfied until all students reach
the challenging standards we set for them. We must work across party lines
to enact my Education Accountability Act and support this weekD,s Senate
vote to put 100,000 new, well-prepared teachers in the classrooms.

        While our education reform efforts are clearly headed in the right
direction, we must take these important steps to close the gap between
students and increase the pace of reform.
