                                          Electoral/Political Reform Ideas                     Hex-Dump Conversion

I. Make Election Day a Holiday

          In United We Stand, Ross Perot proposed that Federal elections to be held over two days -- Saturday and
Sunday -- so that working people could get to the polls more easily. A problem with holding the vote over the
weekend however is that it may offend the religious community. A more practical option would be to make election
day a holiday. Almost every democracy in the world declares a holiday for election day and they all have higher
turnout rates than the United States. While U.S. turnout rates were dropping from 65 percent to 55 percent in the
1960s and I 970s, rates in West Germany, Sweden, and Italy hovered around 90 percent While rates in other
countries were not quite as spectacular as in these three, they nevertheless remained on average 70 percent. Certainly
other factors are have contributed to these higher rates, but they cannot explain the whole disparity between the
United States and other democracies.

         It should be noted that the new democracies of Russia and South Africa have their election days as holidays.

         OMB estimates that the total cost to the government of a Federal holiday is $350 million per day. We do
not have estimates regarding the costs to the private sector. One option to reduce any cost impact to the public and
private sectors is to hold election day on Veterans Day (November 11).

2. Voting by Mail

         One option to encourage greater voter turnout is to urge all states to make voting by mail easier. In Oregon
on third of the states ballots in 1996 arrived by mail. In King County alone one fifth of all voters in that county
voted by mail -- up from 32,000 absentee ballots four years ago.

         There are two major concerns about increasing voting by mail. First, processing mail ballots is costly --
According to LA County Registrar Conny McCormack, while votes at a polling lace cost $1 each to process,
absentee ballots cost $8 to $10 per vote. However, we could expect some drop in cost if voting by mail be the norm
not the exception. Second, voting by mail could open up the electoral process to greater levels of fraud.


3. Foreign Lobbying

         Issue an Executive Order that would ban all executive branch officials from contact with registered
agents of foreign governments when the contact is for the purpose of influencing the U.S. government on
behalf of foreign governments. The order would include corporations that are either wholly-owned or
majority-owned by foreign governments. The definition of registered agents of foreign governments would
largely track the definition of agency in the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA), although it would be
limited to foreign governments, while FARA covers agents of all foreign "principals." The proposal would
include exceptions for lawyers engaged in litigation or administrative proceedings.

        Alternative options include: 1) maintaining a public record of lobbyists who contact any government
agency on behalf offoreign entities; 2) Fully enforce FARA.

4. Ban Foreign Lobbyists Contributions to National Campaigns

         Although U.S. law prohibits foreign entities from contributing to U.S. campaigns, lawyers and
lobbyists for foreign entities are not restricted from raising and distributing funds to candidates. In order to
reduce the possible influencing of Federal elections by foreign governments, the President could endorse a
ban on contributions to any candidate for Federal election who is a registered foreign lobbyist as defined
under FARA. The President could propose that a ban be included in the final, bipartisan campaign finance
reform. In addition, the President could challenge all Democrats to stop accepting such contributions'
immediately.
                                                                                             Hex-Dilmp COil version

5. Refonn the Federal Election Commission

         There is strong academic agreement that the Federal Election Commission needs refonn. In its current fonn
it is paper tiger without real teeth. Currently, there are six member of the committee that the President appoints.
Three Republicans and three Democrats. One proposal would be to add one independent member and give the
agency criminal prosecution powers to enforce the election laws. A more modest refonn proposal would be to
exclude fonner national and state party officials (congressional campaign committees included) from serving on the
Commission.


6. Pass Bipartisan Campaign Finance Refonn ..

         The President's position on this is clear and we have a developed strategy. One issue that is not yet
resolved, however, is the timing regarding the President's petition to the Federal Election Commission to ban "Soft
Money." The petition is ready to be sent, however, Senator McCain has expressed some reservations regarding
timing because of concerns that the President's petition will appear to be partisan grandstanding since Republicans
raise twice as much "Soft Money" as Democrats.


7. Nationallnitiative/Referendum

          Referenda allow the people to pass judgement on laws passed by their representatives, while initiatives
allow the people to originate legislative proposals. Some initiatives ("direct") translate the public will into binding
legislation, while others ("indirect") create agenda items to which bodies can respond. Today, important questions
at the state level are routinely submitted to direct judgement of the people. In 49 states, voters must approve
changes in state constitutions. 21 states have statutory initiatives; 18 states have constitutional initiatives; 25 states
have popular referenda. In addition, state legislatures often put legislative referenda on the ballot, and governors
often put initiatives to circumvent legislative obstacles. There has been a surge in the use of these devices at the state
level since the mid-1970s, past the previous peak registered in the early years of this century to a new record high.
While the evidence is mixed on the effect of referenda and initiatives on stimulating voters to Rlrn out, these forms of
public participation are seen by the people as increasing legitimacy of public institutions and the policy outcomes that
flow from them.

          In the past, we have recommended the President endorse a constitutional amendment that would penn it
both referenda and indirect initiatives but not direct initiatives. Referenda would give the people a chance to nullify,
by a vote of 60 percent, legislation already passed by the House and Senate and signed by the President. Indirect
initiatives would give the people a chance to craft specific legislative language which, once approved by a 60 percent
majority, would have to receive up or down consideration by the U.S. Congress within 90 days. This proposal bears
only on legislation; it leaves untouched existing mechanisms for and proposing and passing constitutional
amendments

         A more detailed white paper is available on this proposal.
