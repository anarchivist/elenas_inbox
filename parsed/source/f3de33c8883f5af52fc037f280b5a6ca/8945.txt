Subject:         Re: did you ever reach David Beier reo Hollywood?

Toby told me the following:

In 2/97, the President went to Paramount studies to talk about the
portrayal of cancer story lines in the media.  He wound up blasting them
for their portrayal of smoking, and was received with hostility.   Toby
said it took them a long time to recover from that.

In 12/97, he met with the head of the screen actors and writers guilds,
along with Kristi Turlington, and some tv producers (about 7 people in
all) to discuss the portrayal of smoking in the media.  (Kristi's father
died as the result of smoking, and she has done a PSA for the CDC on
smoking) .

Richard Mazur, head of the screen actor's guild, is most interested in the
issue, and has made an effort to hold a few meetings with people in
Hollywood, and is working to educate people by bringing in doctors to
explain things, etc.   Toby also noted that a few CA legislators have held
hearings on the issue.

The VP's office got no where talking to Jack Valenti (head of the motion
pictures association) . Toby says that his indifference is definitely part
of the problem.

Toby said that they haven't taken any action since 12/97.     She said that


except for Mazur, they encountered resistance and tremendous hostility
from people.
