I.    PURPOSE

      To highlight the support from the state of California and the high tech industry for your
      national standards and testing proposal.

II.   BACKGROUND

      You will be hosting a round table discussion with California educators and high tech
      CEOs in front of an audience of 150 members of the education and business
      communities. The Vice President and Secretary Riley will also be participating. This is
      an opportunity for you to receive the endorsement of Delaine Eastin, the California State
      Superintendent of Public Instruction, and over 200 high tech industry leaders for your
      national standards and testing proposal.

      California Superintendent Endorsement:
      The California endorsement means that nearly 20 percent of the Nation's students are
      committed to participate in the standards and testing program. Superintendent Eastin's
      endorsement makes California the fourth state, after Maryland, Michigan, and North
      Carolina, along with the Department of Defense schools, to commit to participate in the
      national tests. California public schools serve over five million students, representing
      over 11% of the nation's public school enrollment.

      High Tech Industry's Endorsement:
      John Doerr, partner in the venture capital firm of Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield & Byers, will
      announce that a group of over 200 high-tech industry leaders who hire graduates from
      across the country have endorsed the President's standards and testing initiative.
      Moreover, the industry leaders will write to all governors, chief state school officers, and
      state board of education chairs calling on them to support national standards. Doerr will

       be joined via audio feed from San Jose's Stonegate School by Jim Barksdale, CEO &
       President of Nets cape Communications, Mayor Susan Hammer, and students who will
       participate in the tests in 1999. Other CEOs will participate in the event at the White
       House and from San Jose. The CEOs coming to the White House will also meet with the
       Vice President and Erskine separately. This is the fourth meeting the Vice President has
       had with John Doerr and other high tech industry representatives since January. In these
       meetings the Vice President specifically sought their support on this issue.
