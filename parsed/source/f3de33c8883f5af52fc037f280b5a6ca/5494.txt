                                 Questions and Answers
                                    December 6; 1997


Q:   Why did the President direct the Attorney General and the Secretary of Education
     to develop a new study on school crime and violence? Doesn't the federal
     government already issue several studies on this topic?

A:   Yes, the federal government does sponsor several studies that provide important
     information on crime, violence and drug use in schools or among youth. Key studies
     include: the National Institute on Drug Abuse's annual Monitoring the Future survey,
     which predominantly measures drug use; the Center for Disease Control's 1993 and 1995
     Youth Risk Behavior Survey; the Bureau ofJustice Statistics' National Crime
     Victimization Survey; and several surveys by the National Center for Education Statistics.

     While all of these studies provide useful information, they do not provide parents, schools
     and lawmakers with an annual baseline from which to measure the level of violence in
     our schools. For instance, there is no study that specifically tracks homicides in or near
     schools on an annual basis. Also, these studies and others are published on different
     timetables, and they do not all measure the same activities or reach the same students.
     So filling-in the information gaps and establishing an annual baseline is a big
     improvement.

Q:   Can you clarify what new tools the President recently signed into law to help fight
     juvenile crime?

     Over the past month or so the President has signed appropriations bills that
     contained key components of the anti-gang, youth violence and drug strategy he
     released last February. These include:

            (1) Inthe Commerce-Justice-State appropriations bill, a new $250 million
            juvenile crime block grant that specifically sets aside more than $110 million
            for new prosecutors to curb gang violence and for juvenile courts to help
            fund probation officers. These funds will help other cities replicate crucial
            aspects of Boston's successful youth violence strategy.

            (2) In the Labor-HHS appropriations, $40 million for the Department of
            Education's 21st Century Learning Centers. This initiative will help more
            schools to stay open later and on weekends, so that kids can be supervised
            during the crucial hours of 3pm to 8pm when most juvenile violent crime
            occurs.

            (3) In the Treasury-Postal appropriations, $195 million for an unprecedented
            paid media campaign that will us to use the full power of the media --
                                                                        Automated Records Management System
                                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion

               including prime time TV spots and the Internet - to teach kids about the
               dangers of drugs.                         '
         These aren't the only initiatives in this years appropriations. There are other
         important tools - such as new funds for gun tracing, the Office of Juvenile Justice
         and Delinquency Prevention, Boys and Girls Clubs - but these are certainly some of
         the most important.

    Q:   If key components of the Administration's juvenile crime proposals were recently
         signed into law, :why is the Administration still pushing for juvenile crime
         legislation.

         Certainly, the recently signed appropriations bills included key Administration
         proposals to fight juvenile crime and drugs, but these measures are simply a first
         step. We'still need a long-term strategy to attack youth violence and
         gangs - similar to the successful Boston model.

         Also, there are still important measures on which Congress has not acted.
         Congress has not passed the President's proposal to ban violent juveniles from
         buying guns on their 21st birthday. And Congress has not passed some of the new
         prosecutorial tools and tough penalties that President has called for -such as
         expanding the use of racketeering statutes (i.e., RICO) for gang-related offenses,
         and increasing penalties for using kids to sell drugs, selling drugs to kids, or selling
         drugs in or near a school.

         There's still a lot more we can - and should - do on juvenile crime.

    Q:   The'President pushed hard for passage ofthe Gun-Free Schools Act, which called,
         for the mandatory expulsion of any student caught bringing a gun to school.
         Shouldn't this law have prevented an incident like the one in Kentucky? And does
         this incident prove .that the Gun-Free Schools Act is a failure?

         I don't think so, As the President said, we may never learn why the teenager in
         Kentucky did what he did -- and we will always speculate what we might have done to
         prevent this terrible tragedy. Would tough enforcement, metal detectors or simply
         paying closer attention to troubled students have prevented this or other shootings?

         What we do know, however, is that the Gun-Free Schools Act is making a difference.
         Although we're still measuring its long-term impact and effectiveness, preliminary
         statistics show that nearly 6,000 students have been expelled for bringing a weapon to
         school. So while the Gun-Free Schools Act can't' provide a guarantee against tragic
         shootings, it has helped make thousands of schools and students safer.
