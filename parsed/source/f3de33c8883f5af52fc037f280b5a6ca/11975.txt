TEXT:
ED staff who sat in on Sec Riley's meeting with the Hispanic Caucus report
that it went well.  The only major issue of contention continues to be
whether the administration will use the "three-year goal" language in our
ESEA legislation.  Caucus members said that they were ok with any other
steps we took to "operationalize" the goal (I'm not clear on exactly how
that was described to the caucus).

I expect we'll get a fuller read-out on this in today's ESEA meeting.
