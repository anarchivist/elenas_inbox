TEXT:
have you looked at the brief yet? I looked at it early this am
and have no problems with it, although I know that Nancy will be
unhappy about the argument that we can't move replacement timber
now.  Jean couldn't get an answer out of the Forest Service
yesterday and i suspect God couldn't either, had she tried.
