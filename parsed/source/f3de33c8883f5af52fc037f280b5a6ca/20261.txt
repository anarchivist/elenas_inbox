TEXT:
1) Monday Speech: Lowell Weiss wants to sit down to discuss what you'd
like to see in the President's remarks.  I've already brought him up to
speed on where we are, and have given him our latest paper, so it
shouldn't take too long.

2) Amendment Comments for JR: We should discuss the comments we've gotten
on the amendments JR asked us to examine. Josh would like to participate
in this discussion.
