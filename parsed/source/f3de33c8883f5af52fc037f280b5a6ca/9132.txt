TEXT:
Today we announced your executive order creating a President's Council on
Food Safety, which will develop a comprehensive strategic plan for federal
food safety activities and will ensure that federal agencies annually
develop coordinated food safety budgets.  In addition, as one of its first
orders of business, you directed the Council to review the recent National
Academy of Sciences report, which recommended legislation to establish a
unified office for managing food safety programs to be headed by a single
official. The story on the Council was carried in Tuesday's New York
Times. Today, the three co-chairs of the Council, the Secretary of
Agriculture, the Secretary of Health and Human Service, and the Director
of the Office of Science and Technology policy, held a press conference at
USDA, which was attended by all three networks and CNN.  The response by
the consumer advocates and the industry groups has been generally
positive.
