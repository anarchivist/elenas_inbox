TEXT:
I just received a note from scheduling that our World AIDS Day proposal
was regretted.  The AIDS Office is working on an AIDS orphan message,
which is what Ann Lewis wants.  I'm not sure if they'll come up with
anything, though, and I think it may be helpful for you to try to at least
confirm that the President will do something for World AIDS Day. Thanks.
