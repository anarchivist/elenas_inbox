At the Friday afternoon meeting, John Hilley proposed that leg affairs
coordinate an effort to get at least 40 Senators to sign a letter saying they'd
vote to uphold a Byrd rule challenge against the FLSA and privatization
provisions.

I spoke to Joan Huffer of Senator Daschle's staff this weekend to see if the
Senate Parliamentarian had ruled on these provisions already.  She said he has
not, but she would work with Budget and Finance Committee staff to get a ruling
from the Parliamentarian as soon as possible.  (The Parliamentarian had
previously ruled on the Senate version of privatization (which applied only to
the state of Texas), and had indicated that he was skeptical of FLSA, but had
not actually ruled on the exact House-passed provisions.)

I did not tell Joan about the letter strategy -- Janet, I wasn't sure if we
were ready, particularly since you didn't raise it at our Saturday meeting with
House Dems.  Janet and Susan, I assume you'll coordinate the strategy to get
the signatures?
