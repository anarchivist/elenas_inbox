I couldn't do each year individually because there is a food stamp cost of
living adjustment (which actually our previous analysis from HHS ignored) .
But I think this works pretty well.  I got some numbers from Jeff Farkas
to do it.

Recall that the number of hours of work required per week increases from 20 hours in 1997 and
1998 to 25 hours in 1999, and 30 hours in 2000 and thereafter. However, the increase from 20
to 30 hours can be in the form of training directly related to employment, so it is possible to
argue that 20 hours is the more useful reference point. But below is the 30 hour chart.
