      TEXT:
      The Republican Leadership continues to charge that the President is either
      not allowing his Commission members to vote their conscience OR not
      exhibiting sufficient leadership to push his members to vote for the
      Breaux package.   (Yes, these are not at all consistent, but they seem to
      represent a strategy aimed at suggesting that everything we are doing
      around Medicare is political.)    Lott stated that that the absence of 11
      or more votes for the Commission assures that necessary Medicare reforms
      will not be possible in this Congress. He suggested it was up to the
      President to deliver the necessary votes.

      Congressman Thomas charged that the White House was instructing
      Commission members not to support something they otherwise would.  After
      Thomas' comments, the press spotted Stuart Altman and ran over to him to
      get his side of it.  Stuart said that such a suggesting was ridiculous.
      He emphasized that no one in the White House has told him to do anything.


     He said he has consistently outlined the issues he cares about -- the need
     for ouside revenues {such as the surplus}, the need for a prescription
     drug benefit for all beneficiaries, and the need for a defined benefit in
     any program reform, such as premium support.  He pointed out that it has
     been the Commission who has not been responsive.  He said that he and
     Laura have been quite clear that they would be open to premium support
     models, but they had to be workable and their impact on the program and on
     beneficiaries had to be well understood before proceeding.

     We are already getting some questions about these comments.  Gene and I
     believe it should be a two-fold response to the questions about the
     Republicans' Medicare rhetoric:

     DRAFT ANSWER:   First, any suggestion that the White House has pressured
     its members to take any position is both inaccurate and insulting.  Our
     appointees are well respected health care experts who have long-standing
     opinions on this important issue.  Their positions have not changed or
     altered at any point during the work of the Commission.

     The President's Commission members, particularly Dr. Tyson and Dr. Altman,
     have indicated an openness to new, competitive reforms, but they have also
     underscored their belief that:
     (1) there be new and substantial revenue dedicated to strengthen the
     financial health of the program, such as the President's proposal to
     allocate 15% of the surplus to Medicare,
     {2} there always be a defined benefit and analysis be provided about the
     impact of any structural reforms on beneficiaries and providers; and {3}
     there be a long overdue and affordable prescription drug benefit available
     to all beneficiaries. To date, our Members have informed us that their
     minimum requirements have not been met.  Our hope, of course, is that this
     situation will change.  But, once again, we do not feel it serves any
     fruitful purpose for the White House to comment on every individual iterat
     ion of the Commission's recommendations.  We look forward to learning
     about the final deliberations of the Commission.

     IN ANOTHER DEVELOPMENT, Senator Breaux just circulated the Medicare
     actuary's initial projection of savings from two of the most recent Breaux
     plans. We are circulating a brief summary of this estimates for your
     review under separate cover. However, it is important to note that our
     HCFA actuary is now assuming some savings -- in the range of between $26 -
     $37 billion over five years -- for a premium support model.  {This is
     largely because the Breaux staff have altered their original proposal to
     make it more structurally defensible, albeit there are still problems.}
