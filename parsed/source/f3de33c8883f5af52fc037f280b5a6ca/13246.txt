     EXAMPLES OF REDUCED GOVERNMENT SERVICES DURING A SHUTDOWN


A.     National Park Services facilities are closed.

       1.     On an average day, 383,000 people visit National Parks Services facilities.

       2.     Potential per day losses for businesses in communities adjacent to National Parks
              could reach $14 million, due to reduced recreational tourism.

       3.     As a result of the closing of Yosemite National Park, Mariposa County declared a
              state of emergency last week and asked Governor Wilson of California to declare
              the county an economic disaster area and therefore eligible for state aid.

B.     Access to and use of National Forests is restricted.

       1.     Forest Service operated campgrounds, monuments, and visitors centers are closed
              in the 155 National Forests.

       2.      No timber sales activities, including preparation, advertising and award of sale are
             . occurring. Harvesting will continue for sales that were awarded prior to the
               shutdown.

C.     FHA mortgages and housing vouchers are halted.

       1.     On an average day, the Federal Housing Administration processes 2500 home
              purchase loans and refinancings totaling $200 million worth of mortgage loans for
              moderate-and low-income working families nationwide.

       2.      In January, HUD will be unable to renew 49,000 vouchers and other Section 8
       rental subsidies for low and moderate income households which could lead to the
       eviction of these families.

D.     Applications for passports are not being processed and foreign visitors are unable to
       obtain visas.

       1.     On an average day, the State Department receives 23,000 applications for
              passports.

       2.     On an average day, the State Department issues 20,000 visas to visitors who
              spend on average of$3,000 on their trips for a total of$60 million. Foreign

            students studying in the United States and home for the holidays are unable to
            obtain visas to return to the United States for their classes.

E.   Some Veterans Benefits will not be delivered.

     1.     While the December 22 Continuing Resolution provided funding for certain
            benefits and payments, it expires tomorrow (January 3); consequently, contractors
            providing services and supplies to hospitals will not be paid and benefits for
            January will not be paid on February 1.

     2.     In addition, approximately 170,000 veterans did not receive their December
            Montgomery GI Bill education benefits and will not receive benefits in January.
            Funding has also lapsed for processing veterans' claims for educational and
            rehabilitation counseling, and enabling veterans to obtain V A guaranteed home
            loans.

F.   Programs for the Elderly are at risk.

     1.     Some 600,000 elderly Americans potentially face loss of "Meals on Wheels,"
            transportation and personal care provided by HHS' Administration on Aging
            because a Continuing Resolution has not been passed.

G.   Contractors handling Medicare claims will not be paid.

     1.      Approximately 24,000 contractor employees are involved in paying Medicare
             claims (which average about $3.5 billion per week) and most will have to
           . self-fund payroll and other expenses or stop their activities.

H.   Federal funds to states for Medicaid will be limited.

     1.     On December 27, States received only 40 percent of the estimated quarterly
            payment for Medicaid. Without further action, the Federal match for Medicaid
            and its 36 million beneficiaries, including 18 million children, will run out in late
            January.

I.   State-run Unemployment Insurance operations are threatened.

     1.     By the end of this week, 11 states (plus DC and the Virgin Islands) will have
            exhausted Federal funds for administering the unemployment insurance program
            (NJ, AL, RI, IN, KS, AK, MA, NH, VT, UT, NM). In order to keep
            unemployment offices open, states would have to fill the gap with their own
            funds. Otherwise, unemployment offices would have to close and benefit
            payments would cease. Kansas has already closed its unemployment office.

                                              2
                                            Hex-Dump Conversion


     2.     If State unemployment offices are closed, all activity stops. No new claims are
            taken; no continuing benefit claims are paid; and tax collections stop.


J.   Grants for state JOBS, social services, and child pry>tection programs will not be
     made.

     1.     States are due $630 million in Social Services Block Grants today (January 2).
            These funds are used by the states to provide a variety of health and social service
            programs to low-income populations.

     2.     HHS will not be providing grants of $248 million to states today (January 2) for
            JOBS programs to help those on welfare to obtain training and work.

     3.     As of today (January 2), states will lose $74 million in quarterly grants for
            discretionary child protection programs. Such programs help states respond to
            more than 2.5 million reported cases of child maltreatment each year.

K.   The FCC is substantially closed.

     1.     Each week, 1,000 consumer inquiries and complaints go unanswered.

     2.     Processing of spectrum licenses and ongoing deregulatory efforts by the FCC are
            deferred, possible delaying the availability of new communications services.

L.   Food and other supplies for prisons may become unavailable.

     1.     Many vendors to Federal prisons bill once a month and bills for supplies provided
            during the shutdown will come due in early January. Absent an appropriation,
            these bills cannot be paid and some vendors may be unable to continue to deliver
            goods and services.

M.    Federal workers are being penalized.

     1.     Due to Congress' failure to approve short-term funds by Friday, December 29,
            over three-quarters-of-a-million Federal employees only received half their usual
            pay (or less because of withholdings).

            a.     They received pay for December 10 to 15, but not December 16 to 23.

            b.     Without Congress enacting additional funding measures by late this week,
                   these emergency and furloughed employees will not receive pay for the


                                              3
                                         Hex-Dwnp Conversion

                   current paYJ?eriod (December 24 to January 6) on time, i.e. next week.

     2.     The three-quarters-of-a-million of Federal employees consist of:

            a.     480,000 emergency workers who are working and whom the government
                   is obligated to pay, but who can't be paid until Congress approves funds to
                   end the shutdown (this includes Federal law enforcement officials, prison
                   guards, social security workers and those providing care at veterans
                   hospitals); and

            b.     280,000 non-emergency workers who are currently furloughed and not
                   being paid (and who have no guarantee they will receive back pay unless
                   Congress acts to approve back pay).

     3.     The vast majority of these workers cannot afford this big cut in their take-home
            pay, especially during and immediately after the holidays.

     4.     20,000 employees were furloughed when their agencies exhausted carryover
            funding in late December; they will receive substantially complete Pilychecks for
            the pay period ending December 23 (but not future pay periods).

N.   The Smithsonian museums, Kennedy Center, Holocaust Museum, National Zoo, and
     National Gallery of Art (except for the Vermeer exhibit which is supported by private
     funds) are closed.

     1.     On an average day, 80,000 people visit the Smithsonian Museums on the Mall
            and the National Zoo.

     2.     On an average day, 12,400 people visit the National Gallery of Art.

     3.     On an average day, 6,900 people visit the JFK Center for Performing Arts. (This
            does not include individuals who pay to attend performances, for which the
            Kennedy Center will continue to be open.)

     4.     On an average day, 3,000 people visit the Holocaust Museum.

o.   Activities in Foreign countries are hampered.

     1.     Because local residents working for the United States cannot be paid, many of
            them will not report for work. This will adversely affect:

            a.     Support for Congressiop.al trips abroad since drivers, security personnel,
                   interpreters and general support personnel are generally hired locally.


                                             4
                                        Hex-Dump Conversion

            b.     Security provided by foreign service nationals for Federal employees,
                   offices and homes.

            c.     Quarterly utility payments due the first week of January which will result
                   in loss of services and evictions.

     2.     Legal actions are anticipated by at least some local residents who cannot be paid.

P.   Programs for Native Americans are stopping.

     1.     The Bureau of Indian Affairs cannot make general assistance payments due to
            about 53,000 Indian families and individuals or to guardians and foster families
            that care for about 3,000 Indian children.

Q.   "Deadbeat Dads" are getting a holiday through the shutdown.

     1.     The Federal Parent Locator Service, to which 20,000 cases per day on average are
            referred, is closed.

R.   Assistance to Small Businesses is interrupted.

     1.     On an average day, more than 260 small businesses are not receiving SBA
            guaranteed financing totaling more than $40 million ofloans.

     2.     On an average day, more than 90 small businesses are prevented from bidding on
            government contracts because they are unable to receive SBA guaranteed bid
            bonds which allow them to bid on those contracts.

     3.     On an average day, 1,200 small business owners are not receiving SBA-sponsored
            training and counseling normally available to them.

     4.     Banks issuing federally-guaranteed loans from SBA, VA, and HUD have stopped
            receiving default claim payments. In addition to potential cash flow shortages to
            participating banks, this will result in higher costs to the Government, because the
            claims will accrue additional interest during the furlough period.

     5.     No out year payments for Advanced Technology Program awards made in prior
            years to more than 100 innovative, high-tech companies are being made totaling
            $68 million.

S.   Many protections for American workers are suspended due to the shutdown of much of
     the Labor Department. For each day of the shutdown:

                                            Automated Records Management System
                                            Hex-Dump Conversion
          1.     Approximately 840 veterans will not be placed in jobs through the Veterans' Job
                 Training Assistance program which is closed.               '

          2.     Since the start of the shutdown, over 1,000 workplace safety complaints have
                 gone unanswered.

          3.     160 workplace safety and health inspections are not being performed.

          4.     Three OSHA-approved state programs have shut down because of a lack of
                 matching federal funds (New Mexico, Hawaii, Puerto Rico) and three others
                 (South Carolina, Tennessee and Utah) will shut down this week.

          5.     170 worker complaints of minimum wage and overtime violations remain
                 unresolved.

          6.     3,500 investigations involving pension, health and other employee benefit plans
                 have been suspended.

          7.     500 requests for information and assistance from pensioners participating in plans
                 with $3 trillion in assets are going unanswered.

     T.   Important environmental protections are curtailed due to the shutdown. For each day
          of shutdown, on average:

          1.    As a result of exhausting carryover funds, EPA is now preparing to furlough 2800
                Superfund staff which will mean that up to 32 ongoing remedial cleanup actions
                being lead by Superfund staff will be shut down on January 2. Cleanup actions
                will stop at additional sites if the shutdown continues. Work at 26 sites will
                continue to address immediate threats to life or property.

          2.    All EPA non-Superfund civil environmental enforcement actions have stopped.
                On an average day, $3 million of fines or injunctive relief against polluters will be
                lost and 8 Federal environmental compliance inspections of polluters' facilities
                will not be conducted.

          3.    About 240 calls each day to EPA's "hotline" for drinking water contamination
                outbreaks are going unanswered. Five other "hotlines" receiving thousands of
                calls each month are shut down, depriving the public of potentially critical
                information on pesticides and toxic substances, asbestos in schools, and other
                public health information.

          4.    EP A-issued permits for air, land, and water pollution limits nationwide cannot be


                                                  6
                                                 Automated Records Management System
                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion

                   approved and necessary EPA technical assistance to States for State-issued
                   pennits cannot be provided. Approvals of some companies' activities will be put
                   on hold while their competitors with approved pennits are allowed to operate.

             5.     All emergency exemptions for farmers to use restricted pesticides to fight pest
                    outbreaks have stopped, potentially resulting in severe crop damage and loss of .
                    income.

        U.   hnportant Education programs are shut down.

             1.    Civil rights violations in schools cannot be investigated. In an average week, the
                   Education Department's Office for Civil Rights receives about 100 new
                   complaints of discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, age
                   or disability. These complaints cannot be investigated or remedies sought. The
                   buildup up of backlogs delays justice for individuals. .

             2.     Help cannot be given to parents and teachers. During an average week, the
                    Department of Education answers 8,000 inquiries from teachers, school
                    administrators and concerned parents, seeking help with education problems that
                    cannot be answered during the shutdown.

        v.   American exporting businesses are being disadvantaged during a shutdown.

             1.    On an average day, more than 30 export licenses with a value of$30.5 million
                   that would otherwise have been approved by the Bureau of Export Administration
                   will not be acted upon.

             2.    On an average day, more than $92 million in sales of U.S. products are blocked
                   due to inability of the Department of State's Defense Trade Center to process
                   license applications for the export of defense articles and dual-use technology.
                   During the previous shutdown, more than 4000 export applications were delayed
                   and part of that backlog was still being processed prior to the shutdown.

             3.    On an average day, more than 2500 telephone calls and faxes from u.S.
                   businesses seeking export advice, infonnation and counseling are not being
                   responded to by the Bureau of Export Administration or the International Trade
                   Administration due to the shutdown.

        w.   The Securities and Exchange Commission will soon shutdown.

             1.    The SEC's funds are expected to be exhausted by the end of next week, causing
                   review of an estimated thfee-fourths of pending and new SEC filings for the
                   month of January to be delayed. A delay in review of filings for initial public


                                                     7
                                       Hex-Dwnp Conversion

            offerings, mergers and acquisitions, and filings for new debt or stock offerings
            would eventually impact the flow of corporate financing and capital fonnation.

X.   Vital legal and law enforcement functions are shut down or will be delayed.

     1.     FBI training of state and local law enforcement officers has ceased.

     2.     Investigations of employment discrimination on the basis of race, sex, religion, or
            national origin are suspended.

     3.     Processing of prison grant applications has slowed down. Appropriated funds to
            assist states in constructing and bringing on line new prison facilities will be
            delayed.

     4.     Collection activities by Justice's Civil Division have ceased. The cessation of
            collection activities means that the Treasury receives less income and thus the
            deficit actually grows. In addition, individuals who owe the government money
            can withhold payment without any particular penalty.

Y.   Social Security Administration is not processing new or replacement Social Security
     numbers.

     1.     The Social Security Administration processes on a daily basis an average of
            60,000 new and replacement Social Security numbers. Social Security numbers
            are required for tax, employment eligibility, and other purposes. Processing and
            verifying of Social Security numbers is not occurring during the shutdown.

Z.   Key statistical data are not being collected and disseminated.

     1.     Important statistical releases have been delayed -- most importantly the Bureau of
            Economic Analysis' Gross Domestic Product and Corporate Profits for the third
            Quarter of 1995, the October 1995 U.S. International Trade in Goods and
            Services, and Personal Income and Outlays for October and November. Also
            postponed are the scheduled December releases on Import and Export Price
            Indexes, Durable Goods, Housing Starts, and Single Family Home Sales.

     2.     State population estimates that are used to establish ceilings on tax-free bonding
            authorities also have been delayed.

     3.     Other economic indicators now being delayed include the monthly unemployment
            rate (originally scheduled for Jan. 5), Producer Price Index (originally scheduled
            for January 11), Consumer Price Index (originally scheduled for January 12), Value
            of New Construction (originally scheduled for January 2), Manufacturers'


                                             8
                                                      Hex-Dwnp Conversion


                     Shipments, Inventories, and Orders (originally scheduled for January 4), and
                     Wholesale Trade (originally scheduled for January 9).

              4.    On an average day, 2,000 people call the Census Bureau and 4,000 people call the
                    Bureau of Labor Statistics requesting information on economic and demographic
                    statistics. These calls are going unanswered as are the 70,000 daily inquiries on
                    the Census Bureau's on line data services, which are shut down.


        AA.   The National Institute of Standards & Technology has shut down.

              1.    Companies, universities, hospitals, and defense and law enforcement agencies
                    depend upon NIST's laboratory-based research and services. For example, NIST
                    provides in excess of 20,000 measurement samples and performs thousands of
                    calibration tests each year for more than 3000 large and small companies.

              2.    U.S. firms are being denied critical support in their efforts to deal with
                    international standards and testing requirements that limit the sale of U.S. goods
                    overseas.
