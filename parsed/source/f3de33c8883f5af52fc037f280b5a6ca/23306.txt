Dear Senator Edwards,

       Thank you for your thoughtful letter expressing concern about the future of tobacco
fanners in this country. As you know, I have made protecting tobacco farmers and their
communities one of the key components of my Administration's policy to reduce youth smoking.
 While we must work to reduce youth smoking, we also must ensure that we protect tobacco
fanners and their communities.

        I agree that any recoupment from the state settlements should take into account effects on
tobacco fanners. My Administration has proposed an approach that gives states flexibility and
discretion over how these funds will be spent. Specifically, we have proposed that states keep
100 percent of the tobacco settlement funds in exchange for a commitment to use a portion of the
proceeds to reduce youth smoking, protect tobacco fanners, improve public health, and assist
children. We look forward to crafting legislation with the states, members of Congress, and
with representatives of tobacco fanners. Without such legislation, not a single penny of tobacco
settlement funds would have to be used to reduce youth smoking.

       It is possible to protect tobacco farmers and their communities, at the same time that we
dramatically reduce youth smoking. I am confident that we will be able to reach agreement on
recoupment. I look forward to working with you on this important issue.


                                     Sincerely,
                                                                        H                    anagcment System

Dear Senator Robb,

       Thank you for your thoughtful letter expressing concern about the future of tobacco
fanners in this country. As you know, I have made protecting tobacco fanners and their
communities one of the key components of my Administration's policy to reduce youth smoking.
 While we must work to reduce youth smoking, we also must ensure that we protect tobacco
fanners and their communities.

        I agree that tobacco fanners and their communities must be protected from the effects of
tobacco litigation. As was done in the settlement with the state attorneys general, I believe that
in connection with any judgment or settlement of Federal claims there should be established a
fund to protect them from the unintended consequences of that lawsuit. I am committing my
Administration, as any Federal litigation proceeds to judgment or settlement, that we will make
sure that adequate funds are set aside by legislation to ensure the financial security of tobacco
fanners and their communities. We would of course develop this legislation in close
consultation with you and other members of Congress, and with representatives of tobacco
fanners, workers, and their communities.

       It is possible to protect tobacco fanners and their communities, at the same time that we
dramatically reduce youth smoking. I am confident that we will be able to reach agreement with
respect any judgments or settlement~ of federal claims. I look forward to working with you on
this important issue.

Dear Representative Boucher,

       Thank you for your thoughtful letter expressing concern about the future of tobacco
farmers in this country, particularly small farmers. As you know, I have made protecting tobacco
farmers and their communities one of the key components of my Administration's policy to
reduce youth smoking. While we must work to reduce youth smoking, we also must ensure that
we protect tobacco farmers and their communities.

         I agree that tobacco farmers and their communities must be protected from the effects of
all tobacco litigation. As was done in the settlement with the state attorneys general, I believe
that in connection with any judgment or settlement of Federal claims there should be established
a fund to protect them from the unintended consequences ofthat lawsuit. I am committing my
Administration, as any Federal litigation proceeds to judgment or settlement, that we will make
sure that adequate funds are set aside by legislation to ensure the financial security of tobacco
farmers and their communities. We would of course develop this legislation in close
consultation with you and other members of Congress, and with representatives of tobacco
farmers, their families, and communities.

       It is possible to protect small tobacco farmers and their communities, at the same time
that we dramatically reduce youth smoking. I am confident that we will be able to reach
agreement with respect to any judgments or settlements of federal claims. I look forward to
working with you on this important issue.


                                     Sincerely,
