TEXT:
We are meeting with McCain and Hollings' staff on Monday morning to

discuss a

number of design issues that might be resolved before we reach the

principals'

level.     These include 1) how much to charge smokeless manufacturers; 2)

how to

structure the $6.5 billion liability fund; 3) licensing and anti-smuggling

provisions; 4) document disclosure; 5) inflation adjustments and other

technical issues; 6) whether to reduce the 17 so-called new federal

bureaucracies; 7) asbestos; and 8) a new title that would contain any

consent

decree with the industry.
