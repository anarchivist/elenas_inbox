TEXT:
i've had several conversations with hhs and with debbie in florida's washington
office. obviously, our major problem is that hhs has had florida's plan since
sept. 20--and in that plan florida clearly states its intent to implement on oct
1--and florida has talked to the hhs regional office multiple times to let them
know that they wanted to implement on oct 1. the governor feels very sure that
he is right on this issue and is very worried about the political fall-out.
i've told hhs that they must solve this problem in a way that does not embarrass
the governor or make us look totally incompetent. they are talking to the
secretary now about possible options.  i think i bought hhs another 24 hours
with florida--but they do expect an answer tomorrow early in the day.
once hhs is ready to discuss the policy options with us i will let you know.
