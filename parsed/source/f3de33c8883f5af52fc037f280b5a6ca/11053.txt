Bruce
(from Jon and Tanya)

The Education Department and the National Center for Educational
Statistics are planning to release new NAEP reading scores this coming
Wednesday morning, February lOth, showing some small but statistically
significant gains in reading since 1994. The gains are clearest in 8th
grade, but there are also some slight but uneven gains in the 4th and 12th
grades. They will release national scores next week, and state-by-state
scores later in the spring.

The president is scheduled to do an Americorps event Wednesday as well.
We asked Education if the date of the announcement could be moved in the
event there was interest here in involving the president -- but Education
says the date cannot be changed.

If you'd be interested in the president doing this event, we can try to
push back harder on the Education Department to move the date. Otherwise,
we can explore VP participation in the announcement (the VP might be able
to do it that day) or just have Riley go ahead and do it.

The message of the event could be that this new data shows that we are
turning the corner on education -- but need to accelerate progress by
moving forward on the president's agenda to end social promotion, increase
accountability, reduce class size, etc.  If the president did this event,
Mike thinks it is might be possible to release the Education Department's
social promotion report in order to focus some of the press coverage on
the president's agenda. What do you think?
