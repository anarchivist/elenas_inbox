TEXT:
OMB staff (who just got the COS memo) just raised this fact --

If $26 billion over five years for liability is within the $1.10, this
also means that we probably don't have $15 billion left after spending $10
billion over 5 years for farmers; $10 billion for cessation,
counteradvertising, and other public health programs; $10-15 billion for
NIH; and $20-25 billion for states.

subject:         Question re: $6.5 liability and budget

Our assumption is that McCain wanted $5.2 billion of $6.5 liability fund
to be part of the annual assessment, right, i.e., within the $1.10? And
the $1.3 billion co-pay would be outside, right?

You should know that the table OMB handed out at the meeting yesterday
assumes all the $6.5 billion is outside the annual payment.   In other
words, the table shows $32 ·billion in "receipts less spending" because
they did not assume $26 billion ($5.2 billion x 5 years) is eaten up by
the liability fund.

Obviously, then, we have less money to play with than expected.
