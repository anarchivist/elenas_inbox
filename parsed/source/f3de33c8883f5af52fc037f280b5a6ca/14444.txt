Elena -- here's the text of the proposed presidential response that I
voice mailed you about:

December 10, 1996


Mr. Thomas L. Young
Executive Vice President,
   Administration
Owens-Illinois
One Seagate
Toledo, Ohio 43666

Dear Thomas:

     Thank you so much for your kind expression of support.   It
is good to hear from you again.

     I am proud of what my Administration has accomplished during
the past four years, but I know we still have much work to do,
and I look forward to working with you over the next four years.

     As we discussed in Cleveland, I believe our legal system
needs reform, and I have repeatedly urged Congress to pass
limited, meaningful product liability measures.  However, I
vetoed the product liability bill Congress sent to me this year
because it unduly interfered with state authority and tilted
the legal playing field against consumers.

     I value the perspective of the Coalition for Uniform Product
Liability Law and hope to have the benefit of your continuing
counsel as we work to meet the challenges that lie ahead.
                        ###

thanks for your help,
Jeff
