                               STATEMENT OF THE PRESIDENT

       Today, the Federal Bureau of Investigation released its final crime statistics
for 1996, and the results should be good news for all Americans. Overall crime
is do"wn for the fifth year in a row, with the biggest reductions coming in violent
crime (6%) -- and especially murders (9%).

        But the best news is not in the numbers, but in the fact that communities
across the country are making steady gains -- in almost every category ~- in the
fight against crime. Both the number and the rate of crimes are at their lowest
levels in a decade. And reported rapes, robberies, assaults, murders and all
types of property crimes are down from the previous year.         Even the arrest rate
for juveniles, which has skyrocketed since the mid 1980s, has now gone down for
two years ina row.

        Since being elected President, my Administration has worked with Police,
Prosecutors, Mayors and other community leaders on a tough, smart crime
strategy to drive down the crime rates. Together, we have fought for more
police in our communities, fewer guns on our streets, tougher punishment for
violent offenders and better opportunities for our kids. Today's crime statistics
show that, armed with these tools, we are moving in the right direction. Law
abiding Americans are finally -- and decisively -- tipping the scales of justice in
their favor.
