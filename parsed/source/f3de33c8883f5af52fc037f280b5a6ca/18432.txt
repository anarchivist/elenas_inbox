Medicare Fraud and Abuse Update_ Next week the first HHS/Justice report on anti-fraud
activities, mandated by the Kennedy-Kassebaum law, is expected to be released. The report will
document how successful the enforcement agencies have been in targeting and prosecuting fraud
activities. It will also report that these activities have resulted in $1 billion in fines and penalties
that have been collected by the Administration and deposited directly into the Medicare Trust
Fund. It is available at a fortuitous time because the Senate Governmental Affairs
Subcommittee on Investigation is planning will hold a hearing on January 29 documenting how
fraud appears to continue to be pervasive in the Medicare program. The hearing will reportedly
cite examples of providers and suppliers billing Medicare for services and medical devices that
were never provided to any Medicare beneficiary. The JusticelHHS report, which can be
discussed with other HHS anti-fraud initiatives that we are asking the Department to expedite,
will hopefully mitigate the negative impact of this report.

Norwood's Consumer Protections Legislation_ You recently asked us whether we should
work specifically with Congressman Norwood to pass consumer protection legislation. Despite
the fact that Congressman Norwood's legislation has over 200 co-sponsors in the House (and
more than 95 Republicans), we have hesitated to endorse this legislation because it has a number
of controversial components. Specifically, the business and labor community strongly object to
the bill's enforcement mechanism, which gives the courts broad authority that could lead to
excessive litigation. In addition, there are a number of provisions in the legislation that are
designed to protect providers at least as much consumers. For example, the bill comes close to
effectively assuring any willing provider protections, which would mean that even the most
inefficient, expensive, and poorest quality providers could not be excluded from health plans.
These provisions are not only controversial but they could also prove to be quite costly. Cost
projections will be used to suggest that more people will become uninsured and could become a
powerful countervailing argument for no Federal legislation. There are many in the business
and labor community as well as Members of Congress who generally support the notion of
consumer protections but are looking for a more moderate bill. However, they are holding out
to see if they have an alternative. Our strategy is to keep the pressure on for Federal legislation,
while looking for a coalition of moderates to develop a compromise bill.

Children's Health/Medicaid Outreach Update. There are currently four states who are
almost ready to receive approval on their Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) plan.
These four states -- Colorado, Alabama, South Carolina, and Missouri -- would be the first states
to provide coverage for uninsured children under the new law you signed into law this summer.
Weare pushing HHS to expedite final approval and hope to have some or all of these states
signed off on in the next few weeks. Other states are moving along on their proposals as well.
Some of these states are seeking waivers from the benefits and cost-sharing guidelines laid out by
Congress for this new law, which could generate tensions between the children's advocates and
the states. We will be sending you a memo early next week to outline policy decisions in this
regard. Finally, we have a series of administrative and budget provisions that give states new
flexibility and incentives to effectively target the three million children eligible but not enrolled
in Medicaid. These initiatives, which will be very well received by both the children's advocacy
community and the states, are ready to be rolled out at any time. We are currently looking for
possible events to call attention to these initiatives.

Genetic Discrimination in the Workplace. On Tuesday, the Vice President is participating in
an event with the Genome Action Coalition in which is he releasing a HHS/Labor Department a
report on preventing genetic discrimination in the work force. This report, which is similar to
the report you announced in July on genetic discrimination in health insurance, outlines the
Administration's principles for legislation on this issue. It prevents employers from using
genetic information as a condition of employment, or as a way to classify employees, or even
obtain it except under specific circumstances. There are a number of bills on this issue on the
Hill, including one that is quite similar introduced by Senator Daschle. We believe that this
event will be effective in highlighting your commitment to preventing genetic discrimination
both in health insurance and in the work force.

Reichauer and the Medicare Buy-In. Today, Chris J. met with Bob Reichauer, EJ. Dionne,
David Broder, Henry Aaron, Marilyn Moon, Judy Feder, and a host of policy experts at the
Brookings Institution on the Medicare buy-in initiative. After going through the specific policy
and the rationale behind it, virtually all participants at the meeting, including Reichauer and
Aaron, explicitly stated that this policy is thoughtful (although very modest) and indicated that it
merited a positive reception by the Congress. In fact, Reichauer explicitly stated "if I were in
the Congress, I certainly would vote for it." He also indicated that he did not mean for his op-ed
piece to be excessively critical and actually apologized, although privately, for it being received
as such. Chris informed him that it was important for him to be more clear about his sentiments
about this policy since it so influences the elite perception of it. DPCINEC will be sending you
a memo next week on our responses to the criticisms raised by Reichauer in his piece.
