TEXT:
I was told tonight that CBO released its score today, estimating that the
federal government will recoup $2.9 billion over 5 years and $6.8 billion
over 10 years from the state tobacco settlements.  CBO estimates states
will collect $48 million over 5 and $97 million over 10 from the
settlements and that 1) about half that is Medicaid; 2) the federal
Medicaid share is 57%; 3) the feds recoup about 25% of what they're owed.
