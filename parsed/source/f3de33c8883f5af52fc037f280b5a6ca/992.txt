TEXT:
Are you planning to corne, since Bruce will probably be in drug control
strategy meeting? And, if so, do you want to open the meeting? If not,
Steve Silverman will probably kick it off, which I think is fine with
Bruce. He did tell me Steve is an "ally" on this and not to be wary, fyi;
and Cabinet Affairs has been quite helpful in my dealings with them to
date.  But I don't want to rollover excessively, in case that is what I
am doing.
