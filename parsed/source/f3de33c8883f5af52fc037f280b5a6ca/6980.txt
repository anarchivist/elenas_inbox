TEXT:
Bob and I will take care of this.  We've also talked to Bill plante at CBS
and to Michelle Norris at ABC--they are both clearly interested in this
story.

Bob and I also talked to Mosley-Braun's office about announcing Zones at
the same event. They are firmly opposed to that--they want the focus on
construction. Bob, Jon and I also think this is the right call with
respect to the constituency groups who have planned these forums.
switching message on them at the last minute will not be very well
received.  Finally, we are hoping that the combination of the upcoming
Congressional fight over the construction initiative and the press
interest in the President's "renewed attention to his agenda" will help
this event break through.
