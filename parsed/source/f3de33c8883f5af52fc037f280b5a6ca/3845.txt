TEXT:
My soundings in the press indicate that they expect to write the welfare
to work event as mostly a Gephardt/Clinton/Gore story-- not a welfare
reform at work story.  The more new numbers-- best being caseload, next
perhaps being new companies or goals-- may be the best tool to keep it on
Presidential effectiveness as a story ...
