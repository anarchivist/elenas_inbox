Subject: Outsourcing in Wisconsin

The Wisconsin Secretary of HHS, Jean Rodgers, called USDA today to say
that
they expect an answer 'on their waiver request this week.  Their
privatization
effort includes Food Stamps and Medicaid.   HCFA apparently has not raised
concerns about outsourcing, but has raised other issues.    Ms. Rodgers
plans to
call Kevin Thurm or John Monahan with the same message.

If Wisconsin does not get an answer they plan to raise the issue to a
"higher
level".  I assume this means the 'White House. Just wanted to give you a
heads
up.
