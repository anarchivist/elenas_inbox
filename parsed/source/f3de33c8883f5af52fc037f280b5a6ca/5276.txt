TEXT:
I sat in on a meeting, chaired by Maria Echaveste, with the Central
American advocacy groups. The topic was reaction to the package of relief
for the Central Americans.

Though generally pleased with what we have accomplished, there were
concerns expressed about ensuring some administrative relief for the
Guatamalans and Salvadorans that looks more like what the Nicaraguans
got. Specifically, they want two things:   (1) a regulation that provides
that those defined as a class by the legislation (essentially Guat. and
Sal.) are assumed to meet the "extreme hardship" trigger for suspension of
deportation; and (2) that those that are going through this process not
have to present their suspension case to the immigration court; rather,
that they be allowed to be handled administratively (similar to asylum
applications). This would obviate, to a large extent, the necessity for
lawyers and would be a generally lower burden. Maria pointed out that
they all knew the limitations of suspension of deportation as relief from
the beginning, and it is all that they ever wanted.  However, they still
stated an intent to press on. There was some limited discussion of NJB
relief (legislatively, next year), but it didn't really go anywhere.

Finally, Congo Gutierrez stated that he was looking into an e.p. type
challenge to the law -- why a Mexican who has been here as long, is not
entitled to the relief now afforded a Nicaraguan or Guatarnalan. He stated
that he would like the Administration to be "behind his efforts."
