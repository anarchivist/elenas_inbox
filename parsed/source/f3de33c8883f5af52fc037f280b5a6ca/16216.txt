                            PREVENTING INSURANCE DISCRIMINATION BASED
                                     ON GENETIC INFORMATION

     Today the President pledged his commitment to enacting bipartisan legislation in this Congress to prohibit
     health plans from inappropriately using genetic screening information to deny coverage, set premiums, or to
     distribute confidential information. In so doing, he released a new report from the Department of Health and
     Human Services that summarizes the promise and perils of genetic screening. He also announced that the
     Republican Chair ofthe Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, Senator Jim Jeffords, and the
     Public Health and Safety Subcommittee Chair, Senator and Doctor Bill Frist, have indicated their support for
     passing a bipartisan bill that is consistent with the goals and general recommendations of the HHS report.

     The Progress and Promise of Genetic Testing. Genetic testing has the potential to identify hidden genetic
     disorders and spur early treatment. Tests for genetic predisposition to certain diseases and conditions -- such
     as Huntington's disease and certain types of breast cancer -- are already available and more genetic tests are
     on the horizon.

     Genetic Discrimination: The Perils of This Progress. But genetic testing also can be used by insurance
     companies and others to discriminate and stigmatize groups of people. Studies have shown that:

     ·      Over one-fifth of people in families where someone has a genetic disorder report that they, or a
            member of their family, had been discriminated against by an insurance plan.

     ·      85 percent of Americans report that they are extremely concerned with the possibility that their
            genetic makeup will be used to discriminate against them or a member of their family.

     Building on Kassebaum-Kennedy. Kassebaum-Kennedy took steps to prohibit genetic discrimination by
     preventing insurers from using genetic information as a "pre-existing condition" and denying or limiting
     coverage in group markets. However, Kassebaum-Kennedy falls short in three areas. It does not: (1)
     prevent health plans in the individual market from denying coverage on the basis of genetic information; (2)
     assure that premiums settings are in no way based on genetic information both in the group and individual
     market; and (3) prevent health plans from disclosing genetic information to insurers, to plan sponsors, and
     other entities regulated by state insurance laws, such as life, disability, and long-term care insurers.

     State laws are insufficient. Nineteen states have already enacted laws to restrict the use of genetic information
     in health insurance and many others have introduced legislation. However, state legislation is insufficient to
     solve this problem. First, private sector employer sponsored health plans, which cover half of all Americans,
     are exempt from state insurance laws due to ERISA preemption. Second, current state laws generally focus
     on genetic tests rather than a broader definition of genetic information such as family history, medical
     records, and physical exams. Finally, the variability among state bills will lead to a lack of uniformity across
     the nation as to whether and how genetic information may be used by health plans.

     Building on the existing bipartisan commitment to the President's challenge. Several bills have been introduced
     in this Congress which prohibits health plans from requesting or using genetic information to deny health
     care coverage or raise premiums. The bipartisan legislation introduced by Rep. Louise Slaughter, H.R. 306,
     addresses the three major gaps left by the HIP AA legislation and represents a strong foundation for this
     much-needed reform. It has already attracted over 150 cosponsors. The HHS report released today
     recommends building on this legislation and enacting a bill that protects all Americans from the threat of
     genetic discrimination.
