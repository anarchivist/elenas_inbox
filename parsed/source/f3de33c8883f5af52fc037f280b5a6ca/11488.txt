TEXT:
Rodney called right back to apologize for the leaks on car seats and 211,
as well as for the mix-up on letting the VP do it Monday.  He says the
leaks are inexcusable and he's trying to get to the bottom of them.

He also brought up that he'd seen the squib in the WSJournal about our
interest in a Passengers Bill of Rights, and wondered what we were doing
on that.  He agreed to work with us on it, so Tom, you should check in
with his people and get something going.   (We'll need to include NEC and
OMB. )
