                         President Clinton and Vice President Gore
                     Investing in Smaller Classes and Modern Schools in
                             Embargoed for Release February 20,1999 (10:06 a.m.)

President Clinton is urging Congress to pass his education agenda which includes reducing class size in the early
grades to a national average of 18, modernizing 6,000 schools nationwide, strengthening accountability.

Reduced Class Size in the Early Grades
Studies show that smaller classes help teachers provide more personal attention to students and spend less time
on discipline; as a result students learn more and get a stronger foundation in the basic skills. In 1998,
President Clinton proposed to help local school schools hire 100,000 well-prepared teachers in order to reduce
class size in grades 1-3 to a national average of 18, and make sure that every child gets a solid foundation in the
basics. Last year, the President signed into law the first installment of his seven year, $12.4 billion proposal to
hire 100,000 new teachers. For the first year, $1.2 billion was provided to help local communities hire 30,000
teachers. Now Congress must provide the next installment of $1.4 billion to fund 38,000 teachers in the second
year:

             Under President's Clinton's proposal, would receive funds in fiscal year 2000 to support a
             total of new teachers.

New Classrooms and Modernized Schools
A third of all schools across the country, with 14 million students, have one or more buildings that need
extensive repair, according to the General Accounting Office. School districts also face the cost of upgrading
schools to accommodate computers and growing enrollment. To meet this urgent need, President Clinton in his
balanced. balanced proposes Federal tax credits to pay interest on nearly $25 billion in bonds to build and
renovate public schools 6,000 schools throughout the country. Two types of bonds are being proposed: 1)
$22.4 billion in School Modernization Bonds to build and renovate public schools. Half of the bonds ($11
billion) would be allocated to the 100-125 school districts with the largest number of low-income children.
The other half of the bonds ($11 billion) would be allocated to States according to the proportion of low-income
children, not counting the children in the school districts described above; and 2) $2.4 billion in Qualified
Zone Academy Bonds to finance renovation and new school construction in empowennent zones and high
poverty areas through innovative partnerships between public schools and businesses. Under President
Clinton's proposal:


              would receive tax credits to support $ million in school modernization.


Ensuring Accountability
In his State of the Union Address, President Clinton announced a package of accountability measures designed
to hold students, teachers, and schools to high standards, and to ensure that school districts and states provide
students with a high quality education. While insisting that states and local governments retain primary
responsibility for education, President Clinton called on Congress to make sure federal dollars support what
works and not what doesn't. His proposal emphasizes reforms that a growing number of states, cities, and
schools across the nation are implementing and that are producing clear results. Specifica:Jly, the President
announced that he will send to Congress legislation to reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act
to ensure that schools end social promotion; teachers are qualified to teach the subjects they are assigned; states
turn around their lowest-perfonning schools; parents get annual report cards on school perfonnance; and
, . schools institute effective discipline policies.
