Subject:         Draft

As we discuss whether to do a letter, here is the latest draft of one,
attached.  I think it effectively rebuts Bolick's arguments while
simultaneously presenting a positive portrait of both Bill Lann Lee and
the Administration's commitment to charter schools.

    To the Editor:

            Clint Bolick's article about Bill Lann Lee and charter schools argues that Mr. Lee has
    "launched a campaign to stop charter schools in their tracks." Some campaign. Under
    President Clinton, the number of charter schools in America has gone from just one in 1993 to
    more than 1,100 today.
            There is no "campaign" or "battle" against charter schools being waged by Bill Lann Lee
    or anyone else in the Clinton Administration. Thanks to the leadership of President Clinton,
    school districts across the country are embracing charter schools as an innovative way to improve
    the quality of education in America, particularly in distressed areas where the need is so great.
    Bill Lann Lee, Acting Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights in the Department of Justice,
    shares the President's vision and supports Administration policy and the law completely.
            Fundamental civil rights goals of hreaking down segregation and ensuring equal
    educational opportunities for all Americans can be achieved simultaneouslv with the
    development of charter schools. The rapid growth of charter schools during the last six
    years is Ilroof. For example, in the East Baton Rouge case, the Department of Justice did not
    oppose the opening of a new charter school. It simply asked the new charter school to take steps
    to avoid further segregating the community. In the South Carolina case, the government moved
    to enforce an existing consent decree which closed certain schools to alleviate the isolation of
    African American students and equalize resources, and the state court agreed. The closed
    schools are to be replaced by new facilities._ In no case has the government acted against any
    charter school simply because it is a charter school. In every case the government has acted to
    protect the public interest in desegregation.
            Mr. Bolick imagines a "war" against charter schools that simply does not exist. The only
    battle being waged is by Mr. Bolick and his allies against the nomination of Bill Lann Lee. But
    their complaint is not really with Mr. Lee. It is with the civil rights laws themselves, which Mr.
    Lee has been acting to enforce for the past year. His track record of success -- and the Clinton
    Administration's success in promoting charter schools -- speak for themselves.

    Sincerely,


    James E. Kennedy
    Special Advisor To The White House Counsel
