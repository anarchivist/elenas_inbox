MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:                  Melanne Verveer
                       Elena Kagan

RE:                    White House Conference on Early Childhood Development and Learning

As you know, on Thursday, April 17, you and the First Lady will host the White House
Conference on Early Childhood Development and Learning: What New Research on the Brain
Tells Us About Our Youngest Children. The purpose of this memorandum is to provide for you
an overview of the Conference and the series of events leading up it, as well as the likely policy
announcements to be unveiled at the Conference, pending your approval.

Conference Overview

The Conference will spotlight the exciting new findings about how our children develop, and
explore how we can make the most of this information to give our children what they need to
thrive. Central to the Conference will be a discussion of your Administration's
accomplishments in this area, such as significant investments in research and programs such as
Early Head Start and WIC.

The Conference will be divided into two parts -- a morning session and an afternoon session,
each of which will follow the format of a roundtable discussion.

Morning Session

You and the First Lady will make remarks to open the Conference, outlining why this
Conference and the issues it will underscore are important. This will also be the opportunity for
you to make a policy announcement on child care, outlined below. In this session, you will be
joined on a panel by experts who will present an overview of the emerging knowledge on early
childhood development in neuroscience and behavioral science. Dr. David Hamburg, President,
Camegie Corporation of New York will help to facilitate the brief presentations of the first three
speakers, listed below.

Dr. Donald Cohen, Director of the Yale Child Study Center, will discuss how children's behavior
helps us understand their cognitive, emotional and social development.
                             Hex-Dump Conversion

Dr. Carla Shatz, Neuroscientist at University of California, Berkeley, will explain how children's
brains grow and develop in the earliest years of life.

Dr. Patricia Kuhl, Chair of the Department of Speech and Hearing Sciences at the University of
Washington, will discuss how children learn language.             .

Following these presentations, the experts listed below will join the panel and respond to
questions generated by a poll conducted by Hart Research for Zero to Three (an advocacy and
umbrella early development organization), as well as to qustions posed by you and the First Lady
(e.g. "does this research suggest that it would be better if women did not work?" or "does this
research suggest that adopting an older child is a bad idea?").

Dr. Ezra Davidson, Drew University of Medicine, can address the importance of prenatal and
perinatal services.

Dr. T. Berry Brazelton, Harvard University, can discuss the pediatrician's role in early childhood
development.

Dr. Deborah Phillips, Institute of Medicine, can address how child care can affect early
development.

Luncheon

The luncheon in the State Dining Room will be optional on your schedule, and is intended for
informal discussion among the Conference participants.

Afternoon Session

The purpose of the afternoon session is to highlight model efforts that communities are
undertaking to support parents and enhance early childhood development. We intend for this
panel to be action-oriented, so that you would highlight your Administration's policy
achievements and new initiatives during the course of the panel discussion. The discussion
participants include:

Dr. Gloria Rodriguez, Avance Family Support Program, San Antonio, TX
Avance is a widely acclaimed family support and education program serving predominantly
Hispanic communities.

Harriet Meyer, Ounce of Prevention, Chicago, IL
Ounce of Prevention is a statewide program in Illinois that develops and tests innovative early
childhood development programs for replication and runs model Early Head Start and child care
programs.
                        o
Melvin Wearing, Chief of Police, New Haven, CT
                           Hex-Dump Conversion

Will talk about a pioneering initiative that trains community police officers to use child
development principles in their work.

Arnold Langbo, The Kellogg Company CEO, Battle Creek, MI .
Kellogg launched a community-wide effort last fall to provide practical early brain development
infonnation to every Battle Creek parent and caregiver.

Rob Reiner, CastleRock Entertainment
Los Angeles, CA
Will talk about the "I Am Your Child" campaign launched this month and the media's role in
making early childhood development infonnation available.

Respondents:

Governor Bob Miller, Nevada, Co-chair of the NGA Children's Task Force
TBD Republican Governor

Lead Up to the Conference

The lead up to the Conference may well be our best opportunity to frame the discussion on why
issues relating to children's early development are important and why your Administration has
invested so heavily to enhance those years oflife.

Your radio address on Saturday 4112 (which you are scheduled to tape on Friday, 4111) will be an
important opportunity for you to introduce the themes of the Conference. On Monday, 4114, the
First Lady will host a roundtable with reporters, in which she will build on your radio address
and underscore the themes of the Conference. On Wednesday, 4116, the First Lady will host an
event at the White House to announce an initiative to encourage pediatricians to "prescribe" that
parents read to their children, when families visit the doctor. This event will be optional on your
schedule, pending activity on the budget.

Policy Announcements

Child Care Proposal

Child care experts believe the Defense Department's child care system is the best in country
and possibly also the best in the world. This was not the case as recently as the early
1980s, but legislation enacted in the late 1980s has led to dramatic improvements in DoD's
child care and parenting programs. DoD child care is now characterized by: high
standards enforced by four unannounced annual inspections and an 1-800 hot line for
parents to report concerns; a high percentage of accredited centers; relatively generous
wages and benefits that have reduced staff turnover; wages tied to training and an "up or
out" personnel policy requiring completion of training requirements; and adequate
funding to make quality child care affordable, although there are still waiting lists.
                               Hex-Dump Conversion

We recommend you hold the DoD child care system up as a model for the nation and issue
an executive order at the Conference directing the Secretary of Defense to share the
Department's expertise with civilian child care communities by: each military child
development center adopting a local civilian child care center to help increase its quality
and training; local military bases partnering with state and county governments to provide
on-the-job training to welfare recipients in their child care programs; establishing military
regional "Child Care Masters Programs" that local civilian child care managers could
attend for two to three weeks to learn best practices; publicizing more widely DoD's model
designs for child care facilities and playgrounds; and providing DoD's benchmarks for
cost, compensation, evaluation, standards against which local child care programs could
evaluate themselves. Clearly, most civilian child care systems will come up short against
DoD's benchmarks, particularly in terms of salary, benefits and afford ability, but a debate
on this topic might help build public support for greater investment in child care.

To show that you are serious about the DoD system being a model for civilian child care,
the executive order could also direct the GSA to evaluate its child care centers against
DoD's model practices and report back to you and recommended actions.

[Elena, based on what I can see, I would not release the RAND report. It does not say it is
the greatest thing since sliced bread; it says the Bush Administration legislation has worked
to improve the program dramatically. We have not gotten feedback from Joan on these
DoD proposals. We are continuing to try to reach Joan.]

America Reads Challenge Early Childhood Kits for Families and Caregivers

You will announce the release of the America Reads Challenge Early Childhood Kits. The kits,
named include booklets for families and caregivers suggesting activities for children ages 0 to 5,
a calendar listing ideas for daily activities, and a developmental growth chart. The kits will be
distributed to early childhood programs and through requests by callers to the Department of
Education's 1-800 phone line.

CEO Summit

Kaiser Permanente, whose CEO David Laurence will be in the audience at the Conference, will
convene a CEO Summit in the fall of 1997 to discuss what businesses can do to enhance early
childhood development -- for their own employees by creating family-friendly workplace
practices, for the communities in which they have a presence, and for their own products and
services. This effort will be announced at the Conference, with you challenging Kaiser to address
at the Summit the themes raised at the White House Conference.

Children's Health Initiative

In your remarks, we recommend that you discuss the importance of insurance coverage for
children's health and development, and highlight the Children's Health Initiative in your 1998
budget proposal. In 1995, 10 million children did not have health insurance. Your children's
                             Hex-Dump Conversion

health proposal will extend coverage to up to 5 million of those children by the year 2000. The
proposal includes: (1) grants to states to cover workers and their families between jobs; (2) a
program to cover children whose families earn too much to qualify for Medicaid but too little to
afford private coverage; and (3) efforts to strengthen Medicaid and ensure that all eligible
children are enrolled. The deans of academic medical centers will endorse your proposal at the
conference.

We are also planning a follow up children's health event, where you will release a study showing
the links between insurance coverage, health status and development and learning for children
from 0 to 18 years old, talk in more detail about your health proposal, and announce a project by
Kaiser Permanente to spend $100 million over the next 5 years to provide health insurance to
uninsured children.
