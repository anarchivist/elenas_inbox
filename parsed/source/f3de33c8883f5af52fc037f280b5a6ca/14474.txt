TEXT:
FYI--FDA today approved "Mr. Brown's" home drug test kit. As you know, the
Agency is revisiting its policy on such kits and, in the interim, is not
enforcing against Sunny Cloud and others who have kits on the market.    Mr.
Brown's was approved under the regular FDA PMA reveiw process.
The company has been notified, and FDA/HHS will issue a press statement later
today. Shalala is planning to make a statement (rare for specific device
approvals), noting that the Administration has zero tolerance for kids' drug
use, parents should hav~ all tools available to them,   and this will expand
parents' choices. HHS is letting Rahm, WH Press, Hilley know.
The President has never commented directly on this issue, but Carol sent a
letter to FDA expressing his views.   (In VP debate, VP held FDA's interim
no-enforcement policy up as an example of FDA's enlightenment). WH Press will
be prepared for any calls.
