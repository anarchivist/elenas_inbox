 TEXT:
   The welfare law requires each state to report its child poverty rate
 annually to HHS. If the child poverty rate increases by five percent or
 more from the prior year as a result of the TANF law, the state must also
 submit a corrective plan that outlines how the state will reduce the child
 poverty rate.

         The law charges HHS with devising a methodology for states to use
 in devising child poverty rates.  HHS has drafted a preliminary
 methodology (attached) and wants share it at a series of consultations
 with states and academics, starting on Friday.   I have reviewed the
 attached and see no problem. Would you care to review? Ann Rosewater is
 hoping for a response by noon tomorrow.  ==================== ATTACHMENT     1 =======

                                                            DRAFT    March 26, 2010 DRAFT
                          Regulations on State Child Poverty Rates

Section 413(i) of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act
(PRWORA) requires that each state report their child poverty rate annually to the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).1 If the child poverty rate has
increased by five percent or more since the prior year as a result of Section 103 (TANF)
of PRWORA, the state must also submit a corrective plan that outlines how the state
will reduce the child poverty rate.

The Secretary of HHS is charged with establishing a methodology for states to use in
determining their child poverty rates. The methodology is statutorily required to
include:

·      The number of children who receive free and reduced price school lunches;
·      The number of food stamp households;
·      County by county estimates of children in poverty as determined by the Census
       Bureau.

From the factors outlined in the legislation (school lunches and food stamp
participation) it would appear the Congress is not concerned solely with an official
measure of poverty.      However, given the unsettled nature of the debate on measUring
poverty and the requirement that the measure must be able to indicate a five percent
change in child poverty, we approach this regulation with a desire not to deviate too far
from the official poverty measure.

Our examination of this issue has focused on two questions:

1.     A technical methodology for measuring state-level child poverty, including a
       process for determining whether changes in state-level child poverty are
       attributable to TANF.
2.     Potential regulations regarding corrective action plans.

1.     Methodology for Measuring Child Poverty Rates

       Data Limitations

       We began our consideration of the issue by examining the data sources
       mentioned in PRWORA. There are certain limitations to the data types
       mentioned in the law.

       ·       According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), schools report

     This section of the law is attached.

                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion
      participation by the number of lunches served and do not record the
      number of children who participate. Over the past several years the
      proportion of lunches served free or reduced price and the proportion of
      enrollment approved for free or reduced price meals both have risen
      steadily. During the same time period, however, poverty counts and
      AFDC participation decreased. The cause of these disparate trends is
      unknown.

·     Currently, the Census Bureau does not estimate small area poverty rates
      (what the legislation identifies as the Census' county-by-county estimates)
      on an annual basis. The most recent data currently available is for 1993;
      1995 data is expected in 1998.

We also examined other possible data sources that could be used to calculate
poverty rates. The most likely data source is the Current Population Survey
(CPS), which the Census Bureau uses to calculate annual national poverty rates.
 It also has a number of limitations, most notably small sample sizes in the
majority of states.

      POTENTIAL METHODOLOGY

After examining a number of options, HHS staff have developed a potential
approach that attempts to balance data limitations with the requirements and
intent of the legislation.

Under this approach, the measure of state level child poverty would involve a
three-step process:

1.    We would ask the Census Bureau to develop annual state child poverty
      estimates using the method developed for estimating small area poverty
      rates.

2.    If the Census method in Step 1 showed an increase of five percent or
      more in the child. poverty rate for a state, then that state would submit data
      on the number of households with children participating in the Food
      Stamp Program.

3.    If the use of food stamp data in Step 2 also showed an increase of five
      percent or more, then states could submit evidence that the increase in
      child poverty resulted from factors unrelated to TANF.

Step 1: Use of the Census Methodology for Estimating Small Area Poverty

The Census Bureau has developed a model for estimating local area poverty


                                     2
                                                                      Hex·Dump Conversion

       rates. This model, which uses CPS data, the Census Bureau's Annual
       Intercensal State Population Estimates, Food Stamp Participation data, and IRS
       Tax Return data, is designed to reduce the large year-to-year variations in state
       poverty rates that result from CPS-only estimates.

       This model would produce the best results from a statistical standpoint. It
       presents the best opportunity for estimating state-level child poverty rates, and it
       would allow detection of changes within a statistical confidence interval. At the
       same time there are limitations to this approach as well. There is a time lag in
       the availability of the estimates, and the model may not allow the impact of T ANF
       on the poverty rate to be isolated.

       Step 2: Use of Food Stamp Participation Data

       We are considering augmenting the Census estimates by using more recent
       food stamp data. If the Census model detected a·5 percent or more increase in
       the child poverty rate in a state, then the state would submit data on the number
       of households with children that received food stamps in the two most recent
       years. This food stamp data would be used to confirm that economic
       deprivation among children continued to be a problem in a more recent period.

       Step 3:    Evidence that Increases in Poverty were Independent of T ANF

       The methods described in steps 1 and 2 above for estimating state child poverty
       rates would not isolate the impact ofTANF on child deprivation. Therefore, our
       methodology must include additional procedures to shed light on the relationship
       between TANF and changes in child poverty.

       If the Census methodology and use of food stamp data resulted in an estimated
       increase in child poverty rates by five percent or more, states could submit other
       evidence--economic, programmatic, etc.--that child deprivation did not increase,
       or that the increase in the child poverty rate resulted from factors outside of
       TANF.

2.     Corrective Action Plans

       If a state's child poverty rate increased by five percent of more resulting from
       TANF, then the state must submit a corrective action plan. The plan is to
       outline the manner in which the state will reduce the child poverty rate, including


      As one could expect, the intricacies of this model are complex. We plan to have Census staff
present at our consultation meetings to answer questions. A full discussion of this model can be found
on the Internet at the Census Bureau's home page. The address for the Small Area Income and Poverty
Estimates is: hUp:/Iwww.census.gov/hhes/www/saipe/.

a description of the actions to be taken.                  H~x·DlIlllp   Conversion

HHS has limited authority to regulate in this area. The statute gives the Secretary
explicit authority to establish a methodology, but is silent on authority to regulate
corrective action plans. As a result, we do not intend to establish detailed regulations
regarding the content and timing of corrective action plans.
