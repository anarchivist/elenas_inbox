      TEXT:
      FYI: On Monday, DOJ will release the final Peat Marwick report and brief
      the Hill on its
      findings concerning INS management of the problem plagued Citizenship USA
      initiative (which inadvertently naturalized unqualified aliens).  The
      final results are not particularly good and will likely add ammunition to
      Hill calls for immigration benefit/services to be stripped from the INS.

      In brief, the report repeats the December findings that of the 1.1 million
      aliens naturalized in 1996, 6,000 criminal aliens were inappropriately
      granted citizenship benefits. These individuals are currently in
      revocation proceedings.  Few actual revocations have been effected to
      date. The report will also state that 38 aliens who were under
      deportation or final orders of exclusion were also naturalized (INS did
      not check the Executive Office of Immigration Review's data base which
      documents immigrant court actions prior to granting citizenship) .

      The most serious problems relate to the results of Peat's sampling of the
      entire 1996 naturalization universe which the Hill agreed would be
      acceptable in lieu of investigating all 1.1 million new citizens.   The
      results of this sampling (6,018 applications by population strata and
      geographic location) identified an error rate of 3.9 percent equating to
      approximately 38,000 ineligible aliens being granted citizenship.   The
      majority of these (25.5K) were found to have applied for citizenship prior
      to being eligible and INS should not have accepted the application.   INS
      had permitted immigrants to apply if they were 90 days from the 5-year
      residency/permanent legal resident requirement.  Peat found applications
      INS had accepted which were 6 months to a year prior to eligibility.
      Most, however, were eligible (time in residency) by the time they actually
      reached the citizenship ceremony and became citizens.


 The remaining (11.5K) were found not to have meet the "good moral"
 certitude requirement of the law (DWI, etc).

 The review also found that 90 percent of the cases lack sufficient file
 documentation to justify granting citizenship and that in 70 percent of
 the sample cases audited, the reviewer was unable to determine whether
 fingerprints had been sent to the FBI. Overall, based on the sample set,
 Peat Marwick documented a 95 percent error rate -- a strong indictment of
 INS' management of the naturalization process.

 DOJ is planning to package the results of the Coopers and Lybrand redesign
 of the naturalization process to temper the negative press associated with
 the Peat audit findings.
