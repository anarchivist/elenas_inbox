                      RADIO ADDRESS ON SCHOOL REFORM BILLS
                                 OCTOBER 17,1997

        Good Morning. This week, Hillary and I have been visiting our neighbors in South
America. We've savored the hospitality and uniqueness of every country we've visited. But as
we've traveled from Caracas to Brasilia to Buenos Aires and places in between, we've also had
the chance to see that much more unites the people of the Americas than separates us. All of us
cherish the same ideals: Freedom and equality, family and community, peace and democracy.

       And we all believe that providing all children with a world-class education is the best way
to ensure they fulfill their God-given promise in the 21 st century. I was struck by how the
people of each country had taken this principle to heart. Earlier this week, I saw how
government, business and community leaders had worked together to build a school that had
become an oasis of hope for children in one of Rio De Janeiro's poorest neighborhoods.

        It was a powerful reminder of the transforming effects of education, of how we in the
United States must continue to make sure that politics stops at the school house door. Because
we worked across party lines this summer, we've already opened the doors of learning wider than
ever before for Americans of all ages, passing the single largest increase in education spending
since the GJ. Bill fifty years ago.

        But we cannot rest. When I return to Washington, I will call on Congress to continue
working with me to strengthen our public schools. I pledge to do everything I can to make sure
two bipartisan school efforts become law. The first will bring more innovative charter schools
to more communities across our country, boosting charter school funding to $100 million so that
we can open some 3,000 new schools by the end of the century. Charter schools empower
parents, educators and conmmnity leaders with the freedom to create the schools that bestrneet
the needs oftheir children while also meeting the highest levels of public accountability.

          But sometimes, charter schools aren't always the best answer to a community's
education needs. Often, a school just needs a little extra help to implement the specific
reforms they need to revitalize their classrooms, encourage teachers and inspire students.
That's why I'm also supporting a bipartisan bill that will help low-achieving, low-income
schools transform themselves through proven reforms -- everything from intensive reading
programs to teacher training to after-school tutoring. I believe virtually every problem
facing our schools has been solved by at least one community in America. This bill will
help all of us share these solutions with the schools that need them most.

         This fall, we have an important opportunity to strengthen and reaffirm our commitment to
our public schools and our children. Let us all work together to make sure every child masters
the basics and meets the highest standards of academic achievement, that every principal and
every teacher is empowered to introduce innovation into the classroom, that every parent can take
an active role in his or her child's education, and that every school across America is accountable
for its performance. Our children are counting on us. Thanks for listening.
