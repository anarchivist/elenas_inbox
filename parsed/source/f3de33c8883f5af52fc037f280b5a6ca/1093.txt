TEXT:
We have received the proposed Executive Order to add 12 members to the
Advisory Commission. Would you let me know the preferred timing for the
issuance of the EO? Mac Reed of OMB based on discussions with you, Kathy,
suggested that we need to get it out tomorrow or Wednesday.   However, the
DPC weekly report to POTUS suggested a March 10 release date.

We need to staff it out to senior WH staff for feedback, and the deadline
we give will be based on when you need the EO to be issued.

Let me know.

THANKS.
