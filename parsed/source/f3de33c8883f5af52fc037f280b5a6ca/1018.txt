TEXT:
Message Creation Date was at 25-FEB-1997 20:59:00

TO:   DIRECTOR FRANK RAINES
  DEPUTY DIRECTOR JACK LEW
  DEPUTY DIRECTOR JOHN KOSKINEN

FROM: OMB LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS

DATE: FEBRUARY 25, 1997

SUBJECT:   LEGISLATIVE REPORT


Director Raines will testify on the PresidentO,s Budget Wednesday morning
before the Joint Economic Committee.

Also on Wednesday, Senator Torricelli will hold a press conference to announce
his vote on the Balanced Budget Amendment (BBA); and House Coalition members
hope to reach agreement on their budget for FY 1998.  (A Press conference is
tentatively set for 2:00pm.)

House Democrats will release their education initiative on Wednesday.  It will
be based on the Administration's plan, but will 1) make Pell an entitlement, 2)
expand the individual grant to $3300, 3) restore the student loan deduction, 4)
not require a B average for eligibility for the Hope Scholarships,  and 5)
propose an emergency reforms assistance program for schools.


CONGRESS TODAY (2/25):

SENATE:
The Senate adopted (53-46) H.J.Res. 36, the Authorization for Release of
International Population Funds.
  [SAP sent, 2/24: Administration strongly supports]

The Senate tabled (55-44) the Reid amendment to the BBA, which would have
excluded the Social Security trust fund from the resolution. Senator Torricelli
introduced an amendment tonight, which would permit capital budgeting, amend
the military waiver, and provide majority waivers for recession.  The Senate
will take up his amendment on Wednesday.

HOUSE:
** No Votes **
After its consideration under suspension of the rules, the House ordered and
postponed votes on H.R. 668, Airport and Airway Trust Fund Tax Reinstatement
Act of 1997. The vote will occur on Wednesday around 1:00 pm.
  [SAP sent, 2/25: Administration strongly supports]


CONGRESS TOMORROW (2/26)

SENATE
The Senate will convene at 9:00 am to consider the Feinstein substitute
amendment to the BBA for 2 hours, with a vote at 11:00 am.  Compared to the


      Hatch version, the Feinstein substitute would 1) exclude Social Security, 2)
      allow a broader military waiver, 3) not require a super-majority vote to raise
      the debt limit, and 4) not prohibit capital budgets.

      The Senate will then consider the Torricelli amendment (3 hours debate,
      followed by a vote) that would permit capital budgeting, amend the military
      waiver, and provide majority waivers for recession.

      Under a UC agreement, all amendments to the BBA must be offered by 5:00 on
      Wednesday afternoon.

      HOUSE:
      Convene at 11:00 am for legislative business; No votes before 12 noon.
      Consider H.R. 624, Armored Car Reciprocity, under suspension of the rules
        [SAP pending: No objection)
      Consider H.R. 497, Re: Blue Cross / Blue Shield Charter, under suspension of
      the rules
        [No SAP)
      Hold a vote on H.R. 668, Airport and Airway Trust.Fund Tax Reinstatement Act of
      1997. under suspension of the rules
        [SAP sent, 2/25: Administration strongly supports)
