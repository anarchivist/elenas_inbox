                                     DECEMBER 3, 1997

        Last June, I challenged all Americans to join me in a year-long effort to address what I believe
is the greatest challenge facing us in the 21 st century: Building one America out of our growing
racial and ethnic diversity.

         For the last five years, I have worked hard to fulfill a vision for America -- one that provides
opportunity for every person responsible enough to work for it, keeps America the world's strongest
force for peace, freedom and prosperity, and brings our people together across all the lines that divide
us. Weare making great progress toward these goals. Our economy is the healthiest in a generation.
 Our social problems are finally bending to our efforts. But if this country is ever to reach its greatest
potential, we must move forward as one American community -- respecting our diversity, but even
more, celebrating those things that unite us.

        In my lifetime, America has witnessed a great deal of racial progress. But, our task is far from
over. We sit at different tables at lunchtime. We move out of our neighborhoods once our
neighbors' complexions change. Even when we go to the same schools or work in the same offices,
we are too often separated by a gulf of silence.

        That's why I've come to Akron and asked you to join me here today. We must fill in the
silence with honest talk and careful listening. When it comes to race, everyone seems to have an
opinion -- one formed by the mind, in the heart, and from experience. Too often, these opinions
are formed without the benefit of true conversations with people of other races. If we don't speak
frankly about who we are and how we see each other, if we ban certain topics from our conversations
out of fear of giving offense, if we fail to listen to each other with open minds, then we only deepen
our divisions. We must use dialogue to debunk the false stereotypes, to move past the old
resentments, to discover what we still need to do to build One America.

         But concrete, specific action to bridge the gaps between us must accompany this vital
dialogue. I believe the best way to make racial progress over the long haul is to make sure everybody
who is willing to work for it has the opportunity to make the most of their own lives. In the coming
months, my administration will propose an opportunity agenda to help expand opportunities for all
Americans in education, health care, housing, crime, and civil rights enforcement. The budget I send
to Congress next year will propose new Education Opportunity Zones to reward school districts in
poor urban and rural areas for undertaking the kind of sweeping reforms that cities like Chicago have
adopted -- closing down failing schools, providing public school choice, removing bad teachers,
eliminating social promotions, and making sure children get the extra help they need to succeed.
Strong public schools are the heart of opening the American Dream to all Americans. If we're going to
succeed in the 21 st century, we must recognize that every child can learn, so long as we hold them to
high expectations and hold their schools accountable for results.

       So let's begin the dialogue with our young people. Let's find out how those who will lead the
majority of their lives in the next century are dealing with the challenge of race today. Let's walk
around in each other's shoes for a little bit and strive to understand where we're all coming from.
Most of all, let's find out how we can come together as one America today and in the years to come.
