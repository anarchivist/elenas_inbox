    Anti-smoking funds in line for deep cuts

                                           Many, including GOP Gov. Jeb Bush,
    are
                                           worried the cuts may keep teens from
                                           getting the anti-tobacco message.

                                      By PETER WALLS TEN

                                      . St. Petersburg Times, published April
    20, 1999


                                      TALLAHASSEE -- The popular anti-tobacco
    campaign that
                                      has won praise from former Surgeon
    General C. Everett
                                      Koop, President Clinton and smoking
    critics nationwide is
                                      about to be scaled back.

                                      Republican leaders in the state
    Legislature agreed late Monday
                                      to slash the campaign's marketing budget
    in half, a move the
                                      campaign's fans and even GOP Gov. Jeb
    Bush said Monday
                                      could damage efforts to curb teen
    smoking.

                                      During this year's legislative session,
    GOP leaders were
                                      skeptical that the anti-smoking campaign
    was working. But on
                                     Monday, advocates for the. campaign
    charged that the
                                     Legislature was bowing to the wishes of
    the powerful tobacco
                                      industry.



                                 "This thing in the Legislature has never
 been about (the
                                 campaign's) success," said Jared Perez,
  an 18-year-old
                                 student at Palm Harbor University High
  School who helped
                                 design the edgy "Truth" campaign.   "It's
 about politics."

                                 House and Senate leaders agreed to give
  the advertising
                                 campaign $12-million -- a drastic
 reduction from the current
                                 year's $26.6-million budget.

                                 Lawmakers want to cut the pilot program's
 overall budget --
                                 which includes local youth partnerships,
 school programs and
                                 enforcement against underage smoking
 from this year's
                                 $70-million total to $45-million.

                                 Bush and the program's supporters had
 asked for $61-million,
                                 with $22-million going for the Truth
 campaign.

                                 If the ad campaign is cut in half, Bush
 worried aloud Monday
                                 that teens might not get the message.

                                 "It like running a political campaign,"
 he said. "You've got to
                                 make sure your message hits the
 audience. "

                                 Formally called the Anti-Tobacco pilot
 Program, the effort
                                 was created last year by Gov. Lawton
 Chiles with funds from
                                 Florida's $13.1-billion settlement with
 tobacco companies.

                                 The agreement on the tobacco program came
 as legislators
                                 wound down their negotiations on
 Florida's $48-billion budget.
                                 While the House and Senate have agreed on
 the major issues,
                                 the fine print will not be known until
 later this week.

                                 House and Senate leaders insist they
 never had any direct or
                                 indirect contact with the tobacco
 industry on the subject. And
                                 the industry has denied accusations that
 it has worked to derail


                                  the Truth campaign.

                                  State Rep. Ken Pruitt, R-Port St. Lucie,
       and Sen. Locke Burt,
                                  R-Ormond Beach, were not deterred by the
       criticism.

                                  "If nobody's happy, that usually means
       we've done a good job
                                  spending the people's money wisely,"
       Pruitt said.

                                  The Truth campaign has been at the center
       of controversy in
                                  the Capitol for weeks.

                                  When the state House announced its first
       proposed budget,
                                  which included no money for the campaign,
       anti-smoking
                                  advocates were outraged.

                                  A group of teens protested in the Capitol
       and irritated some
                                  legislative leaders with their aggressive
       approach.

                                  At the same time, the results of the
       Florida Youth Tobacco
                                  Survey were released, showing the
       campaign could have been
                                  responsible for a dramatic decline in
       teen smoking over the
                                  past year.

                                  The plot thickened when the Bush
       administration fired the
                                  program's director, prompting Democrats
       to question the
                                  governor's true commitment to its
       funding.

                                  State Health Secretary Bob Brooks said he
       made the change
                                  because he wanted the pilot program to
       shift away from
                                  marketing and more toward education and
       cessation
                                  programs.

                                  The GOP position also drew fire from one
       of the attorneys
                                  who represented the state against the
       industry.

                                  Wayne Hogan, a lawyer from Jacksonville,
       reneged on a
                                  $2-million donation to House Speaker John
       Thrasher's alma
                                  mater, Florida State University, after he


  read that Thrasher
                                  wanted to eliminate the anti-smoking
  campaign and shift
                                  money to medical programs at FSU.

                                  Amid all the activity, the
  Washington-based Campaign for
                                  Tobacco-Free Kids released a poll showing
  about 75 percent
                                  of Floridians support fully funding the
  campaign, and that the
                                  support holds up even among conservative
  Republicans.

                                  The man who conducted the poll, Fred
  Steeper, is a prominent
                                  GOP pollster who worked for George Bush's
  presidential
                                  campaigns and now works for Texas Gov.
  George W. Bush.

                                  "It is frustrating to have to fight so
  hard to convince the
                                  Legislature to fund a program that is
  recognized as the best
                                  program in the country," said Ralph
  DeVitto, a lobbyist for the
                                  American Cancer Society.
