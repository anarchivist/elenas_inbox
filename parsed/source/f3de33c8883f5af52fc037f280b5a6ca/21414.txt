TEXT:
Here is revised, still very rough draft of a one-pager on riders.

This is a document that will be given to friends on the Hill and off.
The riders to be included are the ones we want to have a public fight
over.   Again this is just an initial draft -- in addition to comments
send along additional riders that we want to engage publicly on. We would
like to start with a broad list and give people a chance to react and
winnow it down to a core list.

Thanks.

                         The First Step:             Drop Controversial Riders
                                                  October 5, 1998

The President has proposed a budget that focuses on the basic fundamentals needed to
keep the country moving forward:
                                                                                Automated Records Management System
           Saving Social Security First.
                                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion
       _   Investing in education and in a cleaner environment.
       _   Leading the response to the global financial tunnoil.

The Congressional Majority has taken its eye off of these basic fundamentals. That is why
they failed to even pass a budget resolution, despite a April 15th legal deadline. And why they sent only one
appropriations bill to the President's desk before the fiscal year began. Instead of focusing on basic budget
decisions and making the needed investments:
           The Congress has loaded down the appropriations bills with scores of controversial and
           objectionable riders. These non-budget provisions are an unnecessary distraction that pose a
           major obstacle to achieving a budget solution.

The time has come to return the focus to the basic task at hand: achieving a budget
solution. Dropping these controversial riders is the critical first step needed to achieve success. It is time
to put progress over partisanship and to put common sense over ideology.

Examples of Riders that should be dropped:
    Numerous Objectionable Environmental Riders -- The next week will detennine whether this has been a
    pro- or anti-environment Congress. Right now the Congressional Majority is heading in a very
    anti-environment direction. They have weighed down the appropriations bill with many riders that would
    be hannful to the environment ...... [CEQ insert language] ... that would gutlhurtJdevastate forests ...... .
    Undermining of the Brady Law -- Extraneous language included would undennine FBI background
    checks related to the Brady handgun law. This is a law that the American people resoundingly support and
    its implementation should not be undenni~ed.
    Denying an accurate Census. The statistical methods incorporated in the Census Bureau's plan,
    which are based on recommendations from the National Academy of Sciences, would produce the
    most accurate census possible and virtually eliminate the large undercounts of minorities, children,
    and other groups that occurred in the 1990 census. The onerous House language restrictions on the
    Census should be dropped.
     Prohibition on National Testing -- The House has included language would prohibit the
    development, implementation, and administration of the tests unless explicitly authorized. This
    would bring a haIt to the President's efforts to help States and parents raise academic standards
    through a voluntary national test.
·   OSHA Peer Review -- The House includes language that requires a peer review panel for all proposed
    OSHA regulations. OSHA already has an extensive public hearing process where any interested party may
    testify. OSHA must address all significant issues raised. The agency conducts peer reviews when
    appropriate. This provi~ion is unnecessary, overly broad, and would further delay OSHA's process for
    issuing regulations.
