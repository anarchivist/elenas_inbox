TEXT:
I received word yesterday that we will be announcing a business council
out of the child care conference.  I urge that we change the name -- given
labor's historical and present record of establishing labor/management
child care centers, calling a council "business" would very much disturb
labor leaders -- any other name would work better --

also, can we make the connection between quality child care and child care
workers -- who are among the lowest paid and receive no benefits --
especially since I understand we will be announcing a national registery
-- child care workers 'hear this as the only thing we say about workers who
care for children is that they are criminals -- we need to balance this
with some affirmative statements about workers and a policy statement
about their wages, working conditions and benefits because they are
horrible.   We we talk about child care "providers"   I fear we are
thinking institutionally and not about workers -- they are the bulk of the
providers.

Thank you for your consideration in this regard.
