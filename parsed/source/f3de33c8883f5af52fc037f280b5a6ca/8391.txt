It is appalling that Congess would decide to intervene in the drug safety
practices of the Food and Drug Administration. For years, the FDA has


used rigorous testing and the highest of scientific standards to protect
public health.  Now, this congressional action would substitute political
ideology for sound science, and that is a  serious mistake. And it would
restrict scientific research that can protect women's health and offer
safe medical choices.

Q: Will the President veto this measure?

Since the provision was just added in one House, it's too early to say.
