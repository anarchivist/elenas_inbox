Individual Development Accounts: The Senate passed by voice vote the
Humans Services reauthorization bill which reauthorizes the Head Start
program, the Community Services Block Grant, and the Low Income Home
Energy Assistance Program for five years.  This bill also includes the
Coats-Harkin Individual Development Account (IDA) proposal that we support
(but have yet to do so formally) .
