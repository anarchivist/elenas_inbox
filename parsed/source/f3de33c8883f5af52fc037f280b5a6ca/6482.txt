TEXT:
I want to make sure you have heard the rumor that FTC is going to ask
congress to give it the authority to regulate tobacco advertising in
testimony next Monday or Tuesday.  Since FTC is an independent agency its
testimony is not cleared by OMB.  I'm not certain which hearing this would
be. There is a McCain hearing scheduled for Tuesday.   Should we call FTC
and inquire?
