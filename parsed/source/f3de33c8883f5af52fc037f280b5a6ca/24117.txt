TEXT:
Elena and Sandy,
We have been discussing the need to move ahead rapidly on collecting data
for the Race Initiative. We have set up a meeting with Judy Winston for
Wednesday and hope that some work can be done between now and then.

I reviewed the draft outline that Sandy prepared using Chris Edley's
framework.   I think that it is a good start, but it needs more detail.  We
would like for you all to identify one person with expertise to be our
main contact for each of the broad categories we are researching.   Jose
Cerda had mentioned that the DPC had identified some staff members to
serve in this capacity.   The categories where we need a contact are:
health
education
housing
crime & the criminal justice system
economic status / labor markets
political participation
public attitudes about race relations

Under each of these categories, it would be helpful to identify the
following information:
key indicators of progress
trends in disparities among races
where have positive changes occurred (especially those where government
intervention has made a difference)
where are disparities growing
costs of discrimination
data sources, upcoming studies, other resources of information

We would expect the contacts to work closely with the federal agencies to
gather this information.
Is it possible that you could bring to the Wednesday meeting the key
contacts for each of the 7 areas and have each of them bring a list of
the key data elements they would expect to collect?

please feel free to call (5-1013) or email me if you have any questions or
concerns.
Thanks very much.
