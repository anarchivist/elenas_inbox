TEXT:
Just had a lengthy and enlightening conversation with Cecilia Calvo at W2W
partnership. She is a wealth of information about what's going on in U.K.
reo welfare reform, having recently led a group of high level British
officials on a tour to NY, Washington, St Louis and Milwaukee and spending
several weeks in Britain learning about what they are doing. She says
that the most immediate focus is a 'New Deal' for 18-24 year olds,
starting in 12 pilot sites in January and going national in April.  The
program targets unemployed youth who will be called in once they have
received assistance for 6 months.  They will come into a job center, meet
with a 'New Deal' advisor, get an assessment, and if determined job ready,
go to work.  If not, they will go through 12 weeks of Strive-like job
readiness, including assessment for substance abuse and learning
disabilities, then go to one of four steps: unsubsidized job, long-term
training, voluntary sector (sort of like work experience), or work in the
environmental sector. This is largely a male population, not single
parents.

Given this focus, we may want to reconsider some of the site visit
options, or at least ask people in the four states if they have
suggestions for programs focusing on a similar population. cecilia is
sending me some info about some Americorps/welfare reform partnerships in
Florida and NY. She said her visit to YouthBuild in St Louis was also
good.    At the same time, she says Blair et al remain very interested in
how to operate effective job centers and private sector involvement.
Seems to me the question is to what extent we want to highlight the youth
issue, since the population the Brits are targeting is not really a
primary focus of our welfare reform initiatives. Do you have any thoughts
on this?
