TEXT:
Thank you for your quick review of the Family Planning language for the
House L/HHS SAP. As agreed to on the phone, here is the language that we
will submit for the final floor SAP. As also discussed on the phone, we
will make no substantive updates to the Hyde text in the SAP.

We just received word that the L/HHS Bill is scheduled to go to the House
Floor at 2:00 pm today.  The SAP is going up within minutes.

FAMILY PLANNING TEXT TO BE SUBMITTED FOR FINAL HOUSE FLOOR SAP
"The Administration supports efforts to encourage minors to discuss their
health care needs with their families.  However, it would oppose a
potential amendment on the House floor requiring parental consent for
minors to receive contraceptive health services in Title X Family
Planning clinics. Mandating parental consent for contraceptive services
could discourage sexually active minors from seeking all health care and
reproductive counseling services and thus lead to more unwarranted
pregnancies, more abortions and more sexually transmitted diseases,
including HIV, among our nationD,s youth.  As an alternative, the
Administration supports the amendment adopted in Committee that requires
clinics to certify that they encourage family participation in the
decision of minors to seek family planning services and provide counseling
to minors on resisting attempts to coerce minors into engaging in sexual
activities."
