    PRESIDENT CLINTON'S PLAN TO STRENGTHEN ACCOUNTABILITY FOR
                       RESULTS IN EDUCATION

In his State of the Union Address, President Clinton will announce a package of proposals
designed to hold students, teachers, and schools to high standards, and to make sure that school
districts and states fulfill their responsibilities to provide students with a high quality education.
These proposals will help to lift student achievement in every public school and to close the
opportunity gap by giving special attention to disadvantaged students in low-performing schools.
Ifpassed, the President's proposal would mark a seachange in federal education policy,
demanding for the first time that states put in place the kind of accountability measures that
produce results. Specifically, the President will announce that he will send Congress legislation
to reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which will require states and school
districts receiving federal money:

End Social Promotion. The President's proposal will require states and school districts to end
social promotion -- the practice of promoting students from grade to grade regardless of whether
they have mastered the appropriate material and are academically prepared to do the work at the
next level. Students who are promoted without regard to their achievement fall even further
behind their classmates, and are more likely to lack basic skills upon graduating from high
school.

To ensure that this requirement helps more students succeed, rather than simply increasing the
number held back, states and school districts would have to show how they will help students
meet promotion standards on time by (I) strengthening learning opportunities in the classroom
with clear standards, small classes with well-prepared teachers, high quality professional
development, and use of proven instructional practices; (2) identifying students who need help
at the earliest possible moment; and (3) providing extended learning time, including after-school
and summer school for students who need extra help; and (4) developing an effective remedial
plan, with intensive intervention, for students who still do not meet the standards, so they can get
back on track in their schooling.

In 1996 President Clinton challenged every state and school district to adopt policies to end
social promotion and require students to pass high school graduation exams. Twenty six
states now have high school exit exams, and last year four states adopted policies to stop
promoting unprepared students from grade to grade. A growing number of urban school
districts, including Boston, Philadelphia, New York City, and Washington D.C. are
adopting similar policies. In Chicago, which three years ago ended the practice of social
promotion in a way that gives students who need it substantial extended learning time,
citywide math and reading scores have gone up every year, with the largest gains among
the most disadvantaged students. President Clinton's FY 2000 budget proposes to triple
federal funding for after-school and summer school programs (from $200 million to $600
million) to help schools ending social promotion give students the extra help they need to
succeed.

Put Qualified Teachers in the Classroom. According to the National Commission on
                               Hex-Dump Conversion

Teaching and America's Future, the knowledge and skills teachers bring to the classroom is one
of the most important factors in improving student achievement. Yet every year, approximately
50,000 individuals teach on "emergency" certificates,which means they do not meet the
standards the state has set for certification. In addition, numerous teachers teach subjects for
which they lack adequate preparation, with fully one quarter of secondary school teachers lacking
even a minor in their main teaching field. Students in schools with the highest concentrations of
poverty -- those who often need the most help from the best teachers -- are most likely to be in
classrooms with teachers who are not fully qualified: for example, in schools with the highest
minority enrollment, students have a less than 50 percent change of having a math or science
teacher with a license and degree in the field.

The President's proposal will require states to adopt competency tests for all new teachers,
requiring them to demonstrate both subject-matter knowledge and teaching expertise. The
proposal also will require states and school districts to phase out, over five years, the use of
teachers with emergency certificates and the practice of assigning teachers to subjects for which
they lack adequate preparation. To support these new teacher quality standards, the proposal
will provide resources to help states strengthen teacher certification standards, implement
competency testing for new teachers, provide training to current teachers, and give incentives to
recruit more highly qualified teachers.

Turn Around Low Performing Schools. The President's proposal will require states to
identify the schools with the lowest achievement levels and least improvement and take
corrective action to tum them around. These corrective actions, based on a careful assessment
of each school's needs, would include steps such as intensive teacher training, support to
improve school discipline, and the implementation of proven approaches to school reform. If
these actions do not result in improved student achievement within two years, the proposal would
require states to take additional corrective actions, such as permitting students to attend other
public schools; reconstituting the school, by fairly evaluating the staff and making staff changes
as appropriate; or closing the school and reopening it as a charter school or with an entirely new
staff. Nineteen states currently take similar actions to help improve low-performing schools,
and experience demonstrates that when these interventions carefully implemented and
accompanied by the resources to support change, schools improve and student achievement
increases. The President's FY 2000 budget contains $200 million to help states begin taking
these steps immediately.

Issue School Report Cards. The President's proposal will require states to distribute to all
parents annual report cards for each school and school district, as well as the state as a whole.
The report cards will include information on student achievement, teacher professional
qualifications, class size, school safety, and other factors that will help parents to judge the
performance of the schools. Where appropriate, the report cards also will show the academic
achievement of ethnic and racial subgroups, to ensure accountability for helping all students
achieve. Thirty-six states currently publish or require local school districts to publish school
report cards, and five additional states will begin the practice in the next two years. A recent
report by Public Agenda, however, shows that only 31 percent of parents had seen these report
cards. The President's proposal will help ensure that all parents in all states have access to the
                                Automated Records Management System
                                Hex-Dump Conversion

     infonnation they need to evaluate the quality of their schools and identify the areas in which
     improvement is needed.
