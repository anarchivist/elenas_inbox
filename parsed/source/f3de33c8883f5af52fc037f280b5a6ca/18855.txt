We talked to USTR and FDA

  1.   USTR says we shouldn't use the word "equivalent" because that word is
  a term of art in our SPS agreement.
  2.   Also they said the legislation is not comparing the actual food
. safety systems, it is just comparing the safety of the end product.  If we
  used the phrase "systems that are equivalent to our own" then other
  countries,particularly Europe would want us to procesS our food exactly
  like we do.   ==================== ATTACHMENT   1 ====================

     PRESIDENT CLINTON ANNOUNCES INTRODUCTION OF SENATE FOOD
       SAFETY LEGISLATION AND REPORT TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF
           IMPORTED AND DOMESTIC FRUITS AND VEGETABLES
                            March 4, 1998

Today President Clinton will announce the introduction oflegislation by Senators Milkulski and
Kennedy to ensure the safety of all imported foods, including fruits and vegetables. This
legislation will enhance the Food and Drug Administration's authority to prevent the import of
fruits, vegetables, and other food products that do not meet U.S. food safety requirements. The
President also will announce the release of a report that provides a blueprint on how the
Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Department of Agriculture (USDA)
will work cooperatively with the agricultural community to develop guidance on good
agricultural and manufacturing practices for fruits and vegetables.

Enhanced FDA Oversight for Imported Foods. The President will call on Congress to pass
the food safety legislation to be introduced today in the Senate to give the FDA greater authority
over imported foods. This legislation will permit the FDA to halt imports of fruits, vegetables,
and other food products from any foreign country with food safety systems that do not provide
the same level of protection required for U.S. products. The legislation also will permit the
FDA to halt imports from countries or facilities that do not allow FDA inspections to occur.
This legislation gives FDA authority that is comparable to USDA's existing authority to prevent
the importation of unsafe meat and poultry. The President already has committed to providing
approximately $25 million in his Fiscal Year 1999 budget to enable the FDA to dramatically
expand its international food inspection force in order to implement this legislation. Reps.
Eshoo and Pallone previously have introduced this legislation in the House of Representatives.

Development of Guidance on Good Agricultural and Manufacturing Practices. The
President will announce the release of a report on how the Secretary of Health and Human
Services, in partnership with the Secretary of Agriculture and in cooperation with the agricultural
community, to develop guidance on good agricultural and manufacturing practices. This report
outlines the progress already made -- and the measures that must still be taken -- to develop
guidance for the growing, processing, shipping, and marketing of fruits and vegetables by
October 1998. The guidance -- the first-ever specific safety standards for fruits and vegetables --
will address potential food safety problems throughout the production and distribution system
and help ensure the sanitation and safety practices of all those seeking to sell produce in the U.S.
market. The report also provides both short- and long-term plans for technical assistance,
education, and outreach activities to support the appropriate application of the guidance.
