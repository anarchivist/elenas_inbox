TEXT:
If we like, we could announce a new summit commitment in the radio address
as well, related to high school service. Here's the official commitment:

"The National Association of Secondary school Principals, representing
more than 40,000 school administrators, pledge to introduce more than 2
million students to the concepts and "how to's" of service learning,
bringing the service ethic and opportunity to young people through its
core programs:  the National Association of Student Councils, the National
Honor Society/National Junior Honor Society; and the new American
Technology Honor Society."

I have forwarded it to Waldman.   I think this is worth seeing if it fits
in. What do you think?
