FYI: You probably know this, but the CPSC statute says "firearms, firearms
ammunition, and components of firearms ammunition ... " so it does address
firearms themselves.

Hmm.  The CPSC language you quoted talks about firearms ammunition, which
is not what we're talking about here. And can I see the ATF law? I have
to say that the prospect of getting into a fight with Congress on this one
doesn't strike me as so bad.
