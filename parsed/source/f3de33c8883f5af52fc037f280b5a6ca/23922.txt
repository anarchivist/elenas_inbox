TEXT:
We would like to set up a working group on tobacco that could meet several
times throughout the summer.  For the first meeting, we have set aside
Wednesday, June 2, at 4:00pm in room 211 of OEOB.  Please let me know if
that time does not work for you.   I will follow-up with a confirmation.

Pam, please forward to additional DOJ folks per our discussion.

Thank you.
