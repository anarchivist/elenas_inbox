TEXT:
This is just a reminder that we're meeting with our buddies from
nga/apwa/ncsl on Wed at 1 (Room 472).  Emily, I hope you are coming; i
think it's problematic for you NOT to attend, so let me know if there's a
conflict.  Elena, it's totally optional for you.

(Also, we have our Tuesday subgroup meeting tomorrow at 3 in room 211.
This is optional for all of you (although I would really like to have OMB
there) . )
