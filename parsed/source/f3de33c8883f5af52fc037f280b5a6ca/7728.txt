Susan Page is slated to do an interview with the President on 5/20. The
focus of her article is supposed to be tobacco. The article will run in
the Friday edition which stays on the stands through Tues. I think the
President will be briefed on tobacco already for the tobacco event but I
thought you guys should know/ be prepared for this.
