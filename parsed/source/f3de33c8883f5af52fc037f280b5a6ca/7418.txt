                    RADIO ADDRESS OF THE PRESIDENT
                             TO THE NATION



         THE PRESIDENT:  Good morning.  Today, I want to
talk about our efforts to improve service and end abuses at the
Internal Revenue Ser~ice. American citizens have every right to
expect that they'll be treated with respect by a government that
works for them. A big part of our values as a people include
courtesy, efficiency and fairness from government.

         For far too long in the minds of too many Americans
the IRS has symbolized an immense bureaucracy, a place where unfair
treatment and unresponsive service were far too common. We've worked
hard to give the American people an IRS that is fairer, more
efficient, more responsive to their needs, and to support the many
dedicated IRS employees who do want to serve them well. And we've
made progress.

         Two years ago I was proud to sign into law the
second Taxpayer Bill of Rights.  It's made it easier for taxpayers to
appeal IRS decisions and to recover attorney's fees when the IRS
makes mistakes. And last May, Vice President Gore and Treasury
Secretary Bob Rubin began an unflinching top to bottom review of


customer service at the IRS.  They reported back to me with their
recommendations and we're already beginning to see a new IRS that is
more committed to the needs of taxpayers.

         We're keeping IRS offices open longer during filing
season, launching independent citizen advocacy panels to help
taxpayers get relief.  Now you can call the IRS and get telephone
service six days a week, 18 hours a day -- soon i t ' l l be 24 hours a
day. And this year, 24 million Americans saved an awful lot of time
and hassle by filing their returns on the phone or electronically.
I've also appointed a new IRS Commissioner and a new kind of IRS
Commissioner.  Charles Rossotti is an experienced businessman who
spent his entire career on the taxpayer side of the table.

         But we've got more to do.  Like most Americans, I
was outraged by testimony at last week's congressional hearings on
the IRS, by the stories of our citizens harassed and humiliated by
what seemed to be an unaccountable downright tone-deaf agency.  These
problems developed over years, of course, and we can't solve them all
overnight. But Commissioner Rossotti has moved swiftly to route out
abuses and to further reform operations of the IRS.

         Also, he's asked Judge William Webster, the former
Director of the FBI and the CIA, to conduct an independent review of
the criminal investigation division. As further steps are needed
they will be taken.

         But above all, our new Commissioner needs new tools
to build a better IRS, and he needs them now.   Last year, our
administration worked with the House of Representatives to pass
sweeping, strong, bipartisan reform of the IRS, to give citizens more
protection, improve service, reduce abuse.  Now the Senate is poised
to enact very similar legislation.  I call on Congress to make this
year the year we set aside political differences to enact real
reforms of the IRS. When it comes to quality service at the IRS,
congress can't afford to file for an extension.

         As we continue to improve our work we may uncover
more problems at the IRS. Now, if we do I pledge to the American
people that once again we'll act swiftly, guarding against abuse,
punishing those who cross the line. And as we do, we will build a
fairer and more effective government for a stronger America in the
21st century.

         Thanks for listening.

                                  END
