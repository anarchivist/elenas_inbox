TEXT:
We have voiced general support for the Cardin amendment to the House child
support incentives bill, but we do have some concerns about it.   It would
exclude aliens who owe child support from admission to the U.S. and make
them ineligible for visas.   The INS is very concerned about the
administrative burden this would create, since a check could be required
every time an alien leaves the country, even if only for a day.   The
Center on Budget is working on an alternative that it hopes to sell Cardin
on.   (Cardin is motivated by one particular child support scofflaw -- a
wealthy foreign businessman who isn't detected by other enforcement tools
like wage withholding.)   The Center's compromise is that a state can
create a list of people for whom the usual enforcement techniques don't
work, and the INS denies admission to those people based on that more
limited list it maintains at the border.    If Cardin OK's this compromise,
I am told others on the Hill will be satisfied with it, too.   I am
assuming we would go along with this, but let me know if you disagree.
