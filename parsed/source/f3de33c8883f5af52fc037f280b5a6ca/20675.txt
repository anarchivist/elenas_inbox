TEXT:
Last night, Lowey was able to rewrite her contraceptives amendment so that
it was germane.  It passed 224-198.   I have revised the letter
accordingly, taking out the paragraph on Lowey. The question is, given
this vote, whether Congress is quite as extreme as we portray them.
Certainly, the Mexico City Policy would still lead to more abortions and
unintended pregnancies, so I left that in.==================== ATTACHMENT      1 ======

weeks to restrict safe reproductive choices for women. It is regrettable that some Members of
Congress have chosen to pursue a series of initiatives designed to create a political issue at the
risk of increasing unintended pregnancies and abortions and of compromising women's health
and safety.

        I have long said that I believe abortion should be safe, legal, and rare. All of the
proposals being offered would restrict safe medical choices. Same One would actually restrict
access to family planning information and services and could have the perverse effect of
increasing the number of unintended pregnancies and abortions. I urge the Congress to put
partisan politics aside and instead put women's health and safety first.

        first, I am very aisappoiHtea tbat the HOHse struol( COHgressv/omaH Lowey's proposal to
reqHire bealtb plaRs partioipatiRg iR tbe feaeral Employees Healtb BeRefits Program to ooyer all
FDA apprOyea presoriptioR oORtraoeptives. The Loviey proposal wOHla ba;'e improyea Basic

aeortioR.

        SeOORa, First, I strongly object to the amendment to impose restrictions on international
family planning programs. By prohibiting foreign non-governmental organizations from
receiving United States funds if the organization uses any non-US government funds for
abortion-related services, the amendment jeopardizes funding to health care providers who are
working to meet the growing demand for family planning and other critical health services in
developing countries. Moreover, requiring recipients of US funds to refrain from advocating
changes or even calling attention to alleged defects in abortion laws would interfere with lawful
free speech and the ability of organizations to participate in the democratic processes of their
own countries. Ultimately, the result of this amendment's provisions could also be an increase in
unintended pregnancies, abortions, and maternal and infant death.

        Third, Second, I find it deeply disturbing that CORgress the House would take the
unprecedented step of intervening in the Food and Drug Administration's drug approval process
by banning funding for the approval or testing of drugs such as RU-486. For years, the FDA has
used vigorous testing and the highest scientific standards to protect public health. This
amendment substitutes political ideology for sound science. It would restrict scientific research
that can protect women's lives and offer them safe medical choices.

         FO\;lrtb, Third, I am disappointed that the House chose to reject the changes that I
proposed to the Child Custody Protection Act. As my Administration conveyed to Congress, I
would support properly crafted legislation that would make it illegal to transport minors across
state lines for the purpose of avoiding parental involvement requirements. I have repeatedly
stated that I would sign a bill ifit were amended to exclude close family members from criminal
and civil liability and to ensure that individuals who provide only information, counseling,
referral, or medical services to the minor cannot be subject to liability. As amended in this way,
the legislation would prevent the circumvention of state parental involvement laws, while
ensuring healthy family communications. Unfortunately, the Congress has ignored these

provisions identified by the Department of Justice. In doing so, this Congress has demonstrated
that it is not truly interested in passing legislation, but only in creating another partisan political
issue.

         Finally, Congress is again indicating that it will tum the difficult debate over so-called
partial birth abortions into an opportunity to score political points, rather than to pass legislation
restricting this procedure. I have long opposed late term abortions, and I believe that we
generally should prohibit the use of this procedure. I have insisted, however, on exempting
those few but tragic cases in which this procedure is necessary to save a woman's life or to
protect her against serious injury to her health. I again call upon Congress to add such a narrow,
tightly drawn exception to this bill, so that I can sign it and put an end to all other uses of this
procedure.

       I urge Congress to move beyond ideology and political maneuvering, to abandon
extremism, and to protect women's lives and health, while reducing the need for abortion.
Congress's current course would remove appropriate reproductive choices for women, seriously
jeopardize their health, and very possibly increase the frequency of abortions. I will strongly
oppose these efforts.
