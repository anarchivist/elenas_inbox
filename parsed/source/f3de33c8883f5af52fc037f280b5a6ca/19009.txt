           ST ATEMENT OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
                             MARCH 16, 1998


I congratulate the public health and tobacco producer communities for working together to
promote bipartisan, comprehensive tobacco legislation that dramatically reduces youth
smoking and protects American farmers and thcir communities. I am firmly committed
that tobacco legislation protect farmers and their communities, and have made this
commitment one of the five key elements that I will insist upon before signing tobacc!)
legislation. I hope you will continue your efforts to expand your coalition and to enact
comprehensive tobacco legislation this year that protects our Nation's children.
                                       March 16, 1998



 Q:   What was the announcement today by tobacco farmers and public health groups?

A:    A coalition of public health groups and tobacco producers announced a set of core
      principles for national tobacco legislation. Among the organizations agreeing to the
      principles are the Burley Tobacco Growers Cooperative, the Flue-Cured Tobacco
      Stabilization Corporation, the American Heart Association, the American Cancer Society,
      and the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids. The principles are geared toward reducing
      disease caused by tobacco products while simultaneously ensuring the future prosperity of
      tobacco fanners and their communities. The principles discuss subjects such as FDA
      authority, limits on tobacco advertising to children, and providing fair and equitable
      compensation for tobacco fanners and their communities.

Q:    Does the President support this effort?

A:    The President strongly supports the effort to build a coalition between fanners and public
      health groups, and in his statement today the President congratulated the coalition for its
      work thus far. The President has made protecting farmers and their communities one of
      the five key elements that must be part of any comprehensive tobacco legislation he will
      sign. The coalition's effort and principles are an approach that is consistent with the
      President's policy on comprehensive tobacco legislation and he looks forward to working
      with these groups in the future.

Q:    What is the significance of this announcement for the future of tobacco legislation?

A:    The agreement between tobacco producers and public health groups demonstrates the
      potential to craft bipartisan comprehensive solutions that meet the goals of both the
      public health and tobacco fanning communities. The Administration believes that it will
      be possible to fonn a similar consensus in Congress, and that the announcement today is
      another important step in enacting comprehensive legislation this year.
