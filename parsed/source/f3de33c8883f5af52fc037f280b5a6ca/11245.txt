TEXT:
Elena,

NBAC has submitted its report entitled Research Involving Persons with
Mental Disorders That May Affect Decisionmaking Capacity to President
Clinton. The Commission concluded that additional protections are
necessary for the ethical conduct of such research and makes twenty-one
recommendations in the following areas:  review bodies, research design,
informed consent and capacity, categories of research, and surrogate
decisionmaking.

In the meantime, NIH has drafted a set of "Points to Consider" for their
grantees that addresses many of the same issues. These two documents have
large areas of agreement, although there are a few significant
disagreements that remain.

Unless I hear differently from you, this is how I plan to proceed.

1)   OSTP will send the NBAC report to the NSTC Committee on Science for
review by the agencies, asking for comments and recommendations on
implementation.   It will be accompanied by the draft "Points to Consider",
for comparison. Our ultimate goal is to seek a uniform set of guidelines
that will apply throughout the government, just as all agencies currently
follow the Common Rule for human subjects research, and RAC guidelines for
recombinant DNA research.

2)  I am going to encourage NIH to release their "Points to Consider" as
interim guidelines, to be followed while we continue to discuss our areas
of disagreement.  I believe this appropriate because the NIH document
represents a considerable increase in protection for the involved subjects
and these "Points" have large areas of agreement with the NBAC report.   I
anticipate that there will be a Presidential statement explaining what is
happening.

I would appreciate any advice you might have on preparing a Presidential
statement about the NBAC report and the NIH guidelines, with respect both
to content and to timing of the release.



Artie
