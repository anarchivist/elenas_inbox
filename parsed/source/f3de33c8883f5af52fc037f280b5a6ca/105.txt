TEXT:
You should have in your fax machines (except for Steve, whose
machine was busy) a draft Presidential signing statement for the
antiterrorism bill.    It has a firm 10:00 Tuesday morning deadline
for comments.
The statement is based on a draft supplied earlier this evening by
Justice, combined with input from State.
On page 3, there is a placeholder for habeas corpus.    The Justice
draft was silent on this, apparently on the theory that anything
to be said on this issue would be prepared by White House staff.
Todd Stern has asked me to get him a fully vetted redraft as early
Tuesday as possible.    I appreciate your efforts to meet the tight
deadline.   Thank you.
(Todd, I faxed one to you, too.)
