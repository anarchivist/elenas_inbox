TEXT:
DPC staff have asked for a timeline post this week's project on new
ideas.  For example, when do we want to submit an options memorandum to
POTUS.

Second, Elena, folks have asked if you could make it clear at the NEC-DPC
Deputies meeting that the agencies should be working through NEC and DPC
staff. Apparently there is some confusion in the agencies about
processes. When need to make it clear to them that there is one process.
