      For Immediate Release                                                              May 19,1999


                                   STATEMENT BY THE PRESIDENT


      I commend the House Commerce Committee for its overwhelming bipartisan support for the
      Work Incentives Improvement Act today. By unanimously endorsing this legislation, the
      committee has taken an important step towards removing significant barriers to work for one of
      our nation's most significant untapped resources -- millions of people with disabilities. The
      committee's action, under the leadership of Chairman Bliley and Congressman Dingell, parallels
      the overwhelmingly bipartisan support that the RothIMoynihan/Jeffords/Kennedy version ofthis
      legislation received from the Senate Finance Committee.

      Americans with disabilities can and do bring tremendous energy and talent to the American
      workforce, but the unemployment rate for all working-age adults with disabilities is nearly 75
      percent. One of the most glaring problems is that people with disabilities frequently become
      ineligible for Medicaid or Medicare if they go back to work. This puts people with disabilities in
      the untenable position of choosing between health care coverage and work. The Work Incentives
      Improvement Act would improve job opportunities for people with disabilities by increasing
      access to health care and employment services.

      Justin Dart, one of the foremost leaders of the disability community, has said that the Work
      Incentives Improvement Act is "one of the boldest since the landmark passage ofthe Americans
      with Disabilities Act." As I indicated in my State of the Union Address, I could not agree more
      with him. I urge Speaker Hastert and Majority Leader Lott to move promptly to schedule votes
      on this important and long overdue legislation.
