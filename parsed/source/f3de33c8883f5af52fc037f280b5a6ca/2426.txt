TEXT:
A few things:



1.   I think we should make clear that our terms will be as" tough as they

were on McCain.   We are going to have a very high bar.



2.   Also, we should provide for inclusion/consultation of the anti-tobacco

forces, esp. Koop/Kessler.   The last thing we need right now is these

folks saying we are selling out on this issue.   If they blast us, we

lose.   We need to get them on board.
