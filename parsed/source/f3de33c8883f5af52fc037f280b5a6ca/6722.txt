TEXT:
The Kennedy-Kassebaum legislation I enacted in 1996 is an extremely
important achievement. The Administration is conducting a thorough review
of this law to ensure we do everything possible to eliminate these harmful
practices and make this law work for all Americans. Unfortunately, there
are reports that despite this important legislation some insurers are
thwarting the intent of the law -- by giving insurance agents incentives
not to sign these Americans up for health care coverage or delaying until
they are ineligible. These practices are intolerable and we must stop
them. The Administration is conducting a thorough review of this law to
ensure we do everything possible to eliminate these harmful practices and
make this law work for all Americans.  To ensure that they stop now,
tomorrow, I am asking the Department of Health and Human Services to send
a notice to every insurer in every state to affirm that creating
incentives that make it difficult for eligible individuals to sign up is
explicitly inconsistent with the law.  The Department will advise states
to use all their current enforcement authority to eliminate these harmful
practices. And where they donD,t take action the Federal government
will.
