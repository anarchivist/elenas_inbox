                                        Welfare to Work

"Everybody that ever said people who are able-bodied on welfare ought to have to work now has
     a moral obligation to make sure that the people who have been told they have to work
  actually have jobs so they can work. We have to do that.. .. I believe that the private sector is
anxious to be asked to participate in this. I believe they want to end the permanent underclass in
            America and help people move into the thriving, growing middle class."
                                   President William 1. Clinton
                 Remarks to the Joint Session Of The North Carolina Legislature
                                           March 13, 1997


The President has launched an aggressive campaign to challenge state legislatures, businesses,
non-profits, and the faith community to take a leading role in helping move people from welfare
to work:

·      The President is traveling across the country to speak to state legislatures to challenge
       legislators to make welfare reform a success and to offer examples of what is working in
       other states and communities. Welfare reform was a central part of recent speeches in
       Maryland, Michigan, and North Carolina.

·      The President is reaching out to employers large and small, challenging them to become
       involved in the welfare to work effort. The President initially spoke with a group of 14
       CEOs interested in helping people move from welfare to work. During the State of the
       Union Address, the President announced commitments from five of these companies--
       Sprint, Monsanto, UPS, Burger King, and United Airlines .. The White House staff
       continues to speak with companies who have expressed interest in becoming involved.

·      The President and Mrs. Clinton have met with religious leaders, including at theWhite
       House Prayer Breakfast and the Congressional Prayer breakfast, both times challenging
       the faith community to help with the welfare to work effort.

·      The President's budget includes initiatives to help companies and communities provide
       job opportunities for welfare recipients. His budget includes $3 billion for a
       Welfare-to-Work Jobs Challenge to help communities move one million of the
       hardest-to-employ welfare recipients into jobs by the year 2000. To complement
       the $3 billion Welfare-to-Work Jobs proposal, the FY 1998 Budget includes an
       enhanced and expanded Work Opportunity Tax Credit. First, the WOTC would
       be enhanced for long-term welfare recipients for three years. This credit would
       allow employers who hire welfare recipients to claim a 50 percent tax credit on the
       first $10,000 of wages paid to that person for two years. Wages may include the
       cost of training, health insurance, and day care. Second, the WOTC would be
       expanded to make a new population -- 18-50 year olds made ineligible for food
       stamps -- eligible for the existing base credit for the next three years.
