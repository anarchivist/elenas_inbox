TEXT:
Here's what's happening w/air bags. A couple of events have put them in
the news.  Leonard Evans -- GM's top research guy said in a Monday Wash.
Times article that the gov' t' s estimate of lives save.d is speculative and
has been stated over-confidently.     CBS did piece last night on this.
National Transportation Safety Board met today and made a number of
recommendations on seatbelt use and airbags that are consistent with our
agenda (e.g. states should pass laws requiring kids 12 and under in back
seat; NHTSA should publish a final rule on on/off switches). NTSB also
recommended putting black boxes in cars to get better info on nature of
crashes to improve car safety design -- don't think we have a position on
that yet.

More to come soon. DOT is wrapping up work on the on/off switch rule
(right now DOT thinks it will allow cutoff switches on a retrofit
basis). NHTSA told press today they expect to issue the final rule in a
matter of weeks not months, and that we will come in well under our
average rulemaking time.  The rule is at OMB on an informal basis; NHTSA
anticipates getting it over to OMB formally late this week early next
week. We should start a discussion soon w/ DOT about how to roll it out.
