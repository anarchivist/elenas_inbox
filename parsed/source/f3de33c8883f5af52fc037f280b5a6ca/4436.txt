TEXT:
The National Performance Review prepared a chart, which I will send you,
which shows the varied success of agencies to date to meet their federal
welfare hiring goals. Both the Executive Office of the President and the
Office of Personnel Management have already hired 100% of those they
pledged to hire by the year 2000. Also on the high end are the Social
Security Administration (25%), the Department of Labor (22%) and HHS
(19%). As of August 22nd, however, HOD had met 0% of its goal, Commerce
and State 1%, and Justice 2%, EPA and NASA 3%.  The Department of
Education has hired only one person, 5% of its 21 person commitment.

The National Performance Review staff have been working with all the
agencies on their performance.    I recently worked with Anne McGuire and
Barry Toiv to organize a meeting of agency policy and communications staff
to reinforce the importance of 1) improving performance; and 2) managing
press inquiries.

I thought it might be useful to send a note 'from you, Bruce, to all the
members of the Domestic Policy Council saying something like "I thought
you would be interested to see this chart comparing 'agency performance in
meeting their federal hiring commitments. As you may know, agencies must
report their fiscal year 1997 hires to the National Performance Review by
November 15th. Contact Bob Stone at XXX-XXXX for more information."
ro,ll make sure the idea doesno,t step on any toes in the VPo,s office. Wh
at do you think?
