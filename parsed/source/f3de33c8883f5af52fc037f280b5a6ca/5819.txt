TEXT:
HHS plans to post a summary of the states' TANF Financial Reports on the
web. They have shared a draft with us that they hoped to post tomorrow.
They do not plan to do a press release or make a big deal about the
data.   They do plan to share information with the Hill and state
organizations. The data is very preliminary and definitely subject to
change. After reviewing it and conferring with Cynthia, we recommend
delaying for about a week for the following reasons.
The report reflects data as of 12/19, from 41 states. As you may recall,
states were required to submit their -first quarterly report on 11/14, but
could not be penalized as long as they report by 12/31.    It doesn't make a
lot of sense to post the report missing data from 10 states if they plan
to submit by 12/31 (or already have).    I have a call in to HHS to see if
they know the status of the remaining states.
Spending on work activities looks fairly low though there are some
explanations (primarily that 97 was a transition year and many states also
spent JOBS money for work activities during this year).    It would look
higher with the remaining states factored in. Also, several states who
have submitted did not break down information on work activities--HHS is
following up to find out why. Given that this includes CA, this really
skews spending on work activities.
By waiting a few days, HHS could include the remaining states (or at least
those who report by 12/31) and get clarification from the states who did
not provide specific data on work activities.
HHS ' narrative needs substantial revision's to clarify the data presented.
Bottom line is that the advantages of posting the data immediately seem to
be far outweighed by the advantages of waiting a few days.

FYI, 11 states report spending on separate state programs, ranging from 2%
to 50% of state funds expended. Hawaii is at 50%, Colorado at 27%.

 I have a conference call scheduled with ACF folks late this afternoon and
I will walk through both our specific comments and suggestions on the
report and suggest the delay.  In the event Olivia is not happy with
delaying, she may call you.
