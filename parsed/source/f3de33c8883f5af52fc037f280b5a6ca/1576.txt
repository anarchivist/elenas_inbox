TEXT:
I gave Justice the last draft I had of the liquor letter.  They were
wondering if a sentence should be included which shows the link between
alcohol and other behavior (e.g., "Recent research shows a clear
connection between alcohol consumption and increased domestic violence,
youth violence, and delinquency.")

I realize it may be too late to include this now, but I thought I would
run it by you.

Could you email me the latest copy of the letter?   Thanks.
