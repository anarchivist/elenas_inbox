              TEXT:
              CDC discovered an error in their math -- here is the revised version:

              Today's MMWR (embargoed until 5pm today) finds that more than 3000
              children begin smoking regularly everyday. While the actual number is
              estimated ,to be 3359, the confidence interval is such that CDC is saying
              "more than" 3000 (compared to the "nearly" 3000 that they used to say) .
              This translates to 1.2 million kids each year becoming daily smokers.
              What is perhaps more newsworthy is their finding that between 1988 and
              1996, the number of children who became daily smokers increased by 73
              percent -- if the rate of smoking had remained constant during this time,
              then 1.5 million fewer children would have become regular smokers by 1996.

              What is perhaps more newsworthy is their finding that between 1988 and
              1996, the number of children who became daily smokers increased by 42
              percent -- if the rate of smoking had remained constant during this time,
              then 1.5 million fewer children would have become regular smokers by 1996.

              We are doing a weekly item on this.
