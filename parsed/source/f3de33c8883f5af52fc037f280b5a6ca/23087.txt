TEXT:
I will send over a new draft of the Food Safety Council's assessment of
the NAS report. Apparently, at each subsequent draft, HHS is taking a
harder stand to insert language to imply that we will not do a
reorganization. Cliff Gabriel, who has been putting the agencies' edits
in, is at an impasse now with HHS.   The comments in question are bolded
in the new draft. We should talk about this at our meeting on Thursday.
