     MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

     FROM:                 BRUCE REED
                           ELENA KAGAN
                           MARY SMITH

     SUBJECT:            DIRECTIVE TO OPM FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RESOURCE
                    GUIDE

            On Wednesday, November 4, the Vice President will host a domestic violence event
     where he will announce that the Social Security Administration will now make it easier for
     victims of domestic violence to change their social security numbers. For the first time, victims
     of domestic violence will be able to get a new Social Security number by providing written
     affirmation oftheir domestic abuse from a third party, such as a local shelter, or treating
     physician.

             In addition, the Vice President will announce the attached directive to the Office of
     Personnel Management requiring the development of a resource guide for federal employees who
     are victims of domestic violence. This directive builds upon your 1995 executive
     memorandum requiring all federal departments to begin employee awareness efforts on domestic
     violence. While some agencies, such as the Department of Health and Human Services and the
     Department of Justice, have developed their own resource guides, this new guide is needed to
     provide one uniform guide across all federal agencies and for all federal employees.
