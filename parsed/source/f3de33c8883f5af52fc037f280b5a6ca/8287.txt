        These grants are an important step in our fight against prostate
cancer. But we must press on.   This year, as part of historic legislation
to protect our children from tobacco, I proposed to make the largest
commitment in history to fund cutting edge cancer research. My proposal
would also allow people on Medicare to participate in cancer clinical
trials. This will be especially important for prostate cancer, which
overwhelmingly affects men over 65.  The more older men are able to
participate in these trials, the more we will learn about this disease,
and the faster we will be able to find a cure.

        But three days ago, a Republican minority in the Senate bowed to
pressure by the tobacco industry and voted against this legislation .. .
against protecting our children from tobacco ... against our families .. .
against increased cancer research ... against saving lives.  For that,
they will have to answer to the American people.

        This Fathers Day, as we celebrate how much fathers mean to their
children, we should also renew our commitment -- as fathers, as parents,
and as Americans -- to our families by insisting that Congress join
together in passing comprehensive bipartisan legislation that protects our
children and strengthens our nation.

           Thanks for listening.
