Elena:
We have a lot of catching up to do. I talked to Glickman and Shalala per
VP's request and we also vetted idea with key congo types. I have made a
recommendation on how to proceed to VP, but do not have sign off on it
from him or my staff. I promise to bring you back in the loop if you
promise to tell me what is going on with INS reform. How about a quick
conversation after Tuesday's COS meeting (I won't be there on Monday) and
then lets proceed from there. In the meanwhile, I will send you for your e
yes only what I.recommended to VP.
