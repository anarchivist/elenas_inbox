                     PRESIDENT AND FIRST LADY ANNOUNCE RECORD
                            CHILD IMMUNIZATION LEVELS


Today, the President and the First Lady announced that childhood immunization rates for 1996 have
reached an historic high. According to new data from the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC), 90 percent or more of America's toddlers in 1996 received the most critical
doses of each of the routinely recommended vaccines--surpassing the goal set by the President when
he launched his Childhood Immunization Initiative (CII) in 1993. The President also announced a
new child care initiative and a new collaborative to establish registries to help meet our goal to
further improve our children's immunization rates for the year 2000.

Achieving the President's Goals by Reaching Record Child Immunization Levels. The Childhood
Immunization Initiative set an ambitious goal of ensuring that at least 90 percent of all toddlers
received the most critical doses of each of the routinely recommended vaccines. CDC's National
Immunization Survey, which surveys parents of preschoolers nationwide, reports that the nation has
met these goals and national infant immunization rates are at an all-time high. CDC reports that:

·      Over 90 percent of two-year olds received the recommended doses of vaccines for
       diphtheria, tetanus, measles, polio and Hemophilus influenzae, the virus causing a form of
       meningitis -- exceeding the 1996 goal of reaching at least 90 percent, for these most critical
       doses.

·      The increases since 1992 have been substantial. For diphtheria and tetanus, immunization
       rates for toddlers increased from 83 in 1992 to. 95 in 1996; polio rates increased from 72
       to 91 ; measle rates, (usually delivered in a vaccine that also protects against mumps and
       rubella), rates increased from 83 to 91 ; and Hemophilus influenzae type B rates increased
       from 28 to 92 .

·      Most children now receive the Hepatitis B Vaccine, which was not even recommended for
       infants until in 1991. Eighty-two percent of two-year-olds received Hepatitis B vaccine,
       surpassing the 1996 goal of 70 percent.

Childhood Immunization Initiative Has Helped Rates Reach Unprecedented Highs. In response to
disturbing gaps in the immunization rates for young children in America, President Clinton
launched the ClI shortly after taking office in 1993. The ClI addresses five areas: .
(1) improving the quality and quantity of vaccine delivery service; (2) reducing vaccine costs for
families; (3) increasing community participation, education and partnerships; (4) improving systems
for monitoring diseases and vaccination; and (5) improving vaccines. This national initiative
coordinates efforts at all levels of government, in the private business community, and among
volunteer organizations to protect children from disease through sustained, routine immunization.
                                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion



Other Clinton Administration Efforts to Increase Childhood Immunization Rates: In addition to the
CII, the Clinton Administration has taken other steps to increase child immunization, such as: (1)
granting welfare reform waivers to 17 states to allow them to require parents to immunize their
children appropriately as a condition of receiving assistance; (2) permitting states to develop
individual responsibility plans as part of the welfare bill for welfare recipients to require them to
immunize their children; (3) forming partnerships between state and local immunization programs
and WIC to encourage parents receiving WIC nutrition benefits to immunize their children; (4)
awarding CDC funds to four state education agencies to deliver immunization services to
preschool-aged children in elementary school-based health centers; (5) creating a joint HUD,
HHS and AmeriCorps pilot program in four cities -- Chicago, Kansas City, Philadelphia and Little
Rock -- to boost immunization rates among children living in public housing; and (6) forging a
partnership with AmeriCorps to provide volunteers to do a wide range of immunization outreach
activities.

Taking the Next Step to Increase Child Immunization Rates: Meeting More Ambitious Goals by 2000.
While child immunization rates are at an all-time high, ahnost 1 million children under age 2 are
missing one or more recommended shots. Therefore, the President and the First Lady mark the
milestone of 1996's unprecedented child immunization rates with firm resolve to continue efforts to
raise these rates even further. More than 78 percent of two-year olds in the United States received
their full series of shots as recommended up from 55 percent in 1992. This is an historic high.
By the year 2000, the President hopes that at least 90 percent of two-year olds receive the full series
of vaccines.

New Initiatives to HeJp Reach Our Next Goal. Today, the President and the First Lady announced
new actions to expand on the Administration's comprehensive strategy to ensure that even more
children receive the necessary vaccinations.

       Ensuring that Children in Child Care Settings Are Properly Immunized: Today,
       President Clinton proposed new child care regulations which will help children in child
       care receive the immunizations they need on time. The new rule requires that aU
       children in federaUy subsidized child care be immunized according to state public
       health agency standards. This regulation will particularly reach those children in
       child care arrangements that are legal but exempt from state licensing requirements,
       such as home-based care.

       Establishing Integrated State and Community-Based Immunization Registries:
              Immunization registries are crucial in helping parents and doctors maintain
       up-to-date             information on the immunization status of their patients and children
       and ensure that proper         vaccines are given on schedule. Today, the President directed
       the Secretary of Health and Human Services to convene a meeting -- with federal, state
       and local government officials,        health care providers and organizations, vaccine

     manufacturers, information system            specialists, and civic leaders -- to identify and
     address the technical and policy issues      involved in establishing state or
     community-based registries capable of transfering information between each other.
