       Hurdles for Clinton Paid-Leave Plan

                                    By ALICE ANN LOVE Associated Press Writer

                                   WASHINGTON (AP)   - - Presiden.t Clinton's proposal
       to let
                                    states tap into their unemployment funds to
       offer paid leave for
                                   new parents faces significant obstacles, benefit
       analysts say,
                                   because states likely will be reluctant to draw
       on accounts
                                    reserved for out-of-work people.

                                   Among the biggest concerns: What would happen if
       the
                                   unemployment rate, now the lowest in nearly
       three decades,
                                   escalated sharply and depleted state benefit
       accounts now flush
                                   with cash?

                                    "The business cycle does occur, and good times
       are followed
                                   by tougher times economically, "    said Emily
       DeRocco, director
                                   of the Interstate Conference of Employment
       Security Agencies,
                                   an association of state employment officials.

                                   DeRocco predicted that states, which
       individually would have
                                   to adopt Clinton's plan, will think "very, very
       carefully"     before
                                   adding new parents to their unemployment rolls.

                                   The 1993 Family and Medical Leave Act has eased
       the strain
                                   on workers who must care for new babies by
       guaranteeing up
                                   to 12 weeks' unpaid leave. But additional help
       is needed for


                        those who cannot afford to take time off without
pay, Clinton
                        said in a speech two weeks ago.

                        The president announced he had directed the Labor
                        Department to write new regulations letting
states provide
                        unemployment benefits to parents of newborn or
newly
                        adopted children who choose to take the leave
guaranteed
                        under the 1993 law.

                        As many as 6 million parents could be eligible
for such
                        programs each year nationwide, administration
officials
                        estimate.

                        "The economy has been good and unemployment has
been
                        down and states have benefited, "   said Grace
Kilbane, director
                        of the federal Unemployment Insurance Service.
"If states have
                        very healthy balances in their (unemployment)
funds, then
                        they're in a good position if they want to
broaden eligibility."

                        Advocates of adding new parents to the
unemployment rolls in
                        Maryland, Massachusetts, Vermont and Washington
requested
                        the federal clearance. Their proposals generally
would offer full
                        unemployment benefits, averaging $200 a week
nationally,
                        during leave.

                        Clinton's endorsement has sparked hope that
state legislatures
                        might now take the idea more seriously.

                        " I t hits a chord with people. People understand
it.    . .. The best
                        way to take care of your family is to do it
yourself, "    said
                        Vermont state Sen. Jan Backus, a Democrat who has
                        sponsored legislation.

                        An   economic expansion -- the longest in the
nation's peacetime
                        history -- has boosted tax collection and padded
many states'
                        unemployment accounts beyond what is normally
kept in
                        reserve.

                        The Massachusetts account, for example, is


approaching $1.8
                          billion, enough to pay benefits for at least two
years. Labor
                          unions, women's groups and others pushing for
paid leave there
                          have calculated it would cost $150 million a
year, or about
                          $1.25 per worker per week.

                          "Our view is, can you afford a cup of coffee
for your
                          employees per week so they can have the peace of
mind?"     said
                          Monica Halas, senior employment attorney at
Greater Boston
                          Legal Services.

                          Employers who pay the taxes that fill
unemployment coffers do
                          not see it that way.

                          "You've got a bit of a bait and switch here,"
said Dan Danner,
                          vice president for public policy at the National
Federation of
                          Independent Business.   "An attitude by some   ...
is let's expand
                          the programs to fit the taxes, and if we have a
surplus, heaven
                          forbid you give it back.' ,

                          In addition to state taxes, employers must pay a
federal
                          unemployment tax of 0.8 percent on the first
$7,000 of each
                          workers' wages. That money goes, in part, to a
bailout fund
                          that makes loans to states when their own
accounts prove
                          insufficient.

                          The $7.4 billion federal account has no loans
outstanding. But
                          during a recession earlier this decade, six
states and the District
                          of Columbia had to borrow $1.9 billion, and in
the 1980s,
                          borrowing by 32 states exceeded $20 billion.

                          Worse, the bailout account went bankrupt in
1977, and money
                          from the general Treasury had to be loaned to
states so they
                          could pay unemployment benefits. To replace
that, lawmakers
                          added a 0.2 percent surcharge to the federal
unemployment
                          tax, which is not scheduled to expire until
2007.


                             "What happens if unemployment goes up? Do you
raise
                             payroll taxes then, to continue to pay for
this?"   Danner said of
                             the proposals for paid leave. "Once you create
the program
                             you can't take it away, or at least it's
politically difficult. ' ,
