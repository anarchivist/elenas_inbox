TEXT:
DPC Tobacco Team:

Did you folks know that the ONDCP reauthorizing legislation introduced in
the House not only prevents ONDCP from getting into alcohol and tobacco
(old news), but that it actually prevents them from getting into underage
use of alcohol and'tobacco.   Since it's illegal for minors to smoke and
drink, we've been able to get away w/incorporating this as part of ONDCP's
mandate.  I don't 'know if this fits w/your tobacco strategy or message --
but I wanted to make sure you guys were aware of this.

Jose'
