  White House Outlines Anti-Drug Plan

                                By PETE YOST Associated Press Writer

                                WASHINGTON (AP) -- Releasing the Clinton
 administration's
                                plan to cut the drug problem in half by 2007,
 Vice President Al
                                Go're today said that the strategy had to provide
 hope to
                                youngsters and treatment for prisoners even as
 it cracked down
                                on traffickers.

                                "We must start by recognizing that our nation's
 drug problem
                                was not born in isolation and does not exist in
 a vacuum, 'I   Gore
                                said. " I t is an interconnected problem and so
 our solutions must
                                also be interconnected. We must mount an all out
 effort to
                                banish crime, drugs and disorder and
 hopelessness from our
                                streets once and for all.' ,

                                Gore released the five-part plan, which he said
 repaired
                                programs that are not working and gave a boost
 to those that
                                do, during a ceremony at the Old Executive
 Office Building next
                                to the White House.

                                He claimed some success in the fight against
 drugs, noting that
                                drug use by adults is at half what it was in
 1979 and that drug
                                use by young people has started to decline.

                                "But when drug dealers still roam our streets
 and rob our
                                children of their dreams,   and drug related crime
 still ravages so
                                many of our neighborhoods, we know that we have
 barely
                                begun,"   Gore said.   "We must do so much more."


                           The nationwide effort includes nearly $18
billion to be spent this
                           year by the federal government. White House drug
policy
                           director Barry McCaffrey wants the nation's
children to be the
                           focal point for the drive against drugs.

                           The White House "seeks to involve parents,
coaches, mentors,
                           teachers, clergy and other role models in a
broad prevention
                           campaign, "   McCaffrey said in the four-volume
strategy sent to
                           Capitol Hill today.

                           In a message to Congress, President Clinton said
that among the
                           positive signs are a growing view among young
people that
                           drugs are risky and a continuing decline in
cocaine production
                           overseas.

                           "Studies demonstrate that when our children
understand the
                           dangers of drugs, their rates of drug use
drop, "   said Clinton.

                           The five parts of the administration plan are
educating children,
                           decreasing the addicted population, breaking the
cycle of drugs
                           and crime, securing the nation's borders from dr
ugs and reducing
                           the drug supply.

                           The blend of strategies is aimed at reducing the
use and
                           availability of drugs by 25 percent by 2002 and
50 percent by
                           2007. Achieving the goal would mean just 3
percent of the U.S.
                           population aged 12 and over would be using
illegal drugs. The
                           current figure is estimated at 6.4 percent. In
1979, the rate was
                           near 15 percent.

                           Additional goals for the period ending in 2007
are to reduce by
                           30 percent the rate of crime associated with
drug trafficking and
                           use, and cutting the health and social costs ass
ociated with drugs
                           by 25 percent. As of 1995,   the social costs of
drug use were
                           estimated at $110 billion, a 64 percent increase
over 1990.


                              A major piece of the drug-control effort is an
advertising
                              campaign that generates more than $195 million a
year in
                              matching contributions from media companies.

                              A cornerstone of the strategy is accountability
for the wide array
                              of current anti-drug programs, with boosts for
those that work
                              and the ability to identify swiftly and repair t
hose that aren't
                              producing results.

                              "In the past, Congress had been critical
because there were no
                              specific measurements for success, "       said Bob
Weiner, a
                              spokesman for McCaffrey. "There was some real
heat in the
                              government"   resisting demands for
accountability, but      no
                              longer do we only measure the people working the
issue and the
                              dollars spent on it. Now you've got to prove
bang for the buck. ' ,

                              While head of the u.s. Southern Command as an
Army general,
                              McCaffrey saw first hand in South America how
some u.S.
                              approaches to drug control succeed where others
fail.

                              Over a decade or more, some $700 million was
spent on
                              counter-narcotics aid in Bolivia, with no
significant reduction in
                              cocaine cultivation, said Pancho Kinney, deputy
director for
                              strategy in McCaffrey's office.

                              When another approach was used starting in 1995,
success was
                              immediate and has continued, Kinney added. Under
the
                              strategy, the u.S. military passes along
information about
                              drug-carrying aircraft,     ~hich   then would be
intercepted by air
                              forces of Colombia and Peru.
