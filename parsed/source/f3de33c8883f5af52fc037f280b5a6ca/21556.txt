1. Administration Position on Child Access Prevention (CAP) Laws. On July 8,
1998, the President stood up with Suzann Wilson -- the mother of a student slain in
the Jonesboro school shooting -- and called on Congress to pass federal CAP
legislation that would hold adults who allow children easy access to firearms
accountable for their actions. But this announcement. which received wide
media attention, was almost killed by the Treasury and Justice Departments the
night before the event. Despite having had more than a month to review the
CAP legislation; having already recommended that states pass their own CAP
laws; and having told the Rahm that the Administration could generally support
a federal CAP, as long as their was room to negotiate the final language -- the
Justice and Treasury Departments insisted that they would not support federal
CAP legislation. Chief of Staff Bowles had to speak with Secretary Rubin just to
keep this event from falling of the schedule.

2.   Granting COPS Waivers for Distressed Communities.      On May 29, 1998, the
President announced a new COPS initiative that would target funds to
high-crime, high-need neighborhoods by waiving the federal match for them.
This initiative also almost never came to pass. Although the 1994 Crime Act
grants the Attorney General broad waiver authority -- and a DPC-Ied working
group had repeatedly recommended invoking this waiver authority over the
past year -- the Justice Department opposed granting any waivers unless
Congressional appropriators signed off first. Finally, with the help of some
prominent mayors -- and a year's worth of complaining -- the Justice
Department relented. Similar waivers have now been granted to different cities
and to help hire police to work in schools.

3.   Report on School DiSCipline.  Several times, in anticipation of his July 98
speech to the AFT. the President asked us for a status report on the school
discipline issues that he supported during the '96 campaign -- uniforms, curfews
and anti-truancy programs. Despite weeks of hostile meetings with the
Departments of Education and Justice, we were unable to get them to produce
anything for the President's speech.

4. Recommendation on Crack SentenCing Policy. When the U.S. SentenCing
Commission released its revised recommendations on crack sentences in April of
97, the President issued a statement calling on ONDCP and Justice to review
these recommendations and report back to him within 60 days. However,
before ONDCP and Justice could agree, General McCaffrey publicly expressed
his own views and refused to work with members of the WH staff to develop a
consensus Administration response to the SentenCing Commission's report. In
the end, ONDCP and Justice were a month late in reporting back to the
                                                Automated Records Management System
                                                Hex-Dump Conversion
crack sentencing policies was lost before it even started.

5. Directive on Modified Assault Weapons. On November 14, 1997, after much
disagreement with the Treasury and Justice Departments, the President signed a
directive asking the Treasury Department to review whether or not certain
modified assault weapons could continue to be legally imported. Both
agencies strongly resisted taking this action; thought the Administration would
lose in court; delayed in producing the final report and recommendations; and
were dead wrong. After 6 months of doing battle with Justice and Treasury, the
President's decision on modified assault weapons has been strongly supported
by the public, law enforcement most of Congress -- and not challenged in
federal court.

6. Southwest Border Reorganization. For more than a year now, General
McCaffrey has been issuing reports and holding press conferences on how the
Southwest Border needs to be overhauled -- with huge increases in border patrol
agents, technology resources, and the appointment of a Senate-confirmed
Border Czar. None of these proposals are official Administration policy, and
they are strongly opposed by Secretary Rubin and the Attorney General.
However, McCaffrey has refused to work with us and other WH staff in helping to
determine a formal Administration position on these issues.

7. Teen Drug Testing and Drivers' Licenses. During the '96 campaign, the
President signed a directive asking certain Cabinet Members to report back with
recommendations on what the Administration could do to support drug testing
for teenagers applying to get their drivers' licenses. In early '97, ONDCP and
the Department of Transportation (DOT) replied that the Administration should
fund a demonstration program for interested states. However, CongreSSional
appropriators prohibited DOT from funding such demonstration program before
they could get it off the ground. We have since tried to get Justice and
ONDCP to fund such a demonstration with their discretionary funds, but they
have been unwilling cross the appropriators and dedicate any of their funds for
this purpose.
