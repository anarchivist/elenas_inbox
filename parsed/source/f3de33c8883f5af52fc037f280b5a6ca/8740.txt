TEXT:
Senator Brownback is circulating an amendment to the DC appropriations
bill which would require organizations receiving Title X funds to provide
adoption counseling and referral services to pregnant teens.   Current
Title X guidelines require Title X providers to provide non-directive
counseling for the following three options: prenatal care, adoption, and
abortion.   Brownback's amendment would codify only adoption.  His
language says:

"Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a family planning
organization that is conducting operations in the District of Columbia and
that receives funds under Title X of the Public Health Service Act may use
such funds to provide adoption services as described in [the Adolescent
Family Life Program Act) " .

The pro-choice community is torn over this amendment.    Some of the groups
 (AGI, Planned Parenthood) believe that this puts adoption on a higher
plane than the other options, and that it sets a bad precendent for the
entire Title X program.    (But practically speaking, this amendment should
not have any effect on the program, since the clinics already provide
adoption counseling) .   They want a second-degree amendment offered to
Brownback's which says that nothing in the Brownback language is intended
to negate the obligation of providers to provide non-directive counseling
which includes the three options mentioned above. They will probably go
to Boxer to offer this amendment (she is ranking member on the
subcommittee) .

NFPRHA (National Family Planning Assn) doesn't think it a second degree
amendment is a good idea.  They don't want anyone reminded that Title X
clinics provide abortion referrals, because that could plant gag clause
ideas in the minds of anti-choice members.  I agree with this line of
thinking.

Apparently, Boxer has tried to talk to Brownback to find out whether his
intentions are evil (ie. he wants to undermine the entire Title X program)
or benign. While she wasn't able to elicit that information, she did find
out that he is adamant about bringing this up for a vote -- he wants the


Senate to be on record regarding adoption.

FYI.   Any thoughts?
