TEXT:
Sorry ... here it is:

Announce Outreach Effort for Low-Income Medicare Beneficiaries. A new
report,
to be released by Families USA in early July,. will show that about 3.9
million beneficiaries --
nearly half who are eligible -- do not get premium assistance under
Medicaid. We could announce
ore release an executive directive to order HCFA, SSA, and Administration
on Aging implement
new outreach and enrollment initiatives (this could either be a proactive
initiative or at least to
inoculate ourselves against a report that is likely to receive a great
deal of attention).
