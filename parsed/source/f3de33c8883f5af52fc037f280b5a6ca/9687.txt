PRESIDENT WILLIAM J CLINTON
STATEMENT ON EDUCATION BUDGET
WHITE HOUSE
October 11, 1998

         In only 447 more days, the 21st Century begins--a century in which
the education of our nationD,s children will matter more than it ever has
before. Yet far too many of our public schools are not ready for the 21st
Century.   WeO,ve all seen the news stories--about teacher college
graduates who canD,t pass grammar tests; about schools so overcrowded they
have trailers out back to handle the overflow; about classrooms with 35 or
more students, all vying for a minute of attention from their
stressed-out, overworked teachers.

         This cannot go on. We cannot afford to wait if we are to give all
of our children the first-class education they will need for the 21st
Century.   And yet we are waiting--for the Republican majority in Congress
to bring this yearD,s education investment bill up for a vote.

        The delay must end. Congress must choose progress over
partisanship, and I believe they can.   Earlier this week I signed into
law a strong, bipartisan bill to open the doors of college to millions.
And in just the last two days Republicans and Democrats have worked
together to pass strong charter school and vocational education measures,
and I thank Senators Kennedy and Jeffords and Congressmen Gray and
Goodling for that.

        Now it is time for Congress once again to put progress ahead of
partisanship and send me an education budget that I can sign tonight.
That bill must make the right investments for our public schools.  It must
invest in more highly-trained teachers to bring class sizes down in the
lower grades. It must invest in academically-enriched after school and
summer school for students who are stiving to meet high standards in the'
basics.

        But most of all, this budget must invest in modernized schools for
our children. We simply cannot raise students up in buildings that are
falling down. Any budget that does nothing to help modernize our schools
and give our children clean and safe places to learn is a budget that does
not fully prepare our children for the 21st Century.
