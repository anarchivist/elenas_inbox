BR/EK:

Spoke w/Amy and Stacie -- as well as w/Treasury and DOJ -- we have clarity
on holding the gun shows report.    However, Reno and Rubin may be ready to
transmit it as soon as COB tomorrow ... do we want it officially transmitted
and then held ... or should we have them hold the transmittal a few more
days?

Jose'
