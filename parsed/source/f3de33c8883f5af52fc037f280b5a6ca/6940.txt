      TEXT:
      Attending were HHS, Doug Steiger, Deborah Colton, CRS, Census, and me.
      Haskins said his goal is to develop a list of the most viable family
      formation measures. He will then appeal to HHS to add one of them to the
      NPRM. He acknowledged that the decision rests with HHS, but said he is
      prepared to "take further action" if we choose not to add one of them.

      Haskins had CRS come to the meeting with a list of possible measures (see
      below). We then discussed pro's and con's of each one . . HHS made it
      clear that there are problems with almost all of them.   Haskins' fallback
      position seems to be that he is perfectly comfortable simply repeating the
      illegitimacy bonus's out-of-wedlock births measure if we can't come up
      with anything better.  He reiterated that the law calls for us to do
      something here.   He also said we should try to add measures to CRS's menu
      and might solve any data problems simply by requiring states to collect
      the appropriate data as a condition of the bonus.   .

      We need to figure out a strategy here, since Ron wants to meet again in a
      week.

      Measures listed by CRS:                        Problem/Reaction
      1. 2 parent families as a percentage of all families   Data no good
      at state level.  States
                                                             have little direct
      influence on this.

      2.  Percentage of TANF case closings due to marriage      Measure could
      be affected by
                                                                unrelated factors
      (e.g., patterns in other
                                                                causes of case
      closure, like
                                                                sanctions).     Could
      instead look at
                                                                percentage of TANF
      cases that
                                                                change from
·
     I-parent to 2-parent.

     3. Out of wedlock births                                     Identical
     to Illegitimacy Bonus.

     4. Teen births                                      Ron could
     not support unless adjusted
                                                         for abortions.
     HHS explained why
                                                         abortion data is
    problematic,
                                                         especially if we
     focus only on teen
                                                         abortions.

     5. Marriage/Divorce Rates                           States have
     little direct influence on
                                                         this.   Ron wants
     to explore limiting to
                                                         low-income, but
     data may not exist.

     6. Child Poverty                                            Ron
     doesn't rule out in theory.   But state
                                                         data unreliable,
     most recent data is '94.

     7.  Percentage of Children in Foster Care           Raises thorny
     issues.

     8.   Suggested by HHS:  Child well-being, such as   Ron rejected.
               low birthweight, infant mortality
