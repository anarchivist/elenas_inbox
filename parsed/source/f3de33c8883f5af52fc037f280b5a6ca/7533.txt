TEXT:
Feinstein and LA County DA Gil Garcetti are pushing hard on an exemption
for LA County from the child support penalty.  Feinstein has called
Erskine and the VP.  Today at the briefing for LA County officials,
Garcetti raised the issue to Podesta, according to Karen Skelton.
Garcetti said Feinstein told him that "the issue was on the President's
desk." Garcetti also said that it will be an uphill battle to get the
President to change his mind from opposing a waiver to supporting one.
Podesta supposedly responded that it may be possible for the WH to say
that it does not oppose a waiver, though the WH would be hard pressed to
say it supports a waiver.  Feinstein is spreading the rumor that the Hill
will support this if only we will support or not oppose, but that's not
what we are hearing from Hill leaders -- they continue to show no interest
in doing this.

While Karen wishes we would change our minds, she isn't taking this up the
chain to try to overturn our current position of oppose. So in the
meantime, we continue to tell LA County we're not persuaded that it's a
good idea. Let us know if this doesn't make sense to you.
