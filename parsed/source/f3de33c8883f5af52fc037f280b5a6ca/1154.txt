Please let me know if I missed something.

Notes from 3/5 conference meeting and follow up:

- Title: "White House Conference on. Early Childhood Development and
Learning:
What new research on the brain tells us about our youngest children"
Nicole to get final approval.

- Overall goal for event: We talked about the conference as a way to get
information and resources out to anyone who works with parents or young
children. It will emphasize the ways in which the federal government can
playa key role in helping strengthen families, as well as highlighting
what the rest of us can do.

- Announcement: Marsha will take the lead on seeing if the President and
First Lady on Monday can do an Oval Office announcement of a new executive
order and the date for the event. In planning for this, we need to be able
to say something about what will come out of it. (We'll have tapes and
materials for parents, website, etc.)

- Panels: Nicole and Pauline will have options by Monday of various ways
in which parents' questions can be posed to panelists.

- Press preparations: We agreed to identify 10 stories by April 1 that
illustrate the research being done (most often with federal support) and
how it's being put to use in programs across the country. Pauline and
Nicole will provide the initial list.

- Press lists: Pauline and Nicole will get lists from groups they're
talking with.

- Invitations: We'll identify possible magazine editors/publishers as


guests. Nicole has examples of articles parenting pubs have run and will
circulate copies.

- Sponsors: Nicole will schedule a meeting with Pat Butler. Pat and Marsha
will talk about magazines. We also need to check with counsel's office
about using sponsors.

- Materials: The aim will be to produce, post-conference, a video tape, an
audio, a printed report to include Mrs. Clinton's remarks, synopses of
information presented, resource guide and an action sheet for parents.

- Regional events: Pat will continue to talk with Kris and Laura Schwartz
about moving forward with agencies on setting up regional watch events.

- Next meeting: We will meet again Friday. Time TBD
