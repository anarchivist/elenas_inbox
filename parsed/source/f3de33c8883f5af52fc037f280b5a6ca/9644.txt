PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
REMARKS FOR TOP COP EVENT
THE WHITE HOUSE
October 9, 1998

        Thank you, Tom and Bob [Tom Scotto, NAPO President; Bob Scully, NAPO
Executive Director], Attorney General Reno, Vice President Gore, and
honored Top Cops.  I am delighted to welcome all of you here today.

        This July, I stood just a mile from here, in the Great Rotunda of
the Capitol, humbled by the courage and the sacrifice of the two men we
had come to honor -- Officer J.J. Chestnut and Detective John Gibson --
two law enforcement officers who literally threw themselves between an
assailantO,s bullets and innocent bystanders .. , and gave their lives to
defend freedomO,s house.

        The men and women we are honoring here this morning put on their
badges every day, prepared to make the same sacrifice in their own
communities. They are true American heroes.   From crossing the line of


fire to rescue wounded fellow officers ... to confronting criminals armed
with assault weapons and body armor ... to nursing a seriously injured
neighbor back to health ... the heroics -- and the basic humanity -- of
these officers are an inspiration to us all.    I congratulate 1998's Top
Cops and I thank them on behalf of a grateful nation.

        America owes an enormous debt of gratitude to all of our nationO,s police
officers, who put their lives on the line to protect ours.   But six years
ago, law enforcement was not getting the tools it needed to reverse the
trend of rising crime and fear in our communities.  I took office
determined to change that.

         Together with NAPO, we have worked to take back our streets from crime
and violence. We put in place a comprehensive plan based on what law
enforcement officers were already trying to do in communities all across
America -- to put tough new penalties on our books ... to help steer young
people away from crime and gangs and guns ... to keep guns out of the
hands of criminals     and most important of all, to put 100,000 new
police officers on the streets.

        Six years ago, some said crime was a problem we just couldnO,t
fix.  Today, because of our efforts, crime has dropped across the board to
its lowest level in a generation, and respect for the law is on the rise.
Our nationO,s law enforcement officers are at the center of that
extraordinary success. They are cracking down on gun traffickers and
working to keep guns out of the hands of criminals. They are working with
local school authorities to promote school safety. And they are walking
the beat and working with residents to prevent crime from happening in the
first place.

        But you know better than I do that when it comes to fighting crime, we
cannot afford to rest. Keeping our communities and our families safe
requires eternal vigilance. So today, we are taking new steps to help our
nationO,s police officers stand ready in our fight against crime.

        First, we know what a difference more police have made in our
communities.   I am pleased to announce that we are awarding up to $30
million in new grant money to help communities hire more police
bringing the' total number of police officers funded by our COPS initiative
to more than 88,000 -- closer than ever to our goal of 100,000.

         Second, we know what a difference Brady background checks have made to
keep illegal guns off our streets.    I am pleased to announce that we will
give states over $40 million to help them computerize the criminal history
records they use to do those background checks -- a simple procedure that
has already stopped a quarter million fugitives and felons from purchasing
guns.

        These steps will give law enforcement the tools they need to keep
making a difference. That is why I am so pleased that last night, the
Congress passed two bills that will build on our progress in both these
areas.   I will be proud to sign both these bills into law.

        The first bill will help school systems to hire safety officers,
and use the same community policing methods that have worked so well in
neighborhoods allover the country. These school resource officers, as
they are called, work with principals, parents, teachers and students to
stop school violence before it happens.

        I want to add that next week, on October 15th, we will hold the


first-ever White House Conference on School Safety, and I am looking
forward to hearing from many groups -- especially law enforcement -- about
how we can work together to meet this challenge.

        The second bill will provide states with more than $1 billion over
the next five years to to modernize not only their criminal records
system, but also to upgrade their communications and criminal
identification systems, as well. And it will also help us build a new
electronic information sharing partnership with state and local law
enforcement to keep our child care and elder care systems safe.

        [I am pleased that Congress has put our familiesD, security and our
police officersD, safety ahead of politics and sent me these bills. Now,
we have to put progress ahead of partisanship, and pass a budget thatD,s
good for the American people.   A budget that will set aside the surplus
until we save social Security for the future ... that will strengthen our
economy at home by meeting our obligation to help the 1MF stabilize the
economies of our customers abroad ... a budget that will expand
educational opportunity for our children and improve health care for our
families ... that will protect our environment ... and a budget that will
give law enforcement the tools it needs to keep our communities safe.
These are the priorities that will strengthen America for the 21st century.
]

        Before we finish,  I would like thank our Top Cops again for their
remarkable achievements.   I would also like to thank their families,
because in so many ways, you have made those achievements possible. When
we honor their bravery, we honor your own special brand of courage as
well.  When we honor their sacrifice, we remember the many things you give
up to support their work.  When we honor their strength, we pay tribute to
the spirit in all of you that sustains it.  I thank you for all that you
have done, and will continue to do. And may God bless you all.

        [And now, I will sign these bills.]
