                       DRAFf STATEMENT OF THE PRESIDENT
                                 February 23, 1998


This morning the Supreme Court declined to review a challenge to the community notification
provision of New Jersey's "Megan's Law," thus leaving intact a crucial tool to protect children
from known sex predators. Because of the importance of this law to families and communities,
my Administration has defended its constitutionality, enacted a similar federal Megan's Law, and
worked with states to establish a national sex offender registry. We wiH continue to do
everything we can to make sure that community notification and sex offender registration laws
are enforced and upheld throughout the country.
