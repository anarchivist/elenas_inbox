TEXT:
FYI - My goal on an environmental message on the State of the Union is to get
EPA and CEQ, and maybe even others proposing the same thing--rather than getting
competing proposals that exacerbate the perennial competition among advisors.
The two leading ideas in my mind are protecting children from environmental
threats (an executive order we have been working on) and an environmental
legislative initiative that we (including CEQ, EPA, and others) have been
working on.   Katie has a memo into John Hilley on the environmental
legislation.
CEQ's opening idea for SOTU is "American Heritage Rivers" . which is an idea to
designate rivers as historically valuable and then call on everyone to help
protect them.  I think they are open to change, if it comes from the right
quarter.
Let's talk about this in more detail when you have time.    In the interim, I plan
to work with staff to try to help get everyone on the same page.
