     Subject:         Tobacco Hearing

     Senate Finance just called to invited Lew to testify before the Full
     Committee on March 10 re:    tobacco recoupment. Also testifying would be
     Nancy Ann I'lin, Dan Crippen (CBO) , and 2 state AGs. Lew does not think he
     has much of a choice but to testify. He wanted to make sure that you
     concurred.
