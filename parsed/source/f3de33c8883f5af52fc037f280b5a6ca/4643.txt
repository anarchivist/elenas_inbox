TEXT:
The House is expected to consider the late term abortion legislation next
wednesday 10/8. The measure must pass back through the House because the
original House bill was amended in the Senate to win the AMA's support for
the measure.  If the House passes the measure without further changes
(which is anticipated) it will be ready to send to the President. We are
working with Rosa De Lauro, Nita Lowey and others to plan for the floor
vote. These Members have asked for a new letter from the President prior
to the vote.  For your informatio.n.
