     TEXT:
     This is closer to the Senate SAP, but doesn't make support contingent on
     passage of the amendments.  Let me know what you think.

      [The second and fourth paragraphs come from Mike Cohen and Scott Fleming
     (our
     Assistant Secretary for Legislation). The second paragraph is designed to
     let the House Democrats know that we appreciate their efforts (the
     amendments it refers to came from them).   The 4th paragraph is a
     place-holder until we have a better idea of the amendments that will be
     offered. The reference to Federal dollars reaching the schools for which
     they were intended relates to possible amendments concerning the percentage
     of a school's students who must be poor in order for an LEA to operate a
     schoolwide program under Title I of the ESEA.]

     STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY

     H.R. 800 - EDUCATION FLEXIBILITY PARTNERSHIP ACT OF 1999
     (Rep. Castle (R) DE and 59 cosponsors)

      The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 800, which would expand
     the "Ed-Flex" demonstration authority to permit all States that meet the
     eligibility criteria to waive certain statutory and regulatory requirements
     of Federal education programs.  The Administration has long supported the
     concept of expanding ed-flex demonstration authority in a manner that will
     promote high standards and accountability for results, coupled with
     increased flexibility for States and local school districts to achieve
     those
     results.

     The Administration is pleased with the amendments made at Committee mark-up
     to "sunset" the bill upon reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary
     Education Act of 1965  (to ensure consistency between that statute and
     Ed-Flex), to terminate local waivers if achievement levels decline, and to
     require public notice and comment before waivers are requested and granted.

     The Administration strongly supports an amendment that is expected to be
     offered to H.R. 800 that would implement the President's proposal for a
     long-term extension of the one-year authority to help school districts


    reduce class size in the early grades, which the Congress approved last
    year
    on a bipartisan basis. In order to hire qualified teachers, arrange for
    additional classrooms, and take other steps that are necessary to reduce
    class size, school districts need to know, as soon as possible, that the
    Congress intends to support this initiative for more than one year.

    The Administration also supports amendments designed to:   (I) strengthen
    accountability provisions to ensure that the Ed-Flex program strengthens
    student achievement; and (2) ensure that Federal education dollars continue
    to reach the schools and students they were designed to serve.
