Q: .   USA Today, AP, and the Washington Post are reporting that the Secretary of
       Education is calling for a uniform licensing system for teachers. Is the
       Administration proposing a new national teaching license or teaching test?

A:     No. This week, Secretary Riley gave his annual State of American Education
       Address this week which he uses to assess the state of education and to raise
       ideas and spark long-term discussions among academics, educators and others.
         In his speech, Secretary Riley raised some ideas about how states and
       communities could change the way they license and certify teachers, and said
       he wanted to spark and shape a dialogue about these issues in the coming
       months. The Administration is not making a legislative or budget proposal
       along these lines. (Riley's idea is that states could give new teachers an initial
       license for three years after passing an exam of knowledge and performance,
       give a professional license based on clear standards assessed by an
       administrator and other teachers, and giving experienced teachers an advanced
       license after receiving certification from the National Board for Professional
       Teaching Standards.)

       These ideas build on and reflect much of the work that AFT has done over
       the years -- including AFT's support for the National Board for Professional
       Teaching Standards, AFT's support for tests for new teachers, and AFT's
       support for supporting high-quality teaching.

       Secretary Riley did not call for any type of national teaching license, he did not
       call for national standards or tests for teachers,he is not calling for states to
       adopt any single idea or proposaL Moreover, he didn't suggest that states
       consider changes to teacher tenure, nor did he suggest testing for licensed
       teachers. Riley's office consulted with Sandy Feldman and Bob Chase last
       week about the concepts outlined in the speech to be sure that we are
       comparing notes and generally moving in the same direction.


Q:     Will the Administration indude this in its proposal to reauthorize the Elementary
       and Secondary Education Act? When the Administration is proposing other
       requirements for states to end social promotion, intervene in failing schools, etc.,
       how do you oppose efforts to require these ideas as well?

A:     As you know, in his State of the Union Address, the President proposed steps
       to end social promotion, fix failing schools, and other steps to strengthen
       accountability in our schools. These ideas are based on considerable
       experience at the state and local level and reflect broad consensus across the
                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion

         nation -- and strong support from the AFT. The preliminary ideas on
         teacher licensure and certification outlined by Secretary Riley reflect neither
         such extensive experience at the state and local, nor such consensus. Neither
         Secretary Riley nor anyone at the White House believe these ideas should be
         the basis of any legislative proposals. Riley simply is making a first attempt
         to jumpstart an important dialogue on these issues among academics,
         educators, states, and communities across the nation as they work on these
         issues over' the next few years.




Q.   Will the President support an Ed-Flex bill when it comes to the Senate floor later this
     month?

A.   The President has supported the Ed-Flex concept (i.e. giving eligible states the
     ability to waive certain federal laws and regulations in exchange for greater
     accountability), but wants to be sure that it is done right. He would strongly
     prefer to see Congress consider this bill as part of the overall reauthorization of
     the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, rather than as a freestanding bill.
     This would ensure that Ed-Flex is designed to fit the federal education programs
     of the next five years, rather than the last five years. If Congress does take up
     Ed-Flex prior to ESEA reauthorization, the President will insist that it is consistent
     with his approach to ESEA and that it include tough accountability measures to
     ensure a high-quality education for all children -- especially those in greatest need.
       It is essential that an Ed-Flex provision strike the right balance between flexibility
     and accountability for results. We understand the concerns raised by AFT and
     others in the education community and we will work with you and our friends in
     Congress to address these concerns in the coming weeks.

     In addition, the President will use any congressional consideration of this bill as an
     opportunity to press for other, more important efforts to improve education.
     We must not let debate over a relatively minor measure to reduce regulatory
     burdens distract us from the more important effort of improving the
     education of our students through such crucial initiatives as reducing class
     size and modernizing schools.
