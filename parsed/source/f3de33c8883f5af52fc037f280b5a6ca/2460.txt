Subject:           Vice President's Birthday -- March 31st




On March 31st, to celebrate his 50th Birthday, the Vice President and Mrs.

Gore have decided to spend a part of their day working on a Habitat for

Humanity site, in Southeast Washington (Skyland Terrace) .



As a staff (and "extended staff") present to the Vice President, I invite

any of you who wish to participate to take this time off from work, and

donate your time and effort to this same project.     (For those of you not

in the OVP, you will need to clear. your time off request, of course, with

your supervisor.)      Anyone interested in participating in this volunteer

effort as a "birthday gift" to the Vice President should plan on leaving

here at around 11:30am; we will return to the White House at around

4: 30pm.    (We will have limited van transport available; you may instead

choose to drive yourself to the site.)    The Gores will be arriving on site

at about 1:30pm -- and we want to be well underway by the time they join

us.



Attire for the day should be workclothes appropriate to a construction

site.



After this effort, we will return to the OEOB where we will have a staff

party for the Vice President.    The party will begin at approximately 4:30,

and last until about 5:15.    All of you are invited to join us for the

party.




  We need a very firm count for the Habitat site, and for the party.       Can

  you please e-mail to Scott Hynes, in my office, by Friday at noon, whether

  you are:   (1)   interested in participating in the service effort;   (2) want a

  ride, or will drive; and (3) will be coming to the party?



  I know that, given everyone's support for the Vice President, and

  commitment to service, we will have a great turnout.      Thanks.
