Immigration Issues -- as ofJanuary 27, 1999

1.    Public Charge

     Status: Need to finalize guidance, including the interim final rule on deportation.

      Contacts:       Cynthia Rice (DPC)
                      Dan Marcus (WH Counsel)
                      James Castello (DOJ) -- 514-3392
                      Bob Bach (INS) -- 514-3242 or 616-7767
                      Barbara Strack (INS) -- 514-3242 or 514-8860

2.    NACARA regulations

     Status: Comment period on the rule ends January 26, 1999. OLC has been asked to
                  look at whether we could presume hardship for Salvadorans and
                  Guatemalans covered by the legislation.

      Contacts:       Scott Busby (NSC)
                      James Castello (DOJ) -- 514-3392
                      John Morton (DOJ) -- 514-9343

3.    Parity for Salvadorans and Guatemalans

     Status: We are exploring legislation that would provide parity for Salvadorans and.
                    Guatemalans (equal to what the Nicaraguans got in NACARA). Leg.
                   Affairs in consulting with the Hill re: what this bill would look like.
                    There appears to be bi-partisan interest in some kind of legislative
                   package, though many members are pushing for us to do the presumptio
                   of extreme hardship first.

4.                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion


     Status: The Department of Labor has been approached by Senator Coverdell to begin
                   again a bi-partisan process on H2A reform. We have been approached
                   by grower lobbyists re: heading aprocess to do the same (though not
                   necessarily a bi-partisan process). We have not yet decided whether we
                   want to go down that road.

5.   Section 377

     Status: OLC is looking at the question of whether the group that is considered
                    "front-desked" can be expanded beyond the current group defined by
                   the DOJ. We are also pursuing whether we could do a legislative fIX to
                   the registry date (to, perhaps, January 1984) that would relieve all bona
                   fide members of the late amnesty class (all of whom had to be in the U.S.
                   prior to January 1,1982).

6.   HIV+ Refugees

     Status: We need to determine where the INS is in developing their comprehensive
                   regulation. Scott is leading an inter-agency group on this.

7.    Visas for exploited workers/victims oftraffiking

      Status: DOJ is working on draft legislation that would create a separate temporary visa
                     category for aliens who cooperate in law enforcement actions and are
                     victims of exploitation (including traffiking and smuggling).

9.    Naturalization

      Status: Steve Mertens at OMB is monitoring INS's progress at meeting their
                     productivity goals (set last August). INS is preparing a briefing for
                     Michael Deich that will explain their progress to date.
