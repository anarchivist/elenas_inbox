TEXT:
This is a DRAFT update on the satellite situation as of Wednes eve.    We
will have more details (site addresses, participants) tomorrow.

Region 1 Boston - Nothing due in large part to the snow impeding our
efforts to nail something down.

Region 2 NYC - The Manhattan Community College and Rochester, NY

Region 3 Philly - At least one site

Region 4 Atlanta - At least one site

Region 5 Chicago - North Arlington, IL

Region 6 KC - Possibly two sites in MO

Region 7 Dallas - Probable sites in Dallas, New Orleans, Little Rock, and
Oklahoma

Region 8 Denver - Goose egg but working on it

Region 9 CA - LA, SF, Phoenix, Sacramento, maybe HA, Las Vegas (probably
sponsored by Gov Miller's wife)


Region 10 Seattle - Olympia, WA

Again, this is NOT final but it's looking good. We have a conference call
tomorrow with the regionals at 2.30 pm on 757-2104 code 4590.  It would be
great to have Laura on to discuss the neverending satellite Q's, Nichole
or Pauline to push the FLOTUS' interest, and Emily in case there are
gubernatorial and mayoral sponsorship q's. Others are welcome.

Thnx for all of your help
