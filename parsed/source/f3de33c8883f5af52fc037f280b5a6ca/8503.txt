Subject:           follow-up on the budget meeting

I spoke with Tom Kahn today reo our upcoming budget resolution briefing.
We discussed the possibility of doing the budget resolution briefing on
the 14th or 16th of July. We should think through how we want to max. the
EZ conference sponsored by the VP's office on the 15th as we think
through these dates.    He also forwarded me a list of people who should
be involved.

1.    In order to move forward, I will need to reconcile schedules for ,the
following individuals: Jack Lew, Gene Sperling, Bruce Reed.    Were you
able to discuss this concept with the AP's.   In addition, Maria, Elena
and Sylvia should be prepared to make themselves available.  It was
emphasized by Tom that Jack and Gene will definitely need to be at the
meeting.
However, as I indicated in our earlier meeting - we should make sure the
panelist are broad based.

2. Josh as we discussed, you will need to provide the appropriate talking
points for me to convey to the OPL staffers who will be making the calls;
It will only be a select few callers and probably more Senior than Jr.

3. Tom and I discussed doing a small internal meeting on Wednesday to
coordinate our message and strategy.   I will have Jocelyn send an e-mail
to discuss availability for Wednesday.

4.  I am assuming that we want to convene a larger rather than smaller
group for this briefing.
How do we want to deal with the Business community? Should we brief
separately (Washington rep's) or should we bring a select few into this
briefing?

5. We should also make sure Intergovernmental and Political and Cabinet
affairs is roped in.

6. We should discuss in this same vein our strategy around the approp.
process ... in particular Labor/HHS. Sec. Herman called today wanted to
know what the state of play will be from the White House.   I also told her
to contact Jack for further instructions.   So much of what she cares about
and our groups is being zeroed out of the budget as we speak.



Thanks . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
