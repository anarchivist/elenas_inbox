TEXT:
Can you, today, call Jodi Enda of Knight-Ridder (Philadelphia Inquirer,
Miami Herald, Detroit Free Press, San Jose Mercury,  and many others) to
talk about welfare to work for a weekend piece she's working on? She's
going to go to spend a couple days in St. Louis and attend our event
there, and she wants to talk about difficulties of welfare-to-work, etc.
Her number is 383-6051. How about it?
