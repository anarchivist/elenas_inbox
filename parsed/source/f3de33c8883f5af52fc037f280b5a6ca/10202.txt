TEXT:
Elena: I spoke with    HV about his testimony and the issues we discussed. He
said he had already    made a number of changes, deciding to deal with a
number of issues in    the Q/A. He will send along a fresh draft. He may give
you a call tomorrow    to discuss the hearing. Many thanks. Neal
