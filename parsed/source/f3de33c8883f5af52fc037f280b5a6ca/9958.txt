TEXT:
As you know, Forbes agreed to come to the event -- and there's tremendous
support from the COS Office for this event -- so I'm assuming that Chris
Jennings will smooth things over w/ Ganske (maybe he'll come now) and the
Patients' BOR event is on.  If this is wrong and there's anything I can do
to work on another event over the weekend, please page me. Thanks.
