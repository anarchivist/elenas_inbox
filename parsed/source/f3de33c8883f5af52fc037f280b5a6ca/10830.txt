   Fund To Help Tobacco Farmers

   By ESTES THOMPSON
   Associated Press Writer

   OURHAM, N.C. (AP) -- The nation's four largest cigarette companies agreed
   today to set up a
   $5.15 billion trust fund to help tobacco growers who face a shrinking
   market due to settlements of
   lawsuits that have sharply raised the price of smoking and stepped up
   anti-smoking initiatives.

   The agreement climaxed two days of private meetings between company
   officials and representatives
   from 11 tobacco states. For a time, it appeared the trust fund was in
   jeopardy because R.J.
   Reynolds balked at participating. The company said a better way to help
   the farmers would be to
   buy more of their tobacco.

   But during negotiations today, R.J. Reynolds relented and signed onto the
   trust fund, which was
   restructured. Previously, the four companies -- R.J. Reynolds, Philip
   Morris, Brown & Williamson
   and Lorillard -- would have paid into the fund over 10 years; the
   agreement extends that to 12 years.

   "There are many, many details yet to be worked out, " said Phil Carlton,
   the lawyer representing the
   tobacco companies. "One of the concerns was one of the companies in
   particular had a problem
   with paying the money out that would have been its share in the first
   couple of years."

   Tobacco farmers have been worried about their future as the drive against
   smoking intensified.



Costly settlements of state claims against tobacco companies seeking
reimbursement for the cost of
treating sick smokers have sharply raised the price of cigarettes and that
is expected to reduce
demand.

The trust fund initially was proposed by Philip Morris after the major
cigarette makers agreed to a
$206 billion settlement with 46 states over health care costs last
November. Part of that agreement
required the companies to meet with state officials to discuss the trust
fund for farmers.

Philip Morris announced last week it would deposit $300 million into the
fund this year, even if other
companies chose not to participate. But the No. 1 tobacco company said its
future participation
hinged on the other companies joining the fund.

During the fund's first year, the companies would put in $380 million,
with Philip Morris' $300 million
contribution making up the bulk of the payment.

The second year, the companies would deposit $280 million; the third year,
$400 million; years
four-10, $500 million a year; the 11th year, $440 million; and the 12th
year, $150 million, the
officials said.

North Carolina Gov. Jim Hunt said each state will receive a share of the
fund equal to the amount of
tobacco it grows.

States participating in the discussions are North Carolina, Ohio, South
Carolina, Tennessee,
Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Virginia and West Virginia.

Hunt said the directors of the trust will determine the amount of the
payments and when they are
disbursed.

"We all leave here today winners with a positive outlook for a measure of
financial assistance for our
tobacco farmers, " Hunt said.

During discussions Wednesday, R.J. Reynolds' senior vice president, Tommy
Payne, said his
company had concerns about how the trust fund money would be spent and
whether it might raise
antitrust issues. He said Reynolds' plan to buy mor~ tobacco would not p
ose such problems because
antitrust laws "do not preclude companies from coming to independent
decisions. ' ,

Others, however, dismissed Reynolds' concerns and questioned whether they
were the real reason
for the company's reluctance to sign onto the fund.
