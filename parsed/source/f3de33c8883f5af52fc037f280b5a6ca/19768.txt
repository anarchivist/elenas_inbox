Elena,
FYI. According to Bob Bach, the State Dept. has issued approximately
64,000 H1B visas as of today.  They have enough applications in the
pipeline that by tomorrow, they will have reached the cap.  INS is issuing
a notice of reaching the cap and that b/c their statute requires that once
they run out of visas they must deny additional applications, they would
advise employers not to file new applications until further notice.

Julie
