We are trying to schedule the groups meeting.  I told Barbara Woolley you
would chair it.  Barbara is waiting to get a time on your schedule. We
are trying for next week.

Kennedy's staff see no movement in the Senate at this time. They are
standing firm with their bill and waiting for the Rs to come to them.

In the House there are rumors of an Armey bill, but no details.   House D
staff also don't expect movement soon.

I am working with my contacts among bioethicists to find religious leaders
who would be willing to speak up on our side.
