TEXT:
Hi Elena. Yesterday on the Senate floor, Harkin and others offered an
amendment to the Ag apropriations bill to provide full funding for the
FDA's effots to prevent youth smoking.    (The offset for the $34 million
was obtained by increasing the tobacco marketing assessment, which the
sponsors said would be ultimately borne by the purchasers of tobacco, ie
not the tobacco farmer.)   The amendment lost 52-48, with 11 Democrats
voting against it (including folks like Moseley-Brau, Landrieu, Moynihan,
Inouye and Reid)   They are going to take a revote today.   Harkin and other
sponsors contend that without ths amendment, th Greensboro case outcome is
nullified.    The sponsors are hoping that someone in the White House would
call some of the Ds above and persuade them that this amendment is worht
fighting for.   I'm not sure who is following this issue in the White
House, but I thought you and Bruce might be interested.    I have some
material I will fax you on it. Let me know if there are others I should
contact. Thanks.    Kay
