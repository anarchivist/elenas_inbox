The Honorable William F. Goodling
Chairman
Committee on Education and the Workforce
U.S. House of Representatives
Washington, D.C.  20515

Dear Chairman Goodling:

I understand that the Committee on Education and the Workforce will soon
consider H.R. 4257,  which would allow certain youths as young as 14 years
of age to work in industries that process wood products (including
sawmills) if they are members of a religious sect whose teachings do not
permit formal education beyond the eight grade. The Department has

objective of accommodating the goals of the Amish, consistent with a need
to protect childrenO,s safety and health.

the Amish are turning to support their families and sustain their
communities.

Currently, under the Fair Labor Standards ActO,s child labor provisions,
minors under the age of 16 are prohibited from working in manufacturing
operations, including sawmills.  In addition, the Act gives the Secretary
of Labor the authority to prohibit the employment of minors under
