 TEXT:
 Timing
 The FDA tobacco case is on the list of cases the Justices could discuss at
 their conference tomorrow (Friday April 23rd).   If they make a decision,
 it will be announced at 10:00 am Monday morning.   We and HHS will be
 notified immediately by DOJ.  If no decision is announced on the 26th, the
 next possible announcement date is Monday, May 5th.

 If cert is denied
 If the court denies cert, the 4th circuit will be notified immediately and
 will be expected to issue a mandate within days or weeks which will
 outline, among other things, whether the 4th circuit ruling applies just
 to the 4th circuit or to the entire U.S'. DOJ expects and hopes the cburt
 of appeals will direct the district court to issue the mandate (rather
 than doing it themselves), and that the district court judge will call in
 lawyers from both sides for arguments, but there are no set rules.

 Existing FDA Access Restrictions
 As you will recall, the FDA rule's youth access restrictions are the only
 parts of the rule now in effect. Retailers must check photo i.d. of any'
 tobacco purchaser who appears to be under age 27.     FDA, usually under
 contract with the states, conducts sting operations to enforce retailer
 compliance and fines retailers that violate the rules.   Congress has
 appropriated funds to finance these contracts.   Currently, FDA has
 contracts with 41 states plus D.C. and the Virgin Islands.   Five of these
 states are in the 4th circuit.   (In states without contracts -- North
 Dakota, South Dakota, Oregon, Wyoming, Montana, Ohio, Indiana, Wisconsin,
 and Nebraska -- FDA was planning to conduct its own sting operations, but
 has not begun to do so yet.)

 If the court denies cert, HHS plans to immediately cancel these contracts
 in the five 4th circuit states (NC, SC, VA, WV, and MD) but tell the
 remaining states to continue their sting operations pending further
 guidance from'DOJ and the courts. HHS is eager to continue the stings
(
         because of the role they play in reducing youth smoking; they also believe
         that because Congress has appropriated funds for these purposes, they
         obliged to continue the contracts unless the court tells them not to.  DOJ
         believes that the existence of these contracts will help them argue to the
         4th circuit that its decision should not apply nationwide.  They are also
         considering other litigation strategies which I can describe separately.

         Proposed Administration Reaction to Court Decision
         DOJ and HHS agree that if the court denies cert, we should issue a
         statement on Monday that makes clear our commitment to the FDA rule and
         reducing youth smoking, states the action HHS is planning to take in light
         of the decision, and says we still want to work with Congress to affirm
         FDA's authority in this area. HHS is drafting a statement to get over to
         us tomorrow.  DOJ wants to make sure whatever we say doesn't inflame the
         4th circuit, but in our discussions today I think we were able to agree
         that could avoid that and still be strong on the importance of FDA's
         authority to help reduce youth smoking.  If there is a decision on Monday,
         the FDA Commissioner, who is testifying before the Senate Approps
         Committee Tuesday, will surely get questions.
