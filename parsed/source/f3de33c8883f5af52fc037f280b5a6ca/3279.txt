TEXT:
Erskine is meeting with Native American Members of Congress on Thursday,
and is having a pre-brief tomorrow at 1 (see the e-mail I sent you
earlier) to talk about it. One of the things he may want to talk about
(and this is your call, but Lynn Cutler seemed to think it was a good
idea) is the President's support for a commission on tribal law
enforcement (a proposal I hear you and Bruce sent in to him).   If this is
the kind of news we want Erskine to deliver, you should go to the
pre-brief tomorrow, and if you can also provide talking points on the
commission and how Erskine would explain it, that would be ideal.   (Paper
before tomorrow's meeting would be great; paper during the meeting would
be ok, too.)  I'm heading out, but you can page me or we can talk in the
morning if you have any questions. Thanks so much,
-Angus
