TEXT:
Andrea and I attended a meeting at Treasury on Friday where   we discussed
various options for welfare tax credits.  Treasury was very   opposed to
giving non-profits tax credits either directly or through a   syndication
scheme (where private investors take the tax credit for the   non-profit) .

However, they said chey would continue looking into the ability of the
credits to be maximized by taxable businesses after they have hired an
employee from an intermediary. Specifically, they are going to explore
the ability of a private business to take the second year of the welfare
credit even though the person may have been on the payroll of the
intermediary for all or part of the first year.  Finally, they are going
to look into ways to clarify existing law so that the use of
intermediaries is encouraged and the availability of the credit is made
more well-known. Thanks, Mary
