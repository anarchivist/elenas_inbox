           President Clinton Issues Executive Order to Protect Federal Employees
                            from Environmental Tobacco Smoke
                                       August 9, 1997

President Clinton signed an executive order that will ban smoking in all federal Executive
Branch facilities, except in limited circumstances. Today's action is an important step to protect
the health of federal employees, and the members of the public who visit or use federal facilities,
from the health risks of environmental tobacco smoke (ETS).

Making Federal Facilities Smoke-Free
Federal agencies' smoking policies vary, and many must be strengthened to fully protect federal
workers and visitors from ETS exposure. Over 15 federal agencies ban smoking indoors. But
many agencies still allow smoking in areas where non-smokers and visitors may be exposed to
ETS. The President's Executive Order:
o      Prohibits smoking in interior space owned, rented, or leased by the Executive Branch of
       the federal government, such as office space and National Park Service visitors' centers,
       except in limited circumstances.
o      Allows agencies to have indoor designated smoking areas that are enclosed and exhausted
       directly to the outside. Agency heads may not require workers to enter such areas during
       business hours while smoking is occurring.
o      Prohibits smoking in front of building air intake ducts in outside areas under the federal
       government's control.
o      Directs agency heads to evaluate the need to limit smoking at doorways and in courtyards.
o      Requires heads of Executive Branch agencies to implement the order within one year, and
       encourages agencies to offer smoking cessation assistance to their workforce.

Implementing Strong, Science-Based Measures
Strong scientific evidence. documents that exposure to ETS is a serious health risk:
o      ETS is a known cause of lung cancer in healthy non-smokers, and is associated with
       increases in death rates from cardiovascular disease in non-smokers.
o      The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates that ETS is responsible for about
       3,000 lung cancer deaths each year in nonsmoking adults.
o      Environmental tobacco smoke also threatens the health of hundreds of thousands of
       children with asthma and other respiratory illnesses.
o      In 1986 the Surgeon General found that simple separation of smokers and nonsmokers
       within the same airspace may reduce but does not eliminate ETS exposure to
       nonsmokers.

Building on the President's Record
In August, 1996 President Clinton announced a comprehensive Food and Drug Administration rule
to protect children from tobacco. The regulation seeks to reduce children's tobacco use by 50%
over seven years by restricting children's access to cigarettes and smokeless tobacco and by reducing
the products' appeal. Two provisions of the rule are already in effect:
o       Retailers are prohibited from selling cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products to anyone
        under age 18;
o       Retailers must verify age by photo ID for anyone under the age of 27 purchasing these
            Hex-Dump Conversion
products.
                                                                         Hex-Dump Conversion



     Executive Order to Protect Federal Workers from Enivronmental Tobacco Smoke
                                         Q&A


Q:            What will the executive order do?

A:     The executive order announced today will prohibit smoking in federal executive branch
       facilities, with limited exceptions. Agencies may allow smoking in designated areas if
       they are ventilated directly to the outside and maintained under negative pressure to keep
       smoke from entering other indoor areas. In addition, agencies may allow smoking in
       residential accommodations such as military housing or prisons, or where necessary to
       accomplish agency missions, such as for undercover operations, certain military
       activities, or diplomatic situations.

Q.     Does the order prohibit smoking in outdoor areas as well?

A.     The order prohibits smoking in front of air intake ducts. It also directs the heads of
       federal agencies to evaluate the need to limit smoking at doorways and in courtyards.

Q.     Didn't earlier drafts of the executive order include a much more restrictive ban on
       outside smoking?

A.     All executive orders go through many drafts and are subject to many changes. After
       careful review, the Administration decided that a general ban on smoking at entranceways
       and in courtyards would be inappropriate, given the wide variation among such areas.
       Instead, agency officials have authority to restrict smoking in these areas, based on their
       evaluation of the need to do so to protect workers and visitors from exposure to ETS.

Q:      What facilities will this executive order cover?

A:     All federal executive branch workplaces under federal control, including leased space.
       This includes office buildings, visitors' centers and restaurants in federal parks, and the
       growing number of One Stop Shops or U.S. General Stores where federal agencies gather
       together to provide services to the public.

Q:      Does the executive order cover the Congress and courts as well?

A:     No. Executive Orders apply only to agencies and employees of the executive branch.
       The Congress and Judiciary are independent and separate branches of government. The
       Administration encourages Congress and the Judiciary to adopt measures that protect
       their employees and members of the public from the adverse health effects of


                                                I
                                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion
     environmental tobacco smoke.


Q:           Does this executive order cover the military?

A:   Yes. The military has been subject to a 1994 policy prohibiting smoking in all
     Department of Defense workplaces. The executive order announced today goes further
     than the current DOD policy, because it also covers restaurants and recreational facilities.

Q:   Why is it necessary to ban smoking in federal work areas? Aren't separate
     smoking areas sufficient?

A:   The simple separation of smokers and nonsmokers within the same airspace reduces but
     does not eliminate exposure to environmental tobacco smoke. Separate smoking areas
     are acceptable only ifthey are enclosed and exhausted directly to the outside and away
     from air intake ducts, and are maintained under negative pressure with respect to
     surrounding spaces.

Q:   What is the cost to the government of the EO?

A:   GSA expects that the cost of complying with the EO will be minimal. Agencies may
           incur costs associated with improving ventilation. But prohibiting smoking in
     workplaces lowers employers' expenditures on health and life insurance, workers'
     compensation, property damage and maintenance, and employee absenteeism.

Q:   How many federal agencies already have no smoking policies?

A:   About 15 agencies are smoke-free; almost all the rest have policies in place to minimize
     exposure to second-hand smoke in the workplace. But many non-smoke-free agencies
     will have to upgrade their protections of nonsmokers in order to comply with the EO
     requirements, such as separate ventilation systems for any smoking areas. For example,
     the Department of Transportation allows smoking in smoking lounges that may not meet
     the strict ventilation requirements of the EO. Other agencies such as the Departments of
     Energy and Housing and Urban Development currently allow smoking areas in restrooms,
     offices, or other spaces used concurrently by smokers and nonsmokers. In all, more than
     half ofthe 1.9 million federal executive branch employees work: in agencies that will have
     to strengthen their policies.

Q:   Would the proposed settlement with the tobacco industry have any impact on
     workplace smoking?

A:   The proposed settlement includes far-reaching provisions to protect workers and the
     public from ETS. The settlement would restrict indoor smoking in "public facilities,"


                                              2
                                                                     ,-lex-Dump Conversion


     including most private and public workplaces and fast-food restaurants. Certain
     facilities such as bars, clubs, casinos, and prisons would be exempt. The specifics of the
     settlement provisions will be carefully evaluated during the Administration's formal
     review of the proposed settlement led by Secretary Shalala and Domestic Policy Advisor
     Bruce Reed.

Q:   Does the EO require agencies to aid smoking employees in the transition to more
     smoke-free workplaces by offering them cessation programs?

A:   The EO encourages agency heads to offer smoking cessation programs. In the past, upon
     implementing more protective smoking policies, the majority of federal agencies have
     offered some type of cessation program at agency cost or for a nominal fee. The Office
     of Personnel Management (OPM) supports and encourages these programs and assists
     agencies in making them available to employees.

Q:   Do federal employees' health insurance plans cover smoking cessation assistance?

A:   The government provides health services to 10 million federal employees, retirees, and
            their families through 375 health benefit plans. Individual plan coverage to aid
     members in smoking cessation varies. Federal employees should refer to their plan
     brochure for specific coverage information.

     Generally, fee-for-service plans cover up to $100 towards the cost of enrollment in one
             smoking cessation program per member per lifetime after the calendar year
     deductible has been met. Many fee-for-service plans also cover the cost of smoking
     cessation drugs that require a prescription; some cover the cost of non-prescription drugs
     as a part of the $100 lifetime benefit to aid in smoking cessation. Benefits in Health
     Maintenance Organizations (HMO's) vary.

Q:   What other steps have you taken to reduce Americans' exposure to environmental
     tobacco smoke?

A:   In 1993, the Administration supported legislation (H.R. 3434) to extend ETS workplace
     protection to most workers. And, in 1994, President Clinton signed into law the "Goals
     2000: Educate America Act," which prohibited smoking in federally-funded children's
     services facilities, including most elementary and secondary schools.

     The Administration has also vigorously pursued a research agenda that has revealed
     environmental tobacco smoke to be a cause of lung cancer, a risk factor for coronary heart
     disease in adult nonsmokers, and a cause of respiratory disease iri hundreds of thousands
     of children.

Q:   Isn't OSHA planning to issue a regulation on ETS?


                                              3
                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion



A:   OSHA has been working on a rule that addresses environmental tobacco smoke and other
            indoor air pollutants. With respect to ETS, OSHA's rule would require federal
     and private employers to prohibit smoking in workplaces, except in separately ventilated
     areas.

Q:   When will OSHA publish its rule? Why has OSHA spent so long working on this
     proposal?

A:   OSHA's April 4, 1994 proposal on indoor air quality evoked the largest public response
     in the agency's history, with more than 115,000 comments received when the comment
     period closed in August 1995. Public hearings began September 20,1994 and ran until
     March 13, 1995, with more than 400 witnesses testifying. The post-hearing comment
     period ended January 16,1996. OSHA is continuing to review the comments and
     testimony from concerned Americans before proceeding. This process was slowed
     significantly throughout Fiscal Years 1995 and 1996, due to the uncertainty surrounding
     OSHA's budget; this period included hiring freezes, staff cutbacks, and the government
     shutdown. OSHA is working hard to complete the rule, but has not set a release date.


HEALTH EFFECTS OF ENVIRONMENTAL TOBACCO SMOKE


Q:   What are the health effects of environmental tobacco smoke (ETS)?

A:   ETS causes disease in healthy nonsmokers and is a major source of harmful indoor air
     pollution.

             The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has concluded that ETS is
     responsible for approximately 3,000 lung cancer deaths each year in nonsmoking adults.
     ETS also threatens the health of hundreds of thousands of children with asthma and other
     respiratory illnesses. Similar findings were made previously by the National Academy of
     Sciences, the Surgeon General, and the Nationallnstitute for Occupational Safety and
     Health.

     A recent, well-received study by Harvard researchers (Kawachi et aI., 1997) found that
             regular exposure among healthy, nonsmoking women to environmental tobacco
     smoke at home or at work increased their risk of coronary heart disease 91 %. Even
     occasional exposure increased their risk by as much as 58%. The increased risk for heart
     disease is generally estimated at 30%. Further studies on the relationship between
     involuntary smoking and cardiovascular disease are needed in order to conclusively
     detennine the causal relationship between involuntary smoking and cardiovascular
     disease.

                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion
Q:    Haven't the EPA's numbers been largely discredited?
A:    Absolutely not. The EPA's report was the subject of an extensive open review both by
      the public and by EPA's Science Advisory Board (SAB), a panel of independent scientific
      experts. The panel concurred in the methodology and unanimously endorsed the
      conclusions of the final report. The report has also been endorsed by the U.S.
      Department of Health and Human Services and many major health organizations.

Q:    Do you have estimates of the total costs to society related to exposure to
      environmental tobacco smoke?

A:    Such estimates are not available for environmental tobacco smoke exposure -- only for
      active smoking. Direct medical costs associated with smoking are estimated at $50
      billion per year. In 1990, the estimated indirect losses associated with premature
      morbidity and premature mortality from direct smoking were $6.9 billion and $40.3
      billion, respectively.

Q:           How many people are exposed to environmental tobacco smoke in the
workplace?

A:    In 1996, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) concluded that the
      workplace, in addition to the home environment, are significant sources of ETS exposure
      in the U.S. Of working adults who were non-tobacco users, 47.7% reported exposure to
      ETS at home or at work. Among adult non-tobacco users, the prevalence of reported
      exposure to ETS at work was greater than reported exposure to ETS at home. These
      findings support previous studies that have indicated the workplace is a major source of
      ETS exposure, particularly among nonsmokers who are not exposed at home.
