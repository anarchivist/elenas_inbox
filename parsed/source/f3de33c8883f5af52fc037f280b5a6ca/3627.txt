         ASSIST

         NCI's American Stop Smoking Intervention Study for Cancer Prevention (ASSIST) project,
         represents a joint effort among NCI, the American Cancer Society, and health departments in 17
         states. During the first 24 months of the project (1991-1993), each state conducted a detailed
         site analysis and needs assessment. Following a careful review of these findings, each state
         developed its own comprehensive 5-year smoking control plan. In the intervention phase
         (1993-1998), each state has been implementing their plan. State programs rely on proven
         interventions in work sites, health care settings, schools, community groups, and mass media.
         Detailed guidelines and extensive training has been continually provided to ensure that all
         interventions used in ASSIST are consistent with current scientific knowledge. While
         prevention and cessation services are an integral component of any comprehensive effort, in
         ASSIST emphasis is placed on the strategic use of media and the adoption and implementation
         of those smoking control policies that support nonsmoking as the accepted community norm.
         ASSIST also relies on a coalition based model. To date, more than 2,000 community
         organizations have
