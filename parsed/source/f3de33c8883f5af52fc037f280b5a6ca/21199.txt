TEXT:
According to Peter Jacoby Larry Stein will be calling to set up a
conference call this weekend to discuss our strategy regarding H-1B.
Today's Congress Daily reported that the Republicans plan to offer the
Abraham/Smith proposal on the House floor next week with a few
modifications that move in our direction (including a larger training fee
and a provisicin against unconscionable contracts and "benching"). At the
same time, Lee Otis from Abraham's staff contacted Peter J. with a (small)
counter-offer in an effort to continue our discussions. We clearly need
to decide our strategy over the next week.

Attached is our list of the 15 changes we wanted to see in the
Abraham/Smith proposal.  During the call Peter J and I will dlscuss which
changes Abraham's staff have (tentatively) agreed to and their current
offer.

 The following is a HEX DUMP:

FF575043B0040000010A02010000000205000000BE19000000020000CC71536DA5CD6479D3683B
Proposed Administration Revisions to H.R. 3736 (the July 29, 1998 version):

I.    Require either a $500 fee for each position for which an application is filed or a $1,000
      fee for each nonimmigrant. Fee to fund training provided under JTPA Title IV. In
      addition, a small portion of these revenues should fund the administration of the H-I B
      visa program, including the cost of arbitration.

2.    Define H-IB-dependent employers as:

      a.     For employers with fewer than 51 workers, that at least 20% of their workforce is
             H-IB; and

      b.     For employers with more than 50 workers, that at least 10% of their workforce is
             H-IB.

3.    The recruitment and no lay-off attestations apply to: (I) H-lB dependent employers; and
      (2) any employer who, within the previous 5 years, has been found to have willfully
      violated its obligations under this law.

4.    H-IB dependent employers attest they will not place an H-lB worker with another
      employer, under certain employment circumstances, where the other employer has
      displaced or intends to displace a U.S. worker (as defined in paragraph (4» during the
      period beginning 90 days before and ending 90 days after the date the placement would
      begin.

5.    DOL would have the authority to investigate compliance either: (I) pursuant to a
      complaint by an aggrieved party; or (2) based on other credible evidence indicating
      possible violations.

6.    Establish an arbitration process for disputes involving the laying-off of any U.S. worker
      who was replaced by an H-I ~ worker, even of a non-H-I B dependent employer. This
      arbitration process would be largely similar to that laid out in H.R. 3736 except that it
      would be administered by the Secretary of Labor. The arbitrator must base his or her
      decision on a "preponderance of the evidence."

7.    Reference in the bill to "administrative remedies" includes the authority to require back
      pay, the hiring of an individual, or reinstatement.

8.    There must be appropriate sanctions for violations of "whistleblower" protections.

9.    Close loopholes in the attestations:

      a.     Strike the provision that "[n]othing in the [recruitment attestation] shall be
             construed to prohibit an employer from using selection standards normal or

                                              Automated Records Management System
                                              Hex-Dump Conversion

             customary to the type of job involved."

      b.     Clarify that job contractors can be sanctioned for placing an H-I B worker with an
             employer who subsequently lays off a U.S. worker within the 90 days following
             placement.

      c.     Do not exempt H-I B workers with at least a master's degree or the equivalent
             from calculations of the total number ofH-IB employees.

      d.     Define lay-off based on termination for "cause or voluntary termination," but
             exclude cases where there has been an offer of continuing employment.

10.   Consolidate the LCA approval and petition processes within DOL, rather than within
      INS.

11.   Broaden the definition of U.S. workers to include aliens authorized to be employed by
      this act or by the Attorney General.

12.   Include a provision that prohibits unconscionable contracts.

13.   Include a "no benching" requirement that an H-lB nonimmigrant in "non-productive
      status" for reasons such as training, lack of license, lack of assigned work, or other such
      reason (not including when the employee is unavailable for work) be paid for a 40 hour
      week or a prorated portion of a 40 hour week during such time.

14.   Increase the annual cap on H-l B visas to 95,000 in FY 1998, 105,000 in FY 1999, and
      115,000 in FY 2000. After FY 2000, the visa cap shall return to 65,000.

15.   Eliminate the 7500 cap on the number of non-physician health care workers admitted
      under the H-l B program to make the bill consistent with our obligations under the GATS
      agreement.
