TEXT:
This afternoon new HMDA data will be released by the banking agencies.
Overall the numbers are good.  The number of both government-backed and
conventional home purchase lending to all racial and ethnic groups
increased from 1995. However, the number of conventional home purchase
loans to African-American applicants fell by 1.5%. The good news however
is that home purchase lending increased .5% for Hispanics, 6.1% for Native
Americans, 7% for Asians. Since the President has been in office
('93-'96), conventional home purchase loans have risen 67.2% for
African-Americans, 48.5% for Hispanics, 31.6% for Native Americans, and
16.4% for Asians.
