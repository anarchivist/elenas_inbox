TEXT:
Based on conversation with HHS folks this afternoon, they will definitely
delay posting on web until Monday (unless we require them to delay
further).  This means they can include data as of 12/31. They may not get
any new state reports in tomorrow, but at least we'll have given them the
benefit of the doubt. Of the 9 states who have not reported yet, at least
5 definitely should have reported by now. The situation for the other 4
is a bit less clear since they did not start TANF until after 1/1/97 so th
e rules and timing for them is a little different. HHS regional offices
were supposed to be following up to find out where the reports are.

HHS is substantially revising the narrative part of report based on our
comments and will be sending revised version by COB tomorrow. We'll look
at it again and make sure we can live with what's in there to be posted on
web Monday. HHS' notion is to post the data early and often, rather than
waiting until its all·perfect--the idea is that these are works in
progress and there is some benefit to the system, and to HHS' credibility,
to get the information out quickly.

Let me know if you have concerns with this or want to discuss further.
