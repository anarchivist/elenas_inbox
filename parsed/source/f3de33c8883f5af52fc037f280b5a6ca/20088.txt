I.     PURPOSE

       To call on the Senate to pass the McCain tobacco legislation by the end of the week.

II.    BACKGROUND

       You will urge the Senate to swiftly pass the McCain legislation when they return from
       recess next week. You have previously announced that you would be pleased to sign the
       McCain Manager's Amendment into law because it meets your five principles for
       comprehensive tobacco legislation. This is an opportunity to reiterate the importance of
       enacting compre-hensive, tobacco legislation this year, and to comment on key
       amendments that are likely to be considered by the Senate next week. In particular, you
       will emphasize your support for Senator Ford's LEAF Act, and urge Congress to break
       this impasse and pass a bill that provides strong protections to farmers and their
       communities.
