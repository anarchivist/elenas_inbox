TEXT:
This is great.  FYI -- the next House-Senate-advocates immigration
strategy meeting organized by Sandy Levin is scheduled for April 10th.
This one will include members of Congress. Our allies are looking for
demonstrations of commitment from us, so having had this meeting with a
statement or having a firm plan by then would be great.
