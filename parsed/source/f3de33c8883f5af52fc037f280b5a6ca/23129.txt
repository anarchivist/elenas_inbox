        Here are some thoughts on the genetic discrimination issues that came up in
yesterday's meeting. Family history really is different from genetic markers (at least the
way it is used). Family history is used as a factor confirming the existence of current
disease. For example, physicians use family history as one indicator that an individual
now has heart disease. The CIA said it used family history as one indicator to suggest an
applicant currently has mental illness. The principal concern about genetic markers has
been that they indicate a possibility that disease will develop in the future.

        I still think that it makes sense to prohibit direct use of family history to make
hiring or assignment decisions. That is because, as I understand EEOC's interpretation,
the ADA prohibits such decisions unless there is a direct and imminent threat to the
employee. It will be rare when any condition reaches that threshold and even rarer when
family history is the factor that pushes the evaluation over the threshold. The loss of that
factor in the employer's decision is insignificant compared to the benefits in privacy and
prevention of misuse.

        On the other hand, it makes less sense to bar the use of family history as a factor
indicating that further testing is needed. If employers, including federal agencies, are free
to make medical evaluations of current physical condition, should we bar what is now one
regular aspect of a conventional medical evaluation? Doing so could hamper evaluations
and encourage physicians to do additional unnecessary testing.

        I gave my views on formulating the exemption option so I won't repeat them here,
except for one thought. If a narrow, agency-specific exemption finds its way into the
order, the administration will probably have to explain it some day. At that point, the
rationale will point toward a broader exemption. So? we will end up conceding the broad
rationale but we will be stuck with (and have to defend) an illogical exemption.
Consequently, the exemption option should be faced directly rather than serve as a
(tempting) narrow fix.
