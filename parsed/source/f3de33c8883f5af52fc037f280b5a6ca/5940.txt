TEXT:
Here is what we plan to put in the heart of the scheduling memo.   Still
checking a few facts, but wanted to get your reaction in the meantime.
The high tech firm in Florida might especially appeal to Blair, and the
jobs look really good.  If schedule calls for something close by, it's
hard to beat Giant for convenience and they have a British connection as
well (they're part-owned by a British company and one of the active
players in the U.K. 's welfare reform efforts is a major grocery company).

February 6th, 1998

Welfare reform is a very high priority for Prime Minister Blair. He has tracked our reforms with
great interest and has modeled much of his program on ours. A visit to an innovative welfare
reform site provides an opportunity to show both Tony Blair and the American people how
people are successfully moving from welfare to work. The visit would focus on work and
retention, showing what the public and private sector, working togther, can do to help welfare
recipients get and keep good jobs. We would visit a business where the President and Prime
Minister could talk with one or more employers, former welfare recipients, and the public
officials involved in welfare reform in that community. We would highlight the importance of
pUblic-private partnerships and the benefits of going to work.

We have identified strong options in two states--Florida and Maryland. Public officials in both
states are eager to host the event.

FLORIDA
Circent Semi-Conductor, Orlando, FL
Tour the the semi-conductor fabrication unit at company, where approximately 20 welfare
recipients are currently working in "clean rooms" making integrated circuits. Have a discussion
about the program and Q&A time for the Prime Minister to learn more about welfare reform in
the U.S. generally, and this initiative specifically. Other participants could include: company
officials, former welfare recipients, and state and local elected officials.

Cirent is not currently involved with the Welfare to Work Partnership; however, Partnership staff
are interested in working with us and in getting more involved in Florida. The Orlando Chamber
of Commerce contacted the Partnership last week to request 100 copies of the Blueprint for
Success and is very enthusiastic about getting involved with welfare reform. Governor Chiles'
Washington office has been involved in identifying options and is enthusiastic about a potential
visit, as is the staff from the State WAGES Board (a private-public body that oversees welfare
reform in Florida). WAGES is the name of Florida's welfare reform program.

The company: Circent Semiconductor is a joint venture begun in 1996 between Lucent
Technologies and Cirrus Logic that manufactures eight inch integrated circuit wafers. The
expansion of the new venture in 1997 brought 600 new high-tech jobs to Orlando. Circent now
has 1,400 employees at the site; CEO is Peter T. Panousis. (Lucent was formed as a result of
AT&T's restructuring and became a fully independent company in September 1996. Cirrus, based
in Fremont, CA, is a leading manufacturer of advanced integrated circuits and one of the world's
fastest growing semiconductor companies.)

Success: In the past year, Circent has hired about 20 welfare recipients, representing about 10%
of its incoming entry-level workforce. Starting wages are up to $20,000 per year.

The program: Circent has been very aggressive and committed in hiring and supporting former
welfare recipients. The company is very active in the community and with the local WAGES

                                                             Automated Records Management System
                                                             Hex-Dump Conversion
and also make a concerted effort not to single them out. [getting retention, pay, benefit, and
promotion information, and information about the referral process between the WAGES
coalition/agencies and the company] [Getting background on WAGES structure, partnership,
private sector and community sector membership].

Orlando also has a strong welfare to work transportation strategy that we might want to highlight
to garner support for our $600 million transportation initiative. The WAGES coalition contracts
with the local public transit authority, LYNX, to transport WAGES participants. They are
working on a van pooling initiative that will include WAGES participants as drivers [getting
more information on this, can we connect it to Circent?].


Maryland
Giant Foods, Inc.--Prince George's County
Tour either the corporate training facility in Greenbelt or a Giant grocery store in the County.
Visit several welfare recipients who are in or have completed on the job training for positions
including cashiers, pharmacy and bakery clerks, and meat wrappers. From the time they begin
training, individuals are hired as part time associates at __ihour with full medical benefits. We
would then have a discussion about the program and Q&A time for the Prime Minister to learn
more about welfare reform in the U.S. generally, and this program specifically. Other
participants could include: CEO Pete Manos, the store or training manager, former welfare
recipients, State and local elected officials, and Eli Segal. (Giant has just joined the Welfare to
Work Partnership.) Governor Glendening's office is excited about the program and about the
potential visit.

The company: Giant is based in Landover, MD and has 170 stores and 27,000 employees in the
Washington Metro area. The company is partially owned by a British firm [get name].

Success: To date, Giant has hired 71 of91 people interviewed (exceeding the normal hire rate
of 1 in 4). In the four months since the program began, only 5 people have left (compared to
Giant's typical attrition rate of 50%).

The program: This is a partnership between Giant, the Private Industry Council, and the local
welfare office in Prince George's County. The United Food and Commercial Workers Union
[double check] is also involved and supportive of the project. Giant Foods has a contract with the
state to train and place approximately 80 welfare recipients, with plans to expand to 100. Giant
provides the PIC with hiring requirements. The local welfare office identifies possible
candidates and does initial screening and selection. Those who meet criteria go to the PIC for a
two week pre-employment training focusing on work readiness and service industry skills.
Giant played a key role in developing the training. Giant interviews graduates and hires
successful candidates as cashiers, pharmacy, grocery, bakery, seafood and produce clerks, and
meat wrappers. They are part-time associates starting at $__Ihour with full medical benefits.
(All Giant associates are brought on part-time because of seniority rules.) Giant provides 6 weeks
of paid on the job training (funded by the state). A job coach is available to help people succeed
services. There is also a buddy system to help new employees adjust to the job [getting more
information]. The fact that individuals are welfare recipients is kept confidential and invisible to
other employees. The company, the participants, and the public agencies are all pleased with the
program. To date, there have been 7 two-week pre-employment classes, and there will be one
going during the visit.
