TEXT:
Here is an update on what happened in the privacy meeting:

Sally asked that everyone come up with a draft package of privacy
initiatives in two weeks.  The topics that the package will address are:
(I) the privacy entity in the EOP; (2) identity theft; (3) profiling; and
(4) industry self-regulation (what Ira Magaziner is working on).  The
package will hopefully also include some legislation we could endorse.

The following are some upcoming dates:

June 4 - the industry is thinking of having a pre-announcement of how it
will regulate itself
June 4 - FTC is releasing a report on privacy
June 23 - Commerce Department "summit"
July 1 -Commerce Department report to the President - Sally pushed Ira on
the industry self-regulation part    if the industry doesn't come up with
a strong enough proposal, we need to have a Plan "B" to announce on July
1.
