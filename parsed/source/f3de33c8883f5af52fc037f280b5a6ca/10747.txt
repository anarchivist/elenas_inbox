Subject:         Re: OMB's possible Revised Bullet for Tobacco Budget
Language

1.0MB's is more-cryptic and has less sympathetic rhetoric for farmers.
I think this brevity will be less reassuring to farmers. Also, it
doesn't mention that we are watching what is going on and doesn't imply
we will continue to fulfill the commitment we made depending on the
outcome. But Bruce seemed to agree in our staff meeting that our line is
that we are a backstop for farmers depending on the outcome of their
negotiations.

2. OMB only mentions purchase commitments explicitly: a.) there might be
some legal issues about us saying that our main budget plan is to pressure
private companies to enter into certain contracts with other private
entities b.) the purchase commitments is not the chief way we have ever
promised to help farmers, to emphasize it now will signal we are backing
away from our general commitment to be a backstop farmers and moving to
just this.
