Sylvia asked that we check with you and make sure you didn't have any
concerns with this regulation.  In addition to the points Anil makes
below, note that, Medicaid already has a precedent for counting a pregnant
woman as more than one person.

Subject: FYI -- WIC rule codifying law on treatment of pregnant women for
program eligibility

FNS is about to clear a rule that, among other technical provisions,
codifies language the President signed into law in 1994, and that almost


all state agencies have since implemented under an FNS policy memorandum.
The provision at issue would make an otherwise income ineligible household
with a pregnant woman eligible for WIC benefits if the household would be
eligibile if household size were increased by one.  In passing this law
Congress considered evidence that some of the greatest returns in the WIC
program are for pregnant women.  We are bringing this to your attention
out of concern that a rule allowing pregnant mothers to be counted as two
individuals could be construed by some as a statement on status of a fetus
with respect to broader discussions on abortion policy.  Because the rule
codifies language signed into law in 1994 and on which FNS has already
issued guidance, it reflects no change in policy or in formally stated
Administration position.

Please let us know if you have any concerns.
