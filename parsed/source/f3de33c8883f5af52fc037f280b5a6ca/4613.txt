TEXT:
Please let me underscore what I've been saying this afternoon:  for the
President to have a document to sign at lOam tomorrow morning, the clerk's
office needs it as soon as possible to scrub it and re-format it for the
ceremony. Please help us out by putting a lid on the directive as early
as possible this evening, preferably by 6:30 p.m. Thanks.
