TEXT:
Fred DuVal has more or less agreed to have a conference call late this
afternoon with Dem Govs staff (Miller, Romer, Dean, Chiles, Carper).
Romer and Dean are pressing him very hard on the question of how they
should respond to Carper's letter, since Carper is apparently pushing very
hard for his 3-point position to become the Dem Govs position. The theory
is that this conference call would reinforce our position, and slow down
Carper.  I'm a bit mystified as to why Dem Govs should be confused about
our position, but maybe they really are.

If you don't think this conference call today is a good idea, you probably
need to call Fred. He is out Thursday and Friday, which is why he's
rushing. He thinks next week is too late since Carper is pushing these
guys. It seems like you would have to be on such a call; we could do it
without him Thurs. or Friday if we wanted.

Carper's 3 points are:

1. Recreate the CWEP system of paying the minimum wage (person can't work
more hours than the state benefit divided by the minimum wage) .

2. A confusing item that either weakens the work requirements by saying
more things count, or just says that states can combine activities to hit
the work requirements.

3. says workfare people are not employees.   This is how he gets around
FICA, but obviously there's a lot more that this does.
