TEXT:
          There will NOT be a regular interagency/EOP meeting on timber
this
          afternoon. I do, however, expect to receive the draft REO memo we
          discussed at last week's meeting sometime this week, and will
make
          sure agency reps. receive it.

          There will be a meeting next Tuesday, January 21st, at the
          regularly scheduled time.  The agenda for next Tuesday will
          include (but not be limited to ) a discussion of the Small
          Business Regulatory Flexibility Act's applicability to both
forest.
          plans under NFMA and management plans under FLPMA.

          On the following Tuesday, January 28th, instead of the regular
          meeting, Katie McGinty will chair a meeting of the Interagency
          Steering Committee.  Most, if not all, of the regional
          executives will also be attending.  Two important agenda items
          will be the analysis of new information resulting from the timber
          rider on the Pacific Northwest Forest Plan, and a briefing from
          the regional executives on progress made in implementing the
          various monitoring activities committed to by the agencies in the
          ROD for the Plan.
