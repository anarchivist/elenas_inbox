       Gene Sperling and Rahm Emanuel would like to compile a report of all of
       the activities undertaken as a part of the budget rollout since Friday,
       May 2.

       Please send a reply email to me by noon tomorrow (Wednesday) with a l i s t
       of what you, your office, and your principal have accomplished since
       Friday.  Specifically, your list should include a report on those
       activities and calls listed on the strategy document that was circula ted
       on Friday as well as any other activities or calls that you have camp leted
       (e.g., press calls, outreach calls, documents faxed).

       Please also list the activities that you, your office, and your principal
       plan to conduct in the days ahead (e.g., constituency briefings,
       conference calls, follow-up press calls).  Following up on this effort
       and on your reports -- we plan to hold a meeting later in the week to
       discuss further budget rollout activities.

       Thanks very much, both for your timely response to this email, as well as
       for your patience and efforts on Friday.
