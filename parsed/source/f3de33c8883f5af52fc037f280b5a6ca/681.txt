RE:            Possible Presidential Involvement/Action on "Tuskegee Study"

DATE: Thursday, January 30,1997



        A quick report on a meeting this afternoon with Kitty Higgins, Elena Kagan, HHS Chief
of Staff Bill Corr, and Assistant Secretary for Health Philip Lee.

Background

        As you know, between 1932 and 1972 the Public Health Service (now part ofHHS),
together with the Tuskegee Institute, conducted a long-term study of untreated syphilis known as
the "Tuskegee Study." For the purposes of the study, federal, state and local officials allowed
about 400 African-American men to go untreated for syphilis, even though treatment was
available. (11 of these men are still alive.) The study was stopped only after it became public
in 1972. The government then agreed to provide medical care to the victims and their families
for the rest of their lives.

Tile Government's Study

        In 1996, CDC and HHS sponsored a Tuskegee Syphilis Study Committee (technically the
President's committee, although I do not believe he has ever publicly commented on the issue).
In May, 1996, the Committee issued a report which recommended that the President apologize
on behalf of the government. The report also suggested initiatives in minority health, training
for health care workers serving in minority communities, and a clearinghouse to help
investigators conduct ethically responsible research. The study has gotten a great deal of media
attention, much of it focussed on the fact that the incident has fueled African-American distrust
of government and public health authorities.

HHS's Request (or a Presidential Event or Message

        HHS is now requesting some kind of Presidential involvement -- ranging from a
proclamation or press statement, to an actual Presidential event. They initially asked that this
happen before February 10th (which is clearly impossible), because that is when an HBO movie
about the Tuskegee Study will premiere; at the very least, they would like to do this by the end of
February, which is African-American History Month.

       HHS was arguing that the President should simply issue an apology, since that was the
                                                                             Hex-Dump ConvGlSlon
                                               -2-
Committee's main recommendation. Apparently, HHS was not prepared to act on any of the
Committee's other recommendations. Kitty, Elena and I agreed that it is almost certainly not
worth Presidential involvement unless we can show real action. HHS promised to report back
ASAP with possible steps that could be taken.

       The key questions are:

       Is this issue worth the President's involvement, even if we can show action?

       If so, is it better to quietly issue a proclamation or statement or to design an actual event?

       If not, should HHS do something on their own?

        Please advise; once we receive more options from HHS, we plan to hold another meeting
on this issue.
