     Subject:         Appropriations Committee Action on FDA

     FYI - - HHS & FDA staff advise that House Appropriations Committee
     provided full funding for the FDA portion of the Food Safety Initiative -
     - $24 million (+10 million from the Subcommittee mark of $14 million) .

     Also, the Committee provided $24 million for implementation of the FDA
     tobacco regulation - - +9 million more than the Subcommittee mark and $10
     million less that the President's request.

     The AG appropriations bill was approved, but the Committee vote was split
     down party lines (FDA was not the reason for this split).  I will let you
     know if I get any more information.
