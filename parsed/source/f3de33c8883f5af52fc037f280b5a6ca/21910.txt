TEXT:
FYI.  Caroline F. just forwarded me a copy of a letter sent to the AG from
Sens. Kennedy. Abraham. Graham and Mack on Dec. 15th of last year in which
they discuss their view that it would be consistent with the NACARA
legislation for the AG to use her discretion to presume extremere hardship
for NACARA beneficiaries generally.  I will fax you a copy of the letter.
