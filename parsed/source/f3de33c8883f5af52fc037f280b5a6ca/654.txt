Bruce:
Rumor has it that you're the West Wing point person on this one. And
rumor also has it that you've got some materials that might be useful as I
prepare the VP's remarks.  Could you have someone get me those materials
(267 OEOB). Once I have a look, maybe we could talk tomorrow. As I
understand it, my orders are to discuss education, welfare reform, and
bipartisanship.  Thanks.

Pink
