Elena -

Following up on our conversation this morning, the meeting on the EPA
issue will be at 10:30 am in the Roosevelt Room.  The immediate issues to
be discussed at the meeting are (1) how OIRA handled pre-decisional memos
from OSTP and CEA, and (2) how OSTP and CEA should respond to document
requests from Congress. The larger issue, however, is how the system will
work down the road; how OIRA will handle policy council pre-decisional
memos concerning proposed agency regulations. This is the portion of the
meeting that I assume will be relevant to DPC. The meeting has been
organized by Bill Marshall in the Counsel's office and will be led by
Sylvia Mathews.  I think Bob Damus and Sally Katzen will attend along with
Michele Jolin, Shelley Fidler, and me.  I le~t Bill a message this morning
suggesting he invite DPC and NEC and got a message back saying he had
invited NEC.  Perhaps he merely forgot to include DPC, so even though it's
not my meeting, I think I can feel safe in inviting you or a member of
your staff to join the discussion.  Please give me a call at 62735 if you
have any questions.
