    Prostate Cancer Update. We have been extremely successful in highlighting the new
    Medicare preventive benefits and 'research breakthroughs for breast cancer. However, we have
    yet to have the same level of success highlighting our significant record on prostate and
    colorectal cancer. For this reason, we are contemplating Father's day to highlight a number
    of the Administration's initiatives, but in particular to announce the release of over $25
    million in new grants explicitly set aside for prostate cancer research at the Department of
    Defense. Other initiatives we could emphasize include: the new Medicare colorectal and prostate
    screening preventive benefits, your support for Medicare coverage of cancer clinical trials,
    historical increases in the NCI budget, genetic discrimination legislation, and the patients' bill of
    rights. Until recently, prostate cancer research and breakthroughs have not received the
    attention or funding that other politically salient diseases have, such as breast cancer and AIDS.
    The NCI, however, now believes that there is new potential in this area, and is therefore
    increasing funding to begin new clinical trials and other research in this area, efforts which will
    be enhanced if Congress passes your proposed 67 percent increase in cancer research, In
    addition, one of the greatest barriers to progress in this prostate cancer research is the lack of
    success in enrolling men in clinical trials. Your proposal to cover cancer clinical trials, which is
    currently being carried in the McCain version of the tobacco legislation could make a significant
    difference in attracting men into these studies. It is important to note that the Medicare prostate
    preventive benefit does not go into effect until the year 2000, The reason for the delay of
    implementation has much less to do with cost than it does with the lack of evidence that
    screening makes a difference in morbidity. Experts believe that this test has many false
    positives and even when it finds cancer, the jury is still out as to whether or not we catch it soon
    enough to make a difference given the treatment outcomes. It is our hope and expectation,
    however, that in prostate screening and research should lead to lower mortality rates in the future,
