TEXT:
As you may have heard by now, the House passed the Human Services
Reauthorization bill Monday night, including the IDA demonstration, along
with Head Start, CSBG, and LIHEAP. There are no major differences between
the IDA provisions in House and Senate bills.   The objectionable Head
Start amendments were dropped.  It's not clear when conference will take
place but there's interest in getting this done soon. The bill authorizes
$25 M annually, but there's a problem with the pay for right now.   The
Senate Labor/HHS bill earmarks $10 M of HHS' welfare reform research
funds.  When combined with other cuts, this takes the research funding $22
million below our request and $17 M below FY98.    We understand OMB has
begun some initial thinking about alternative offsets (including the WTW
funds available because 6 states didn't request formula grants this
year).  We'll need to have more discussion about the funding issues, but
just wanted to give you a heads up.
