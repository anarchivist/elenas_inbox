SUBJECT:           LEGISLATIVE REPORT


Stevens and Byrd late today introduced a bill to disapprove 36 of the 38
Mil Con item vetoes.   The disapproval bill covers all the cancellations
except for #31 (aviation support facility in S. Dakota) and #41 (an aerial
port training facility in Wisconsin) .  Earlier in the afternoon, Stevens
and Byrd chaired an appropriations hearing where Senators expressed their
opposition to the cancellations and questioned witnesses from the Army,
Navy and Air Force regarding the various items.

senators Gramm, Byrd, Warner and Baucus announced their intention today to
offer an amendment to the highway bill (following the recess) to increase
contract authority oy $31 billion over the 6 years.   Domenici has stated
his intention to raise a 60-vote budget point of order, but itO,s unclear
if Domenici has 41 votes to sustain the point of order.

House Budget Committee Ranking Member Spratt hosted a briefing today on
the FY 1997 deficit number for Committee Democrats, interested public and
press. CBO Director O'Neill and Bob Reischauer of Brookings Institution
spoke and answered questions. The event was designed to underscore the
benefits OBRA 1993 has had on the deficit and overall economy and to give
credit to the law's supporters.

The House and Senate are in recess until Monday, October 20th.
