                  Md. Mortgage Co. Disputes Clinton


                  Filed at 5:43 a.m. EST

                  By The Associated Press

                  COLUMBIA, Md. (AP) -- A mortgage company is disputing an
                  announcement by the Clinton administration that it has agreed to
a $6.5
                  billion settlement of discrimination accusations.

                  The head of Columbia National Inc. denied that the company, the
                  Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Fort worth
                  Human Relations Commission reached a settlement.

 .'
             Chief Executive Officer Dave Gallitano said the only agreement
with HUD
             is to continue the company's mission to bring home mortgage
loans to
             low-to-moderate income families.

             "The statements released by the White House and HUD are
inaccurate
             and very misleading, "   Gallitano said in a statement.

             Columbia National was accused of violating the Fair Housing Act
by
             making too few loans to minority or low-to-moderate income
families.

             President Clinton announced the settlement Monday in a tribute
to Martin
             Luther King Jr., saying the Columbia, Md.-based lender agreed to
make
             $6 billion in horne mortgage loans available over five years to
minorities
             and low- to moderate-income families in 28 states.

             The company also will spend $529 million on programs designed to
             increase home ownership among minority and poor families, the
president
             said.

          But Columbia National said the $6.5 billion figure actually
represent the
          "volume of loans we made over the past five years."   It said it
was told
          HUD had made no finding of discrimination.
