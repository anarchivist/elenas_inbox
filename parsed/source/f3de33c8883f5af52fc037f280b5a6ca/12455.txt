 XP\     P6Q Health Care Bicameral Democrats Meeting on Medicare Reform:o On Wed
nesday, Congressman Gephardt hosted a meeting between House Democrats (e.g., Di
ngell, Rangell, Stark, Waxman, Pomeroy) and Senate moderate Democrats (e.g., Br
eaux, Conrad, Graham, Lieberman) to discuss Medicare reform. The Democratic Le
adership arranged this meeting in order for Members to understand the conflicti
ng positions held by the Democrats in the Congress on Medicare reforms.  Senato
r Daschle wanted to make certain the House Democrats understood the strongly he
ld position in the Senate that a viable reform proposal needs to be crafted; Co
ngressman Gephardt wanted Senate Democrats to understand what he and his Member
s feel are the political and policy implications of pursuing what they feel to
be "flawed" Medicare policy. Although the meeting was a bit confrontational, i
t was viewed by most attendees as constructive.   At the conclusion of the meet
ing and in response to a suggestion by Senator Lieberman, Congressman Gephardt
proposed that key Democrats from both Houses start working together ! along wit
h the White House on some alternative competitive models for the program to de
termine if a consensus around one approach could be achieved. While encouraged
 by this development, we are still analyzing how to be responsive to the reques
t without constraining your options and/or risking problematic leaks.

oHealth Care New Older Women's League Report on Importance of Medicare to Wome
n: DOn Monday, the Vice President will join the Older Women's League (OWL) in
releasing a new report on the disproportionate dependence women have on the Med
icare program. The report will document that threefifths of the Medicare popul


ation at age 65 are women and, that by age 85, women outnumber men in the progr
am by a two to one ratio.  It will also highlight how much income older women s
pend on health care (27 percent of their income by age 85), the number of chron
ic illnesses older women face (three out of four have two or more chronic condi
tions), the degree to which they rely on prescription drugs (8 out of 10 are pr
escribed medications regularly and the majority of their costs are paid outofpo
cket.), and how much longer they live than men (79 versus 73). At the event, 0
WL will indicate its support for the approach the Administration is taking to a
ddress the challenges facing Medicare. In particular, they will commend you for
 your Medicare surplus dedication proposal, your commitment to expand access to
 affordable prescription drug coverage, and will strongly support your oppositi
on to increasing the eligibility age without any policy that assures it does no
t lead to more uninsured Americans. Along these lines, they will reiterate the
ir support for your Medicare buyin proposal.

 xP\     P6Q DHealth Care First Lady Launches Asthma Screening Program at Local S
chaol: DOn Tuesday, the First Lady will visit Draper Elementary School in Wash
ington DC to participate in the launch of a new asthma screening program being
conducted by the American College of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology. This new
program will screen thousands of children nationwide throughout the year to ide
ntify children with asthma and educate their parents about the disease in order
 to ensure they receive treatment. The First Lady will also announce that the A
dministration will submit to Congress legislation for a new, $68 million initia
tive to fight childhood asthma. This initiative includes new efforts to: (1) im
plement school based programs that teach children how to effectively manage the
ir asthma; (2) invest in research to determine environmental causes of asthma a
nd to develop new strategies to reduce childrens exposure to asthma triggers; (
3) provide funds to states and provid·ers to help them implement effective disea
se management strategies that will insure we lower hospitalizations, emergency
room visits and deaths from asthma; and (4) conduct a new public information ca
mpaign to reduce exposure to dust mites and other asthma triggers, such as toba
cco smoke.

DHealth Care Senate Finance Committee Holds Hearing and Praises the CHIP Progr
am: DOn Thursday, the Senate Finance Committee held a hearing to discuss the pr
ogress that HCFA has made in implementing the new Childrens Health Insurance Pr
ogram. The feedback from members was extremely positive; Senator Roth opened th
e hearing by stating that the members were there to focus on a success story.
 In her testimony, Nancy Ann Min DeParle stated that during the first year of i
mplementation, the program has enrolled almost 1 million children and is on tar
get to enroll 2.5 million children in CHIP by the year 2000, a strong first ste
p towards our goal of covering an additional 5 million children through both Me
dicaid and CHIP. She also noted that the new toll free number for childrens hea
lth outreach, 1877 KIDS NOW, which you and the First Lady launched in February,
 has already received over 40,000 calls from families interested in learning ab
out available free or low cost health insurance options for their children.  wi
tnesses from the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities and state Medicaid dep
artments also praised the Administration for its implementation of the program
and its interest in initiating and sustaining outreach efforts

    xP\ P6Q DDrugs Arrestee Drug Use: D On Thursday, the Department of Justic
e's National Institute of Justice released its 1998 report on arrestee drug use
 patterns. Some of the key findings of the study include:

x'      hp x (#'        hp x (#(1) Cocaine.  Cocaine use declined among adult male a
s, but remains the most commonly found drug for female arrestees.   Though coca
ine use appears to be stabilizing, in 19 of the 35 ADAM sites, at least onethir
d of all adult males tested positive for cocaine.

(2)   Methamphetamine.   High rates of methamphetamine use remained largely confi


ned to Western cities.  In San Diego, Las Vegas, Spokane, and Sacramento, and S
alt Lake City, over 20 percent of both male and female arrestees tested positiv
e for meth.
        hp x (#'        hp x (#
        hp x (#'        hp x (#(3) Opiates. Opiate use remained stable and geograph
idespread. Nearly 70 percent of confirmed heroin users also test positive for
cocaine, indicating problem of abuse of mUltiple drugs.

 (4) Marijuana. Marijuana is the most commonly found drug in test results among
  male arrestees and its use is concentrated among younger arrestees, particular
ly young males.
         hp x (#'        hp x (#
         hp x (#'        hp x (#(5) Young offenders (ages 1520).    Marijuana is the p
rug used by juvenile arrestees. On average, more than half of juvenile males t
ested positive for marijuana. While opiate use remains very low among juvenile
  arrestees, significant increases in heroin use were found in New Orleans, Phil
adelphia, and St. Louis.

Tobacco -- FDA Rule:D This week the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear the Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) tobacco case. Arguments are expected to be heard
  this fall, with a decision likely sometime next spring. As you will recall, i
n 1997 the district court upheld the FDAs authority to regulate tobacco product
s, but found the statute did not permit the agency to regulate tobacco advertis
ing. Last August, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals struck down the district
  court ruling, finding the FDA did not have authority to regulate tobacco produ
cts. The Solicitor General filed a petition seeking Supreme Court review, argu
ing that Congress clearly gave the FDA the authority to regulate drugs and devi
ces and that based on scientific evidence presented in the rule, the FDA made a
  reasonable interpretation that tobacco products meet the statutory definition
of a product intended to affect the structure or any function of the body.     Th
irty-nine states filed an amicus brief supporting the Administrations position.
   On the day of the Supreme Court announcement, we issued a statement praising
the court decision and reaffirming your commitment to the rule. While this matt
er is pending in the courts, only parts of the rule are in effect.   Retailers m
ust check photo identification of any tobacco purchaser who appears to be under
  the age of 27 or risk fines. Not in effect are the rules provisions designed
to limit minors access to cigarettes sold in vending machines or the rules limi
ts on advertising and marketing which appeal to minors.   In an unrelated event
this week, The New York Times announced it will no longer run advertisements fo
r tobacco products, the first ban for a national newspaper.

StyleODTobacco -- Recoupment Issue:D On Thursday the Campaign for Tobacco Free
Kids and the American Heart Association issued a report we mentioned earlier hi
ghlighting how few states are investing the tobacco state settlement into meani
ngful youth tobacco prevention programs. The report found XP\    P6Q in recent m
onths only four states have decided to use settlement funds to reduce youth smo
king, for a total of nine California, Florida, Maryland, Massachusetts, Montan
a, Oregon, Virginia, Washington.  There are 25 states in which there is no prop
osal being seriously considered to guarantee the use of a substantial portion 0
f the settlement funds for programs to reduce tobacco use among children.  We i
ssued a statement expressing XP\         P6Q disappointment that few states are dey
ing funds to youth tobacco prevention programs and citing the report as support
~   ..
          for our recoupment position.  Since the supplemental appropriations process ha
         s been delayed, governors seem to be increasingly nervous that the HutchisonBli
         ley amendment wont be enacted, but have not yet been willing to support any alt
         ernatives. We are having quiet conversations with the states and on the Hill i
         n an attempt to resolve this impasse.

         DEducation ! School Construction: 0 On Tuesday, Congressman Rangel plans to int
         roduce his school construction legislation. The measure currently has about 85
          Democratic cosponsors'. Rep. Gephardt's office has indicated that they would 1
         ike to do some type of White House event with you on Tuesday to mark the introd
         uction of this bill, however you are apparently scheduled for foreign travel on
          that day.  Rangel's proposal which refiects your school modernization initiat
         ive   would make nearly $25 billion in bonds available to states and districts
         over the next two years to build and modernize up to 6,000 public schools.

         DEducation ClassSize Study. 0 On April 29 at the National Press Club, Secretar
         y Riley, Senator Patty Murray, the NEA, and other leaders announced the most re
         cent findings of Project STAR the Tennessee study that has tracked the perform
         ance of a control group of students against others who were in smaller classes
         in grades K3.  preliminary findings show that students who were in smaller clas
         ses in the early grades had better highschool graduation rates, higher grade po
         int averages, and are more likely to attend college.
