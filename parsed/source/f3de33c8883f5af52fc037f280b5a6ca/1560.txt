TEXT:
We've had a chance to review the one page HHS privatization paper on
principles and USDA's two drafts of a letter to Texas.  We understand that
HHS also has drafted a letter, but we haven't seen that yet.  Also, USDA
is planning on revising their letter for a second time.

Two things jump out at us.

First, the HHS paper and the USDA letter leave us with the impression that
the agencies are willing to allow the up front "intial application
processing" to be privatized through the interview.  The final decision
would be made by a State employee.  This is based on the Medicaid model
which only allows the initial application work to be contracted out.   That
represents a significant amount of the Medicaid work since there is not as
much on-going certification in Medicaid as in Food Stamps or AFDC/TANF.
The USDA letter mirrors the HHS paper and therefore only applies to the
up-front work, leaving out a significant amount of the work which is
typically performed by an eligiblity worker through frequent on-going
contact with the household.  It was rather clever on their part, but I
think the State might not react well.  I don't think they were trying to
put anything past us; instead, this oversight indicates that there is
still some miscommunication regarding what functions should be priva


tized.  For instance, in the meeting held earlier this week, B. Vladek was
talking about privatizing much the same Elena has talked about it, i.e.
through and including the interview.   K. Thurm was using a vocabulary
which indicated a position much more akin to USDA's which says that the
interview has too much discretionary decision making to be privatized.
The paper is a slightly different take from both of those views because it
would only privatize up-front application work rather than the ongoing
work over the months and years to determine if the individual maintains
their eligibility.   (Perhaps the HHS letter is different, but I'm assuming
that it follows the paper.)

Barry, in his role as Ken this week, believes that the players should sit
down one more time to go over exactly what we all mean by "initial
processing", "decision making" and "certification" before HHS makes a call
to the State and certainly before any paper or letters are shared with the
State. We should be very clear on what we all mean so that we give
consistent responses to the State -- because they will ask questions.

Second, both the HHS paper and the USDA letter are rather technical. They
don't address the broadbased principles which Raines and Koskinen feel
should apply to any privatization initiative:  improved program
performance, improved financial integrity and improved cost
effectiveness. A whole range of issue are captured under these umbrella
terms such as quality control, recipient access to benefits, the role of
current state employees, etc. We know that we owe you language, but its
not clear that the letters as written are appropriate for this kind of
discussion. That's a problem easily solved, but again we probably need to
sit down and make sure we are all on the same page with regards to
process. Also, as Barry mentioned in his e-mail both letters should be
reviewed by Labor and OPM.

I don't think Ken will be back until mid-week. We'd prefer to wait for
him, but we and Barry can meet before than if time dictates that this
process move more quickly.

I'll be out next week.   Please contact Barry or Jeff if you have any
questions.
