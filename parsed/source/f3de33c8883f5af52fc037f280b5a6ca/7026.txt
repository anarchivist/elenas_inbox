TEXT:
Elena,
I spoke with Peter and Earl Grohl from Labor this morning. As I mentioned
yesterday, Lamar Smith (Chair of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on
Immigration) has asked the DOL to appear at a hearing on H1B visas on
April 21st. According to Peter, Smith and Mel Watt (ranking member) are
working on a bi-partisan bill that they will introduce soon after the
hearing. According to Smith's staffer (George Fishman), they want to
include the "recruit and retain" and "no lay-off" provisions, modeled
after what is in the Kennedy bill.   Fishman has asked Peter for a signal
of what in Kennedy's bill is important to the Administration.

Smith's bill may also include a provision that would require any person
entering under the family unification program to have a high school
diploma. This is a whole other can of worms that we likely do not want to
grapple with at the same time.

Peter has not had a conversation with Smith's staffer reo training.  He
plans to get with Gerry to have that conversation. However, Peter thinks
that Kennedy may not include H1B reforms in his bill (compromising with
Abraham), and thus our priority should be to ensure that there are H1B
reforms included in the House bill, and then work out a compromise with
the Sen. version later.  Peter plans to speak again with Kennedy and
Abraham to push for the reforms.

Julie
