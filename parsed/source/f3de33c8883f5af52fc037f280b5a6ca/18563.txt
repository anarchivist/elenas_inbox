        Q:   Doesn't this mean that many of the policy proposals you've announced simply may
             not happen if there isn't tobacco legislation?

        A:   No. As we've said all along, our budget proposal makes clear that these proposals
             can be fully paid for within the context of a balanced budget. Our budget assumes
             that Congress will pass tobacco legislation, and we believe that this is a realistic
             assumption. The budget we are sending to Congress includes a number of
             proposals to pay for our new initiatives -- including tax proposals and spending
             offsets. Of course, no offset proposed in a budget is guaranteed; Congress can
             reject any proposed way of rmancing a progr~m. If Congress does not pass
             comprehensive tobacco legislation, we will work with Congress to find other offsets.
              This is a high Administration priority, and we will find an effective funding
             mechanism.

        Q:   Why are some ofthe President's key priorities funded with tobacco money? Isn't
             this just a ploy to increase pressure on Congress to pass tobacco legislation? What
             is the Administration going to do if Congress doesn't pass a bill this year?

        A:   First, let's remember that every initiative in our budget submission, including these,
             are paid for within the context of a balanced budget. The President is committed to
             that goal, and we'll simply find other offsets to support our key priorities if
             necessary. That's what happens in the budget process every year.

             But we expect Congress to pass tobacco legislation -- it has bipartisan support. So
             does funding for the NIH, and so does child care. We believe we're going to be able
             to work with Congress to pass these important initiatives.
