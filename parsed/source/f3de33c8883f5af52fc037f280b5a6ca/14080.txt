PRINTER FONT 12- POINT- ROMAN
Unless I hear otherwise by 3:00 P.M. today September 16, 1996, I
will assume you have no objection to LRM
o
-5584, dated 9/13/96.
The LRM asked for comments on the draft SAP supporting H.R. 3676,
the Carjacking Corrections Act .

If you (1)  need another copy of the LRM, (2) intend to comment
but need more time, or (3) have provided comments that I may have
overlooked, please let me know by answering this E
o
-mail.

Thanks,

Ron Jones
