TEXT:
Stephanopoulos and McCurry held a summit and came up with the
following scenario for the veto of HR 1833
1.      The President holds a private meeting with the two women.
They tell him their stories. He signs the veto in their presence.
2.      The two women proceed into the Oval Office with the
President, tell their stories to the pool, the President says,
"And that is the reason I have vetoed HR 1833."
3.      The women depart to do press at their hotels, etc. No
stakeout.
If you have any questions about this, please give me a call.
