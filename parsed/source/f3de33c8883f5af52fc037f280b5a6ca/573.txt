TEXT:
Although resolving the bifurcation issue should probably be our
top priority this week (see the letter from NGA/NCSL/APWA), here
are 2 unresolved welfare issues we are letting languish:
1.  Allor none:     HHS prefers the "all or l"!one" position to the
"pick and choose" position, and is waiting to hear from us.      I
believe everyone here except Ken prefers "pick and choose." We
need to resolve this, since states are making these choices.       Ken
and Chris were supposed to have a conversation to compare
approaches here ... has that happened?
2.  Cost neutrality for child support pass-through waivers: we
are waiting to hear from OMB on this one. HHS's position is that
states that pass along the benefits to families should be allowed
to continue their waivers, while those that don't should not.
Other issues:
        On bifurcation, HHS will give us paper very soon; we need
to know our position. NGA is pressing hard to resolve this before
its meeting.
        We need to sort out what we've done on the bucket
budget-wise -- I think the budget essentially decided this.
        We need a decision on a day for children's SSI -- Ken and I
think it has to be the end of this week or the beginning of next
because of Chater's departure on 1/31.
        FYI, we are planning to meet w/NGA/NCSL/APWA tomorrow at 1
after a long hiatus.    Should be a pleasant discussion of
bifurcation.
