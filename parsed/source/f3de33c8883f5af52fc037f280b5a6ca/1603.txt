 TEXT:
·As I mentioned, Bill Schultz asked if we could push off Thursday's meeting
 for 2 more weeks.  He doesn't think they have anything new to say but will
 have more in 2 weeks.  I said no -- we should at least talk.  He finally
 agreed.  He warned me, however, that Bill Corr is likely to call you and
 ask that we either delay the meeting or, for convenience, do by conference
 call (which I think is fine).  FYI Schultz is also pushing his staff to
 get the reg ready.
