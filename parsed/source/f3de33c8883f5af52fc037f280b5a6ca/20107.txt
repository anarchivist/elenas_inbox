TEXT:
FYI, Paul Begala will be calling a meeting Wednesday to discuss the
message events for the week of June 15.  Since it's the last week before
the China trip, your friends in the Scheduling Office are hoping to be
very deliberate about how he spends his time.   I wanted to give you all a
heads up about this meeting, so you can be thinking about what you think
makes sense.

I am not sure what time the meeting is, I believe Stacie Parker will be
following up with you directly on that.

thanks.
