TEXT:
Jackie Lawing (sp) from HUD called, and suggested that Secretary Cuomo be
on the President's panel discussion.  I would suggest not --for several
reasons including time constraints and the fact that we do not have a
panelist representing the housing issue.  Do you want me to call them or
will you?
