     Today's PRIDE survey shows that American families can impact adolescents' attitudes and
     behaviors when it comes to drugs. This is a small step in the right direction. But we must all
     continue to warn our youth that drugs are wrong; that drugs are dangerous; and that drugs can kill
     you. That is why in the coming months, we will take our anti-drug media campaign nationwide,
     fund more community anti-drug coalitions, and work to enact our long-term drug strategy.
     These and other steps will help us t,o reach our ultimate goal -- cutting teen drug use in half.
