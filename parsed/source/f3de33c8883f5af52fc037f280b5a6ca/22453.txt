TEXT:


The LA Times appears to have not run the story on the Vice President's
announcement of additional ESL funds (which is the last Q&A of the
attached) but I understand the VP will still be announcing the policy
today in California, along with the legal immigrant benefits story which
made the NY Times.

Thus you may want to' change the question to

Is todayO,s Los Angeles Times correct in reporting that the Vice President
will announce today that the AdministrationO,s budget will include
additional funding for English as a second language instruction?

                                     Welfare-to-Work Q&As
                                       January 25, 1999

Q:   What is the President announcing today?

A:   With welfare caseloads down by nearly half since 1993 and over 10,000 companies committed to
     welfare-to-work, President Clinton will announce today a new package of initiatives designed to
     ensure that those remaining on the welfare rolls make a successful transition from welfare to
     work, with a new focus on increasing the employment oflow-income fathers so they can support
     their children. The President's $1 billion Welfare-to-Work initiative will help 200,000 more
     people go to work. At least $150 million will go toward helping fathers fulfill their
     responsibilities to their children by working and paying child support. Remaining funds will
     focus on long-term welfare recipients with the greatest challenges to employment. The
     President also will announce today that his budget will contain new welfare-to-work housing
     vouchers, transportation funds, and tax credits to help those on welfare get to work and stay
     employed. Taken together, these initiatives will provide parents the.tools they need to support
     their children and succeed in the workforce.

Q:   Is the rate of caseload decline beginning to slow? And to what extent is the caseload
     decline related to the economy and to people going to work?

A:   Today the President will release state-by-state data showing that welfare caseloads are at their
     lowest level in 30 years and that the welfare rolls have fallen by nearly half since he took office.
     Since January 1993, 36 states have had caseload declines of more than 40 percent and nationwide
     the rolls have fallen by 44 percent, from 14.1 million to just below 8 million. The rate of
     decline is almost exactly the same as it was a year ago. For example, between January and
     September of 1997, caseloads declined 14 percent; between January and September of 1998, they
     declined 13 percent. Because the number of people on welfare has fallen dramatically, the same
     percentage decline in 1998 obviously represents fewer people than it did in 1997, but the rate of
     decline has not slowed.

     The AP reported that the rate of caseload decline is slowing in some states. Weare watching
     this trend closely, but it is too early to determine whether or not this represents a significant
     pattern. We do not find it terribly surprising that the rate of decline may be slowing in states
     who have reduced their caseloads dramatically over the past few years and are now working with
     those who have the greatest challenges to employment. That is exactly why we need to make
     this additional investment in helping those who remain on the rolls move into jobs and to ensure
     that those who have gone to work succeed in their jobs.

     Only some of this caseload decline can be attributed to the economy. In a study published in
     May 1997, which only looked at caseload trends from 1993 - 1996, the Council of Economic
     Advisers attributed 44 percent of the caseload decline to the strong economy and about one-third
     of the decline to state welfare reform waivers the Administration granted to states to change their
     welfare reform policies. More recent analysis by CEA finds that only 20 percent of the decline
     in caseloads between 1994 and 1998 can be explained by economic conditions and only 8 percent
     of the decline since 1996 can be accounted for by the economy.

                                                - 1-
                                   Hex-Dump Conversion

     Recent information released by the Department of Health and Human Services shows that more
     welfare recipients are working and more people are leaving welfare for work. The percentage of
     welfare recipients working has tripled since 1992, an estimated 1.5 million people who were on
     welfare in 1997 were working in 1998, and that all states met the first overall work participation
     rates required under the welfare reform law.


Q:   Why is the President seeking more Welfare-to-Work money when states aren't spending all
     their welfare block grant (TANF) funds?

A:   These additional Welfare-to-Work funds will ensure the hardest-to-employ welfare recipients
     living in the highest poverty areas get the help they need to get jobs and succeed in the work
     place. Those remaining on the welfare rolls often face the greatest challenges such as limited
     English proficiency, substance abuse, or a disability which requires more intensive commitment
     of resources. The funds will also ensure both parents contribute to their children's support, by
     focusing a minimum of$150 million on increasing the employment oflow-income fathers so
     they can pay more ch!ld support.

Q:   Couldn't TANF funds be used for these purposes?

A:   Welfare-to-Work funds can achieve thesepurposes more directly. For example, most
     Welfare-to-Work funds flow automatically through the states to communities with the greatest
     needs (those with highest poverty levels, most long-tenn welfare recipients, and highest
     unemployment). Many states, faced with additional T ANF funds due to unexpected caseload
     declines, need to get T ANF funds reappropriated in order to direct additional funds to the
     neediest individuals. Since state T ANF block grant levels are fixed, some states may wish to
     reserve these additional T ANF funds for "rainy day funds" when additional funds may be needed
     due to popul,ation increases or regional recession.

     Similarly, Welfare-to-Work funds can be used to employ non-custodial parents of children on
     welfare without additional changes to a state'sTANF plan. Often under state law the
     noncustodial parents of children on welfare are ineligible under TANF, which usually focuses on
     the custodial parent. Many states would need to redefine, probably in state statute, their
     definition of an eligible T ANF family in order to serve noncustodial parents with T ANF funds.

Q:   Why aren't states spending their TANF funds more quickly?

A:   The most recent data reported by the states to the Department of Health and Human Services
     show that by the 3rd quarter ofFY 1998, states had obligated about three-quarters ofTANF
     funds available to them in the October 1997-June 1998 period. HHS expects future data to
     show a substantial increase in spending commitments because 1) states will have had the
     opportunity to appropriate these additional funds, which they did not initially plan for because
     they did not expect such large caseload declines; 2) state policy decisions made in early 1998 will
     now be implemented, resulting in additional expenditures. HHS expects states to leave some
     T ANF funds unspent, leaving them in the federal treasury for a "rainy day" when additional
     funds may be needed due to population increases or a regional recession.

Q:   Aren't some states already using Welfare-to-Work funds to employ fathers? What's new
     about the President's proposal?

A:   Today, Governor Carnahan of Missouri will describe how his state has successfully used
     Welfare-to-Work funds to help low-income fathers increase their employment so they can
     support their children. Missouri is one of several states (along with Wisconsin and Michigan)
     that designated all or most of their FY 1998 Welfare-to-Work funds for noncustodial parents of
     children on welfare (some other states used a portion of their funds for this purpose). Because
     of the success these states have had, the President proposes to require every state to spend at least
     20 percent of its funds to help low-income fathers work and pay child support ..

Q:   How is what you are proposing for fathers different from Congressman Clay Shaw's bill
     introduced last session?

A:   We believe our proposal is consistent with Congressman Shaw's goal of encouraging states and
     communities to help fathers become more involved in their children's lives, but our proposal is
     somewhat more targeted on low income fathers with children on welfare, and builds upon an
     existing program instead of creating a whole new program. (Our proposal would require states
     to spend at least 20 percent of their Welfare-to-Work funds, or at least $150 million, to help low
     income fathers work and pay child support will also help fathers get involved with their children.
      Congressman Shaw's bill established a separate block grant for states to fund projects that
     encourage fathers to marry, be better parents, and increase their employment and earnings. He
     proposed $2 billion over 5 years, with $200 million in the first year, and targeted 80 percent of
     the funds to fathers with incomes below the state or local average.)

                                   Hex-Dump Conversion

Q:   Why are you proposing additional funds for fathers employment programs when the recent
     evaluation of the Parents' Fair Share demonstration showed disappointing results?

A:   Our proposal builds on the lessons of Parents' Fair Share. The evaluation showed that the
     demonstration succeeded in increasing the fathers' child support payments, but did not have
     significant impacts on employment and earnings. One of the lessons from the study was the
     importance of building stronger links to employment services for these fathers, many of whom
     do work but only in intermittent and low-paid jobs. Our proposal does this by providing fathers
     employment funds through the workforce system (former Private Industry Councils, now known
     as Workforce Investment Boards) whose core mission is to help people get and keep good jobs.
     These workforces boards will be required to work closely with state and local child support
     offices to ensure fathers meet their child support obligations, which, as a result of the 1996
     welfare law, are much tougher than those in place during the Parents' Fair Share demonstration.

Q:   The President said in the State of the Union that this additional $1 billion would help an
     additional 200,000 people go to work. ' How was that figure arrived at?

A:   The figure is based on a total of $1.3 billion ($982 M in federal funds that flow to states and
     communities, allocation to tribes, and competitive grants -- excluding those funds used for
     evaluation and technical assistance -- plus $357 M state match required for the formula funds)
     and assumes an estimated cost of $6,500 per individual served. The 200,000 people includes
     approximately 170,000 hard-to-serve welfare recipients and 30,000 low income fathers
     (assuming that every state spends 20 percent of their formula funds, or $150 M, plus match on
     fathers and assuming the same average costs).


Q:   DO,es the $1 billion you are proposing go the Welfare to Work Partnership?

A:   No. The $1 billion Welfare-to-Work grant program administered by the Department of Labor
     provides formula awards to states and communities and competitive grants to innovative
     governmental and non-governmental efforts to help long-term, hard to employ welfare recipients
     and non-custodial parents obtain lasting unsubsidized employment.

     The Welfare to Work Partnership is a private entity consisting of 10,000 businesses committed to
     hiring from the welfare rolls. Today, Fleet Bank President and Chief Operating Officer Robert
     Higgins will describe how his company, a member of the Welfare to Work Partnership, is hiring,
     retaining, and promoting welfare recipients (the bank hired over 800 in 1998 alone, representing
     about 7.5 percent of the bank's new hires.)

     Many Welfare to Work Partnership companies, like Fleet, work closely with local Private
     Industry Councils and non-profit agencies who receive Welfare-to-Work funds. For example,
     the Northern Rhode Island Private Industry Council identified welfare recipients and helped train
     them for jobs at Fleet's Lincoln Rhode Island Financial Services Call Center.

Q:   What is the Administration doing this year on housing and transportation for people
     moving from welfare to work?

                                                -4-
                                  Hex-Damp Conversion

A:   Today, the President will announce that his new budget will provide $430 million for 75,000
     welfare-to-work housing vouchers, including $144 million in new funds for 25,000 additional
     vouchers, and willincrease Access to Jobs transportation funding from $75 million to $150
     million.

     We're pleased that Congress fully funded the President's FY 1999 request for $283 million to
     provide 50,000 welfare-to-work housing vouchers -- the first new housing vouchers approved in
     five years. This week, HUD will announce the grant competition so local housing authorities,
     working in partnership with organizations responsible for welfare reform and Welfare-to-Work,
     can apply for these new vouchers to help families move closer to a job, reduce a long commute,
     or secure more stable housing that will help them get or keep a job. The TEA-21 transportation
     bill authorized up to $150 million annually for the President's Access to Jobs transportation
     initiative and the FY 99 budget appropriated $75 million for this first year. Secretary Slater
     announced the grant competition for these funds in late October, and is currently reviewing the
     proposals it received (which far exceed the funds available).

                                Hex-Dwnp Conversion

Q:   Is some of the caseload decline the President will be announcing due to new Food Stamp
     work rules that were added to the 1996 law by Rep. John Kasich? An article in
     yesterday's Washington Times says the work rule moved 700,000 off welfare.

A:   No. The President's announcement that welfare caseload have declined by nearly half since he
     took office and 35 percent since 1996 refers to the decline in people on TANF (fonnerly AFDC).
      The Washington Times story is referring to work rules put in place in 1996 for able-bodied
     Food Stamp recipients without dependents, who in 1998 comprised 3 percent of the Food Stamp
     caseload. The Times' headline that the work rule moved 700,000 people off welfare is actually
     not a conclusion reached by the General Accounting Office study cited in the story. That study
     found that in 1998 in the 42 states for which they could obtain data, there were 514,000
     able-bodied Food Stamp recipients without dependents and in 1995 in all 50 states there were 1.3
     million such individuals on Food Stamps. However, it is somewhat misleading to conclude that
     therefore the work rule resulted in 700,000 people leaving the rolls for work because 1) the
     700,00 difference would be lower if we had 1998 data for all 50 states; and 2) there are other
     reasons why people leave the Food Stamp rolls, including the growing economy.

Q:   Does the Administration support requiring able-bodied Food Stamp recipients without
     dependents to work 20 hours a week?

A:   The President believes able-bodied individuals on Food Stamps should work or perform
     workfare, but those who are unable to get jobs should not lose their Food Stamps. In
     his FY '98 budget, the President proposed changes to this provision to make it more fair
     to people who want to work but can't find jobs, including additional funds to provide
     workfare and training opportunities for individuals facing the Food Stamp time limit
     (which allows able-bodied individuals without dependents to receive Food Stamps for
     only 3 months in 36 if they are not working 20 hours a week). The Balanced Budget Act
     did increase the amount of funds available for this purpose and provide some additional
     flexibility to states to exempt individuals from these requirements.

Q:   Is today's New York Times correct in saying the President's budget will propose to restore
     certain benefits to legal immigrants?

A:   Yes. The Vice President is announcing today in San Francisco that the Administration's FY
     2000 budget will restore important disability, health, and nutrition benefits to additional
     categories of legal immigrants, at a cost of $1.3 billion over five years. This proposal will build
     upon the Administration's success in the Balanced Budget Act and the Agricultural Research Act
     in restoring eligibility for Medicaid, SSI, and Food Stamps to hundreds of thousands oflegal
     immigrants. Upon signing the 1996 welfare law, the President vowed to reverse unnecessary
     cuts in benefits to legal immigrants that had nothing to do with the goal of moving people from
     welfare to work.

Q:   Is today's Los Angeles Times correct in reporting that the Administration's budget will
      include additional funding for English as a second language instruction?

A:   Yes. The Vice President is announcing today that the President's new budget will include a $70
     . million initiative to help states and communities provide expanded access to high quality
       English language proficiency instruction, linked to practical instruction in civics and life skills
       including how to navigate the workplace, public education system, and other essentials. This
       initiative is designed both to help meet the extraordinary demand for English and civics
       instruction in immigrant communities and to demonstrate our shared commitment to fully
       integrating new Americans into our social and civic life. States, community-based
       organizations, local education agencies, and other non-profits will compete for grants to support
       English proficiency and civics instruction. With $70 million, the initiative will be able to
       provide English language and civics instruction to approximately 150,000 people in FY 2000.
