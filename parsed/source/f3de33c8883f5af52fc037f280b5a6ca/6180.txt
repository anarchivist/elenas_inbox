TEXT:
In his resignation letter to the President, Gene Ludwig offered the
following statistics on the impact of the Administration's 1993 reform of
the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA):

"Lending commitments under the CRA have increased IS-fold from the
pre-1993 era, from roughly $3 billion a year to $43 billion a year.    Thes
commitments represent new credit availability for low- and moderate-income
urban and rural communities, including loans for housing, small farms and
small businesses.  At the same time, equity investment by national banks
in community development corporations and projects were six times greter
in the last four years than during the previous 28 years combined.    Home
mortgages to African Americans and Hispanic Americans have increased more
than 50% over the last four years -- almost thre~ times the rate of
increase.for the population as a whole.  In some chronically underserved
communities the change has been even more dramatic .... moreover, we have
been able to achieve these results while substantially reducing the
supervisory and paperwork burdens that the CRA had previously imposed on
the banking industry."

This paragraph highlights what I maintain is still our most successful,
yet underpublicized community empowerment initiative.  It also, in my
mind, underscores the need for the President to give a major address which
ties what has been a successful strategy to reinvigorate America's cities
with his sizable package for urban America in his FY99 budget.
