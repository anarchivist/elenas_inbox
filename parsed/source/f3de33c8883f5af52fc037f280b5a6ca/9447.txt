TEXT:
It remains unclear whether the compromise bill is going to the House floor
today.  Peter spoke with Abraham last night to try to get him to pull the
bill from consideration today. We just (a few minutes ago) received a
copy of the legislative language, though Ceci said that it may be
incomplete.  I have put together a draft SAP that Peter is reviewing.
Once I get his comments, I will get it to you and Gene/Sally for review.
I have also spoken to OMB about trying to move this as quickly as possible
once we get your sign-off on the SAP and the final legislative language.
Thanks.

Julie
