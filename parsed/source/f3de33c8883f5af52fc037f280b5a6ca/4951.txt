TEXT:
I know it's the worst sort of bean-counting, but if you two agree, once we
have sign-off from on high about Julie's appt, could we include it in a
weekly item to the President, along with a line or two about our overall
diversity (30% minority, around 68% female, etc.)? The way Bob Nash's
office reports the figures (with DPC and OPD as separate entities), we'll
never get credit for our racial diversity. And the President should know
that while Administration-wide, the % of women appointees has dropped to
49% (lowest since we got here), the DPC is much more progressive.
