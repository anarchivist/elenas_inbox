TEXT:
Jim Dorskind recommended I consult with you on a letter POTUS has received
from Bishop pilla on late term abortion.   As a matter of background, he
has received numerous responses over the last year and a half on this
issue.  The l'atest language he got was on April 30.  He has now been sent
all the language I have at my disposal, so I'm at a loss as to what to say
next.  This current letter urges the POTUS to rethink his position based
on the recent American Medical Association support for the pending legisl
ation.  Please let me know how you think we should handle, given these
facts and that the legislation is now in Conference Committee.

Thanks,
Kyle Baker
