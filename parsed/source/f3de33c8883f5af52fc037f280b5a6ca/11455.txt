Q:     What Title I Report is being released today?

Today, the Department of Education released the Final Report of the National Assessment of
Title 1. The Title I program provides funds to high-poverty schools to give extra help to
disadvantaged students - those with the highest risk oflow academic performance. Prior
assessments of the program found that low-income students were often given watered-down
curicula and held to lower academic standards them other students. As a results of an overhaul
of Title I in the 1994 reauthorization ofthe Elementary and Secondary Education Act, states now
hold low-income students to the same high standards set for other students. In releasing this
report, the Depannent of Education is meeting its Congressionally-mandated responsibility to
examine the progress of students served through Title I and the implementation of the key
aspects of the re-formulated program.

Q:     What are the major findings of the National Assessment?

Improved achievement in high-poverty schools. The National Assessments shows that we are
seeing an increase in academic achievement for students in high-poverty schools, as states and
districts begin to implement reforms to hold students to the same high standards and hold schools
accountable for results. In reviewing how students in high-poverty schools perform on the 4th
grade math and reading National Assessment of Education Progress (NAEP) tests the
Assessment found:
         ·      National Reading Scores. Since 1992, reading scores for 9 year-olds in the
                highest poverty public schools has improved, reversing a downward trend and
                bringing scores back to late 1980s levels. An examination of the scores of the
                 lowest-acheiving 4th graders - those most likely to be served by Title I - showed
                that there were fairly substantial improvements in reading between 1994 and
                 1998.
         ·      National Math Scores. Since 1992, math scores have improved for 9 year olds in
                the highest-povery schools by almost one grade level. The lowest-achieving 4th
                grade students also showed substantial improvements in math scores.
         ·      State and Local Scores. Data reported by states and local districts show progress
                over three years in the percent of students in the highest-poverty schools that meet
                state and local standards in reading and math.

Substantial gap in performance between high-poverty and low-poverty schools. The Assessment
also points out that while the performance of students in high-poverty school is improving, the
percentage of these students meeting basic standards in reading and math still lags behind their
peers. In 1998, the percent of high-poverty 4th grade students who met the "basic" performance
level on the NAEP reading tests was about half the national rate. The Assessment also shows that
schools with high concentrations of poor students are most likely to be low-performing schools
and that states and districts face challenges in turning these failing schools around, that the
teachers in high-poverty schools report that they are not prepared to teach to high standards, and
that a significant number of Title I schools continue to allow non-certified aides to provide
classroom instruction.
                                                                                   Hex·Dump Conversion

Q:    How do the findings in the National Assessment relate to the President's
accountability proposal?

We need to stay the course charted by the Administration and Congress five years ago in the last
reauthorization of Title I to require all sudents to meet high acadmic standards and to hold
schools accountable for results.        This assessment clearly shows that.as states and districts
make progress in raising standards, students acheivement in high-poverty schools improves. But
we need to go further than we did in 1994. We need to take the education reforms that
some states and cities have shown produce results --turning around failing schools, phasing
out the use of unqualified teachers, ending social promotion and providing extra assistance
to help students meet high standards, --and spread those reforms throughout the nation.
The President will shortly send to Congress his Education Accountability Act, which will require
all states and school districts that receive federal funds to end social promotion, to insure that all
teachers are qualified; to turn around their lowest-performing schools; to provide parents with
annual report cards on school performance and to institute effective school discipline policies.
The President's proposal is designed to ensure that all our children benefit from these
proven and effective accountability measures. These proposals will help to lift student
achievement in every public school and close the opportunity gap by giving special
attention to disadvantaged students in low-performing schools.
