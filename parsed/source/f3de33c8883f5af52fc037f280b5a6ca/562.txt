TEXT:
Just so you know:  Texas does have a matter pending before USDA
and HHS, even though it's not a waiver.   The state is asking us to
share the costs of a new automated system, and such requests are
routinely reviewed by both agencies.  That's the hook that enables
the 2 agencies to say yea or nay on this.   Supposedly the agencies
are required to review the RFP's involved to make sure the new
system is cost-efficient, protects federal dollars, and is legal.
Hence the potential opportunity for them to say no on the grounds
that it violates the merit systems protection requirement.
