H.R. 4578 - Save Social Security Act of 1998
Rep. Archer (R) TX

H.R. 4578 violates the President's pledge to save Social Security first.
It calls for tens of billions of dollars to be drained out of projected
budget surpluses before any action has been taken to strengthen Social
Security for the long term or those surpluses happen.  The President
firmly believes that none of the projected surpluses should be touched
until the long-term solvency of Social Security has been fully secured.

The unique opportunity to save social Security must not be squandered.
The Administration, therefore, strongly opposes H.R. 4578. If the bill
were presented to the President in its current form, he would veto it.

This Statement of Administration Policy (SAP) was developed by the
Legislative Reference Division (Haskins) in consultation with Director
Lew, Associate Directors Chow and Minarik, Assistant Director Emery, EIML
(Smalligan/Sauer), OIRA (Chenok), BASD (Lind/Kilpatrick/ Locke), OMB-LA
(Konigsberg), and BRCD (Rea/Moran) as well as the White House Office of
Policy Development (Rice) and the National Economic Council
(Orszag/Marr/Liebman). The Departments of Health and Human Services
(Wallace), Justice (Jones), Labor (McCarthy), the Treasury (Dorsey) and
the Social Security Administration (Chesser) concur in this position.

OMB/LA clearance:


Background

In his January 27, 1998, State of the Union Address, the President
proposed that 100 percent of the Social Security surplus be reserved
"until we have taken all the necessary measures to strengthen the Social
Security System for the 21st century." He announced his schedule for
achieving social Security reform, inviting every American to participate
in the reform process.  The President called for nonpartisan regional
forums followed by a White House Conference on Social Security in December
1998.  In addition, the Pres·ident declared that he would convene the
leaders of Congress to draft "bipartisan" social Security reform
legislation in January 1999.

summary of H.R. 4578

H.R. 4578 was introduced on September 16, 1998, and ordered reported, as
amended, by the House Committee on ways and Means on September 17, 1998.

Within ten days of enactment, H.R. 4578 would require the Secretary of the
Treasury, in consultation with the OMB Director, to project the estimated
total Federal budget surplus during each of FYs 1998 through 2008.    At
the end of each of those fiscal years, the bill would require the Treasury
Department to transfer funds from the General Fund into a special reserve
account, the "Protect Social Security Account", an amount totaling 90
percent of the Federal budget surplus projected by the Department for that
period.   As under current law, the funds would be invested in
non-marketable securities.

H.R. 4578 would define "total" Federal budget to include all spending and
receipt accounts of the United States Government that are designated as
"on-budget" or "off-budget" accounts.

According to OMB's Budget Review Division:

                The 90 percent of the surplus for FYs 1998-2008 that is
to be transferred to the Treasury "Protect Social Security" account would
increase the debt subject-to-limit. Based on the estimates in the
Mid-Session Review, H.R. 4578 would require that the debt limit be raised
during the fall of 2000, two years earlier than under existing law.

                Other than raising the debt subject-to-limit, the
account has no effect on the budget totals and the "lock-box" does not
prevent the Government from spending more than ten percent of the surplus
for tax cuts or other purposes.

                The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that H.R.
4579, the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1998, would cost slightly more than ten
percent of the cumulative surpluses even before considering the additional
debt service costs associated with the tax cuts.  If the current surplus
projections were to be optimistic, the amounts available to protect Social
Security would be well below the ninety percent that H.R. 4578 would place
in reserve.

Pay-As-You-Go

According to the Income Maintenance Branch (Sauer), H.R. 4578 would not
affect direct spending or receipts; therefore, it is not subject to the
pay-as-you-go requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of
1990.
