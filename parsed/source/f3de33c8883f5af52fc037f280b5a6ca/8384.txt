Education and Training:
                                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion

Declare End to Reading Wars -- Announce Summit. The National Academy of Sciences
Report on "Preventing Reading Difficulties in Young Children" has been well-received across
the political spectrum, but it is not well-known. One possible event would be for you to respond
to the report by declaring an end to the reading wars -- the long-running fight between "phonics"
and "whole language" advocates. At one of the tutor training sessions being held across the
country over the summer, you could call for a September "Reading Summit" (already being
planned by Education). You could also put some flesh on the $3 billion Early Learning Fund in
the budget, perhaps calling it the Marshall Plan for the end of the Reading Wars.

DC Training Alliance. You could announce a Labor Department pilot program that would
give a $1.2 million planning grant (the "metro-tech grant") to the DC, MD, and VA job-training
systems to train workers to meet the demand in the high-tech industry in the DC, MD, and VA
area. The pilot program will fund 100 workers. There is an expectation that this pilot will lead
to a demonstration project serving 3,000 people at a cost of $17 million. This is. ready to be
announced anytime in the near future.

School Construction and Smaller Class Size Day. We could begin preparing now for a
back-to-school week day that would focus on school construction and smaller class sizes. We
could ask parents, volunteers, Members of Congress, and community leaders to join together to
help rebuild/renovate/modernize their local public school. You, the Vice President, Mrs.
Clinton, and Mrs. Gore could all participant in this construction effort. This would be a terrific
visual and would allow Members of Congress a chance to highlight this important issue for the
fall.

Report on Success of School-to-Work Program. A major study is expected to be released soon
on one of your signature programs of his first year in office, School-to-Work. If it is as positive
as hoped, and if the right-wing's opposition continues to be an issue, this might be an appropriate
time to take on the right-wing and further energize the business community in support of
Democrats' efforts. Weare not sure of the timing of this report. Moreover, our budget scales
back the school-to-work program (from $400 million to $250 million) as it sunsets according to
law.


Individual Development Accounts:

Endorse Coats-Harkin Bill. You could announce your endorsement of the Coats-Harkin IDA
demonstration bill in Congress. One possible event idea would be to go to a community
development bank and help a welfare recipient open a bank account -- this would allow us to
push for CDFI funding at the same time. Another idea would be to do a more simple Rose
Garden event with the sponsors of the bill and welfare recipients, and push this as part of our
welfare-to-work efforts.


Pensions:

Pensions Proposals. Your advisors have reached consensus on two pension proposals (in
                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion
addition to the proposals announced in January). The joint and two-thirds/three-quarters
survivor annuity proposal would increase benefits for some surviving spouses of pension plan
participants, while the other proposal, initially advanced by Rep. Price (D-NC), would allow
workers to count FMLA time toward pension vesting requirements. This would ensure that .
those (relatively few) workers close to the 1,OOO-hour minimum requirement for vesting do not
lose a year of vesting because of time taken off under FMLA. This can be billed as a women's
pension item.

Rural Agenda:

Rural Economic Development. There are several potential rural economic initiatives that the
Administration could roll out over the summer or fall. These focus in particular on education,
agriculture, housing, trade, and health care. We would work together on some of these and other
potential initiatives.

Rural Press ConferencelRegional Press Opportunities. We may want to consider
announcing different elements of a rural economic development initiative through a radio press
conference which you, the Vice President, and Sec. Glickman could jointly hold. We have done
this successfully in the past, particularly with respect to budget initiatives. In addition, we might
want to devote a weekly radio address to rural issues as well.· Both of these hits could be part of
a broader rural economic rollout in which we have Cabinet heads and subcabinet officials
conduct media in targeted rural markets across the country.

Housing:

,HUD-NAR "One America" Agreement. HUD and the National Association of Realtors
 (NAR) have reached a final agreement on the "One America Broker" program. Under the
 program, NAR will sponsor training for real estate professionals on how to better serve minority
 and immigrant home buyers. The training will address adherence to Fair Housing Act
 principles, as well as ways to expand the housing choices available to minorities and other
 underserved groups. Realtors who complete the course and commit to serving these groups
 would be able to use the "One America" logo in advertising and promotional materials, which
 could help them to attract additional clients. To be certified, realtors must be free of any Fair
 Housing Act violations. The agreement could be announcedlhighlighted by you or the Vice
 President at an event with, e.g., a minority or immigrant new home buyer who previously
 experience discrimination and (possibly) a realtor with an outstanding record serving
 underserved groups.

Technology:

[COMBINE WITH OTHER DISABILITY PROPOSAL]
Initiative on Technology for Americans with Disabilities. New information technologies can
substantially increase the quality oflife for the 55 million Americans with disabilities. For
example -- speech recognition, text-to-speech, computers that can be manipulated with eye
movements as opposed to a mouse -- can all allow Americans with disabilities to lead more
independent lives and increase their ability to get ajob. The backdrop for this event could be
demonstrations of the technology. Deliverables could be:
o Announcement of Technology Task Force of President's Committee on Employment of
                                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion
       People with Disabilities.
o      FY2000 budget initiative (R&D to develop better technologies, programs to educate
       engineers to design accessible technology).
o      Government commitment to purchase "accessible" technology [This is part of the "GI"
       bill. ]



International Economics:

Trade Adjustment Assistance. We could do an event on helping everyone benefit from a
global economy. This event could have four different components, focused on both worker and
community adjustment:
o You could announce the consolidation and reform of the Trade Adjustment Assistance
        (TAA) program and the NAFTA-TAA program. This would more than fulfill the
        President's promise to strengthen the TAAINAFTA-TAA programs during the fast track
        debate.
o A possible Executive Order establishing a coordinating committee on community
        adjustment issues. This could be modeled after the Executive Order on defense
        adjustment programs.
o You could call on Congress to pass his EDA budget and NADBank budget, so that we
        can effectively deal with communities that have severe and sudden economic distress.
o Memorandum of Understanding between NADBank and EDA so that they work better
        together. This is important to Rep. Torres and the Hispanic Caucus. NADBankiCAIP
        and EDA have done a lot of work together, but it could be an important symbolic
       message to the Hispanic Caucus for the relationship between the two to be formalized.

Sanctions Policy. You could announce the release of a Presidential Decision Directive on
Sanctions which would establish a joint NECINSC interagency sanctions review group to
monitor and coordinate broad United States government sanctions policy. The group would
ensure that prior to sanctions being implemented the Administration would conduct a
cosUbenefit analysis. The group could also review existing sanctions in place to determine
whether they are still serving an important purpose in fulfilling our policy objectives. The time
could be ripe for such an announcement because of the keen awareness on the Hill and elsewhere
about the proliferation of new sanctions regimes and their cost to the U.S. economy. An
interagency process has been working on such a directive; work could be finalized in time for an
annQuncement. Because the Glenn Amendment has crystallized opinion about the problems
with unilateral sanctions, this can and should be done sooner rather than later (e.g., over the next
couple of weeks).

Major International Trade Speech. You could articulate U.S. trade objectives for the year
leading up to the 1999 WTO Ministerial Conference, which we are hosting. You could also
announce the selection of the city for such an announcement. Over 20 cities have expressed
interest; the conference will bring international attention and over 10,000 attendees from foreign
government, business, press and NGOs. The policy initiative would be a refinement of the goals
outlined at the May 1998 WTO Anniversary in Geneva.


                                                               Automated Records Management System
                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion
    Financial:

    Consumer Credit and Financial Services Bill of Rights. Consumer debt levels are at record
    highs. So too are consumer bankruptcies. And as fees for financial services (including A TMs)
    mount, consumer anger grows. Working with the DPC, we could develop an initiative and
    legislative proposal aimed at educating consumers about the use of credit and bank services,
    improving the information consumers receive, and targeting predatory practices.
