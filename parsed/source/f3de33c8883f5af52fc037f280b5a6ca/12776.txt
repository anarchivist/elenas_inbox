Subject:          Re: racial profiling

Having spent a few days trying to draft an appropriate introduction to the
Executive Order, I discussed with Maria on Friday what I hope will be the
solution to the problem.  Early in the week, Eric Holder is meeting with
INS to determine whether there is any real need for the "INS exception" to
an absolute ban on racial profling. Assuming that the answer is "no," we
should then be able to stake out for the President the same firm position
already publicly adopted by the Vice President and the Attorney General.
