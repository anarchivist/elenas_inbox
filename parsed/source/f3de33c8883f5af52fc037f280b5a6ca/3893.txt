     Implementation of Children's Health Initiative. We have started a process with HHS, OMB,
     the First Lady's office, and others designed to assure an effective implementation of the new
     children's health initiative. By next week, we will have completed a timetable that outlines
     important due dates for any necessary guidelines and regulations to help the states interpret and
     design children's health plans. It will also list meetings/forums with state representatives
     (Governors, Medicaid Directors, etc.), children's advocates, health care providers and others who
     are extremely interested in the new children's health options. We will be evaluating whether
     participation by you, the First Lady, Donna and other principals may be desirable to highlight the
     new Federal dollars and opportunities to cover uninsured children. We are also producing
     responses to frequently asked questions about the new law, so interested parties have a good
     sense of the statute and the process for implementing it. Lastly, we are now reaching out to
     foundations to determine their interest in using private dollars for outreach efforts designed to
     cover the 3 million children currently eligible but not enrolled in Medicaid. There seems to be a
     good deal of interest and we will keep you informed of developments.


     Pediatric Labeling. Next Wednesday, the Vice President, the First Lady and you are scheduled
     to participate in an event that announces a new pediatric labeling regulation from the FDA that
     will ensure that drug companies test their products specifically on children and provide
     appropriate dosage levels to pediatricians and other health care professionals. Despite years of
     attempts at voluntary compliance, the drug industry still rarely does needed testing on and
     labeling for children. As a result, doctors either do not prescribe needed medications (for fear of
     hurting their patients) or attempt to approximate dosage levels, too frequently resulting in under
     or over-medicating fragile, young patients. Pediatricians, children's hospitals, consumer
     advocates, and AIDS groups (there has been little testing on the impact of protease inhibitors on
     children) are strongly endorsing this regulation.
