TEXT:
this one is addressed to you both as the resident tobacco czar AND a
distinguished professor of law!

Can HHS reach individual settlements with states - based on individualized
medicaid determininations - that would forgo recoupment for that state if
the state commits to expenditures we approve? Is this something we could
pursue?
