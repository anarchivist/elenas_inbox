TEXT:
In 1962, I became involved in politics because of child care issues in my
community in Iowa. As a member of the Iowa Commission for Children and
Youth, I fought for child care programs and funding.  In 1970, at the
White House Conference on Children, we put forward the bill that Nixon
vetoed two years later. As an elected official in my county, we made
serious gains in child care, but never enough and never with help from the
feds.  Today, thanks to your work, I felt that a dream had come true.
Many thanks and congratulations from an old lady and millions of children!
