"
     I will send around a revised block, but here are the highlights:
     1.   The President and First Lady will be given the option of doing the
     Breast Cancer Event on the 20th (which was supposed to be their
     day off), and they will decide.  If it is not the 20th that EITHER the
     FLOTUS or POTUS will do it as their own event.

     2. NJ speech on Oct. 8th is not going to take place at a Babtist
     Ministers Conference and it will remain an education message.
