TEXT:
Hi,

Following is a draft POTUS response to the Barry Munitz (Chancellor of CA
State Univ. System).  I understand that Phil Caplan in Staff Secretary's
office has sent you both copies of his letter to the President (dated
3/18).  Please let me know if the following draft is okay.  This letter is
for the President's signature, and I need your comments as soon as
possible. Thanks!

DRAFT:


Thank you for writing to me.  I deeply appreciate the support of the
university presidents in the California State University System for my
Administration's national education agenda. Thank you too for sending
me a copy of the American Council on Education's resolution.  I have
shared your letter with my staff in the Domestic Policy Council.

As you well know, government must work in partnership with educators,
administrators, community leaders, and parents to set tough academic
standards, promote technology literacy, and encourage lifelong
learning for all Americans. Our success in boosting wages and
strengthening our nation's economy depends on the skill and education
of our people. The commitment of the California State University
System to excellence in education and to broadening educational
opportunities for all American is a valuable investment in the future
of our country.
