Is there a reason we say "disapprove" rather than veto?

   DonD,t Believe Talking Heads
                    Wrong! for Thursday

                                By James J. Cramer
                                The Street.com
                                NEW     Y 0 R K,   April 8 0* Sometimes
                                the talking heads are so wrong that
                                they can throw you off your game.
                                We saw a great example of this
                      principle in WednesdayD,s trading in Philip
                      Morris.
                          All day, the talking heads blathered about how the
                      verdict against MO in California had been reduced and
                      how that would boost big tobacco. I heard this said at
                      least five times. My, what great news!
                          So, you might be wondering: How come, other than at
                      the opening, MO did nothing but go down all day?
                      Despite a huge blue-chip rally! The answer, as it often
                      does, had nothing to do with that verdict. Nothing at all.
                      That was yesterdayD,s canard. What mattered was that the
                      Justice Department had hired the best legal gun out
                      there, a Minnesota law firm with a reputation for going
   for
                      the jugular, to work on JusticeD,s sweeping case against
   the
                      tobacco industry.
                          There were three salient points about that decision
   that
                      trumped anything positive involving a cutback in the size
   of
                      the verdict. One is that the last we had heard about this
                      suit, it was all but dead.
                          There had been press reports earlier in the year
   saying
                      that enthusiasm for the case had died down. This hire was
                      a clear sign that this suit is alive and well and
   dangerous.
                      ThatD,s a huge switch from the more benign federal
                      backdrop in an otherwise total-siege situation.
                          Second, we know that by bringing in outside experts,
                      Justice means business. Remember the Microsoft team,
                      Murderers Row, that the Department of Antitrust brought
                      in? This hired-gun plaintiff team could rival Boies & Co.
                      for expertise in its field.
                          Finally, the Minnesota firm signed on for small


      bucks. I
                      donD,t know about you, but there is nothing worse than an
                      opponent not motivated by money. You canD,t game that
                      kind of enemy. It wants revenge.
                           The lesson here is that the early-morning TV shows
                      often contain statements about how such and such a stock
                      will trade. Many, many times these statements are plain
                      Wrong. Wednesday was one of those many days. If you
                      listened and acted, you lost money.
