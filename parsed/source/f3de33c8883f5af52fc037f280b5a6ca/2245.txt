Subject:         Re: wtw wins

we have the disabled exemption for those on the rolls as well as new
applicants, but the bans continue for new entrants (kids and disabled, SSI
and medicaid) arriving after 9/30/97.    I hear that the authorizers are
unhappy going as far as the agreement, so we'll see how it plays out.    If
we do get this enacted, it's a bases loaded triple, at least (to continue
the sports metaphor) .
