TEXT:
We believe this is the final version of the directive. We've taken the
majority of comments/edits from ONDCP and Justice but made sure to keep
some of the stronger language preferred by Rahm. Also, while General
McCaffrey has seen the directive and is generally pleased, he is insisting
on seeing the the absolute "final" version before he personally signs
off.  He doesn't expect to do this until tomorrow morning.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE ATIORNEY GENERAL

SUBJECT: Zero Tolerance for Drug Use and Availability for Offenders

Crime rates in this country have dropped significantly for 5 years, and the number of Americans
who have used drugs is down nearly 50% from its peak 15 years ago. Also, drug-related
murders have dropped to their lowest point in a decade, and recent drug use surveys indicate that
-- for the first time in years -- teen drug use is leveling off, and in some instances, modestly
decreasing. All of this news is encouraging.

Nonetheless, much more can and needs to be done to continue to bring down drug use and
increase public safety. With more than half the offenders in our criminal justice system
estimated to have a substance abuse problem, promoting coerced abstinence and treatment within
the criminal justice system is critical to breaking the cycle of crime and drugs. My
Administration consistently has promoted testing offenders and demanding the treatment they
need to get off drugs, and stay out of trouble in the future. We have worked to expand the
number of Drug Courts throughout the country, increased the number of federal arrestees and
prisoners who are tested and treated for drugs, and launched an innovative "Breaking the Cycle"
initiative, which is a rigorous program of testing, treatment, supervision, and sanctions for
individuals at all stages of the criminal justice process. And under your leadership, the Federal
Bureau of Prisons provides models of excellence in drug detection, inmate testing, and drug
treatment.

We can do still more to promote coerced abstinence and treatment among state prisoners,
probationers, and parolees. When a drug user ends up in a state prison, we have a chance to
break his or her addiction. Convicted offenders who undergo drug testing and treatment while
incarcerated and after release are approximately twice as likely to stay drug- and crime-free as
those offenders who do not receive testing and treatment. But when drug use inside prisons is
ignored, the demand for drugs runs high. In this environment, corrections officials struggle to
keep their prisons drug-free. Often drugs are smuggled in by visitors; sometimes even by
compromised correctional staff.

To maintain order in our prisons, to make effective treatment possible, and to reduce drug-related
crime, we can not tolerate drug use and trafficking within the nation's prisons. Thus, I direct
you to:

       (1) Amend the guidelines requiring states receiving federal prison construction grants to
       submit plans for drug testing, intervention, and treatment to include a requirement that
       states also submit a baseline report of their prison drug abuse problem. In every

                                                                 Automated Records Management System
                                                                 Hex-Dwnp Conversion
progress they are making towards ridding their correctional facilities of drugs.

(2) Draft and transmit to the Congress legislation that will pennit states to use their
federal prison construction and substance abuse treatment funds to provide a full range of
drug testing, drug treatment, and sanctions both during incarceration and after release.

(3) In consultation with states, draft and transmit to the Congress legislation that moves
         towards enacting stiffer penalties for drug trafficking into and within correctional
facilities.
