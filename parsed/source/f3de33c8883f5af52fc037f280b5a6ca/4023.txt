TEXT:
fyi--

secretary Riley held meetings this week with Bill Gray/HBCU advocates as
well as advocates for Hispanic Serving Institutins (including MALDEF and
an organization called HACU) .  I gather these went fairly well. However,
OLC at Justice has raised some possible Adarand concerns with provisions
regarding HSI's (which lack the historical background of HBCUs and the
special status of tribal colleges), so ED is going to be taking a more
careful look at that.

-- Bill
