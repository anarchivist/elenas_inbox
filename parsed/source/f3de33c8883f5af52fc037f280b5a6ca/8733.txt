TEXT:
According to Eddie, the Opt. of Justice and the Dept. of Educ. are working
on whether they can develop a regulatory or legislative fix to the Supreme
Court case that limits damage liability for schools (and school districts)
to cases where the school has actual knowledge of or deliberate
indifference to the sexual harassment.  The Dpt. of Educ. has authority to
promulgate regs. that impose other duties on school districts, and Ed. and
DOJ are trying to determine if they could do regs for this.  Even if they
could promulgate such regs, there is a question of what the remedy could
be. Also, according to Eddie, it is unclear whether it is currently a
violation of Title IX not to set up an internal mechanism for harassment
complaints.  Eddie said that the Ed./DOJ group has been meeting, and that
he would find out where they are and let me know.
