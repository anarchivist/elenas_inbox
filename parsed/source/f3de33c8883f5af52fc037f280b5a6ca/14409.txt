TEXT:
Angus King from Erskine's office asked for some brief notes on
labor's likely issues tomorrow.
I prepared the attached which I discussed with Diana and
indirectly with Monahan.  Couldn't reach the rest of you and they
wanted it tonight.
If there are changes that need to be made, I can make them
tomorrow prior to the 12:45 pre-briefing.
Thanks.

               BRIEFING ON LABOR'S WELFARE REFORM CONCERNS

The following briefly summarizes the key issues related to welfare refonn that organized labor
has raised to us previously, their status, and our suggested response.

1. Privatization of Administrative Functions

ConcernAllowing states to contract out the administration of Food Stamps, Medicaid, or welfare.


ProblemThe states have the legal authority to contract out administration of the welfare block
             grant. They need a waiver to do this for Food Stamps and approval for Medicaid.
              Both Texas and Wisconsin are well down the road in developing their plans to
             contract out.

ResponseSince (a) we do not have a definite position yet on this issue and (b) we don't have a
             legal basis to tum the states down, we should probably just listen.

2. Public Comment Period on State Welfare Plans

ConcernEnsuring that HHS requires a 45 day public comment period before state welfare plans
             are certified as complete.

ResponseHHS will require comment periods, but they can take place after the plan is submitted
            to the federal government. Plans will be certified as completely only after the
            comment period has ended. Funding will be retroactive to plan submission.

3. Continued Medicaid Funding for Immigrants

ConcernEnsuring that all immigrants will continue to get Medicaid even after losing their SSI.

ProblemThis is a budget issue. It may be possible to let states do this administratively, but the
              cost could be over $1 billion over six years.

ResponseWe share this concern. Need to look at it in the context of the budget.


4. Employment Rights for Welfare Recipients

ConcernProviding greater labor protections for those in "workfare" programs -- working for their
             welfare.

ResponseWe have pressed for greater protections in the past. We will work with them on this in
            the new Congress.

5. "Fix" Legislation

C01icernThey have a list of issues they would like a "fix" bill to address.

StatusWhile we know we will be submitting a budget which would restore some of the cuts, we
             are not sure what we will do in terms oflegislation on some of the other policy
             issues: labor protections, privatization, etc.

ResponseWe should indicate openness to hearing their concerns, and express that we are still
            developing both our substantive ideas and our strategy.

6. Job Creation Legislation

ConcernThey have a series of concerns -- wanting more money ($10 billion, not $3 billion),
             preferring job creation to job referral, DOL administration, etc.

StatusThe details of the proposal are still being developed, but the broad outlines remain what
              they were in August. Development will continue into January.

ResponseWe will continue to work closely with them on the development of this initiative and
            will try to incorporate some of their concerns.
