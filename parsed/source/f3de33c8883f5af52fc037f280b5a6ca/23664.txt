TEXT:
During a California Working Group meeting I attended yesterday, I was
asked to draft a Q&A on Proposition 187 for meetings that the President,
Vice-President, and other Administration officials are having in DC with a
number of California officials beginning May 3rd (CA Legislative
Delegation, 5/6 LA County Supervisors) including Governor Davis on May
6th.   Also, the President will be in CA from 5/14-5/16.

I would appreciate your comments on my draft (see below) .




PROPOSITION 187


Q:      What is the AdministrationO,s view of California Governor Gray
Davis' decision to seek mediation to resolve the legal challenge to
proposition 187?

A:       When the California voters considered Proposition 187 in 1994,
the Administration strongly opposed this proposition because it was unfair
to children.   Since Proposition 187 is currently pending before the U.S.
Court of Appeals and the Administration is not a party in this case, it is
not appropriate for the Administration to comment on pending litigation.
However, the Administration hopes that the important and complicated
issues raised in this case will be resolved soon.
