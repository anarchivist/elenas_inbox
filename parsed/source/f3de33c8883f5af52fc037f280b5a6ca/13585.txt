TEXT:
Kay Baily Hutchison and Hatfield just engaged in a colloquy to
attempt to establish legislative history on the ESA waiver, in
which they asserted that the President is required to consider
jobs and economic factors in exercising his waiver. Hatfield (I
think) also stated that those factors were equally applicable to
the other waivers.
He also inserted a number of other written colloquies into the
Record that mayor may not deal with the waiver authority.
I leave this up to the lawyers, but the Congressional Record of
today may be replete with attempted legislative histories. Not
certain we can read the Record before we do the signing
statement/waivers, but it might be possible. There may be good
arguments against attempting to get into rebuttals (one might be
that we would draw attention to non-issues -- where we feel there
is no ambiguity in the new law -- and we might be better off just
strongly asserting what we believe is our clear authority) .
Please keep me posted of your collective thinking on this.
