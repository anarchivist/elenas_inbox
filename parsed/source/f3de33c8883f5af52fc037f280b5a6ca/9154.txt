to participate in a children's health insurance outreach event with Irwin Redlener's Children's
Health Fund to announce two to three new states that are receiving Children's Health Insurance
Program (CHIP) approvals. The states include Iowa and possibly Georgia, Delaware, Montana
or Kansas. At this event, the Children's Health Fund will be focusing attention on its new
medical caravan, which is touring through several states over the next week in an effort to sign
up uninsured children who are eligible but not enrolled in health insurance programs. In
addition, the Vice President will also highlight some of the initiatives that Federal government is
taking in response to the Executive Memorandum you issued in June at the Family Conference in
Nashville directing eight Federal agencies to enroll and cover uninsured children, including over
150,000 children's health pamphlets that are being sent Treasury Department workers,
administering the EITC and other low-income assistance programs.
