Subject:         Grandmothers

 According to todays NYTimes: "About 4 million children ... live in
households headed by a grandparent, a 41 percent increase since 1992
... Research by AARP attributes this rise mainly to high rates of substance
abuse by parents; child abuse neglect, or abandonment .... "
     I think I remember that we were trying to get more information about
custodial grandparents to explain problems with the Child Custoday/Locking
Up Granny bill.
