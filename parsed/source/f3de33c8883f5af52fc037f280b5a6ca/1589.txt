TEXT:
I am being called up this morning to brief the budgeteers on Medicare.
As a result, I will be unable to make the 9:30 meeting.  Please accept my
since apologies.

We do have a number of issues we need to talk about.  They include:  (1)
an update on the health discussions with the Hill; (2) the organ
donation/allocation issue and meeting with David Matter; (3) the request
for a children'S coverage meeting with the POTUS -- I have been asked to
submit a scheduling request; I need your guidance on participants; and (4)
the diabetes update after my afternoon meeting today.
