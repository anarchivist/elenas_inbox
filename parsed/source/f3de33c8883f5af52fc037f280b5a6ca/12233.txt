FYI. Eddie Correia in Counsel's office sent me the attached meeting
announcement.  I don't know if you discussed the division of issues while
I was out.  Is this an issue that the NEC would want to run? Paul?

Subject:         Diversity in the workforce

         We hope to meet with a number of industry representatives on May
4th, probably at 3:00, room TBA, to discuss industry commitments to
expanding diversity in the workforce. If you have ideas about firms to
contact (please supply firms, individuals and phone numbers if possible)
and ideas we should raise at the meeting, please let me know. I will
schedule a time for our group to get together in advance of the industry
meeting.
