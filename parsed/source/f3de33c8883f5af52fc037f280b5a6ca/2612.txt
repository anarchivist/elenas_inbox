TEXT:
Elena-- on the voucher amendment, Lott did not introduce this; Dominici
did for Coverdale.  See how much confusion is rampant on this?

I would stress in the weekly (1) that it happened; (2) that is was
occasioned by confusion; it happened quickly, the amendment was so poorly
drafted that it is unimplementable; (3) that it provides something of a
symbolic victory but one that we can and will downplay because of the
confusion.
