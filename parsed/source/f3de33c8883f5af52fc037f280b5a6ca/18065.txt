HEADLINE: Welfare activists citing job shortages

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 10

BODY:
   Thousands of activists are planning demonstrations across the country
today
to protest what they contend are major shortfalls in newly established
federal
welfare policies. The events are timed to coincide with a report by a
Washington advocacy group suggesting the new plan for moving welfare
recipients
into jobs is hampered by an insufficient number of available jobs paying at
least modest salaries.   The report by The Preamble Center for Public
Policy


found the u.s. economy in 1997-1998 will create only about half the
low-skill
jobs needed for welfare recipients, with the ratio reaching 8-to-l in some
states.   It also estimated the odds of a welfare recipient finding a job
paying
"a living wage"    was nearly 100-to-1, and predicted the influx of former
welfare recipients into the labor market will push down wages for the
nation's
lowest-paid workers by 12 percent. The report noted the welfare reform
bill
passed by Congress and signed into law by President Clinton in 1996 was
designed
to lift welfare recipients into paying jobs, but it said' 'a wealth of
evidence
has now accumulated which demonstrates that this is impossible under
current law
and policy. " The report counters the optimism voiced by supporters of the
reform law, including Clinton, who declared on its one-year anniversary in
August that given falling welfare rolls: " I think it's fair to say the
debate
is over."   Protest events were scheduled today for cities that include
Washington, New York, Boston, Denver, Atlanta, Chicago, Philadelphia,
Seattle
and Milwaukee.
