TEXT:
Mike Smith spoke with Secretary Riley about the Cardin provision and the
possible compromise language we have been working on.   The Secretary
wants to be clear that his strong preference is to remove the Cardin tax
credit provision outright.  He sees the compromise language as the last
option if all other efforts to get Cardin to drop the provision fail.
