TEXT:
Gomperts heard a rumor we will announce some big AmeriCorps expansion as
part of a millenium speech. Any truth to the rumor?

(Also, he's pressing me on trying to get a reauthorization event on the
calendar in late September/early October. He said the VA/HUD
appropriations bill may well be done by mid/late September, and so argues
it's not too early to think about getting it on the schedule. Any advice
on what to tell him?)
