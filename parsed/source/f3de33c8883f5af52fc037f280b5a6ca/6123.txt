TEXT:
Elena,

OMB spoke yesterday with the agencies that commented on the new EEOC rule
to let them know the modifications that the EEOC had agreed to make
pursuant to their comments. The agencies were not pleased.   Sally is
holding a meeting with them on Monday at 2pm to discuss their remaining
concerns.

The agencies are particularly upset with the provision of the EEOC rule
that would remove the agency's ability to review AJ decisions.  The
agencies have argued that the EEOC does not have the authority, under
Title VII, to remove the agency from the process. The General Counsel
from OPM (Lorraine Lewis) called Sally and Don Arbuckle and requested that
OMB put this question to OLC. OMB may want to seek informal advice,
rather than a legal opinion, in order to expedite the response.  I have
told OMB that I would be happy to make the contact with OLC on this
question. Does that sound o.k.? Thanks.

Julie
