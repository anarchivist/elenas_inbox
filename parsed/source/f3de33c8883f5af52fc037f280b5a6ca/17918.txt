TEXT:
Elena,

Do we have an Education directive yet? The final town hall meeting before
Thanksgiving is tomorrow at 11am. I know that they will want to know more
about what we plan to do.  I asked Mike this morning, but I haven't heard
back yet.

Also, I spoke with Christa about what other role we should be playing in
this process.  She has hooked me up with the press and speech people, to
allow us to review q&a and statements. Otherwise, I asked Minyon to let
me know in what other ways we should be plugged in. Does that seem right?

Julie
