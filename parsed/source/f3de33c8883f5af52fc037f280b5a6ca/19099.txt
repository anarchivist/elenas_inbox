                                Youth Smoking Reductions
                                     March 23, 1998

Q:   What did the Vice President announce today?

A:   The Vice President announced a new Treasury Department analysis that
     demonstrates that the Administration's proposal for comprehensive tobacco
     legislation will have a significant impact in every state and every region in the
     country in reducing youth smoking and preventing premature deaths. A per-pack
     price increase of up to $1.50 over 10 years combined with advertising and access
     restrictions will result in an average reduction of 42 percent in underage teenage.
     smoking in the year 2003 in every single state, including the District of Columbia.
     The percentage reductions in underage teen smoking and resulting premature
     deaths range from 33-36 percent in states like Washington, Massachusetts, and
     Michigan, to 47-51 percent in states like Wyoming, Tennessee, and Kentucky.
     Fifteen states will see reductions above 45 percent in the 2003. Over the next five
     years, the number of young people kept from smoking would be about 3 million
     young people for the country as a whole. Individual states will see reductions
     ranging from a few thousand in the smaller states up to about 248,000 in California
     and 205,000 in Texas.

Q:   What is your support for saying that one million lives can be saved over 5 years if
     Congress passes comprehensive legislation?

A:   Last month, the President announced a Treasury department analysis which found that the
      Administration's proposal -- a price increase of $1.1 0 per pack over five years coupled
     with sales and advertising restrictions -- will save a million lives over the next five years.
      This report concludes that underage smoking would be reduced by nearly half. Based
     on new data, we now estimate that cumulatively over the next five years, approximately 3
     million underage teens would be kept from smoking -- an increase from the 2.4 to 2.8
     million previously reported. Because the number of premature deaths from smoking is
     about one-third of actual smokers, the Administration's proposal would prevent almost a
     million premature deaths over the next five years.


Q:   Many legislators and public health officials have said that tobacco legislation must
     not include limits on liability. What is the Administration's position?

A:   The President would prefer legislation without liability limits, but will evaluate tobacco
     legislation as a whole to determine whether it protects public health. In the context of a
     comprehensive bill that meets the President's five principles and advances the public
     health, reasonable limits on liability will not be a dealbreaker. What's important is
     achieving comprehensive legislation that includes a large per-pack price increase, strong
     penalties for marketing to children, and affirmation of FDA's authority to restrict
     advertising aimed at children and prevent children's access to tobacco products.

               Talking Points for Conference Call with State Attorneys General
                                       March 23,1998




    *   We are meeting regularly with members of Congress on both sides of the aisle in order
        ensure passage of comprehensive, bipartisan legislation this year. We are working
        closely with Senator McCain -in the hopes that he will amend his bill in the Commerce
        Committee to meet the President's five core principles.

    *   Today, I am unveiling exciting new state-by-state numbers which reveal that every state
        will experience an average 42 percent reduction in youth smoking and premature deaths
        under the President's tobacco proposal. Reductions range from 33 percent in
        Washington to 51 percent in Kentucky.

    *   Fifteen states will see reductions in youth smoking above 45 percent.

    *   The new data also shows that three million teens will be kept from smoking over the next
        five years. This is a significant increase over previously announced figures.

    *   These new facts can help build the momentum necessary to pass bipartisan
        comprehensive legislation at the federal level. I strongly encourage each of you to
        announce these new statistics in your state, to help raise awareness that we need to put an
        end to teen smoking. By using these statistics, you can convey that comprehensive
        federal legislation is necessary to significantly reduce the most devastating and
        preventable health problem facing our youth today.

    *   We cannot delay. Every day, 3000 kids become regular smokers and 1,000 of them will
        die prematurely from this addiction.
