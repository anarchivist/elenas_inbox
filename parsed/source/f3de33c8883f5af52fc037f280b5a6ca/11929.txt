   H. R.1141-EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS ACT, FY 1999
                      (Sponsor: Young (R), Florida)


        This Statement of Administration Policy provides the Administration's views on
H.R.ll41, the bill making emergency supplemental appropriations to assist in Central America's
recovery from recent natural disasters, to provide urgent funding related to the situation in
Jordan, and to provide vital loans and other assistance to our farmers and ranchers. The
Administration appreciates the Committee's consideration of the President's supplemental
requests and looks forward to working with the Congress on a bi-partisan basis to complete
action on this important legislation soon. However, we have significant concerns with the
approach being taken in the House Committee bill and we ask that you consider the
Administration's views.

        Providing essential assistance to victims of natural disasters and helping our farmers at
home with vital financing clearly fall in the category of needs that are urgent, unanticipated, and
essential -- that is, emergency requirements. Therefore, they clearly deserve to be funded
quickly, fully, and without requiring offsets that could force unacceptable reductions in important
programs. We support the Committee's action of providing defense-related emergency funding
in response to Hurricane Mitch without offsets and believe that consistent treatment should be
applied to non-defense agencies performing similar emergency activities. The Administration
would strongly oppose an amendment that may be offered that would require offsets for this
defense-related emergency funding.

        The Committee bill would rescind $875 million from international affairs accounts, with
the largest portion being a rescission of $648 million in appropriations of callable capital from
U.S. payments to the Asian Development Bank (ASDB), the World Bank and the InterAmerican
Development Bank. Such rescissions would be extremely ill-advised. Rescinding the callable
capital funding would send a dangerous signal to financial markets and could require the AS DB
and other multilateral development banks (MDBs) to pay a higher premium on their borrowing,
which could lead to the restriction of capital flows necessary to strengthen the global economy
and expand U.S. exports. At a time when some of our emerging export markets in Asia and
other developing economies are beginning to recover, this step would be highly unproductive.
                                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion

        In addition, this rescission of callable capital would call into question U.S. commitment
to all multilateral development banks. This could have a detrimental effect on capital flows and
economic growth globally, including in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. This unintended
consequence would even more broadly delay economic recovery in markets vital to the United
States, thereby hurting our own economy.

       The other rescissions in the international affairs area would undermine a host of
important objectives in many programs. For example, the rescissions would cut support for U.S.
exports, undermining our efforts to penetrate foreign markets and provide jobs for American
workers. At a time when the United States needs to promote its exports, this is 'a particularly
misguided step. The rescissions would also undercut free market reform and democracy
promotion in the New Independent States and in Eastern Europe, areas where it is manifestly in
America's interests to encourage reform. The rescission of development assistance would set
back efforts in the poorest countries, including possibly in those hit hardest by Hurricane Mitch.

        Other rescissions would undermine our efforts to provide peacekeeping operations in
troubled areas of the world. The rescission of Global Environment Facility funding would be
highly detrimental to the cause of improving global environmental protection. Still other cuts
would reduce our contributions to international organizations, where America's reputation as a
contributor in good standing is already tarnished.

       In addition, we are concerned with the $150 million cut in important nonproliferation
programs to reduce stockpiles of excess weapons grade uranium and plutonium in Russia. Since
the Department of Energy has already negotiated an agreement with Russia to purchase uranium
for $325 million, the entire cut would have to come from the $200 million appropriated for
plutonium. That would drastically undercut negotiations that are underway to dispose of 50 tons
of weapons grade plutonium in Russia, enough for 15,000 nuclear weapons.

        Taken together, these rescissions are so great that the supplemental as a whole would
constitute a net reduction in U.S. foreign affairs spending -- a reduction that would seriously
undermine America's capacity to pursue its foreign policy objectives and promote our economic
security. [The Administration strongly supports adoption of an amendment expected to be
offered that would strike from the bill several of these objectionable rescissions.)

        Were the bill to be presented to the President with the offsets discussed above, the
President's senior advisers would recommend that he veto the bill. We urge the House not to
take actions that could result in gridlock and delay, and that would be detrimental both to our
allies abroad and our citizens at home in their time of need. We urge the House not to add
extraneous authorizations to the bill, particularly narrow, objectionable riders that would serve
only to generate controversy, unnecessarily delaying the urgently needed emergency assistance
contained in this bill.

Emergency Relief for Central America


                                                 2
                                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion

         The bill provides $962 million for Central America, $6 million more than the President's
request. On February 16th , the President transmitted to the Congress a request for $956 million
for International Assistance Programs, the Department of Defense, and the Department of Justice
to provide assistance for emergency disaster and reconstruction assistance expenses arising from
the consequences of the recent hurricanes in Central America and the Caribbean and the recent
earthquake in Colombia. The Administration appreciates the full funding provided in the House
bill for this request, which will provide relief from the effects of Hurricanes Mitch and Georges
and restore hope to this devastated region.

        Hurricane Mitch, the worst natural disaster in the history ofthe Western Hemisphere, left
more than 9,000 dead and drove millions from their homes. Even today, hundred ofthousands
of Central Americans still cannot return to their homes. Schools, hospitals, businesses, farms
and roads were destroyed, resulting in serious economic dislocation. Hurricane Mitch caused
$8.5 billion in damages, and Hurricane Georges brings the total to $10 billion. The President's
Central America package is urgent, unanticipated, and essential and should be funded as an
emergency request..

         Funds must be provided swiftly to prevent the spread of disease and to buy seed and plant
crops in the fast-approaching Spring planting season, thereby providing food and jobs to many
communities, and to demonstrate to Central Americans that they can find jobs and security in
their own recovering economies. Much of the rural road system farmers and small merchants
depend on for their livelihoods was destroyed. Water and sanitation systems have been
disrupted, which can result in disease. Economic destruction and dislocation threaten to
undermine the region's achievements of the past decade, as these nations have made tremendous
strides toward settling conflicts, strengthening democracy, promoting human rights, opening
economies and alleviating poverty. Emergency assistance for reconstruction aid will ensure that
their transformation continues and that Central Americans will have cause to view their own
futures in the region with hope.

Jordan

        The Administration appreciates the Committee's providing the full $100 million for
Jordan, fully funding the FY 1999 request. These funds will provide financial support to help
promote stability in Jordan and the region during the period of transition subsequent to King
Hussein's death. While the administration appreciates the full funding of the $100 million FY
request, we are disappointed that the $200 million requested for advance appropriations for FYs
2000 and 2001 has not been provided. In the context of promoting peace in the Middle East, the
Administration will continue to press for these advance appropriations.

                                                                            Hex-Dump Conversion
Department of Agriculture

        On February 26 th , the President submitted a request for $152 million for urgently needed
emergency funds for the Department of Agriculture (USDA). The Administration appreciates
the Committee's providing fully for this request. The Administration's request would provide
an additional $1.1 billion in farm ownership, operating, and emergency direct and guaranteed
loans to help farmers through the Spring planting season. This additional loan authority would
provide vitally needed financing for the Nation's farmers in light of the significant increase in
demand for USDA loans, due to project continuing low commodity and livestock prices.

Department of the Interior

        The Administration is pleased that the Committee provided a total of$21.8 million in
supplemental funding for Interior's Indian trust fund management reforms. Of this amount, $6.8
million was included in the President's FY 2000 Budget and $15 million was transmitted by the
President with offsets on March 10, 1999. Together these funds will allow the Department to
carry out critical activities, including court-ordered requirements in the Cobell v. Babbitt lawsuit
alleging past mismanagement of individual Indian money accounts, and continued progress on
trust fund management improvements.
