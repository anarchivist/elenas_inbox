TEXT:
Andrea and I have talked with John Orszag of NEC about timing for these
two announcements. The day before the Conference of Mayors speech the
President is announcing the winners of the Microenterprise Awards at the
Treasury Department with Rubin. All of us agree that we should use that
opportunity to also announce the beginning of the IDA competition and the
new budget numbers.

with regards to the welfare to work housing voucher announcement, John
Orszag strongly believes that announcing the beginning of the competition
and the 25,000 new vouchers in the President's budget at the Conference of
Mayors event will step on the message of the day, which is youth
employment. My view, is that we probably won't get much attention on the
vouchers and we could go either way, announce at the Conference of Mayors
event briefly in the POTUS speech or briefly in his welfare speech on the
25th.  I know there is a lot to announce on the 25th, but it would seem to
fit better with the Access to Jobs and other welfare announcements on the
25th.

Please advise.
