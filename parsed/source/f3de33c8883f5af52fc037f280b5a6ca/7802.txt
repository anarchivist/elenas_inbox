TEXT:
Would it be ok if I confirm on the record that the WH is interested in the
ongoing investigation of RJR for smuggling cigarettes into Canada? As you
may recall, I spoke to John O'Brien with the Syracuse NY paper and I had
him send me copies of his stories detailing the investigation of RJR for
complicity in the smuggling of hundreds of millions of dollars of
cigarettes into Canada through upstate NY.  His stories help make the case
that smuggling on the scale that the public is concerned about cannot happe
n without a company's help.

O'Brien is now writing a story about how the companies are using the
smuggling issue to try and defeat tobacco legislation.   I spoke to him on
background. He would like to write that the WH is interested in the RJR
investigation because i t helps refute the industry's charges.  Elena and
O'Brien have been trading calls for a couple of weeks.   Today is his
absolute deadline. Thanks.
