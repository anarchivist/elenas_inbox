HHS (Tarplin) advises that there will NOT be a section on the role of the
Federal Government in Varmus' testimony for Wednesday's hearing.
Accordingly,
please let me know by 10 a.m. tomorrow (12/01) if you have any comments on
the
Varmus statement.

NOTE: Tomorrow morning HHS will be sending us for review/clearance a
number of
Q&As for the Wednesday hearing. I will circulate them to you as soon as
they
are received.
