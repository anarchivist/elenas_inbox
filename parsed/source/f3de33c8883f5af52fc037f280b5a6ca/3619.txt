TEXT:
Governor Locke's general counsel called me to let us know the Governor
will send a letter to the President Monday urging him to voice his support
soon for the settlement with little modification.  Locke's GC wanted to
know where the President wil be to minimize any difference between the
governor and the President.   I told him the President has only reached
one conclusion reo black market.

I don't think this pending letter creates any problems, do you?

Also, the GC and I both are wondering if any other elected officials
besides AGs have taken positions on the settlement.  Do you know of any?
