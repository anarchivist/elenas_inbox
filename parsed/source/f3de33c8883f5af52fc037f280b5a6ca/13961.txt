TEXT:
The DOJ rep who was at our meeting today (Randy Moss) says it may
not be advisable for DOJ to participate in future meetings with
NGA/NCSL/APWA. He says there is no problem with Bob Bach being
there, but that DOJ usually doesn't give advice to outside
entities, and that prohibition would go against the spirit of
partnership at the meetings.  He thinks that, if Elena is there,
she can alert them to any issues. What do you think?
(I am sure Carol wouldn't mind the empty chair.)
