fyi --

I understand that OCR at ED is close to releasing some guidance on testing
policy, though it can't go out yet because Mike Smith has not reviewed
it.  I imagine that whoever attends our meeting on NC Tuesday for OCR will
be aware of this and will bring it up.  This is the kind of thing that the
rest of ED usually has to treat fairly delicately.   Between now and then
I'll try to get a better sense of what the guidance entails.
