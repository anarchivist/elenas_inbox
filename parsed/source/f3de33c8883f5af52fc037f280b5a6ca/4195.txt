TEXT:
Just a little while ago Senators Domenici and Gorton introduced an
amendment to the Labor-H approps bill that would, according to Kennedy's
office, basically block grant all federal K-12 education funds.  I only
heard the very tail-end of the floor statement, but it sounded like they
were trying to make the case that the bill would be consistent with the
budget agreement.

The legislative shop at Education is getting a copy of the legislation
from Kennedy's office and trying to get a sense of timing on this.
