TEXT:
Bruce -- the CBO score of the Medicaid works about how I described
earlier.  It's based on assumptions of how many states will settle suits
in the next five years, and the likelihood that HCFA will actually collect
the federal share.  CBO keeps these assumptions quite close to the vest,
and OMB doesn't know what they are.   But as the table below shows, CBO
expects the federal government in the next five years to recoup about
11.4% of the federal share of the 50 state settlement dollars, which means
the following scenarios would be possible:

1) Assume 25% of states would settle, and HCFA would recoup 45% of federal
unds:

                  .25 x .45   =   11.3%

2) Assume 15 percent of states would settle and HCFA would recoup 75% of
federal funds:

                  .15 x .75 = 11.3%
