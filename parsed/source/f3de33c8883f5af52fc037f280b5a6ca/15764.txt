 TEXT:
 The markup is not yet done -- they broke for other meetings (a member
 meeting on tax issues, I understand) and will be resuming shortly. They
 plan to finish tonight.

 The markup started with the traditional walk-through of the chairman's
 proposal, led by Ron Haskins. Democrats (Stark and Matsui particularly)
 turned into this into an FLSA debate, drawing out the implications of
 Shaw's proposal.  Then:

         The amendment to strike the FLSA exemption was offered, failing
 4-7 (1 D & 1 R absent)

         Matsui offered, his amendment regarding giving welfare to work
 program responsibility to the state TANF agency, with priviso that PICs
 would have to approve the TANF agency's plan.     This was discussed on a
 bipartisan basis and they agreed to "work on the issue" before full
 committee.

         Watkins and Camp offered an amendment to increase to 30% the
 proportion of persons who may "work" by engaging in vocational education,
 secondary education, or education related to employment. This amendment
 included the more narrow definition in the chairman's mark  (i.e.,   the %
 is a % of those required to work, not a % of the caseload).  It passed by
 voice vote.

 After the break, they will consider amendments to:

            Strike the provision to eliminate the state SSI MOE

            Restore legal immigrant provisions to the budget agreement

            Strike Pennington (UI)

            Restore all provisons to budget agreement

         Shaw is apparently willing to return to the budget agreement's
 treatment of asylees (provide 7 instead of 5 years of benefits), so Matsui
 may offer it.
