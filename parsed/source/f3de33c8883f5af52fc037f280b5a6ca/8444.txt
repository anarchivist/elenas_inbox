THE WHITE HOUSE

Office of the Press Secretary
(Xian, PeopleD,s Republic of China)

For Immediate Release                                              June
25, 1998


STATEMENT BY THE PRESIDENT

         Last weekD,s PRIDE survey showed that we are beginning to change
the attitudes and behavior of our children, and that is a step in the
right direction.   TodayD,s Pulse Check shows that the work of AmericaD,s
parents, teachers, and public officials is far from done. AmericaD,s
young people need to hear a single, unambiguous message: drugs are wrong
and dangerous, and they can kill you.   This survey also indicates that we
must continue our efforts to tqughen drug enforcement and to get hardened
drug users off the street and into mandatory testing and treatment.
