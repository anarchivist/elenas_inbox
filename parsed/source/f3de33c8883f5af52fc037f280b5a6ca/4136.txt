FYI, according to Melissa's office, Melissa and Bruce talked about the
release of this report, and agreed that when he returned they would
discuss the timing of the release and rollout.  It apparently has good
news on teen birth rates, youth violence, infant mortality. They are
sending me a draft press release.
