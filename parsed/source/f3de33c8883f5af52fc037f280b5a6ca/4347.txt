TEXT:

FYI --
As I was channel surfing last night during a break in the Clint Eastwood movie,
I saw Rep. Bilbray speaking on the House floor about a bill that I believe Lamar
Smith was introducing to deny birthright citizenship to the children of
undocumented immigrants.  Smith undoubtedly will hold hearings on this again.

As you probably know, this is an issue that we have seen before and the
Administration has opposed it. I have some background material archived on this
(including Constitutional analysis) which we can retrieve if any of you would
like to review it.
Thanks
