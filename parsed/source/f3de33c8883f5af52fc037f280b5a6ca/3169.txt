TEXT:
I agree that we should put something in the weekly on CBEST.  If I had to
write it today, it would basically (1) alert him to the case and briefly
describe the issue (2) let him know of the competing views of the
agencies; (3) let him know of the keen interest of the civil rights
groups; and (4) tell him we are trying to determine if a narrowly drawn
brief along the lines proposed by Wade could work.

Now that you've got the outline from EEOC, do you have a timetable for
moving the decision alo~g?
