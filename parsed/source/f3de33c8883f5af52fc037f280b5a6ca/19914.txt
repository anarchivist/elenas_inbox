Senate Finance Committee -- Breast Cancer Legislation. During the Senate Finance
Committee mark up of the tobacco legislation, Senator D' Amato's mastectomy amendment
passed by a narrow 11 to 9 vote. This legislation requires health plans to allow women to stay in
the hospital as long as is medically necessary following a mastectomy, to cover breast
reconstruction, and to guarantee women a second opinion on breast cancer. It did not pass by an
overwhelming vote for a number of reasons. Some felt that tobacco legislation was an
inappropriate vehicle for this legislation; some were concerned that this proposal just contains
"body part mandates" rather than broader patient protections, such as assuring access to
specialists, emergency care, and an external appeals process for patients to address grievances.
Others argued that the D' Amato legislation is designed to be a substitute for a more
comprehensive patients' bill of rights, such as the bill of rights recommended by your quality
commission or the Dingell/Kennedy or Norwood legislation. While we generally support this
legislation, we agree with the Democratic Leadership that it should be done in the context of a
broader set of patient protections that we have been advocating since your Quality Commission
presented you with the Consumer Bill of Rights. We do believe, however, that this issue will
have particular relevance with both the disability and the women's community and that we need
to do a better job highlighting this fact. We are tentatively' scheduling an event with you to
underscore the importance of the patients' bill of rights to women and to unveil some type of
report that underscores the need for this legislation.

Senate Finance Committee -- Health Care Tax Deductions. The Senate Finance Committee
also voted to reject Senator Roth's proposal to dedicate a portion of the tobacco revenue to offset
the cost of two health care tax deductions. Specifically, Senator Roth proposed to speed up the
phase in of the self-employed tax deduction ($5.5 billion over five years) and to allow
deductions in the individual health insurance market (about $12 billion over five years). The
rationale for the Committee's decision to reject these proposals mirrored our stated concerns.
Specifically, we took the position that although you have long supported the self-employed tax
deduction and continue to do so, that this proposal was inappropriate in this context because it
would undermine the potential to invest dollars from tobacco legislation in public health and
research. We also highlighted the fact that our investments focused on children whereas the tax
proposals did not. With regard to proposals to allow deductibility for individual health
insurance market, we underscored that this proposal is regressive, will not significantly increase
the number of insured, could create an incentive for some employers to drop coverage, and is not
advisable, particularly in the absence of broader reforms in the individual insurance market.
Notwithstanding the fact that the Senate Finance Committee rejected these proposals, there is a
real possibility that Republicans will insist on some type of tax proposals in the tobacco
legislation. We have established a process to review options in this regard.
