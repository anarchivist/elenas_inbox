TEXT:
Yes, there is a 12:00 pre meeting for 0-3. Do you want to reschedule for
tomorrow at 1 or for lunch next week or for dinner sometime this week? I
can also try to see if Ann is flexible for this meeting today, but it is a
little late. Let me know what is best for you.

Also, Eli Attie called to get some info for talking points for the Welfare
Cabinet Meeting and Tom Freedman called to see if you were available.
