TEXT:
Education wondered if we could add an America Reads tie-in to the radio
address, as follows:

The President could encourage middle school/high school students to do
community
service by being reading partners with young children, particularly on
weekends
and during the summer, as well as during weekdays - after school.  He
could also
encourage high school students to be tutors for middle school students to
learn math and science.

Are we getting too many messages, or is this a helpful tie-in?
