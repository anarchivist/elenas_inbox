Elena

I think I have my first question for you about how to incorporate my work
for the VP into my new job.

Don Gips asked me last week to keep tabs on the H1B and related training
issues for the VP.  The VP has a substantive interest in many of the
training issues involved here, as well as ongoing work with the
communities interested in this issue. Don asked if I could get a written
briefing to the VP and give him a chance to weigh in before the next
decisions are made about how to proceed.  I have spoken with Cecilia Rouse
about the training issues and Julie Fernandes about the issue generally,
and Julie suggested that I get your guidance.  A few q's:

1) When will the next set of policy or tactical decisions about this issue
be made?

2) When do you think an appropriate time would be to give the VP a
briefing memo on this? Who would be the best person (s) to do it.    I   am
happy to write a draft or help write a draft.

3) Don's interested in my participating in the mtgs and work on this
issue. Would this be OK? Would.it be OK for me to come to Tuesday's mtg?

Thanks Elena!!                Jon Schnur,    (6-5567)
