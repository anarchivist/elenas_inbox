TEXT:
As the result ·of last night's order, the Forest Service and BLm
are in the process of releasing timber sales today.
I was just asked whether the President has any other authority
under which he could order the agencies to refrain from going
ahead with the sales. i don't think so, but that's more in your
ball park. Does anything spring to mind? In defense of national
salmon? I doubt it, but . . . . ??
