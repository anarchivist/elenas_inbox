     TEXT:
     We'll be putting together the Podesta Daily Report today for the
     President. We'd like to keep it short and simple; so, it'd be nice to
     have a high threshold for submitting bullet points.  If there's something
     you think he needs to know today, please send it electronically (in
     WordPerfect) to me (w/ a cc: to Barbara Barclay) before 4 p.m.   Thanks.
