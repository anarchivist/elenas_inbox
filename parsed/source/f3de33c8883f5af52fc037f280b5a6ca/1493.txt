 I will call NIJ on the smart guns. We had Jusitice include a reference to
 smart guns in our Anti-Gang Bill by anticipating the development of the
 smart gun by including them as part of the defintion of a "locking
 device."   The definition includes firearms being developed which can
 "identify" their lawful possessor by the use of a personal electronic
 "key," palmprint, or other identifier.

 Attached is a status report on other crime and drugs intiatives that I
 prepared for Monday morning's mtg but forgot to give to you.

Upcoming Issues

Crack Cocaine
      Sentencing Commission has infonned us that they will be proposing amendments to the
      sentencing guidelines on May I st to resolve the disparity between crack and powder
      cocaine sentences. In 1995, the Sentencing Commission recommended that crack
      cocaine sentencing guidelines be reduced to powder cocaine levels. Congress passed
      legislation rejecting those recommendations and the President signed this legislation. It
      appears Sentencing Commission will now propose a "pinch" solution -- lower crack
      penalties partially and raise powder cocaine penalties.

       Outstanding issue: Administration position on any changes to sentencing guidelines
       needs to be detennined.

      Communications Decency Act -- which makes transmitting indecent material on the
     Internet punishable by two years in prison and a $250,000 fine. A decision striking
     down the provision as unconstitutional could come down early this summer.

       Action: We should begin considering legislation that would address an adverse Court
       decision.
