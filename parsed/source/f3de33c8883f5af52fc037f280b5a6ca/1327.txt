TEXT.:
Two thoughts:

--May is teen pregnancy prevention month and it is also the one year
anniversary of the National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy.  The
Campaign's full board will be in town ealry May to celebrate (the Board is
full of celebraties and politicans). Could make a good early May event.

--On the child care front, two of the three ideas we sent over aren't
bad:   1) expanding the use of child care resource and referral agencies
and 2)   training welfare moms to become child care workers per the
Kentucky program. Are these two ideas knickedout?
