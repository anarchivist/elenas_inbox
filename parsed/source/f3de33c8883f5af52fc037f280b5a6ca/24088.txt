Subject:         Treasury Draft Bill for Clearance this afternoon

You will shortly receive a Treasury legislative proposal entitled,
Termination of Thrift Depositor Protection Oversight Board (LRM REJ 130) .
Treasury reports the House Banking Committee is willing to consider the
proposal at its reconciliation markup tomorrow.  They also report the
proposed legislation has been endorsed by HUD and the Federal Reserve.
Copies of memoranda endorsing the abolition of the Oversight Board
signed by the Under Secretary Hawke, Chairman Greenspan, and Sec. Cuomo,
and a letter from Sec. Cuomo to Sec. Rubin endorsing this legislative
proposal, will be attached to the draft bill.

IF WE DO NOT HEAR FROM YOU BY THE DEADLINE, WE WILL ASSUME YOU HAVE NO
OBJECTION TO THE PROPOSED DRAFT BILL.
