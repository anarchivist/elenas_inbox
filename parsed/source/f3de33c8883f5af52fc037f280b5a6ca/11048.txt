Just wanted to give you all a brief download on the plans for next week's
Americorps event.

Date:             Wednesday, February 10
Time:             1:50pm - 2:50pm
Location:         Ritchie Coliseum, University of Maryland campus


They are planning to have approximately 1,700 people in attendance, to
include about 300 Americorps members (plus 100 more on the stage),
students from the University of Maryland and other local colleges,
students from Maryland high schools, Americorp VIPs (partners, etc.), and
Congressional Members and staff.

Basic messages will be:  l)talk about budget requests for Americorp
funding this year and plans to go to 100,000 members a year by 2002;
2)kick-off the national recruitment campaign "A Call to Service"; and 3)
highlight POTUS's commitment to service.

Program:
President Mote of the University of Maryland
Rep. Steny Hoyer
Sen. Sarbanes (T)
Sen. Mikulski (T)
Gov. Glendening (T)
Harris Wofford
MTV PSA
3 Americorp Member (testimonials -- similar to the MTV video -- total of 1
-2 minutes)
POTUS

There will also be a pre-program, which currently includes:
Lt. Gov. Kathleen Kennedy-Townsend
Eli Segal
Judy McGrath, President, MTV Network
Univ. of MD Pep Band

The backdrop will likely be a large Americorp symbol, with verbage still
TBD, and the 100 Americorp members.  The cutaway will likely be students
and a sign that says "Getting Things Done!".

That's it for now!
