TEXT:
BR/EK:

Here's a new idea to bring the family together on the release of the gun
shows report ...

- Next Friday (1/21) have Jim Johnson and Eric Holder do an embargoed
brief for Monday mornings papers w/5 print reporters and perhaps a
network;

- Have VP release at event in CA that Monday (1/24), along w/$300 million
in crime victims money that will get good regional press; and

- Draft bill ahead of time and have Senator Lautenberg and Rep.
Blagoievich introduce on Monday and hold press conference w/gun advocates.

Alternatively, we could do for the Mayors' meeting on Friday (1/29).
However, this may only beg the question of where we are on the pending
litigation ... which we may need to figure out before then anyway.

Jose'
