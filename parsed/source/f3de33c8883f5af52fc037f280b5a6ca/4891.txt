FYI, Dan Tarullo met with Shalala yesterday morning and agreed on the
following points:

1. The trade issues should be handled low-key, but we should also push
harder internally to get tobacco off the table in trade negotiations.   We
can point to the absense of trade actions (as compared to the 1980s) as
this Administration's policy statement.  It's too easy to antagonize
Congress on this one.

2. Should push to conclude commercial guidelines, along the lines of the
most recent State Department draft (which I have not circulated
inter-agency as of yet). These could be rolled-out at a Gore-Shalala
event, but should try to include someone from Commerce (new head of
Foreign Commercial Service if confirmed) or State.

3. HHS will cooperate with Treasury on creation of a new fund using
non-appropriated resources. HHS staff will begin doing homework on
absorbtion cpacity of intended recipients (primarily multilateral
institutions, but also some bilateral programs and, presumably, NGOs).
will then have to get together later this fall with Treasury, legal types,
to structure how such a fund will work.

             Cigarette tax hike a smuggler's
             boon?
             U.S., Canadian law officials say yes

             BY MARK JOHNSON
             Media General News Service

             It's a losing proposition but one you can't refuse.
             It's the politics of contraband. It's the smuggler's blues.
             -- "Smuggler's Blues" by Glenn Frey

             CORNWALL, Ontario

          The radio squawked, piercing both the night's stillness and
the parking
          lot conversation. A Royal Canadian Mounted Police constable
out on
          surveillance reported that a boat on the St. Lawrence River
was
          approaching shore at a suspected smuggler's house three doors
from the
          Blue Anchor bar.

             "Yee-ha!"   shouted Georges Levere, a Cornwall police officer
on special
             assignment, as he and two other members of the RCMP's regional
             anti-smuggling task force scrambled into their vehicles.

           The "mounties"   -- in casual street clothes and unmarked
vehicles, not red
           tunics and horses -- fanned out to different positions. The
constable
           watching the smugglers reported men unloading boxes from the
boat and,
           when a van arrived more than an hour later, loading the
freight in back. A
           lookout for the smugglers walked to the road and scoute9 each
direction,


            then gave a thumbs up.

            The van was rolling .       . and so were the mounties. From their
disparate
            points, the cars spun gravel and sped off to converge a safe
distance
            behind the van. They didn't want to be spotted yet.

             "Stay loose. Stay loose,"      Cpl. Norm Turcotte radioed to his
team. The
            van might lead them to a warehouse.

          But amid the confusion of the pursuit, with mounties calling
out directions
          and locations, the smuggler exited off Highway 40l at
McConnell
          Avenue, and the mounties all missed the turn.

             , 'I missed McConnell, "   an agitated constable barke.d into the
radio.

          The mounties floored their accelerators, doubled back and
caught up with
          their target heading north to Toronto. Turcotte ordered the
units in, calling
          in a marked RCMP cruiser to help make the stop. They would
need the
          big lights and siren if the smuggler made a dash for it.

           There was no resistance. The 56-year-old driver, a laid-off
cabbie trying
           to make money, cooperated quietly. The mounties' flashlights
revealed a
           load of boxes covered by a blanket. Levere opened the side
door, pulled
           up a box off the floor and ripped the trash bag that concealed
one of the
           boxes, revealing the unmistakable big red letters: Marlboro.
The van held
           19 cases. That's 950 cartons or 190,000 visits to Marlboro
country.

            Turcotte, a stocky Quebecer, turned to his American guest.

           "This is what you guys have coming if you raise your
(cigarette) taxes," he
          said.

          On both sides of Canada's border with the United States,
front-line law
          enforcement officials predict that if the United States
imposes a $l.50 per
          pack price increase as proposed by President Clinton,
cigarette smuggling
          will boom.

             , 'A nightmare, "   said Jeff Groh, an agent with the Bureau of
Alcohol,
             Tobacco and Firearms who, until moving to headquarters in
April, led


             cigarette and liquor smuggling investigations in the western
states.

           Groh and some of the ATF's most expert investigators on
tobacco and
           alcohol smuggling said smugglers view their trade as low risk
because of
           the modest criminal penalties compared with violent crime.
After all, a
           suspect has to possess 60,000 illegal cigarettes before the
ATF will
           consider making a criminal case.

             , 'If you've got 300 cartons and one hanging out of your mouth,
you better
             eat that one,"   said Joseph P. Dougherty, an ATF agent in the
Washington
             headquarters who worked for eight years in New York.

          A $15 jump in the store price of a carton of cigarettes only
will enhance
          the allure of tax-free illegal smokes.

           , '(Smuggling) will increase exponentially, " Dougherty said.
, 'You're going
           to see it in areas where you don't see it no~."

           The one twist that could avert at least some smuggling is if
the $1. 50 per
           pack increase comes in some form other than a tax, the agents
said.

           Congress soon will consider the price increase as part of
legislation that
           would settle lawsuits by more than two dozen states against
the nation's
           largest tobacco companies. The White House proposed that the
$1. 50
           , 'penalty" be added in order to, among other purposes,
discourage
           smoking and pay for smoking prevention programs for children.

          If Congress slaps the penalty directly on the cigarette
makers, it will boost
          the price at the factory instead of later as a tax. In that
scenario,
          smugglers may not be able to avoid it, ATF agents said.

             Smuggling works in different ways, but the most common, and
what
             Canada saw in droves a few years ago, starts with a cigarette
wholesaler
           buying from the factory and then selling to an exporter. In
the united
           States, for example, neither the wholesaler nor the exporter
has to pay
           federal tax -- currently $2.40 a carton -- on export
cigarettes, since they
           are intended for foreign sale. Exports also avoid state
cigarette taxes,


             which run from 2.5 cents per pack in Virginia to $l per pack
in Alaska.

             The exporter usually will ship the cigarettes to a specially
licensed
             warehouse just outside the country. Canadian smugglers often
ship
           Canadian cigarettes to the United States, especially Indian
reservations
           where, by federal law, cigarettes and other commodities are
sold tax-free.
           Smugglers then slip the cigarettes back into Canada and sell
them at
           below-market prices that still reap enormous profit. They also
smuggle
           untaxed American brand cigarettes into Canada, such as the
vanload of
           Marlboros, but the market for them is limited.

             By the early 1990s, Canada's cigarette taxes had ratcheted up
the price
             of a carton from around $20 to about $47. The higher price
included
             about $37. in tax, a large chunk of which helps pay for the
nation's
             health-care system.

           The dramatically higher price was' 'engendering a smuggling
situation, ' ,
           said Dave McDonald, chief of intelligence operations for the
Cornwall
           office of Canada's Customs Bureau.

             Smuggling grew rampant, and Cornwall turned into a sort of
nicotine
             gateway. This small industrial town sits along the border at
the St.
             Lawrence River and abuts the Akwesasne Mohawk reservation. The
             reservation straddles Ontario, Quebec and New York state,
making it
             easy to ship contraband from one nation to the other. In 1994,
when
             taxes hit their peak, the mounties in Cornwall seized 103,000
cartons of
          illegal cigarettes, roughly twice the amount they currently
confiscate. In the
          more populous eastern provinces of Ontario and Quebec, illegal
cigarette
          sales were starting to rival legal distribution.

          The federal government, followed by the eastern provincial
governments,
          lowered the taxes to where a carton costs about $21. The
smuggling
          trade collapsed but only temporarily. The western provincial
governments
          refused to lower their taxes, and the smugglers eventually
started selling
          there.


             " I t took a while for them to be able to mobilize their lines
of
             communication into these other provinces to take advantage of
the other
             markets that were there, "   McDonald said. In addition, the
taxes have
          crept back up in Ontario and Quebec, pushing the price of
cigarettes to
          about $27 a carton.

          Anti-smoking activists dismiss smuggling forecasts as a
preventable
          problem that's been exaggerated. They argue that tobacco
companies
          could help stop most illegal sales but won't, because black
market
          cigarettes simply mean more consumption and more profit. The
cigarette
          makers, however, usually cite smuggling as a reason not to
raise cigarette
          taxes.

             A federal grand jury in Syracuse, N.Y., is investigating R.J.
Reynolds
             Tobacco Co.'s possible ties to an alleged smuggling ring that
shipped
          $687 million worth of illegal cigarettes and liquor through
the Akwesasne
          Mohawk reservation from 1992 to 1996. Federal court documents
          unsealed in August disclosed that a Reynolds marketing agent
spent a
          fishing vacation with three of the accused smugglers and
listened to
          conversations about the smuggling operation.

             While ATF officials agree that, as one agent said,   "there is
no moral
          turpitude clause"  for the tobacco industry, they say their
concerns about
          higher taxes encouraging smuggling already are borne out
within this
          country. Cigarettes sold in low-tax states such as North
Carolina, South
          Carolina and virginia are trucked to high-tax states such as
Michigan.

             "You'll get a lot of states saying they don't have a problem.
The
          anti-smoking people will say there's no problem,"       said Jane
Gazzaniga, an
          ATF analyst who focuses on smuggling.

             ATF officials say it is difficult to persuade supervisors and
federal
             prosecutors to devote investigators and money to combat
illegal
          cigarettes. The public, however, may not realize that, as
Canada found
          out, contraband cigarettes can quickly take over a large share
of the


             market with nobody paying taxes on them. The state and the
federal
             governments then lose revenue.

             "(What's) going to make up that loss?"    asked Jerry Bowerman,
chief of
             ATF's anti-smuggling division.   "Income tax and other taxes."

             More immediately threatening are the crimes connected to
smuggling.

             "There's a certain amount of violence associated with these
groups, "    said
             Bob Leary, an ATF agent based in Buffalo, N.Y.

           The nature of   the crime and the criminal have changed. It's no
longer three
           guys from New   York in a van driving to the Carolinas to get
smokes for
           the cigarette   machines in their bar. The smuggling rings are
organized,
           sophisticated   and willing to protect their assets, law
enforcement officials
           said.

             In Cornwall during the week when the mounties caught the van
of
          Marlboros, their boat was shot at two nights in a row by
smugglers on the
          Akwesasne reservation.

             "It's scare tactics,"   said Levere.   "And it's working."

          Dougherty, who has tackled everything from firearms
trafficking to
          conspiracy cases, offered a prediction. Amqng the crimes that
concern
          the public and receive law enforcement's attention, cigarette
smuggling
          ranks low on the priority list. Unless it gets more violent,
he said, it will
          stay there.
