TEXT:
I am assuming the plan is still to do this the week after next.  We could
really use it. As I mentioned, I think OMB should send it over to EEOC
for a quick look and to answer the question: What procedures are in place
now or what types of procedures should be implemented to enforce the
requirements of the order relating to sexual orientation. We will get
this question and it would be good to have their answer ready.  Thanks.

Enjoying the tobacco wars?
