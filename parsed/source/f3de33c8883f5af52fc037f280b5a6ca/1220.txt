                                      Q&A
               The Federal Government Plan to Hire Welfare Recipients

Question:   Does the President have specific hiring figures in mind?

Answer:     The directive asks agency and department heads to each prepare an individualized
            plan for hiring welfare recipients that will include each agency's results from
            surveying where jobs exist and what kind of jobs are available. From these
            survey results, each agency will decide on its own target numbers. We can't set
            blanket targets because all agencies are different. Some have more hiring capacity
            than others and some more entry level jobs than others. We need to let each
            agency figure out how it can best become involved.

Question:   How much will this effort cost?

Answer:     We don't expect it to cost anything. One of the usual functions performed by
            departments is that of personnel. Most departments build in these necessary
            activities as part of a minimal budget. We also expect to make this a priority
            within our existing budget.

Question:   Are we talking about jobs in Washington, D.C.?

Answer:     We're talking about jobs all over the country. More than 85 percent of federal
            jobs are located outside the Washington metropolitan area.

Question:   Will the White House directly hire welfare recipients?

Answer:     Absolutely. lodie Torkelson, who handles management and administration for the
            White House, is working hard to put together a program at the White House. In
            fact, her staff is looking at Marriot's hiring program for welfare recipients and the
            job placement and support organization America Works, as well as others, as
            possible models for a White House hiring plan.

Question:   How many welfare recipients will the White House hire?

Answer:     lust as the Federal agencies need to survey hiring capacity and types of jobs
            available, so does the White House. But I know lodie is rearing to go on this and
            will have a program up and running in no time.

Question:   What is the date of the Cabinet meeting?

Answer:     The President will hold the cabinet meeting, as stated in the directive,
            approximately 30 days from the date ofthis directive.
                                                                       flex-Dump Comersion

Question:   Aren't you favoring welfare recipients over everyone else?

Answer:     We are not creating any preference or incentive such as those that exist for
            veterans. We are encouraging the departments to work with the existing hiring
            authorities they now have the option to use and we will ensure they are well
            infonned on how to use all hiring and support avenues available to them.

Question:   Why are we specifically helping welfare recipients rather than other equally needy
            groups?

Answer:     We make no apologies about the fact that we are asking the agencies to hire single
            mothers with children. This group is one of the most crucial to reach. We want
            to help these families move from dependence on welfare to independence through
            self-sufficiency.

Question:   Is this the final step?

Answer:     No. This is a first set of steps. Agencies will begin working right away to
            identify available jobs, reach out to welfare recipients to notify them of those jobs,
            and to fully use the existing programs to help recipients take and keep the jobs.

Question:   Yo).! and others in the Administration have mentioned several times that there
            were many hurdles to enacting a hiring program? What were those hurdles and
            how did you overcome them?

Answer:     The Federal hiring process is nonnally complex. We sat down and looked at all
            of the existing rules and regulations guiding federal hiring. We were pleasantly
            surprised to find that we could hire welfare recipients under existing authority and
            offer them the supports necessary to stay in jobs, also through existing programs.
            All of the government agencies want to become involved in this effort. However,
            most have been unaware that they could do so under existing authority. It is our
            job to make sure every agency and department head now becomes aware of the
            hiring and support options that are available.

Question:   How are you going to hire welfare recipients at a time government is downsizing
            and budgets are tough?

Answer:     In June 1996, after the Worker-Trainee program became fully operational, 7,000
            placements had been made across the country during a time of tight budgets and
            personnel ceilings. Entry-level jobs exist. Now that the President has increased
            the earned-income tax credit, added significant additional funds for child care,
            raised the minimum wage, and doubled child support coliections, work now pays
            more than welfare so welfare recipients will make the rational choice to work

            rather than remain on welfare.

Question:   Is this effort really going to do any good? How many entry level people can the
            Federal government actually hire?

Answer:     In just this last fiscal year, the Federal government hired over 27,000 employees
            with annual pay up to $16,500, a number that goes up to 87,900 when reviewing
            those hired at salaries up to $24,500.
