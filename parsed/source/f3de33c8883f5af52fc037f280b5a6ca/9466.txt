    I believe this captures where we are at present:

    Education Event Next Week: We are working with Sen. DaschleD,s and Rep.
    GephardtD,s offices to plan an education event next week, that will
    showcase Democratic unity around your education agenda and challenge the
    Republicans to (bring your agenda up for a vote before Congress leaves) or
      (ensure that the final appropriations bill meets your overall funding
    request for education and specifically includes funding for class size
    reduction) or (ensure that the final appropriations bill meets your
    overall funding request for education and specifically includes funding
    for class size reduction, and school construction) .
