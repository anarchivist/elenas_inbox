PRINTER FONT 12 - POINT- ROMAN
DRAFT STATEMENT
ON THE NINTH CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS DECISION TO FORCE
ADDITIONAL SALES OF OLD GROWTH TIMBER
        I am very concerned about the Republican rush to reignite
the timber wars of the Pacific Northwest, and I am deeply
disappointed in the court's decision to force us to release these
sales of healthy ancient timber.
        I had expressed my concerns about the environmental
consequences of the logging legislation, but I received repeated
assurances from Congress that we could implement the statute in
an environmentally
o
-responsible way. We strongly believed that
these sales of ancient timber were not covered by that
legislation.
        I am sorry that the courts found differently.  We fought
this case to the bitter end and now the Justice Department has
advised me that we cannot appeal. Therefore, we have no choice
but to comply with the court's decision. The court's decision
forces us to release timber that may lead to irreparable
environmental injury to chinook salmon, the northern spotted owl
and other endangered or threatened wildlife.


        Consequently, I calIon the timber industry to work
voluntarily to mitigate this harm or to restrict cutting to those
areas less likely to harm salmon and other species. They tell
the Forest Service they want to do the right thing. Now, they
should do the right thing.
 [      These same battles were fought in the years before my
Northwest Forest Plan. We were able to maintain a balance
between timber sales and a healthy environment. We ushered in a
new era of sustainable, stable and predictable timber supply. As
a result, management of our public lands in the Northwest moved
out of the courts and back into the hands of public lands
managers where it belongs. 1
 [      In signing the 1995 Rescission Act and in subsequent
directives to my cabinet, I pledged to uphold existing
environmental laws and standards except when forced to do
otherwise. We will continue to do that and challenge those who
interpret differently the language in that law. 1
        As displayed through their actions and rhetoric, it is clear
that congressional Republicans are more interested in appeasing
special interests than listening to scientists warning of

environmental damage -- or to a public demanding environmental
protection.
