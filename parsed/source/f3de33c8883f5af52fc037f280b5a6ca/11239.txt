TEXT:
Thought it might be helpful to give you the frame work IGA and I have
developed for John's talking points to the DGA.   Could your shop also help
me get some talking points that appropriately tee-up our education issues
for the governors (dealing with implementation, federal vs. state role,
etc ... )? Sec. Riley will talk education specifics with the governors
after John speaks.   Thanks again. k


Outline the current political environment and the opportunities that we
have (especially in a post-impeachment context) .

Review the years agenda and themes:
           Social Security
           Medicare
           Education Accountability
           Child Care
           Health care
           Environment/Livability

Emphasize that we have submitted a budget that meets the governors
requests for full funding of existing programs, and that provides targeted
increases in many state priorities (such as Head Start, class size, and
welfare reform).

Note that we see many of these as political/public wins, especially in
areas such as our livability agenda and our education agenda.

Recognize that we have some differences, in particular on the role the
federal government will play in education efforts, and on tobacco
recoupment.
