Thanks for the info.  I think we need further consideration before
proposing unequal treatment of Puerto Ricans in Even Start, Safe &
Drug-Free Schools, and migratory children's education.   What is the
policy reason for such discrimination? The 2nd ranking Dem. on the House
committee, George Miller, is concerned about this. So, too, is Puerto
Rico's Romero, who's on the committee.   Hispanic Members of Congress
just wrote the President asking him to propose phasing in equal treatment
of Puerto Rico in the (few) programs where it is not now treated
equally.   Many of the Puerto Rican kids who would not receive equal aid
will wind up in the States.
