TEXT:
I've talked to two of the groups (Caroline Smith DeWaal from Center for
Science and the Public Interest and Heather from Safe Tables Our
Priority), and they both say they would prefer that the WH be on the
Council because they think the agencies are too much wedded to the status
quo.  Heather said that in the past the agencies were not particularly
forward looking (particularly when they were implementing HACCP) .
Caroline was particularly adamant that WH participation be on the Council
because if WH weren't on the Council, it would send a message to the
consumer groups that we were sticking with the status quo.  In addition,
she was concerned with deadlock between USDA and HHS.

I am still trying to reach Carol Tucker Forman from the Food Safety
Coalition.   I will send you the latest draft of the executive order in a
few minutes.
