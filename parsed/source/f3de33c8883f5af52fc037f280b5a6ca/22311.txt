BR/EK:

 FYI -- Folks at DOJ called me to say that the AG had Ann Harkins call to
 complain to Maria Echaveste that we're not doing outreach now to
 cops/members cuts to Byrne and state prisons.  While I'm worried about the
 reaction to these cuts, we have reached out to all the law enforcement
 groups and told them that the budget had good news (COPS II) and bad
,(state and local funding not gowing up anymore, some cuts ... but no more
 details).  I plan on doing further outreach as we get closer to the
 budget, but I'm not sure I see the wisdom in giving folks all the details
 a couple of weeks out .... jose
