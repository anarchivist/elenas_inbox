TEXT:
HHS had a counter-suggestion to our suggestion.   Actually, I'm not sure
it's so bad. HHS's concern about our suggested language was that it
appeared too much to invite racially neutral criteria with a
disproportionate impact.   But their new effort is more positive than their
old.  I think it's OK, although m~ybe I'm just getting tired.   Is this OK
with everyone?

Intro:
The Act imposes a S-year limit on receipt of TANF benefits.  However, a
state may allow hardship exemptions from the time limit for up to 20%of
its caseload.

DPC Suggestion:
A racially neutral criterion that excludes a disproportionately greater
number of minorities than non-minorities is permissible, so long as there
is a substantial and legitimate justification for this criterion and there
is no comparably effective alternative that excludes fewer minorities.

HHS Counter-Suggestion:
States should take care in establishing the criteria for allowing such
exemptions particularly where racially neutral criteria exclude a
disproportionately greater number of minorities than non-minorities.
Neutral criteria that cause a significantly disproportionate exclusion are
permissible, only so long as there is a substantial and legitimate
justification for these criteria and there is no comparably effective
alternative that excludes fewer minorities.


 [For those who want to cast their minds back, here is HHS's original
version that we didn't like, FYI.]
HHS Original Version:
States and counties may not use a racially neutral criterion that,
nevertheless, excludes a disproportionately greater number of minorities
than non-minorities to determine who will be granted this exemption,
unless there is a substantial and legitimate justification for this
criterion.   Even if there is such a justification, this criterion cannot
be used if there is a comparably effective alternative to identify persons
who qualify for this exemption that excludes fewer minorities.
