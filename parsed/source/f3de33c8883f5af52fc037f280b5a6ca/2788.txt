Background

While the rate of minority enrollment continues to increase overall, the rate of growth has been
slowing in recent years. Sharp declines in minority admissions and enrollment in both
California and Texas demonstrate the stark impact of rolling back affirmative action in those
states and jeopardize efforts to increase college-going among minorities.

·      Minority enrollment still increasing overall, but rate of growth is slowing -- While
       overall enrollment of students of color in colleges and universities rose by 2.9 percent
       between 1994 and 1995 (the latest year for which data is available), this is down from
       gains of 4.6 percent between 1993 and 1994 and 7.1 percent between 1992 and 1993.

·      Sharp declines have occurred in minority admissions in California and Texas-- The
       University of California and the University of Texas at Austin have recently reported
       substantial declines in African-American and Hispanic applicants and acceptances. In
       both states the sharp declines in minority admissions are attributed to roll-backs of
       affirmative action--in California, by the UC Board of Regents, and in Texas by the 5th
       Circuit's Hopwood decision. American Council of Education (ACE), Minorities in Higher Education 1996·97.

       ·           California -- The number of black students admitted to UCLA law school
                   dropped by 80% in one year and is now the lowest since the early 1970s. Boalt
                   Hall Law School at UC Berkeley admitted just 14 black students out of a class of
                   792, down from 75 in 1996. Washifl!,10n Post. 5/19/97, p. AI

       ·          Texas -- At the University of Texas, nearly 400 fewer blacks and Hispanics have
                  been offered undergraduate admission, a 20% drop in one year. Just 14 blacks
                  have been offered admission at the UT law school, down from 65; in May, the
                  sole African American who had accepted an admission offer withdrew. [Note:
                  Developments in Texas have caused such a furor that Gov. Bush has signed a law
                  mandating that the top 10% of graduates of all Texas high schools be admitted to
                  all of the state's public colleges and universities). Washinb"on Post. 5119/97. p. AI; Dallas Morning

Ouestions and Answers

Question:         Are you concerned about reports of declining enrollments of minority students in
                  postsecondary education?

Answer:           These trends are disturbing and completely unacceptable. Educational
                  opportunity is the touchstone of the American dream, and figures like these raise a
                  serious concern that the doors of college education are being closed to minority
                  students. In addition, diversity in education helps prepare all our students to be
                  productive citizens in the 21 st century, so these developments should concern
                                                                Automated Records Management System
                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion


Question:          What is your administration doing to address this problem?

Answer:            We are working on several fronts to address this issue:

               ·   We will continue to intervene in litigation in support of appropriate affirmative
                   action programs. The Department of Education is looking for a good opportunity
                   to challenge the Hopwood decision, and the Department of Justice has filed a brief
                   challenging California's Proposition 209.

               ·   The Office for Civil Rights at the Department of Education is conducting a review
                   of the Texas higher education system to ensure that Texas has eliminated all
                   remnants of its former de jure segregated system.

               ·   And, more broadly, the Administration is pressing higher education officials to
                   maintain and expand diversity, and offering assistance to them to do so. For
                   example, we have called on colleges and universities burdened by new legal
                   restrictions to develop new and creative approaches to achieving diversity, such as
                   aggressively recruiting in secondary schools with high percentages of minority
                   students and forming educational partnerships with such schools.
