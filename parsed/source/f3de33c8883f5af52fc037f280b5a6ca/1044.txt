TEXT:
Around the work supp, I'm not sure if there are labor issues so I asked
OPM to check it out. The labor lawyer was not in yesterday, so he/she?
will look at this morning. There may be no issue at all.

Also, on the new version, note that I added two additional ideas: under
Make Work Pay I added the EITC piece (see paper). The Feds aren't doing
it now and should be.  It's a good and very easy thing to do.

Second, under the incentives section, I added preference to those
competing for government contracts who have hired welfare recipients.
Similar programs exist now: HUD construction contractors are currently
required, to the extent possible, to hire low-income individuals to work
on the construction projects and Government contracts are also given
preferentially to minority-owned businesses. I have a call into GSA to
explore this.
