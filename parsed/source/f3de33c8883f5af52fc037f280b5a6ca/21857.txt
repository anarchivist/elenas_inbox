TEXT:
At the dinner on Tuesday night, several people asked the President if he
would consider making a pitch for the hate crimes bill in the SOTU.   He
said he would think about it in the context of the actual speech. There
has been some internal discussion of the value of inviting Matthew
Shepard's parents to watch from the box.
