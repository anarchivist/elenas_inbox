    Esteemed Colleagues:

    New Fop'press release.   It's going to be a rough couple of days on this
    issue.  I think we've suceeded in ramping up the participation and press
    coverage for the planned protest tomorrow.   I guess there's no turning
    back on this now, but, at a minimum, somebody needs to speak with Gil and
    both deliver our position.and apologize for announcing this the press
    first (especially while the FOP and police unions were in a meeting withe
    VP and on their way to a bill signing!). Christa and I both think that
    this merits no less than an Erskine call, but I'm sure others may feel
    differently. Can you please let us know if this comes up in senior
    staff? While I'm sure some folks will continue to want to kick the can,
    we're way past that now.   If we're ever to re-establish ties withe FOP,
    we'll need some high-level damage control.

    Jose'

    bFOP: Clinton Reaches 'Height of Hypocrisy'

        WASHINGTON, June 16 /U.S. Newswire/ -- Gilbert G. Gallegos,


national president of the Grand Lodge, Fraternal Order of Police,
lost no time today responding to remarks made by the president's
press secretary, Mike McCurry, stating that President Clinton would
not support, as he had promised, collective bargaining rights for
federal law enforcement officers.
    "Mr. McCurry's statements today made it plain that given a
choice, the president prefers hypocrisy to granting basic
bargaining rights to the uniformed officers who risk their lives to
protect him,"  said Gallegos.
    In September 1996, President Clinton held a private meeting with
the Executive Board of the Fraternal Order of Police to discuss
collective bargaining issues. The president stated that, as a
strong supporter of collective bargaining rights, it would be the
"height of hypocrisy"   for him not to support the same rights for
federal law enforcement officers.

    The Fraternal Order of Police is the nation's largest
organization of law enforcement professionals, with more than
272,000 members.
