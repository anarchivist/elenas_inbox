 I'm sorry I didn't respond sooner to your email-- I accidentally
 overlooked it.  I think we need to find out a lot more about the specifics
 of this policy and what we're doing in our budget on detention.  I'm
 expecting INS to send over more detailed information on this plan.   I
 agree with Jose' that it seems an untenable position to release possibly
 violent criminals out onto the street due to space problems.

 I had some difficulty reaching some people who could be useful on this
 earlier today.  I will get in touch with them and try to pull together
 more information to get a better picture on where things stand.  It sounds
 like it might be necessary to haul in INS for a meeting on this soon to   ·
 figure out what other options exist.

 Here's the Q&A.   This INS plan is going to cause us greater heartburn in
 the future.

                                   Question and Answer
                                     February 4,1999


Q.   Today, the Washington Post reported that the INS is considering a plan to release
     criminal aliens -- including drug offenders, and aliens smugglers -- into the
     community due to lack of detention space. Is this true?

A.   Recent changes in the law has caused the number of people that INS must detain to
     skyrocket -- and despite the fact that this Administration has dramaticany increased the
     number of criminal aliens removed to their country of origin, and increased detention
     space --- serious problems have arisen with INS' capacity to hold criminal aliens. The
     INS has worked with the Congress to find an acceptable answer to this problem but has
     not yet been able to come up with a satisfactory solution. As a result, INS is exploring a
     variety of options to solve this problem.

     It should be clear that INS' primary concern for any plan is the impact on public safety.
     Among the options being considered are removing additional people to their country of
     origin, and alternatives for detention for those who do not pose a threat to the community.
      In addition, the INS is looking into separate plans for each local facility to detain the
     highest risk aliens and release those that present the lowest risk to the community. This
     plan is still being developed and is not final. Reports of releasing criminals is premature.
      INS is focused on protecting the community as its first priority and satisfying the
     requirements set out in the law.
