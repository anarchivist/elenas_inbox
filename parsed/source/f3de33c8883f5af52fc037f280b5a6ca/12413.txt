Chairman
Committee on the Judiciary

Washington, D.C. 20510

Dear Mr. Chairman:

         As you know, yesterday I unveiled a comprehensive proposal to strengthen our federal
firearms laws in four important ways: (1) by expanding the successful Brady Law; (2) by further
restricting youth access to guns; (3) by cracking down on illegal gun traffickers; and (4) by
strengthening the Ban on Assault Weapons. In the coming days, I will transmit this legislation
to Congress. Frankly, there is nothing in this proposal that Congress should not be able to pass
this year. Its provisions are common sense and build on efforts that have already proven to be
effective in keeping guns out of the hands of criminals and youth. For instance, consider some
of the specific provisions:

       My legislation will extend Brady background checks to all gun show sales, as well as to
       the purchase of explosives. Justice Department studies show that Brady background
       checks have stopped hundreds of thousands of illegal handgun sales. Certainly they can
       do the same if applied to gun shows and explosives.

       My legislation will raise the age ofthe current youth handgun ban from 18 to 21 years of
       age. With ATF gun trace data showing that more crime guns are traced to 18 and
       19 year-olds than all other age groups, how can we not make this change?

       My bill will also ban youth possession of existing semiautomatic assault rifles and
       large capacity ammunition clips with more than 10 rounds of ammunition. In
       1994, you and other RepUblicans stood up to the gun lobby and supported the
       original Ban on Assault Weapons. Is it unreasonable to consider legislation to keep
       those same weapons out of the hands of all juveniles?

       And my legislation will limit handgun sales to no more than one per month per person, so
       that gun runners -- hiding behind straw purchasers -- cannot buy handguns in bulk and
       divert them to the street. It will also help law enforcement to trace more crime guns to
       their source, and to crack down on gun dealers involved in illegal gun trafficking.

        For more than six years now, we have made great progress in reducing gun-related crime
and violence in America. In fact, the number of violent crimes committed with guns has
dropped by more than 25 percent during that time. Gun violence, however, remain a serious
problem in our nation, and much more needs to be done. Passing comprehensive firearms
legislation is one thing we can and should do to address this important issue. In the coming
weeks, I hope you will give my legislation every possible consideration.
