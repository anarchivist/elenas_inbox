TEXT:
By some legislative fluke, the Smithsonian is not covered by any of the
anti-discrimination statutes. Nonetheless, there are pending cases with
the Smithsonian involving Title VII, the Rehabilitation Act, and the
Americans with Disabilities Act which are stayed pending a legislative
fix.  DOJ is proposing a legislative fix to add back in these three
statutes but not the Equal Pay Act.   DOJ is proposing to add back in
these 3 statutes as a Manager's Amendment to the conference committee on
the Rehabilitation Act amendments. DOJ wanted to send this to Harkin's
staff on Monday, but I asked them if they could wait to send it to the
Hill until after our Equal Pay Event on Wednesday, June 10. Let me know
if you are fine with this proposal as long as it is after our event.
Thanks, Mary
