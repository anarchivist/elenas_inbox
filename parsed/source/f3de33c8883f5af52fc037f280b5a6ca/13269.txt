TEXT:
        I agree with the earlier emails that we should move ahead
with our meeting with Gorton. This court decision makes it all
the more essential.
        Given the delays in the reconciliation schedule and the
time it will take us to work through the key issues on the
Interior bill, we do have a little time.  I would not accelerate
our meeting with Gorton ahead of whenever we are going to meet
next on the Interior bill.
        But I would try to schedule a meeting on the timber issue
with him as soon after that as possible.  That should be mid- to
late-week coming up.
        We also need to carry out the other consultations we
discussed at our "western issues" meeting early this week.   I am
scheduled to have a phone conversation with Peter DeFazio on
Monday. We all agreed that Wyden needs to be informed, too. But
I don't recall that anyone actually took responsibility for it.
I'm happy to help out, but has anyone been in touch with him or
his staff?
        With respect to paper,  when are we doing to give our
text out? So far, very few people on the Hill have our text and
none of it appears to have leaked out. We could complete these
pre-Gorton discussions without paper and then review and finalize
the text to reflect what we've heard. That way we can "consult",
not have it get out before we're ready, and honestly consider
reactions. There's at least one change we may want to make
already, to the "like kind and volume" requirement for
replacement timber to respond to some Oregon recommendations.
