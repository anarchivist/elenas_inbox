TEXT:
You're right about not all parents -- but I think an argument can be made
that no parent starts out wanting to abuse their kids, and it just sounds
odd to say almost or nearly all. I would still argue that the President
should say "all".

The reason I suggested omitting the federal research line is that I
thought it sounded better on the one pager,  the same reason I suggested
taking out the line about Administration achievements in the announcement.
