Has Elena signed off on this? I am printing and will read.
What do you think about a letter from Katie asking about why the
report language says the opposite of what Hatfield has been saying
about the court?  (I suspect he will repeat those statements on
the Senate floor during debate, so we will have him on record, but
he also said them in our fairly large meeting with him, LEP etc.)
