                     PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
          RADIO ADDRESS ON GORTON AND GOODLING AMENDMENTS
                           SEPTEMBER 18, 1997

        Good Morning. We are living at a time of great hope, optimism and prosperity in
America. And it's been a banner year for education. Our historic balanced budget contains the
largest investment in higher education since the passage of the G.I. Bill, opening the doors of
college even wider for more Americans. But we cannot rest. We have much more to do to
prepare our children to seize the opportunities of the 21st century.

        I have called upon all Americans to leave politics at the schoolhouse door and work
together to provide our children the best education in the world. Many have answered the call.
Just last week, the Senate voted overwhelmirigly for voluntary national tests in 4th grade reading
and 8th grade math, bringing us an important step closer to setting high standards of academic
excellence that will ensure no child leaves school without mastering the basics.

        But unfortunately, two events in recent days have jeopardized this essential progress in
education. First, the same forces that have resisted education reform for years in the House of
Representatives have voted against developing the national standards we need to challenge
students, improve teaching, empower parents, and increase accountability. In effect, they have
cast votes against better schools and for a status quo that is failing our children.

        Second, the Senate has passed an arnendment that would undermine some of our most
successful efforts to strengthen schools by converting their funding into block grants for states
and local school districts. The amendment would virtually abolish federal efforts to bring
computers to every classroom, to help immigrant children learn English, to create safe and drug
free schools, and to bring more charter schools to more communities across America. This
morning, I will see firsthand just how high the stakes are. I arn visiting the San Carlos Charter
Learning Center in California, one of the many charter schools across our country that are
bringing new life, new energy and new creativity into public education. It's an innovation we
can't afford to lose.

       In the 21st Century, America's children must have a world-class education. We
must strengthen our schools, raise our standards, and demand exceUence at every level.
So if Congress sends me partisan legislation that denies our children high national
standards, or weakens our national commitment to stronger schools, I will give it the failing
grade it deserves - I will veto it.

        Bringing vital change and progress to our schools will take clear vision and great courage.
 Throughout our history, Americans have always risen to the challenge of building better futures
for our children. I know that -- if we all work together -- we, too will be up to the task.
