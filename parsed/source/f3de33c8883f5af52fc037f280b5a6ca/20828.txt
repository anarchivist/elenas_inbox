The Honorable William F. Goodling
Chairman
Committee on Education and the Workforce
House of Representatives
Washington, D.C. 20515

Dear Chairman Goodling:

I am writing to convey the AdministrationD,s position on H.R. 4037, which
attempts to improve electronic access to and understandability of material
safety data sheets.   I regret that the Administration cannot support H.R.
4037 in its current form.   On April 29, 1998, the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration (OSHA) testified before the Subcommittee on
Workforce Protections regarding an earlier version of the bill, H.R.
3519.   At that time, OSHA testified that, although the proposal was well
intentioned, such legislation was unnecessary and unwise at this time.
That view has not. changed with regard to H.R. 4037.

Background.  OSHAD,s Hazard Communication Standard (HCS) guarantees
workers the right to know the hazards and identities of the chemicals to
which they are exposed in their workplaces.   This standard helps prevent
in5uries and illnesses by ensuring that: (1) employers have the
information necessary to design appropriate protective programs to reduce
employee exposures, and (2) workers understand how best to protect
themselves from excessive exposures.

The HCS includes three basic requirements, all of which are necessary
components of an effective hazard communication program.  First, each
container must be labeled with information about the identity and hazards
of the materials it contains. This serves as a quick snapshot of the most
critical information regarding the chemical, and is located where the
employee is using it.  Secondly, the material safety data sheet (MSDS)
must provide detailed information about the chemical, its hazards, and
associated protective measures; it serves as a reference source for
workers, employers, and safety and health professionals. As such, it
contains technical information about a wide range of effects and
protective measures, and has a diverse audience.  Third, the standard
requires that workers be trained.  Training enables the employer to
explain the technical information, ensure that workers know where to get
additional information if necessary, and discuss the protective measures
implemented in that particular workplace for the hazardous chemicals
present.

Electronic Access. As introduced, H.R. 4037 requires OSHA to amend its
Hazard Communication Standard (HCS) to allow electronic access to
MSDSs--access the standard already permits. When the HCS was first
promulgated in 1983, no means of electronic access were available.  As
electronic methods of access developed, OSHA issued interpretations
permitting their use and ultimately revised the HCS in 1994 to reflect
these policies.  Requiring that OSHA undertake a rulemaking to permit
electronic access--access that is already explicitly addressed in the
existing standard--is a duplication of effort and a waste of valuable
resources.

In addition,   the bill specifies "information" to be provided, implying


that the actual MSDS need not be available.  Such language is
unacceptable, and contrary to the intent of the standard. The HCS ensures
workers ready access to information in MSDSs about chemicals used in the
workplace that could endanger their health or safety.   It is important
that workers be able to access the information contained in MSDSs
immediately in the case of an emergency, and as a matter of course when
simply trying to determine how a chemical affects them.

In addition, the emergency back-up provision in the bill is unclear.   The
regulatory text of the HCS does not address this issue. At the
recommendation of the National Advisory Committee on Occupational Safety
and Health (NACOSH), OSHA recently revised a compliance directive which
directly addresses it. NACOSH, which is a tripartite committee of
industry, labor, and public representatives, believes that electronic
access should only be used if there is a back-up system available in the
event of a power outage, system failure, or other emergency. OSHA does
not specify what type of back-up system should be used because the
standard is performance oriented and allows employers flexibility of
compliance options. We know, for example, of employers who have put their
MSDSs on compact disks as a back-up, or who have a freestanding laptop
that is not connected to the system but has the MSDSs. There are a number
of alternative means of addressing this issue.

Standardized Format for MSDSs.  H.R. 4037 requires every MSDS in the
country to be changed. The HCS is performance-oriented and does not
require MSDSs to be in a specific format.  However, there has been a
significant private sector initiative to develop a standard order of
information.  It has been published as an industry consensus standard
under the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). This same format
has been endorsed by industry internationally by the International Council
of Chemical Associations; has been adopted by the European Union; is
permitted to be used in Canada; and is incorporated into a recommendation
of the International Labor Organization.  It thus has significant
endorsement both nationally and internationally.

Development of this ANSI standard was based on significant consultations
with both the producers and users of MSDSs.   ANSI discovered, as OSHA has
during its rulemaking on this subject, that there are many stakeholders
with often different and conflicting views.   ANSI sougnt to address these
views by including an emergency overview for workers and emergency
responders at the beginning of the MSDS, followed by the more specific and
detailed information needed by other MSDS audiences.

Modification of this voluntary industry format   would be required to comply
with H.R. 4037 as drafted.  It would require a   format with an emergency
overview that is different from the one in the   ANSI standard. The burden
imposed on manufacturers would be significant,   without commensurate
measurable benefits.

In addition, there is an extensive international effort underway to
harmonize hazard communication requirements including those for MSDSs.
The work on MSDSs has just begun, and it will be several years before the
completed system is available for implementation. OSHA is actively
involved in this activity, as are stakeholder representatives and other
Federal agencies. The requirement in H.R. 4037 for employers to change
MSDSs now would not only be extremely burdensome, but might also
necessitate a second round of changes within a few years, when an
internationally harmonized system is completed. While a change at that
time would be accompanied by benefits associated with reducing barriers to
trade and increasing overall protection, H.R. 4037 would have no such


benefits.  Rather, H.R. 4037 would require additional near-term cost and
impose an unnecessary, significant paperwork burden associated with
requiring that thousands of MSDSs be prematurely changed.   The MSDS
format should not be changed until an internationally-agreed fOL~,at is
available through the harmonization process.

Study.  Finally, the bill require s the Secretary of Labor to initiate a
study to address the comprehensibility of MSDSs.  OSHA has already funded
a survey by the University of Maryland to assess the literature dealing
with the comprehensibility of MSDSs. The study may meet this
requirement.  If the authors believe another study is required, sufficient
funding should be provided.

OSHAD,s HCS is based on many years of rulemaking, and extensive evidence
in the rulemaking record.  Hazard communication involves complicated
issues and diverse opinions among stakeholders.  The current provisions
represent a balance of the concerns expressed and the needs demonstrated
by these various groups. The Administration agrees that electronic access
to MSDSs, along with efforts to improve the ease with which they are
understood by those who use them, can be beneficial.  However, H.R. 4037
as drafted creates a significant burden with little discernable benefit.
Therefore, we cannot support the bill at this time.

The Office of Management and Budget advises that there is no objection to
the presentation of this report from the standpoint of the
AdministrationD,s program.

                                        Sincerely,



                                        Alexis M. Herman

                               June 11, 1998

MS. GRANGER (for herself and Mr. ROEMER) introduced the following bill;
which was referred to the Committee on Education and the Workforce


                                    A BILL

To require the Occupational Sofety and Health Administration to recognize
that electronic forms of providing Material Safety Data Sheets provide the
same level of access to information as paper copies and to improve the
presentation of safety and emergency information on such Data Sheets.

     Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
     States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. OSHA RECOGNITION OF ELECTRONIC MSDS'S.

     Section 6(b) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (29
     U.S.C. 655(b)) is amended by adding at the end the following:

          '(9) Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this
          paragraph, the Secretary shall modify the regulations, contained
          in section 1910.1200(g) of title 29, Code of Federal Regulations,
          to clarify that an employer complies with the standard contained
          in such regulations if the employer makes information on each
          hazardous chemical used in the workplace readily accessible
          (available for retrieval immediately in the case of an emergency)
          to employees through electronic access or other alternatives to
          paper copies. Emergency back-up requirements for such electronic
          access systems shall not exceed the requirements placed upon
          traditional, paper storage systems.'.

SEC. 2. STANDARDIZATION FORMAT FOR MSDS'S.

     Section 6(b) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (29
     U.S.C. 655(b)) (as amended by section 1), is further amended by adding
     at the end the following:

          , (10) (A) Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of
          this paragraph, the Secretary shall modify the regulations,
          contained in section 1910.1200 of title 29, Code of Federal
          Regulations, to require that information on hazardous chemicals
          in a Material Safety Data Sheet (referred to as 'MSDS') shall be
          presented in a format that includes an emergency overview which
          warns of those health and physical hazards that require immediate
          attention in an emergency situation. Such information shall be
          featured prominently on the first page of the MSDS and it shall
          describe emergency first-aid, handling, and clean-up instructions
          and note the material's appearance and physical state.

          '(B) The emergency overview under subparagraph (A) shall require
          information on all hazardous chemicals produced, imported, or
          used to be presented at a language and comprehension level that
          is consistent with the technical proficiency of the target
          audience. For sections of the MSDS that are intended for all
          readers or audiences, the language used should be understandable
          to the widest audience possible and should be written with a
          minimum of technical wording. ' .

SEC. 3. STUDY.

     Not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of this
     section, the Secretary shall initiate a study that assesses and
     measures the comprehensibility of hazard warnings to the average
     industrial worker as they would be presented under section 6(b) (10) (A)


      of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970. Upon completion of
      the study, the Secretary shall prepare a report and make it available
      to chemical manufacturers and importers required to prepare Material
      Safety Data Sheets under regulations published as section 1910.1200(g)
      of title 29, Code of Federal Regulations.
