Subject: THE ARC CONDEMNS LOSS OF SSI ASSISTANCE FOR DISABLED

bThe Arc Condemns Loss of SSI Assistance for Disabled Children

    WASHINGTON, Feb. 6 /U.S. Newswire/ -- The Arc of the United
States, a national organization on mental retardation, is deeply
disappointed in today's announcement by the Social Security
Administration (SSA) of its new, overly harsh standards for a
child's eligibility for benefits under the Supplement Security
Income (SSI) program. While we acknowledge the attempt by the SSA
to recognize the importance of functional abilities in assessing
SSI eligibility, we reject as excessive the severity thresholds the
new requirements establish. The SSA had considerable leeway in
setting the new eligibility standards, yet chose to push for
changes that go beyond what was necessary under last year's welfare
law. The Arc is also very disappointed that this decision appears
to have been driven by budget targets, rather than by what is in
the best interest of the children involved. The proposal is
expected to save $4.8 billion over the next six years.
    To achieve the Clinton Administration's budgetary goals, 135,000
children with disabilities who are currently on the SSI program
must lose essential benefits that serve as a lifeline for keeping
the family together. It is estimated that an equal number will have
to be denied access to this lifeline program over the next six
years. This equals a total of almost 250,000 children with severe
disabilities who will lose or be denied critical benefits.
    Today's decision will have a staggering impact in a number of
ways:
    -- Families across America will lose basic support and, in many


cases, medical benefits. Already families are reporting to The Arc
that they will be forced to give up their child to foster care or
institutionalization. Removing a child from loving parents and a
home atmosphere increases the likelihood that a child will never
achieve her or his highest level of functional ability and violates
all of our values regarding family life.
    -- The potential influx of these children into state and local
service systems will place a severe strain on local communities, if
the children receive any assistance at all.
     -- While these changes may help cut federal spending, the impact
that they will have on the families who are already living at or
near poverty will be devastating. The children who are dropped from
the SSI program remain severely disabled and in need of assistance.
If state and local governments cannot or will not make up the
difference in lost support to these children, their families will
simply find themselves abandoned in their efforts to provide proper
care.
    The Arc demands that the administration:
        Take responsibility for thoroughly assessing each child
before dropping him or her from the rolls;
    -- Evaluate the impact of these new eligibility requirements on
families of children with disabilities by tracking what happens to
the families that lose these critical supports;
    -- Ensure that all families being reviewed have information
about available assistance in the review process;
    -- Continue providing SSI assistance to families of children
with sever disabilities who are already on the program until a
final decision is made by a Social Security judge.
    The Arc calls upon the public to express its disapproval of
these new eligibility standards through the planned public comment
period. It is only through the activism of the public that this
damaging decision can be amended.
    As a result of today's announcement, The Arc expresses its grave
concern for children with disabilities and their families as they
are dropped from federal assistance rolls.

    Founded in 1950, The Arc is the nation's largest volunteer
organization dedicated solely to issues of mental retardation.
There are 140,000 members working through 1,100 local and state
chapters. The National Headquarters is in Arlington, Texas, with
the Governmental Affairs office in Washington, D.C.
