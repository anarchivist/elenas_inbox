TEXT:
Chuck would like to arrange a meeting tomorrow at 9:30 in his office to
discuss Piscataway. We hope you can attend for at least part of the
meeting.  I understand your schedule may conflict at that time, but it'd
be great if you could come for at least part of the meeting.
(Unfortunately, 9:30 appears to be the only time that works with Sylvia
and John P's schedule.)
