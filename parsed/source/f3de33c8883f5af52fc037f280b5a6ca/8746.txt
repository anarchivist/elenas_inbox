TEXT:
Just a heads up that Maria Echaveste dropped by our weekly welfare reform
meeting to discuss follow up on Jason DeParle story.  She said POTUS
expressed concern about the issue to she and Gene before the social
security event yesterday. She indicated there was interest in doing
further analysis to find out whether the trends reported are true, and
then exploring strategies to address the issues--particularly increasing
proportion of Hispanics on welfare.  Bruce, I know you already suggested
some data issues to look into, but I wanted to make sure both of you knew
there had also been discussion of possible initiatives. Maria mentioned
that she had intended to talk with one of you about this first --
actually, I think she was a little surprised to walk into the weekly
welfare reform meeting and find me (we hadn't met before) and people from
the agencies.  I'll talk to HHS about further analysis of trends, but want
to get your guidance before pursuing possible initiatives further.
