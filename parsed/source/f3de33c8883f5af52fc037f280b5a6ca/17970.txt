TEXT:
How was the idea received in the meeting?

I think I'll try to sit down with OMB (Barbara Chow, Keith Fontenot and
their staff) and try to get the pros and cons laid out more clearly.  I
don't think you need to be there, but I'd be happy to include you if you
like.

Yes, I heard him bring that up yesterday.  I don't know if it's bad
policy, but it sounds like a tough sell -- giving states less $ to collect
from deadbeats.  I suspect the child support advocates would hate it.
