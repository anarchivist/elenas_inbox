TEXT:
I spoke with Jane DeCe11 of DOT reo  the opening of the conference
on the Coast Guard authorization bill. Apparently, everyone
agreed that a compromise must be reached on the tort liability
provision in order to produce a bill, but it did not appear that
they were close to achieving such a compromise.
