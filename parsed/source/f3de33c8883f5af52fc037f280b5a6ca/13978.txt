TEXT:
Elena, Diana and Jeremy are both out until the day after Labor
Day. I do not know at this point how they left it as to
development of the memo that I asked to see on Tuesday afternoon
after Labor Day when I return.  I believe unless things changed
that Diana left for Europe yesterday so I can't reach her to
answer this question of status. Hopefully the persons cc/d at OMB
are in the middle of preparation ... thanks.
