                                          May 18, 1998


Dear Senator Ford,

        Last September, when I announced my plan for comprehensive tobacco legislation, I
made protecting tobacco farmers and their communities one of the five key elements that must be
at the heart of any national tobacco legislation. Tobacco legislation must reduce youth smoking,
it must not devastate our tobacco farmers and their communities.

        The tobacco program has made it possible for farmers, their families, and communities to
enjoy a measure of economic stability. If the program is abolished, many farmers, particularly
small and minority farmers, will be left in jeopardy and many will be put out of business.
Senator Ford, your proposal, which is included in Senator McCain's comprehensive tobacco
legislation, includes vital protections for farmers and their communities including continuing a
tobacco control and price program. Your proposal satisfies the principle I laid out in September
1997, demanding that any legislation meet the test of protecting tobacco farmers and their
communities.

       It is possible to protect tobacco farmers and their communities, at the same time that we
dramatically reduce youth smoking. Indeed, maintenance of the tobacco program makes it
possible to control the amount of tobacco grown in the United States. I am confident that with the
inclusion of your provision in comprehensive tobacco legislation, we will meet the goals of
advancing public health interests and protecting farmers and their communities.

       Thank you for your important work in this area.


                                     Sincerely,
