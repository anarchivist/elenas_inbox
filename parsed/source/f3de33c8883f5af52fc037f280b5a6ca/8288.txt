Medicare and Hyde Amendment Decision Roll-Out_ On Tuesday, Secretary Shalala will
fonnally transmit a letter to Senator Nickles that affinns the Health Care Financing
Administration's longstanding policy that the Hyde Amendment applies to Medicare's disabled.
population. As such, as the letter points out, exceptions to the non-coverage policy "are
provided for cases of rape and incest, and certain circumstances in which a woman's life would
be endangered." Prior to the release ofthe letter, we will be holding separate meetings with the
women's advocacy organizations, the Catholic Health Association, and Senator Nickles' staff to
apprise them of the reaffinnation of our policy. Your Office of Public Liaison and the Women's
Office understand the rationale for our decision. They believe they can help mitigate the initial
potential negative reaction to this letter by reminding them that an administrative decision in this
area is far less objectionable than what would have been the inevitable legislative response.

FDA Commissioner Nomination. On Tuesday afternoon, you are tentatively scheduled to
unveil your choice for the next Food and Drug Administation (FDA) Commissioner -- Jane
Henney. Although she will not have an easy road to confinnation, particularly considering the
current Senate environment, we believe she is a very capable candidate. We will work closely
with her home state sponsor, Senator Domenici, to ensure she gets a positive send-off.
