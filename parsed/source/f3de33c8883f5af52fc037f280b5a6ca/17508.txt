MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:         Bruce Reed
              Elena Kagan

RE:           DPC Weekly Report




         Race: Staff Diversity at the Domestic Policy Council -- As we come to closure on
staff hiring at the Domestic Policy Council (DPC), I wanted to provide you with a breakdown on
our staff diversity. Our staff is currently 69% women and 26% minority. We believe that these
percentages will increase as we fill the last three slots over the next two weeks.

       Welfare: Letter to College Presidents on Students on Welfare and Work-Study --
Last month, Secretaries Riley and Shalala sent a letter to all college presidents explaining
how the welfare law affects college students on welfare. The letter encourages colleges to
work with states to provide work opportunities that allow students to stay in school. In
particular, the letter explains that work-study qualifies as work from our perspective,
although the fmal decision rests with states. The two departments indicated their
willingness to work with colleges that have questions or concerns about the impact of the
law.

        Crime: Juvenile Crime Bill Update -- It now appears very unlikely that Congress will
enact a juvenile crime bill this year. A pending issue is whether new juvenile crime and
prevention programs (including our prosecutors and afterschool programs) will be funded
through the FY 98 Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations bill -- notwithstanding the fact that
the Senate has yet to pass their juvenile crime authorizing legislation. We have recently heard
that it is unlikely that the appropriators will fund these programs in the CJS appropriations
conference report.

        Drugs: Crack Cocaine -- The crack cocaine working group has been meeting to
develop a long-term strategy on our proposal to revise crack and powder cocaine sentencing.
After an initial round of Congressional staff contacts by the Justice Department and ONDCP,
there does not appear to by any support at this time for our proposed sentencing revision. While
Congress is unlikely to act on any revisions to cocaine sentencing this session, Senators Kennedy
                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion


and Biden recommend preparing to take a defensive posture since we may be faced with efforts
next year to reduce the sentencing disparity solely through increasing powder cocaine penalties.
To this end, the long term strategy will focus on significant and focused outreach as well as a
targeted communications strategy for the remainder of this year and next year. Some of the
additional outreach will include key members of Congress by Attorney General Reno and
Director McCaffrey, as well as law enforcement, legal, local government, and drug treatment
organizations. [Note to Elena: we should see the draft strategy sometime next week.]

       Drugs: ONDCP Reauthorization -- This week, the House passed a two-year
reauthorization bill for ONDCP by a voice vote. ONDCP has raised numerous concerns with
the House bill. The legislation's most troubling provisions are numerical targets for significant
drug use reduction that ONDCP would be required to meet within a specified and short period of
time. While we took a position opposing the bill, our SAP did not contain a veto threat. The
Senate HatchlBiden compromise bill reauthorizes the drug office for seven years represents and
does not contain the numerical targets in the House version. The Senate reauthorization bill may
be considered by the full Senate next week.

         Immigration: Extension of Section 24S(i) -- A short-term extension of 245(i)--
which permits certain illegal immigrants to file here for legal status instead of at consulates
abroad-- was included in the most recent continuing resolution. As you recall, the Senate
Commerce-Justice appropriations bill contains a permanent extension of the provision and the
House version does not contain any extension at all. Next week, the House is expected to take a
vote on a motion to instruct conferees on extending the provision. WH Legislative Affairs says
it is unclear whether the motion will pass.

        Immigration: Central Americans -- House Republicans are very close to unveiling
legislative language to remedy certain problems the 1996 immigration created for Central
Americans. Although we have yet to see the language, we have heard that it closely reflects the
key principles already outlined by Reps. Diaz-Balart and Lamar Smith: 1) grants amnesty for
Nicaraguans in the country before December 1995; 2) allows suspension of deportation claims to
be heard under the older, more lenient standards for Guatemalans and Salvadorans; 3)
retroactively applies tougher standards of suspension cases to all non-Central Americans; and 4)
eliminates the unskilled worker category but grandfathers individuals who are in the pipeline
(about 70-75,000 visas). The Senate is preparing a similar bill which may provide greater relief
to non-Central Americans with cases in the pipeline than the House version (see #3). Two key
points are currently outstanding. First, there is disagreement between the House and Senate on
elimination of the unskilled workers category. This provision is viewed as Chairman Smith's
"price" for the legislation; conversely, Chairman Abraham is a strong opponent of reducing legal
immigration and would be opposed to the precedent of eliminating a category. It is possible that
Abraham will consider a moratorium on the category-- which does not technically eliminate the
category-- with a commitment to take care of the existing backlog. Second, is a concern recently
raised by the eBC regarding Haitians. None of the legislative proposals being developed afford
relief for certain Haitians-- many of whom entered under circumstances similar to the Central


                                               2

Americans but may be removed from the country in the near future. In preliminary discussion,
there seems to be White House and agency support to assist the Haitians, as long as it does not
threaten passage of the overall legislation. The legislation is expected to move as part of D.C.
appropriations in the next two weeks.
        Hate Crimes: Expanding the Hate Crimes Statute to Include Sexual Orientation,
Disability, and Gender -- In preparation for the November 10th White House Conference on
Hate Crimes, the Attorney General has indicated that she will recommend that the federal hate
crimes statute be expanded to include gender, sexual orientation, and disability. This option was
supported by most interest groups and the Civil Rights Division of DOJ. Senator Kennedy had
indicated he would introduce legislation to this effect shortly before or on the day of the
Conference. This option, which only requires the broadest possible Commerce Clause nexus for
the offense to fall within the federal statute, is expected to require a substantial increase of
resources for both the FBI and U.S. Attorney offices. One other option presented to the
Attorney General would have included gender, sexual orientation, and disability as new
categories of hate crimes, but would have required a showing of animus by the criminal offender.
 This option was preferred by the FBI and federal prosecutors in order to address the concern
that, without the animus provision, the statute would require federal review of most
gender-related offenses.

        Education: 1996 NAEP Science Results -- This week the National Assessment
Governing Board (NAGB) released a performance report on the 1996 National Assessment of
Educational Progress (NAEP) in science, showing that less than 30% of U.S. students reach
proficient levels of scientific knowledge and understanding, with 29% reaching the proficient
level at grades 4 and 8, and 21 % demonstrating proficiency at grade 12. The basic level --
representing partial mastery of fundamental knowledge and skills -- was reached by 67% of
students in grade 4, 61% in grade 8, and 57% in grade 12. The 1996 science NAEP was
developed from a new content framework, so results cannot be directly compared to previous
assessments. Numerical scores for the 1996 test had previously been released, but this week's
report was based on levels for basic, proficient, and advanced performance approved by NAGB
in August.

        Education: Vouchers/CoverdeU -- This week the House passed the Gingrich!Armey
version of Sen. Coverdell's K-12 education savings accounts legislation. Vote on final passage
was 230-198, with 8 Republicans voting against the bill and 15 Democrats voting for it. A
Rangel substitute, which would have expanded a school construction bond provision enacted in
the tax reform bill, was defeated 224-199. On Friday the Republicans canceled a mark-up of
legislation that would have allowed ESEA Title VI funds to be used to pay for private school
tuition. Evidently they were unable to muster sufficient Republican support to get the bill out of
committee. However, Republicans will probably attempt to attach voucher language to the
Riggs-Roemer charter schools bill on the House floor next week.

       Education: National Tests -- Friday afternoon the AP ran a story indicating that the
Republicans had decided to send the Labor HHS appropriations bill to you, including Goodling's


                                               3
                                                              Hmt-Dump Conversion
prohibition on developing or implementing national tests. Others in the media are picking up
this story, though the only source for the story appears to be unidentified staff to Goodling or
Ashcroft. Goodling has in fact drafted a new provision that would (1) continue to prohibit the
development or implementation of national tests; (2) require the Education Department to cancel
the current contract for test development; and (3) direct the National Academy of Sciences to
conduct a study, with NGA and NCSL, of the feasibility of comparing the results from different,
existing standardized tests, as an alternative to the national tests. The Republicans have
forwarded Goodling's proposal to the Democrats, though it is not yet clear if this is intended as
the first step in negotiations, or if it reflects a decision to force a veto before any final resolution
that acceptable to you. Weare working closely with Obey to determine how best to respond.
In addition, we have indicated to the press that this "compromise" is unacceptable to you, and
that this provision would cause you to veto the bill--as you stated clearly in your remarks to the
National Board for Professional Teaching Standards.
