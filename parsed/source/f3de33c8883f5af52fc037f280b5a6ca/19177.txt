TEXT:
SSA says Rahm asked Ken Apfel for material on SSA's efforts to stop paying
benefits to prisoners, along with ideas for how to expand those efforts to
other agencies.  Ken sent a copy of his note to Elena and OMB on the
theory that we would have to be involved in any effort to expand this to
other agencies in a quick way.  Other programs Ken listed that might
benefit if SSA shared its prisoner data are food stamps, veterans
benefits, and child support enforcement.  I'm not sure if DPC should be
following up and, if so, who.
