TEXT:
As you may recall, in mid-june, we provided a briefing on recommendations
for modifying standards for data on race and ethnicity that we had
received from our interagency committee. Those recommendations were
published on July 9 for a 60-day comment period.

We have now completed our review of the recommendations and public
comments and plan to announce a decision in about a week.  I would be
pleased to have you join us for a briefing on the recommendations on
Friday, October 17, 11:00 a.m. in room 350.  Please contact my assistant,
Phyllis Kaiser-Dark by phone (x54852) or e-mail to confirm your attendance.
