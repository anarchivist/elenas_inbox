TEXT:
I'm hearing conversations again about what the message event for LA will
be on Saturday, Feb. 27, and I'm hearing education come up again (which I
know Davis really wants to do) .

Do you both still want to push to have gun tracing and child safety seats
be the two events we do for the radio address and the LA message event.
The one thing we need to keep in mind for the LA event is that the First
Lady will be with the President so they will be looking for something they
can both do.

Let me know what you think, or if you're hearing anything different.
Thanks.
