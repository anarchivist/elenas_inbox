       This is the e-mail Ron sent that Don and I were talking to you about.

       Would you mind giving me a call at your convenience so we can sort this

       out?    We are starting to plan for a VP Wednesday event and I want to make

       sure we're all on the same page.        Thanks.

       The proposal to emerge from Erskine's meeting was as follows:



       1.     We would try to put YOU out next week to fire a shot accross the bow

       of the GOP to say that any tobacco bill must be comprehensive, i.e.,

       include a price hike.        We are working to see if OMB/Treas can generate

       numbers as to a projected reduction in teen smoking under our plan, so we
" ..    ~




  would have news to announce when you go out.



   2.       We expect Conrad's bill the following week.   When it comes, POTUS will

  make a statement praising it, saying it is a good bill that is consistent

  with his principles.        He will also say that he hopes this issue can be

  biparstian, and not just partisan -- and he hopes others will come forth

  with bills that are also consistent with his principles (so as to not

  scare off the moderate Repubs who want to help, and so as to not alienate

  other Dems like Waxman, Harkin, etc., who are also drafting bills).



   3.       Erskine will begin quiet conversations with moderate Repubs to try to

  see if they will come onto Conrad or something very close to Conrad.



   I think that this is a good approach.
