TEXT:
We've spared you the gory details, but we have worked with HHS, OMB, IGA,
and NGA to work out revised guidance on cost allocation, to be officially
sent out this week.  The guidance provides instructions to the states to
provide budget information to HHS to help them determine, as required by
the Ag Research bill, how much of each state's TANF block grant is
comprised of Food Stamp and Medicaid administrative costs. NGA had passed
a resolution at its August meeting expressing concern about the draft
guidance. Nearly all those concerns have been addressed (most relate to
making clear that the data collection models provided in the guidance are
simply that -- models that states can adapt to their historical
circumstances). We had a final meeting today with NGA, APHSA, NCSL and
Indiana and Wisconsin state staff and they seemed pleased with the
outcome. We did not address all of their complaints, however -- some are
due to the statute and one -- relating to how narrowly to define
"administrative costs" we simply have an honest disagreement.

FYI -- this provision produced Food Stamp savings in the Ag Research bill
used to fund Food Stamps for legal immigrants (once the amount of Food
Stamp admin costs in the TANF block grant is determined, USDA will then
deduct that amount from each state's Food Stamp admin reimbursement.)
New legislation would be needed to capture savings from the Medicaid data
which will be captured in this process. Our budget proposal last year
captured savings from both, but (in the absence of state by state data) by
cutting FS and Medicaid admin reimbursement by 3 percent.   The idea was
to ensure that states didn't double-dip, by shifting admin costs to the
open-ended FS and Medicaid programs while maintaining their entire TANF
block grant.
