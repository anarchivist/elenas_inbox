TEXT:
Attached is a draft letter on Ed-Flex that the Democratic Governor want to
send to the Hill today.  Please let me know if this is okay, or do we want
to insist that the Governor wait until later next week to send.


E-Mail Message from Jeff Viohl, DGA Chair Gov O'Bannon's staff:
"Here's the draft.  Feel free to call.  Please don't start a lobby
campaign against this.  Support for the bill is done with an understanding
that Wyden et. al. need to work out some additional language with Kennedy
(to the extent real issues or problems need to be addressed)."


           February 19, 1999



The Honorable Tom Daschle
Senate Democratic Leader
509 Hart Senate Office Building
Washington, D.C.  20510-4103

Dear Senator Daschle:

        We are writing to express our strong support for S. 280, the
Education Flexibility Partnership Act of 1999. As Democratic Governors,
our top priority is to create first-rate education systems in our states
that give every child the opportunity to gain the quality education and


skills he or she needs to succeed in the ever-changing workforce.

        This bipartisan legislation would expand the current federal
o&Ed-FlexoS demonstration program so that all states meeting federal
school improvement requirements might have an opportunity to grant local
educational agencies more flexibility to administer federal funds.   The
Ed-Flex authority would allow states to waive a range of federal education
program rules for local educational agencies so long as comparable state
flexibility is provided and schools are held accountable for making
educational improvements. Most importantly, S. 280 maintains the careful
balance needed between flexibility and accountability

        As you know, the Congress enacted the Ed-Flex demonstration
program in 1994 in order to test the idea of giving states the authority
to waive federal statutory and regulatory requirements, along with state
requirements, which impede the development and implementation of education
reforms. Ed-Flex has been a highly successful program thus far in the
twelve Ed-Flex demonstration states, which have used this initiative to
more closely align state and federal education improvement efforts.
Furthermore, Ed-Flex has been an integral part of the Department of
Educationo,s overall effort to promote high standards, accountability for
results, and flexibility at both the federal and state levels.  Secretary
Riley has noted, o&Ed-Flex can help participating states and local school
districts use federal funds in ways that provide maximum support for
effective school reform based on challenging academic standards for all
students.oS Expanding Ed-Flex to all qualifying states will provide the
necessary coordination between
state and federal statutory and regulatory requirements that will further
state efforts to implement comprehensive education reform and ultimately
result in improved student achievement, an objective we all share.

        Democratic Governors strongly support this effort to vest state
officials with more control over the coordination of federal and state
regulatory and statutory authority in exchange for requiring more local
school accountability.  We firmly believe that public education can be
strengthened by increasing accountability for results, while providing
greater flexibility to empower local educators to find the best way to
help all students reach high academic standards.

Although we strongly support swift enactment of S. 280, we recognize that
this is just a first step toward strengthening our state education reform
efforts. Building modern, safe and well-equipped schools, hiring
well-qualified teachers, and allocating the necessary resources for
education programs are areas that will need to be addressed further if we
hope to create a world-class education system. We look forward to working
with you to build a stronger education partnership between the federal
government and states.

S. 280 is common-sense legislation that we believe deserves immediate
consideration. We hope, therefore, that you will join in supporting its
prompt enactment.

                                         Sincerely,




CC:   Senate Democratic Caucus Members
