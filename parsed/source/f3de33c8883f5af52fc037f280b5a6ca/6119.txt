      Attached is draft class size 1-pager.  I'm sharing with Mike Smith and ED
      at same time.  Two points for your quick attention.

       1.   I've written this presuming decision to include basic skills testing.

      2.  The first graph in this is also intened for SOTU education summary,
      which is due moments from now.   You might want to quickly look at that and
      pay particular attention to the fact that I included both 5- and 7-year
      numbers.   Before you strike the 7 year number, remember that we need it to
      (1) get to 100,000 and (2) to convince people this is not a one-time
      5-year effort.==================== ATTACHMENT    1 ====================

                       CLASS SIZE REDUCTION INITIATIVE:
                    SMALL CLASSES WITH QUALIFIED TEACHERS

    To have the best schools, we must have the best teachers ... we must do more to help'all our
                                         children read.
                                              . President Clinton, 1997 State of the Union Address

Small Classes with Qualified Teachers to Improve Reading in Grades 1-3. Today President
Clinton proposed a $12.4 billion initiative over 7 years ($7.3 billion over 5 years) to help local
schools provide small classes with qualified teachers in the early grades. This will help make sure
that every child receives personal attention, learns to read independently and gets a solid
foundation for further learning. The new initiative will reduce class size from a nationwide
average of22 in grades 1-3 to an average of 18, by providing funds to help local school districts
hire an additional 100,000 well prepared teachers. In addition, the President's initiative will
provide funds to states and local school districts to test new teachers, develop more rigorous
teacher testing and certification requirements, and train teachers in effective reading instruction
practices. Schools districts will be accountable for demonstrating gains in reading achievement.
These steps will help ensure that first through third grade students are receiving high-quality
reading instruction in smaller classes from competent teachers.

Investing in Teacher Quality. For reductions in class size to result in improved reading
performance, teachers must have the knowledge and skills to teach reading effectively in small
classes. The President's initiative would accomplish this by:

       Providing funds for teacher testing and training: 10% of the funds in this initiative can
       be used to promote high quality teaching by (1) testing new teachers before they are hired
       and to develop improved tests for teachers; (2) training teachers in effective reading
       instruction practices and/or in effective practices in small classes; (3) providing mentors or
       other support for newly hired teachers; and, (4) providing incentives to recruit teachers to
       high poverty schools.

       Requiring Teachers to Meet State Certification Standards: States and school
       districts would be required to ensure that individuals hired to fill these new positions be
       either fully certified or are making satisfactory progress toward full certification. School
       districts could use the funds described above to provide teachers with the additional
       training needed to meet certification requirements.

       Requiring state basic skills testing for new teachers. States would be required to
       implement basic skills testing for new teachers, to ensure parents that new teachers have
       basic reading and math skills. Each state would select the test it determines is most
       appropriate for this purpose. Nearly 40 states already require basic skills testing for
       teachers.

       Encouraging States to Adopt Rigorous Professional Tests and Upgrade Teacher

                                                                    Automated Records Management System
                                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion


           Certification Requirements. Teachers should be able to demonstrate that they know the
           subject they are expected to teach and have the necessary knowledge and skills to help their
           student reach "the challenging academic standards adopted by the state. States would be
           encouraged to use a portion oftneir funds to toughen their teacher certification
           requirements and to require new teachers to demonstrate competence. For example, states
           could use these funds to develop rigorous tests of subject matter expertise and professional
           knowledge that prospective teachers would be required to pass before they start teaching,
           and to develop ways of assessing whether beginning teachers can demonstrate that they
           have met rigorous standards of classroom teaching before achieving full certification.

    Holding Schools Accountable for Results. School districts receiving these funds would be
    required to make measurable progress in improving reading achievement within 3 years, or take
    corrective actions. School districts could lose funding if there is no subsequent funding. School
    districts would also be required to publish an annual school report card for parents and taxpayers,
    show reading achievement, class size and teacher qualifications.

    Targeting Funding. Funds for the President's class size reduction initiative will be distributed
    to states on the basis of the Title I formula. Within states, each high poverty school district would
    receive the same share ofthese funds as it receives under Title 1, and the remaining funds would
    be distributed based upon class size within the state. Matching funds would be required from
    participating school districts, on a sliding scale. Once a state has reached an average class size of
    18 in grades 1-3, it could use these funds to further reduce class size in those grades, or it could
    extend its efforts to other grades.

    Providing facilities for additional classrooms. In order to help school systems meet the need
    for additional space for smaller classes, the President has (l) proposed a $10 billion school
    modernization bond initiative to provide incentives for communities to invest in local school
    facilities; (2) made facilities changes to accommodate class size reduction an allowable use of
    funds; and (3) allowed for phased-in implementation of the class size initiative to enhance
    state/local facilities planning.

    Small Classes Make a Difference. A major research experiment in Tennessee (Project STAR),
    and other studies have shown that young students benefit from smaller classes with well-qualified
    teachers. For example, Project STAR students showed improved achievement and behavior,
    higher test scores, and gains lasting through their later years of schooling. Economically
    disadvantaged and minority students, in particular, showed the greatest gains in achievement.
    However, these findings demonstrated that all children in early grades benefit from small classes --
    especially in reading. Having smaller classes allows teachers to devote more time to individualized
    attention, engage in more in-depth instruction, and to identify and remedy learning problems
    before students fall too far behind ..
