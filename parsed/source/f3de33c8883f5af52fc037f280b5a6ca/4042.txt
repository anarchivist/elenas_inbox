Subject:         Final Rule on Gasoline Produced by Foreign Refiners (aka PDVSA)

Today we cleared EPA's final rule regarding the "baseline" against which
foreign refiners must measure their gasoline for purposes of compliance
with requirements established under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990
(CAAA). The rule responds to a WTO ruling that found the original rule
inconsistent with GATT. The new rule is virtually identical to the
proposal we reviewed earlier this year.  It allows each foreign refiner
the option of selecting either (I) a baseline based on its own actual
exports to the u.S. in 1990, or (2) the baseline established in the CAAA.

The new rule may confer some (unquantified but likely small) advantage to
foreign refiners over domestic ones (who may not use the CAAA baseline) .
However, EPA decided in favor of this approach because DOE convinced it
that to require all foreign refiners to establish individual baselines
could seriously impede the critical role that imports play in smoothing
out price fluctuations in the U.S. gasoline market. USTR is also happy
because it believes the rul~ shows the U.S. is serious about complying
with WTO rulings that we lose.
