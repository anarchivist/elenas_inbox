USA Today
Rich Wolf isn't interested in writing about the OOW rule, at least not now
   perhaps with more reporting or new data he might be in the future.

He is finishing up a story that I believe I had mentioned to you, Bruce
(may have been when you were on vacation Elena), that he started working
on several weeks ago, about the criminal child support enforcement task
forces that we're expanding as part of our child support law enforcement
initiative.   It may be in as soon as tomorrow.  I'd given HHS and Justice
some guidance about how to be helpful. We'll have to see tomorrow whether
it worked!

 Here's the paper we released in January

Others

Today the Manhattan·lnstitute held a conference on "Next Steps in Welfare
Reform. " Genie attended, said there were press there (Jason DeParle and
Rich Wolf at least). Gov Thompson clearly was misinformed.   She reported:

Overall, remarks by State .and local officials, academics, faith-based and
business community representatives were laudatory about the impact of
welfare reform and declining caseloads.   Speakers such as Charles Murray
and Jason Turner generally characterized the next challenge as
"constructively spending our wealth in this robust economy." However, the
keynote address delivered by Governor Tommy Thompson was particularly
critical of the Administration and its final TANF regulation which was
released this past Monday.   Below is a more detailed summary of his
remarks.

GOVERNOR THOMPSON
 -- Began by observing the irony in the President claiming credit for the
success of welfare reform when he vetoed it twice before finally enacting


the bill -- analogous to the Vice President claiming he invented the
Internet.
-- Painted a bleak picture of WI before he took office. WI was chasing
businesses away with high taxes and luring welfare recipients in with high
AFDC checks.
-- Shared the successes of welfare reform in Wisconsin under his
administration.  Since 1986, there has been a 90 percent reduction in
statewide welfare rolls, dropping from about 100,000 families to roughly
9,000 families today (out of total population of approximately 5.5 million
people).  In 1997, he launched W-2, the State's TANF program that added
on to the 1995 Welfare-not-Work program. w-2 includes a family cap whic~
limits increases for women who have more children while on welfare, and
participants who leave welfare earn an average wage of $7.42 per hour.
-- Remarked that, in the true spirit of Washington, HHS released its final
TANF rule more than 3 years after the signing of the welfare reform law --
illustrating once again that "Washington is an inhibitor of reform rather
than instigator of reform." While the rule reflects that HHS did hear the
States, and in some instances, listened to States, the regulation is
primarily "bad, especially for those States at the forefront of reforms."
-- Continued to describe the upcoming challenges. Of those who remain on
the caseloads, "SO percent are minorities, 40 percent experience problems
with substance abuse or mental health, 50 percent never worked, and 50
percent have no high school education."
-- As a result, the Governor stated, "States need more flexibility in
supportive services ... [the rule] is bad vecause it ties our hands and
doesn't help people retain jobs ... and it doesn't prevent future lapses .. "
-- The Governor described some of his current welfare reform efforts, such
as youth grants, fatherhood initiatives, foster family recruiting.    He
cited specifically that his "Better Badger Babies" proposal to create
high-tech learning centers for at-risk young children would not be an
allowable cost under the new TANF rule.
-- In sum, because of "Washington, the Disneyland of the East," the TANF
rule "prohibits the flexible use of the TANF block grant."

                   President Clinton Proposes New Child Support Crackdown ancilex-Dump Conversion
               Announces a Record 80 Percent Increase in Child Support Collections
                                      December 31, 1998

Today, President Clinton announced a new child support crackdown aimed at the nation's most
egregious child support violators. Despite record child support collections, there are still too
many parents who flagrantly ignore their obligations to their children, and the President will
propose to spend $46 million to identify, investigate, and prosecute these deadbeat parents. The
President took this action today as he released new evidence that his Administration's child
support efforts are working: child support collections have gone up a record 8Q percent since he
took office, from $8 billion in 1992 to an estimated $14.4 billion in 1998.

New Record Child Support Collections
Since taking office, President Clinton has made child support enforcement a top priority, and
those efforts are paying off for children across America. New figures released by the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services today show that child support collections have gone
up a record 80 percent since the President took office, from $8 billion in 1992 to an estimated
$14.4 billion in 1998. Moreover, new figures show that the federal government has collected
$1.1 billion this year by withholding federal tax refunds from deadbeat parents. Nearly 1.3
million families in all 50 states benefited from these tax refunds, which totaled $151 million in
California, $63 million in Ohio, $52 million in Florida, and $48 million in New York (a state
by state chart is available).

New Child Support Law Enforcement Initiative
To ensure that every parent pays the child support he owes, in June President Clinton signed into
law the Deadbeat Parents Punishment Act, creating two new categories of federal felonies for the
most egregious child support violators, a measure he had called for in his 1997 State of the
Union address. Many prosecutors say they would be able to prosecute even more child support
cases if they had legal staff dedicated to the issue and if they received referrals after a complete
financial investigation had been conducted.

       New Investigative Resources: Under this new initiative, the U.S. Department of Health and
       Human Services will establish investigative teams in five regions of the country to
       identify, analyze, and investigate cases for prosecution. These sites, costing
       approximately $12 million over five years, will serve 17 states plus D.C., which together
       have 63 percent of the nation's child support cases. State child support offices will refer
       their most serious child support cases to these sites, where trained investigative staff will
       locate the violator, document information needed for prosecution, and then provide the
       investigated case to the appropriate prosecutor. These sites will be based upon a model
       law enforcement effort established earlier this year to serve five states, which in six months
       has produced an 18-fold increase in federal convictions and collections ..

       New Prosecutorial Resources: To ensure U.S. Attorney's offices have the skilled legal staff
       they need to prosecute more deadbeat parents, the President proposes to provide new
       funds for legal support personnel, who will conduct fact finding and investigations, do
       legal research, and assist in the drafting of court papers. The President's new budget will
       include $34 million over five years, $5 million in FY 2000 rising to $8 million in later
With this new staff, the U.S. Department of Justice expects to increase child support
prosecutions significantly.
