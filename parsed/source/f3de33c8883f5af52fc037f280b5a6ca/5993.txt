The only tentative one is #6 (1-800 number for employers to call re: EITC)

     1.   Anounce that we've met the goal -- two years ahead of schedule -- to move two million
          more Americans off of welfare by the year 2000 (goal set by President in last year's State
          of the Union).

          housing in order to move from welfare to work.

     4.   Announce a nationwide competition to reward state efforts to reduce out of wedlock
          births -- distributing $100 million a year to five states with the largest reduction.

     5.   Announce a nationwide welfare to work competition, distributing $1 billion in high
          performance bonuses to states that do the best job of placing people into jobs and helping
          them succeed in the work place.

     6.   Announce a new 1-800 number for employers to get help with the Earned Income Tax
          Credit, so to help companies retain employees and give them a raise in every pay check.

     7.   Announce the first state and local welfare to work grants, created in the Balanced Budget
          Act to fund welfare to work efforts in high poverty areas (GA, IL, KS, LA, MI, NE, NV,
          Sc).

     8.   Announce that 3,000 companies have pledged to hire welfare recipients, and challenge
