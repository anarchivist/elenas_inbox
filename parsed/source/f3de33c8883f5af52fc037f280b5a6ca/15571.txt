TEXT:
Stacy Grundman made the following fairly helpful comment on our FLSA
talking points.  It's not so critical a change that we have to pull back
the copies we just distributed, but I think it's worth making for the next
version.

Second to last bullet now says (emphasis added):  "The Labor Department
will provide guidance within the next week or two on the specifics of this
POLICY and will engage in extensive consultation with states on how to
apply this POLICY with the least disruption."

She points out that "policy" is not the best word.    Alternative could be
something like " ... the specifics of how labor laws apply to these
programs .... how to apply the law with the least disruption."
