TEXT:
It turns out that the President agreed on Wednesday in a meeting with the
Hispanic Caucus to have an event at the White House that would include
legal immgrants about to lose benefits.  We are going to try to work with
Intergovernmental/Leg/Political Affairs to possibly combine this idea with
the mayors event idea. After speaking to Emily Bromberg et. al. we'll
come back to you with a more specific proposal.
