MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:                 BRUCE REED, CYNTHIA RICE, AND DIANA FORTUNA

SUBJECT:              COLLEGE AND WELFARE WORK REQUIREMENTS


You asked about reports that welfare recipients enrolled in college are dropping out or being
asked to drop out in order to go to work and help states meet the welfare law's work
requirements.

The welfare law does not require states to tell clients to drop out of school -- although some
jurisdictions, such as New York City, have done so. (New York City has moved aggressively to
require welfare recipients to participate in community work experience jobs such as cleaning
parks. This was done not as a result of the Federal welfare law, but at the initiative of Mayor
Giuliani. As a result, the number of students on welfare enrolled at the City University of New
York has reportedly fallen from 29,000 to 18,000.)

The following are some of the ways in which states can accommodate welfare clients who wish
to stay in school:

·      Colleges could make it easier for students on welfare to work 20 or 30 hours a week
       and still attend school. Many Americans work their way through college: Department
       of Education statistics show that in 1993, 38% of undergraduates worked at least 35 hours
       a week, while 16% worked between 21 and 34 hours a week. Colleges could make it
       easier for welfare recipients to combine work and college by providing work study
       opportunities that meet the work requirements. Although most colleges limit work study
       to 10 to 15 hours a week, there is no limit in federal law -- colleges can provide as many
       hours as needed to meet the student's financial need. A student could also work 15
       hours a week in an on-campus work study job and 15 hours a week in a private-sector,
       off-campus job subsidized by her welfare check.

       We recommend sending colleges a letter from Secretaries Riley and Shalala to clarify that
       colleges can use work study to help students on welfare meet their work requirements and
       still complete their degree. Jonathan Alter has also suggested a novel way for colleges to
       help with welfare reform. He recommends that colleges stop putting work study students
       to work in kitchens and dining halls and send them into communities to be tutors and
       mentors. That, in tum, would free up a number of entry-level jobs on campus that could
       be used to hire people off welfare (whose wages in some cases could be subsidized by
       their welfare checks).
·      States could encourage recipients to attend vocational post-secondary training,

    more than 20 percent of individuals can be counted as working by participating in
    vocational training or secondary school, and in many states much of that 20% will be
    made up of teenage parents finishing high school.

·   States could put college students in separate state programs to which the work rates
    do not apply. Under the law states could use savings from welfare reform (from
    dropping caseloads or the fact that they need maintain only 75% of historic state spending
    to get the TANF block grant) to set up separate state programs in which they could
    support welfare recipients in college. Currently, work rates do not apply to either
    1) programs funded by completely separate state dollars or 2) programs funded by
    "maintenance of effort" dollars which states spend in order to get the T ANF block grant.
    We have argued that the work rates should apply to the latter, which is integrally related
    to the federal program, lest states structure their programs to significantly undermine the
    work rates. This change would require legislation. However, even if work rates applied
    to the "maintenance of effort" programs, states could use the savings from welfare reform
    to fund separate state programs for college students.
