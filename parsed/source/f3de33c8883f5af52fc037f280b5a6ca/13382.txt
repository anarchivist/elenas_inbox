            SALVAGE LOGGING LAW: MURRAY INTRODUCES REPEAL IN SENATE
               Sen. Patty Murray (D-WA) yesterday introduced her version of
         a bill to repeal the portions of the salvage-logging law signed
         last summer by Pres. Clinton. Murray plans to attach it to the
         continuing resolution expected to come to the Senate floor later
         this week (GREENWIRE sources) .
               Murray said her bill would put an end to controversial
         timber sales that were reissued to logging companies under the
         law, and reimpose all existing environmental laws.    In exchange,
         ·the US Forest Service could offer those timber companies the
         right to log less sensitive areas or buy back logging rights
          (Leslie Brown, Tacoma MORNING NEWS TRIBUNE, 3/5).
               Murray said the original law was intended' to speed up the
         logging of diseased and dying trees, but "it turned out to be
         legislative overkill on the environment" by opening up sensitive
         tracts to logging (Brent Walth, Portland OREGONIAN, 3/5).
               Sen. Slade Gorton (R-WA), who sponsored the original law,
          "blasted" Murray for trying to repeal a law "that has provided
         the only hope of jobs for Northwest timber communities this year"
          (Brown, Tacoma MORNING NEWS TRIBUNE). Gorton has proposed an
         amendment that would allow buy-backs and timber exchanges but
         continue suspension of environmental laws (GREENWIRE 3/1).
               Gorton's proposal could take as much as $100 million from
         the USFS's existing budget.   "Murray, who says the Forest Service
         already is facing financial problems, would have the federal
         government's claims settlement act -- a separate fund set up to
         cover government liabilities -- cover the cost of the buy-outs"
          (Brown, Tacoma MORNING NEWS TRIBUNE).
               Sen. Bill Bradley (D-NJ) is planning to offer his measure
         supporting full repeal of the law today. Sen. Mark Hatfield
          (R-OR) is also expected to introduce language today to be added
         to the continuing resolution that would extend the expiration of
         the salvage law (GREENWIRE sources) .
                        USFS REDUCES CUTS ON AK NAT'L FOREST
               Citing public concern and economic feasibility, the US
         Forest Service has reduced the amount of logging that will occur


      under the salvage-logging law on Alaska's Chugach National
      Forest. Critics had said the "controversial" cut would ruin
      views and destroy popular recreations spots (GREENWIRE 1/31).
           About 20% of the 5,525 acres planned for logging have been
      eliminated from the proposed cut on the Kenai Peninsula,
      according to USFS's Fred Prange.   Forest Supervisor Larry Hudson
      characterized the acreage reduction as a normal step in the
      USFS's assessment of timber sales. But Jay Stange of the Alaska
      Center for the Environment called the reduction a victory for
      citizens' groups "that opposed logging some of Alaska's most
      accessible scenic areas" (AP/Medford [OR] MAIL TRIBUNE, 3/3).
