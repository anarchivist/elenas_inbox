                  Initiatives to support families moving from welfare to work
                                          January 8,1998

The number of people on leaving welfare for work and the percentage of people on welfare who
are working has increased dramatically since welfare reform (see attached one pager on
employment numbers). To ensure the success offamilies moving from welfare to work, the
President will propose in his new budget substantial new funding for welfare to work
transportation and welfare to work housing vouchers.

A Doubling of Welfare to Work Transportation Funds

The President's budget will increase Access to Jobs funding from $75 to $150 million per year,
doubling the number of individuals and communities can receive welfare to work transportation
assistance. As the President has often remarked, transportation continues to be one of the
significant challenges facing people making a transition from welfare to work. While two-thirds
of all new jobs are in the suburbs, three-quarters of welfare recipients live in central cities or rural
areas. Many entry level jobs require evening or weekend hours that are poorly served by
existing transit routes, and few welfare recipients owning reliable cars. Forty percent of rural
counties don't even have public transportation.

The Access to Jobs program was created last year in Transportation Equity Act at the urging of
the President. TEA-21, as the transportation bill is called, authorized the President's welfare to
work transportation proposal at $150 million annually, but in FY 1999 only $75 million was
appropriated. The President's new budget proposes to fund Access to Jobs at the full authorized
level of $150 million in FY 2000. The program provides competitive grants to assist states and
localities in developing flexible transportation services to connect welfare recipients and other low
income persons (up to 150 of poverty) to jobs and other employment related services. The
program is intended to promote new or expanded transportation services such as shuttles,
vanpools, new bus routes, connector services to mass transit, employer provided transportation,
and guaranteed ride home programs. TEA-21 also included $10 million a year for Reverse
Commute grants to address the urban/suburban mismatch for workers of all incomes.

A SO Percent Increase inWelfare-to-Work Housing Vouchers

The President's new budget will provide $430 million for 75,000 welfare to work housing
vouchers, including $144 million in new funds for 25,000 additional vouchers. This is a 50
percent increase over 50,000 new welfare-to-work housing vouchers the President secured last
year, the first new housing vouchers authorized by Congress in five years. Families can use
these housing vouchers to move closer to a new job, to reduce a long commute, or to secure
more stable housing to eliminate emergencies that keep them from getting to work every day on
time and perform their best on the job. These targeted vouchers will give people on welfare a
new tool to make the transition to a job and succeed in the work place.

In many places, jobs are being created far from where most welfare recipients live and are not
readily accessible by public transportation. About two-thirds of new jobs are being created in
the suburbs, but three of four welfare recipients live in central cities or rural areas. In addition,
there is a large unmet need for affordable housing for welfare recipients and other working poor
families. There are over 5 million families who qualify for but do not receive federal housing
assistance. About 2.4 million renter households with 'worst case' housing needs were working,
with over half earning the equivalent of full-time year-round pay at the minimum wage. Only
about one-quarter of current welfare recipients currently receive federal housing assistance.

The additional vouchers will be available on a competitive basis to local housing agencies,
including tribes and tribally designated housing authorities. Applications must be developed in
consultation with the state, local, or tribal welfare agency and the local Welfare-to-Work formula
funds grantee (typically the Private Industry Council), to ensure that services are coordinated.

The vouchers will be used where they are essential to a successful transition from welfare to
work--that is, where housing assistance is critical for a family to get or keep ajob. To receive a
welfare to work voucher, a family must be eligible for or currently receiving Temporary
Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) or have received TANF within the past two years, and
not already receiving HUD tenant-based housing assistance.

                           More Welfare Recipients are Working than Before Reform

     New data show the percentage of welfare recipients working has greatly increased. Since 1992,
     the percentage of adults on welfare in direct work activities -- employment, work experience, and
     community service -- has tripled, rising from 7 percent in 1992 to nearly 22 percent in 1997.
     Nationwide, 28 percent of all adults on welfare are participating in direct work activities or other
     welfare-to-work activities, such as vocational training, and nearly every state met the law's 25
     percent participation rate for FY 1997. (Source: Case load data reported by the states to HHS--related data
     is now available on ACF's public affairs web site.)

     Estimates based on Census Bureau data show that 1.5 million individuals who received welfare
     in 1997 were working in March 1998. This reflects an impressive 28 percent increase since
     1996 in the percentage of people who were on welfare in one year and working the following
     year -- from 26.5 percent in 1996 to 33.8 percent in 1998. (Source: HHS calculations of Census Bureau
     data.)

     Census Bureau data also show a dramatic shift towards employment among welfare recipients:
     the percentage of single women on welfare who were working increased by 50 percent from 1992
     to 1997. In 1992,40% of single women on welfare had earnings from employment and 60% did
     not; by 1997, these ratios had switched and 60% of single women on welfare had earnings from
     employment while 40% did not. In addition, the Census Bureau data show that the proportion of
     single mothers working has increased dramatically since 1992 and the number of women
     receiving welfare and not working has decreased dramatically. (Source: Harvard University Professor
     Jeffrey B. Liebman's calculations using Census Bureau Current Population Survey data. The data from 1996 and
     earlier appeared in Table III of his article "The Impact of the Earned Income Tax Credit on Incentives and Income
     Distribution" Tax Policy and the Economy, 12, 83-119.)

     New data from the states show that not only are more welfare recipients working but their
     average earnings have increased by nearly 20 percent. Average monthly earnings, which were
     about $506 in the nine month period from October 1996 to June 1997, rose to $593 in the last
     three months of FY 1997 (July through September 1997). (Source: Case load data reported by the states
