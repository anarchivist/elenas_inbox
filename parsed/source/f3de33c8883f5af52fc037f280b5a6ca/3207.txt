Hawaii "reciprocal beneficiaries" law to take effect
New legislation gives many, but not all, marriage rights to registered
same-sex couples

by Peter Freiberg

Statewide legislation that Gay activists say offers the most recognition
and benefits to Gay couples in this country will take effect in Hawaii on
July 8.

Gov. Benjamin Cayetano, a Democrat, decided to let the bill become law
without his signature, despite previous statements that he would sign the
measure as "tantamount to civil rights."

Cayetano's press secretary, Kathleen Racuya-Markrich, who told the Blade on
June 20 that Cayetano would definitely sign the bill, said three days later
that the governor was out of town for the week and that she didn't know why
he decided not to sign it. The deadline for vetoing the bill was June 23.

The new state law sets up a new category of legally recognized
relationships - "reciprocal beneficiaries" - for Gay and other
non-heterosexual couples.

Under the statute, reciprocal beneficiaries are defined as two adults, over
age 18, who are prohibited bylaw from marrying. An unmarried heterosexual
couple would be ineligible, but a range of family members could apply along
with same-sex couples. Applicants do not have to live together, but must
simply sign and have notarized an application to be provided by the state
health department, which will issue a Reciprocal Beneficiaries Relationship


certificate for $8 (compared to $32 for a marriage certificate) .

The certificate will look "similar to what a marriage certificate looks
like," said health department communications director Patrick Johnston. He
said out-of-state couples will be able to get certificates, too, but that
only Hawaii residents will receive any benefits.

The new law includes a requirement that private employers who provide
family health coverage for their married workers also offer such coverage
to reciprocal beneficiaries and their dependents.

The state and counties must also extend health insurance coverage to
reciprocal beneficiaries and their dependents and pay part of the cost.

But despite health insurance and other benefits that the new law gives to
"couples ... barred by law from marriage," activists in Hawaii and
elsewhere who are seeking legalization of same-sex marriages have decidedly
mixed feelings about the legislation.

Evan Wolfson, director of the Marriage Project of Lambda Legal Defense and
Education Fund, said the Hawaii reciprocal beneficiaries law "is the
broadest and most significant recognition extended to non-marital families,
including Gay and Lesbian couples, ever on American soil."

But Wolfson said the beneficiaries legislation does "not come close to the
unique, broad array of legal and economic, tangible and intangible,
protections, benefits and responsibilities that come only with civil
marriage."

Separate isn't equal

"It is still separate and unequal, and even if it were equal, separate is
still unequal," said Wolfson.

Tracey Bennett, a lobbyist for Equal Marriage Hawaii, a group that supports
the court case seeking legalization of Gay marriages in Hawaii, said
bluntly, "We're all pissed."

The law is "not good enough," said Bennett. "If we didn't have the court
case, we'd be dancing in the streets [over the new law], but we know we
deserve more. We deserve to be equal."

Another Hawaii activist, Kate Sample, called the new law "a step in the
right direction," but said, "It was definitely a compromise and, I feel, a
sellout, but politically [the legislators] didn't see any other way."

Dan Foley, co-counsel with Wolfson in the lawsuit by three Hawaii Gay
couples seeking marriage licenses, said that despite its flaws, the new law
"is a very significant step forward."

"The straight community, I think, will become more ... accepting of
same-sex unions once they see this in operation," said Foley. "Real couples
are going to have real rights."

The new law, which will allow couples to begin registering July 8, was
approved by the legislature in April as part of a deal that seeks to derail
an anticipated state supreme court ruling to require the state to issue
marriage licenses to same-sex couples.

With Hawaii politicians under fierce pressure from the Roman Catholic and
"


    Mormon churches, along with the fundamentalist religious right, to restrict
    marriage to heterosexual couples, legislators passed a bill to put before
    the voters a constitutional amendment that would give the legislature the
    right to define marriage in a way that only heterosexual couples can obtain
    marriage licenses.

    The Hawaii Supreme Court, which ruled in 1993 that the state has to show a
    compelling reason to deny marriage licenses to same-sex couples, is
    weighing a final decision. The aim of the constitutional amendment is to
    insure that even if the court rules that Gay couples are entitled to
    marriage licenses, the legislature will be able to overturn that decision.

    In exchange for going along with the constitutional amendment, pro-Gay
    members of the Senate demanded that the legislature make available a
    package of benefits and responsibilities for same-sex domestic partners.

    But in the end, the new category of "reciprocal beneficiaries created goes
    beyond Gay couples."

    "It was pure politics," said State Sen. Scott Matsunaga (D), a strong
    supporter of equal rights for Gay people. "The Senate had wanted to limit
    ... benefits to same-sex couples, but the House, perhaps motivated by
    right-wing concerns, didn't want to give benefits only to Gay [couples].
    They felt that would be giving special rights."

    Foley said that even though, for example, a widow and her unmarried son
    might register, "the primary beneficiaries of [the new law] will be
    same-sex couples."

    Foley said the new law was covertly supported by Roman Catholic, Mormon,
    and religious right lobbyists, who knew that without passage of the
    reciprocal ben~ficiaries law they could not win passage of the
    constitutional amendment proposal.

    "They couldn't say publicly they were doing this for Gay couples," said
    Foley, "even though in effect they were."

    52 of 300 benefits

    Matsunaga said he and other pro-Gay legislators had to recognize "political
    reality" and agree to present the constitutional amendment to the voters.
    In exchange, he said, they won "substantially similar" economic rights and
    benefits for non-traditional couples.

    "While everyone else gets to go to the buffet line," said Matsunaga, "Gays
    will now be allowed to go to the salad bar. They're still not getting the
    full buffet, but at least they're getting a partial meal."

    But activist Tracey Bennett said the benefits are greatly inferior to those
    available to married couples. Reciprocal beneficiaries, Bennett said, are
    given only about 52 state benefits - out of what she said are at least 300
    benefits married couples receive. And, of course, Gay couples are barred
    from any federally related benefits.

    Among the benefits that the Hawaii legislation says are "substantially
    equivalent" to those extended to married spouses are:

    survivorship rights, among them inheritance, workers compensation, and
    state employees' retirement benefits; health-related benefits, among them
    hospital visitation and family and funeral leave; legal standing of


beneficiaries relating to victims rights, domestic violence family status,
and the ability to sue in instances of wrongful death; and, miscellaneous
benefits, such as use of state" university facilities use couples and use of
government vehicles in family emergencies.

But there is also a long list of benefits denied to reciprocal
beneficiaries - not only federally related rights accorded married couples,
but also rights linked to traditional marriage.

"What you're not getting," said Matsunaga, who co-chairs the Senate
Judiciary Committee, "are things that are related to federal status because
of the [1996 federal] Defense of Marriage Act [which bars federal
recognition of same-sex couples]. We couldn't give those."

"We're also not giving," said Matsunaga, "the rights that are so
intricately tied to marriage, such as divorce, alimony and palimony, and
child custody . . . . What you are getting, the cornerstone of the rights and
benefits, are health insurance benefits."

Matsunaga said it was a struggle for the Senate to win the rights it did
get for beneficiaries from the House, which is more conservative and
strongly against equal marriage rights for Gays. "The House just wanted to
give a couple of radishes," he said.

Some of the benefits that remain unavailable to Gay couples are relatively
minor, but many aren't.

The state, which automatically gives a hunting license to the spouse of a
military servicemember, will not do so for reciprocal beneficiaries. A
deduction for filing joint state income tax returns, which was originally
proposed by the Senate, was eventually deleted. A reciprocal beneficiary
who leaves the family will not be required to pay child support, even if he
or she was the main provider.

Governor's about-face

Cayetano's decision not to sign the bill came as a surprise. Earlier this
month, one group, the Hawaii Business Health Council, which includes some
of the state's largest businesses, expressed concern about the cost to
private employers and the state and urged the governor to veto it. Cayetano
then commented, according to the Honolulu Star-Bulletin:

"I look at it more from a point of view of according certain rights to
people of a certain sexual orientation. You can't put a cost ... on
something that is tantamount to civil rights." Cayetano called the bill "a
historic step forward."

Attorney Foley said Cayetano had repeatedly backed giving benefits to
domestic partners; on June 15, the governor stated on a radio program that
he would sign the bill. His press secretary, however, said there may be
"technical flaws" in the legislation that led him not to sign it. Sue
Reardon, director of Marriage Project Hawaii, said she wanted to hear
Cayetano's reasons for not signing before offering any comment.

Under a timetable dictated by the Hawaii Constitution, Cayetano's decision
to let the bill become law without his signature postponed the date it
takes effect by one week, to July 8, according to the Health Department's
Johnston.

Wolfson of Lambda Legal said that while some Gay activists have criticized


the marriage effort for allegedly diverting energy from other goals, the
new Hawaii statute "is yet again strong evidence that that's not true."

"Fighting for the freedom to marry," said Wolfson, "compels even our most
bitter enemies to move in our direction to offer recognition and concrete
benefits to our families."

Foley believes   the reciprocal beneficiaries law may help create a "comfort
zone" in which   citizens of Hawaii will get used to same-sex couples having
civil rights -   and might be more inclined to vote against the
constitutional   amendment.

There is no possibility other states will completely imitate Hawaii's
beneficiaries law, even pro-Gay ones like those in New England. The reason
is that all other states are prohibited by federal statute from requiring
private employers to offer health and pension benefits. Years ago, Hawaii
obtained an exemption from that law.

"That helps explain why we were able to go farther in Hawaii," said
Wolfson, "but it also underscores ... why it is so critically important to
redouble efforts to win the freedom to marry."
