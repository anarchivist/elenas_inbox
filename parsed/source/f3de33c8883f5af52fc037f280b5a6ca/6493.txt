TEXT:
Mary, Cynthia and I had the meeting with Rob Mangus (Ford) and Ridge
Schuyler (Robb) today along with Gotbaum and OMB staff, HHS, Jerry, and
USDA.  They are closer to an agreement than they have been: Mangus puts
it at 80%, but are stuck on a couple of smaller problems. On the crucial
issue of cost they agree it shouldn't go above $2.1 billion a year.   Ford
is very strong on this and Robb agrees although they admit. their proposal
may currently go high.  Timing-wise they are hoping to be ready to talk
publicly by 3/12 and want to approach R tobacco senators soon.   The
current version of the compromise is based on treating flue and burley
slightly differently -- both sides are ok with that. The problem comes
from Robb's idea of dropping the level of subsidy. We will work with USDA
and the senators to find some new 'option on this.  The overall goal still
looks feasible to them, a proposal the farmers groups and all 12 senators
could be behind that is not offensive to the health community.   Gotbaum
agreed after the meeting that a proposal that came in at $2 billion was
worth supporting, despite the fact that it will likely offend his
efficiency sensibilities. We will get back with Ford and Robb early next
week.
