TEXT:
Message Creation Date was at   9-DEC-1996 12:49:00

You should have received a copy of the HHS proposed "final" draft bill that


would make technical amendments to the welfare reform law (P.L. 104-193) [see
LRM MDH-1J .  Note that HHS has included in its package a new provision
regarding the treatment of certain Amerasian immigrants as refugees (see page
64 ).

 HHS has asked that OMB provide it with clearance to transmit its draft bill
to Congress by Tuesday, December 10th. For this reason, comments are due to me
by noon tomorrow (Tuesday). Thank you.
