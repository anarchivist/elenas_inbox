  EK:

  A long, drawn out Q and A on crack for the black journalist event.  Sorry
  so late. Let me know what you think.   I think it's pretty definate that
  this will come up.

  Also, we should probably run it by Peter before we finalize.  Don't you
  think.  In the end, he and Tracey will probably have to call some members
  no matter what we say.

     Questions/Answers for National Association of Black Journalists Meeting
                                 July 16, 1997


Q:    Mr. President. your Administration has supported a sentencing policy that
      punishes blacks users of crack cocaine a hundred times more harshly
      than white users of powder cocaine. How can you defend this policy,
      and how can you say that your Administration is promoting racial
      reconciliation and dialogue when you support a policies like this, which
      seem blatantly unfair and discriminatory to most African Americans?

A:    I understand the concern that many African Americans have when they
      are told that black users of crack are punished much more severely than
      white users of powder cocaine. The current disparity in our sentencing
      laws for cocaine -- or the so-called 100 to 1 ratio -- is unfair and should be
      adjusted. But the issue is not as simple and straightforward as equalizing
      penalties, and I would like to explain why.

      Since the mid 1980s, crack cocaine -- and the armed gangs that deal in it
      -- have fueled an unprecedented level of violence in our cities and
      among our youth. And while this violence now seems to have stabilized,
      it remains at intolerable levels -- and crack cocaine defendants continue
      to be associated with much more violence than powder cocaine and
      other drug users. In principle then, I continue to believe that crack
      cocaine should be punished more severely than powder cocaine -- and
      that is why I rejected the Sentencing Commission's proposal last year to
      equalize penalties for crack and powder cocaine.

      In practice, however, my Administration has realized that the current 100
      to 1 ratio, which triggers 5-year mandatory drug penalties for crack users
      at 5 grams and for powder users at 500 grams, is flawed. Generally
      speaking, federal law enforcement resources should target serious drug
      traffickers -- or at least mid-level dealers that can provide information to
      help prosecute these more serious traffickers. Both the 5 and 500 gram
      triggers in current law seem to miss this mark: the crack trigger is too low,
      and the powder trigger is too high.

      To some extent, however, we already compensate for this flaw in two
      ways: First, federal prosecutors generally use their discretion to target the
      more serious offenders. Thus, the typical crack defendant convicted in
      the federal system is not a kid, not a first-time offender and likely to have
      carried a gun and trafficked in at least 80 grams of crack -- or, frankly, a
      serious criminal. Second, the "safety valve" provision that I signed into
      law as part of the 1994 Crime Bill exempts certain first-time, non-violent
                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion

crack offenders from the 5-year mandatory drug penalty. As a result,
hundreds of drug offenders -- including the small percentage of lower
level crack dealers that make their way into the federal system -- will be
eligible to have their sentences reduced an average of 25%.

In the final analysis, however, our own flexible policies in enforcing the law
do not change the fact that the extreme disparity between crack and
powder penalties is unjustified and should be reduced. That's why I
intend to support a reduction in the 100 to 1 ratio, and to work with
Members of Congress to make such a change to current law. The
Sentencing Commission recently recommended a range of sensible
options for doing this. I believe they suggested that penalties for powder
and crack cocaine should be "pinched" -- that is to say, that the trigger
for powder should be dropped from 500 grams to somewhere between
125 and 375 grams, and that the trigger for crack should be increased
from 5 grams to somewhere between 25 and 75 grams. And I will ask the
Attorney General and Drug Director to work with Members of Congress to
adopt make an adjustment within these ranges.
