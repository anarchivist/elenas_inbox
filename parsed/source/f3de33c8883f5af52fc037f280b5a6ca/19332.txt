TEXT:
Elena,
The letter from Secys Herman, Daley and Attorney General Reno was
transmitted to the Hill for the mark-up of Abraham's bill this morning.
The information that we have received from the Hill: The Kennedy bill was
introduced as a substitute, and defeated 10 to 8, with all Democrats
voting for it.  Then, the Abraham/Hatch substitute (that we heard about
last night, but only got to see late this morning) was accepted, by a vote
of 12 to 6 (both Feinstein and Kohl voted for this substitute). This new
version of the Abraham bill has a temporary (rather than permanent)
increase in the cap (for five years) and has a weak no lay-off provision.
According to Ray Uhalde from Labor after the vote, there was talk of
needing more conversations on this.
NEC and I are doing a short q&a on this that I will send to you soon.
Also, I am sending over a final version of the letter.  Thanks.

Julie
