                          Meeting with Entertainment Industry
                                     April 30, 1999


Q:   Can you tell us more about the meeting announced by the President today?

A:   Today, the President called for a White House meeting in May with representatives from
     the entertainment industry -- including everyone from video games to music to movies to
     television -- as well as with parents, educators, religious leaders, and young people
     themselves. This will be a working meeting -- or as the President said, a strategy
     session -- to discuss what all of us can do to accept our shared responsibility to teach
     and protect our children from the violence that is all to pervasive in our society.
     Although many of the details will be worked out in the coming days, we expect all
     attendees to come prepared with constructive suggestions on how we can move
     forward on this important issue.


Q:   What specifically do you expect to come from this meeting?

A:   Essentially, we expect two things: First, that everyone attending recognized that we all
     have a role in addressing the issue of children and violence -- and that no one groups is to
     blame or exempt from the responsibility to act. Second, we expect this to be the first of
     a series of meetings with all interested groups that will help us find common ground on
     these issues and spur a grass-roots movement across the country to tum our children away
     from violence.


Q:   Will the President challenge the entertainment industry to reduce the level of
     violence in its programming?

A:   The President will include all of the entertainment industry in this meeting, and challenge
     them to live up to their responsibilities. They -- perhaps as much as anyone -- can be a
     very powerful force for good or ill. They must be at the table and part of our efforts to
     find solutions.


Q:   What will the President say to the entertainment industry the next time he goes to
     Hollywood to raise money for the Democratic Party? Will he challenge them then?

A:   You should remember that President Clinton was one of the first government leaders to
     challenge the entertainment industry. His first year in office he gave a pointed speech to
     the industry about its responsibilities. More importantly, his words were followed up
     with action. He and the Vice President have fought for the V-Chip (which will soon be
     available in most televisions sets), a TV ratings system, and new tools to allow parents to
     help monitor and control their children's access to the Internet and other on-line services.
                                                               i\utamate~~:'~~mp Conve;~ion

Q:   Who will be invited to this meetings?

A:   The list of invitees will be determined in the coming days. But as the President
     mentioned, we will include representatives from all of the entertainment industry -- as
     well as parents, educators, religious leaders, and young people themselves. We will
     also consult with Members of Congress.
