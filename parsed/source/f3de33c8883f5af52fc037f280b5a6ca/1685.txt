Subject:         Bifurcation: Elena and I think the letter Thurm sent' you i's
unacceptable

Bruce, as you know, Elena and I have been insisting the HHS agree to
propose language to apply the work rates to the state programs, and a key
part of that is getting them to say they plan to do so in the letter they
are sending to the Hill re: technicals bill being marked up Wednesday.

We sent them a perfectly reasonable redraft on Friday. Thurm sent you a
redraft that completely ignores our concerns. We're holding our ground.
FYI -- Attached is the letter we've proposed.

The Honorable E. Clay Shaw, Jr.
Chairman, Subcommittee on Human Resources
Committee on Ways and Means
U.S. House of Representatives
Washington, D.C. 20515

Dear Mr. Chairman:

I am pleased to offer the Department's support for the Welfare Reform Technical Corrections
Act of 1997 (HR 1048). This legislation will help ensure the effective implementation of the
Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996.

As you know, the Commissioner of Social Security and I forwarded our recommendations for
technical and conforming amendments to the landmark welfare reform legislation in December.
We are pleased that your bill includes most of the amendments recommended by HHS as well as
a number of others that, upon further review, were found to be necessary. We note, however,
the omission of certain amendments that were included in the Administration's proposed
technical corrections package and would be happy to work with you and the affected agencies to
facilitate their inclusion in the bill.

In addition, we look forward to working with you in the weeks ahead on other important issues
related to the implementation of welfare reform. As you know, we recently released guidance to
States on the State spending provisions under TANF. We are interested in confirming these
State maintenance of effort requirements and ensuring the work-based focus of welfare reform.
In particular, we want to collect information on how States are using their dollars to ensure that
State policies focus on work; we want to work with you and the Governors in a bipartisan fashion
to ensure that each State's overall work effort meets the statue's work participation requirements
by clarifying that the calculation of whether a state has met the applicable participation rate shall
take into account the state's success in placing in work activities participants both in TANF and
in state maintenance of effort programs; and we want to work with the States and Congress to
ensure that State flexibility in maintenance of effort programs does not result in costs to the
Federal Government due to the potential loss of child support collections. We plan to submit
specific legislative proposals in these and other areas, but would be willing to engage in
constructive discussions with Congress and Governors on other potential options.

I want to thank you and Representative Levin for the bipartisan manner in which you have
developed HR 1048. My staff and I hope to work with you to ensure speedy enactment of this
important legislation, and to address the other issues related to welfare reform implementation.

                                                      Sincerely,

                                                      Donna E. Shalala
