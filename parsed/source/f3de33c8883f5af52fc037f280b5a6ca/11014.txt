TEXT:
MSNBC ON-LINE INTERVIEW WITH ELENA KAGAN, DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE DOMESTIC
POLICY COUNCIL
Aired on February 2, 1999

                Our guest is Elena Kagan, Deputy Director of the Domestic
Policy
                Council and Deputy Assistant to the President for Domestic
Policy, to
                chat about the budget.

                Host Elena_Kagan says:
                Hi, it is great to be here. I'm ready for the first
question.

                Host Chris_MSNBC says:
                Question from Leeds:   Most economic experts. including
Alan
                Grenspan, have said Clinton's social security plan which
involves
                government investing in the stock market would seriously
undermine
                our free market economy. Have you rethought this proposal?

                Host Elena_Kagan says:
                First, letD,s talk about what Greenspan said.   For the
most part he
                approves the SS, plan.   The main point of the proposal is
to take
                62% of the Surplus and to pay down debt, and to use the
savings
                for Social Security -- he said that that was exactly the
right thing
                to do.
                Greenspan has been very supportive of our Social Security
proposal.
                 Greenspan criticized one aspect of that proposal. Which
was to put a
                small portion into the stock market.   We respectfully
disagree with


                   Mr. Greenspan.    We feel that this can occur with real
safeguards so
                   there is no politicization of the returns.
                   This will make it possible to preserve SS for the future.
So in
                   short Mr. Greenspan agreed with the main proposal - to use
the
                   62% surplus for SS.    And for the part he didn't agree with
- to
                   use a small part for the stock market, we think that Mr.
GreenspanD,s
                   concerns are not correct and that we can put enough
safeguards in to
                   make stock market investments appropriate.

                   Host Chris_MSNBC says:
                   Question from ed:   The budget as submitted depends almost
entirely
                   on new taxes from cigarettes.    Why do you feel cigarette
smokers
                   should be penalized?

                   Host Elena_Kagan says:
                   The Budget submitted does not depend entirely on new taxes
from
                   cigarettes.   Cigarettes are one way in which to raise
funds .. Only
                   oneD(And not the largest.    We don't believe smokers should
be
                   penalized. We believe that increasing the price of
cigarettes will
                   reduce smokingD(especially by youth.    We know that
increasing the
                   price will prevent some kids from smoking and we are
committed to
                   reducing youth smoking in America and thatD,s why the
President's
                   budget has an increase in cigarettes.    Let me say one more
thing, in
                   our budget the money that we get from that increase
cigarette tax is
                   used to reimburse the Government that are incurred as a
result of
                   smoking.   Every year the govt. spends billions of dollars
paying for
                 the costs of lung cancer, heart disease, and other
diseases ... we do
                 that for Federal employees, military, veterans, every year
we do it
                 in Medicare. We use the money in that tobacco tax to
reimburse the
                 government for those costs. We feel it should be the
tobacco
                 companies who pay for those c'osts and not the American
people.

                   Host Chris_MSNBC says:
                   Question from tired:   Why aren't any funds from the
budget allocated
                   to paying off the national debt?



                   Host Elena_Kagan says:
                   There actually are a large part of funds that will payoff
the
                   National Debt.     The President has said that 62% of the
surplus in
                   the next 15 years ought to go to Social Security ... but the
way that
                   works is in these next 15 years ... where the money first
goes is to
                   pay down the national debt.     Then as a result of the
savings that the
                   government realizes there will be more money for the
government to
                   spend on SS.     So when the President says 62% for the
surplusO(from
                   the savings from paying down the national debtO(.we will
have the rest
                   for Social Security.
                   This is an extraordinary thing.     If the budget were
adopted. the
                   national debt would fall sharply.
                   Right now itO,s 44% of gross domestic productsO(that would
fall to
                   7.1%.   And that would be the lowest level of national debt
since
                   WW I.
                   What the budget really does is take these surplus dollars,
reduce the
                   national debt and take the savings for SSO(and in the
process the debt
                   would go down to its lowest level since World War I.

                   Host Chris MSNBC says:
                    Waltzer:   Ms. Kagan
                   Why doesn't the President support eliminating the marriage
penalty
                   presently in the tax laws?

                   Host Elena_Kagan says:
                   We have felt that eliminating the marriage penalty is a
very serious
                   proposal that needs th9ught.    The problem is that itO,s
extremely
                   expensive and we have never been able to figure out how to
pay for a
                   proposal to eliminate the marriage penalty.     Every tax cut
in our
                   budget is paid for and eliminating the marriage penalty is
so
                   expensive that we have not been able to propose it within
the context
                   of a balanced budget.    Some people would want us to use
the surplus
                   monies or give some other very large cut tax ... but we feel
these
                   surplus dollars ought to go to save SS and Medicare to
make sure
                   those programs are solvent well into the next century.
                   This is the course of fiscal restraint that has brought us


the
                  economic good health that we now have.

                  Host Chris_MSNBC says:
                  Question from lynn:    How come the President doesn't
create a better
                  tax break for stay-at-home moms?     $500. for the first year
of life
                  does not really mean much to most .. it seems like a phony
gesture at
                  best.

                  Host Elena_Kagan says:
                  Well $500 could mean a great deal to many families.        What
we're
                saying by this proposal is that all new parents need
helpD(new parents
                who go to work need help to pay for childcareD(but new
parents who
                stay at home also need assistance.  This proposal of $500
is designed
                to give that assistance.  For some families that might not
mean
                anything, but for a great many families that means a great
deal.  So
                whatever choice the parents make, we should respect those
choices and
                assist those families.

                  Host Chris_MSNBC says:
                  Question from ok:    Do you feel the majority will accept
the SS
                  changes the pres. has suggested?

                  Host Elena_Kagan says:
                  We have been encouraged that the Republicans in Congress
for the most
                  part have agreed with the Presidents idea of taking 62% of
the
                  surplus and strengthening social security with it.      What
we would
                  like to do is get together with the Republicans and work
in a
                  bipartisan way to further save SS.    Taking the surplus
will make the
                  SS trust fund solvent until about 2055 - 57 years from now.
                  We would like to make it solvent for 75 years.  We hope to
work with
                  the Republicans in a bipartisan way to meet that.     We
would also like
                  to work with them to take a part of the surplus and put it
into
                  Medicare so it is also able to keep paying the benefits it
does to
                our older citizens.  The Republicans have been less
accepting, but we
                hope that after giving this some thought they will agree
that the
                President is right when he says that a part of the Surplus
(15%)


                      ought to be used for Medicare.

                      Host Chris_MSNBC says:
                      jack_hershey (Jack Southwick) :   Ms. Kagan, Does the
President's
                      budget address any of the more creative "alternative"
                      education areas such as home schooling or charter schools?
Thank you.

                      Host Elena_Kagan says:
                      The President is a big believer in Charter schools.     His
budget asks
                      for increases consistently for more funding for Charter
schools.     The
                      result is an enormous expansion of those schools.     There
were only a
                      few when the President took office, now there are
thousands.     This
                      years budget will include a substantial increase once
again .. And
                      encourage other kinds of public school choice:
                      Another innovative idea:  Some work sites have started to
reach
                      agreements with schools to put schools on or near a
work-site so
                      parents can be near their childrenD(and there has been a
lot of
                      success with these type of schools.
                      The President has a little bit of money in his Budget to
increase
                      choice of schools in a variety of ways.

                      Host Chris_MSNBC says:
                      Question from Leeds:   Historically school budgets and
programs have
                      been the perrogative of local and state governments. Does
the Clinton
                      administration want to nationalize educational policy
making by its
                      proposed educational programs at the national level?

                      Host Elena_Kagan says:
                      We don't want .to nationalize education.    We understand
that local and
                      state governments want primary responsibility, but we do
want to make
                      sure that Federal dollars spent on education are spent
wisely as
                   well. The system needs to be held accountable for
results.     We want
                   to make sure schools across the nation do what we know
works; end
                      social promotion, stop using unqualified teachers &etc
                      State and school districts take responsibility for
identifying and
                      turning around their low performing schools.     In short, we
want to
                      make sure that there is accountability in the school
system and that
                      we do get results for the money we spend.    And we're not


apologetic
                     for that desire to use Federal taxpayer money well to
improve our
                     schools.

                     Host Chris_MSNBC says:
                     Question from Jamielsbell:    But your plan is just
"re-inventing
                     a bigger government" right? The surplus is taxpayer
money .. not
                     yours! Most of us want a tax cut.

                     Host Elena_Kagan says:
                     We have an important decision to make hereD(on how to
spend the
                     surplus.
                     There are some, as the person asking the question, who
think that we
                     should do a very large tax cut - take the surplus and give
it away.
                     But we don't think that thatD,s the strategy that brought
us to the
                     economic position that we are in today.     We have this
economy because
                     we followed a policy of fiscal restraint and fiscal
discipline.     We
                     kept our spending within bounds and we have not done the
kind of tax
                     cuts done in the Reagan administration that caused these
deficits.
                     We feel if we stick to our policy, these economic good
times can last
                     a while longer.   We would like to use the surplus to
reduce the
                     national debt and to secure SS and Medicare into the
future.

                     Host Chris_MSNBC says:
                     Question from BigG:    how come the president doesn't
propose a tax
                     cut for fathers that pay their child support ?

                     Host Elena_Kagan says:
                     Well, we think that paying child support is an obligation.
Not
                     something that ought to be rewarded.     Something that
fathers should
                     have to do.

                     Host Chris_MSNBC says:
                     Question from Audrey Michaels:      MS Kagan, What does the
President
                     have in the budget for veterans?    Thank you

                     Host Elena_Kagan says:
                     The President has a strong budget for veterans as he has
had for the
                     last six years ... with continued increases for Veteran
spending and
                     particularly Veteran health benefits.



                   Host Chris_MSNBC says:
                   Question from scrounge:     I understand that budget policy
is
                   developed via memos. However i am interested in how often
you have
                   the opportunity to meet with the president and have you
expressed a
                   view that he has acted upon in this meeting. in other
words will he
                   respond directly without counsel

                   Host Elena_Kagan says:
                   The President meets with his budget team frequently from
about the
                   middle of November through Christmas - during the period
the budget
                   comes together.    The President meets with the Treasury
Secretary,
                   Deputy Treasury Secretary, and the Director of the Office
of
                   Management and Budget and with officials from the National
Economic
                   Council, and the Domestic Policy Council, where I work.
In those
                  meetings there is intensive discussions about the options
with the
                   budget, what tax cuts to offer, what investments to
propose, and
                   about what the overall structure of the budget should look
like.   The
                   President responds frequently and vigorously to his
advisorsO,
                   questions and comments.    There is a lot of debate about
particular
                  proposals.     The President is very involved in determining
what the
                  budget looks like and what goes into it.

               Host Chris MSNBC says:
                   Question from Christopher: On what issues do you and the
President
                  differ?

                  Host Elena_Kagan says:
                  Even if we did differ on something, I wouldn't say it on
the Internet
                   <grin>

                  Host Chris_MSNBC says:
                  Question from Allison:     What nation's business is not
getting done
                  because of the impeachment inquiry?

                  Host Elena_Kagan says:
                  Well the President is doing the Nation's business
throughout this
                  year.     The President has stuck to his work and every day
he gets up
                  and does what the people of the United States asked him to


do when
                   they elected him.   I think it's more distracting for
Congress than
                   the President and his Staff.    I work hard at the White
House every
                   day doing domestic policy and my work hasn't been effected
at all.
                   The President puts in a full day thinking about what
matters,
                   education, health care, crime, and social security.     The
President
                   does what the people elected him to do ... and what
Congress does is
                   for Congress to answer.

                   Host Chris_MSNBC says:
                   Question from sandflea:    What particular proposal has
required more
                   time and effort to resolve?

                   Host Elena_Kagan says:
                   I think that the question of what to do with this amazing
surplus has
                   required the most time to resolve.
                   It is such an important question because its such a large
                   surplus ... and we can waste it or use it in a way that
secures our
                   future.   The President and his budget team put an enormous
amount of
                   time into thinking about the different options for the
surplus ... and
                   considering how we could use the surplus that continues
our economic
                success and that secures these critically important
programs - social
                security and Medicare.  ThatO,s what we spent the most
time on this
                year.

                   Host Elena_Kagan says:
                   Thank you, I very much enjoyed this. The questions have
been great. I
                   had a good time here tonight!
