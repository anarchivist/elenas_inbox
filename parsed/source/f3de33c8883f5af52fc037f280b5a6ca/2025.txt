DRAFT-- NOT FOR RELEASE

April 28, 1997
         (Senate)

S. 543 - Volunteer Protection Act of 1997
(Coverdell (R) Georgia and 7 cosponsors)

The Administration strongly opposes S. 543, the "Volunteer Protection Act
of 1997."

As a general matter, tort law is the responsibility and prerogative of the
States, rather than of Congress.  This is an area in which States have
served as laboratories, testing and developing new ideas and making needed
reforms.  This tradition, moreover, has been particularly strong with
respect to volunteers, nonprofit organizations, and government entities.
Those seeking new and sweeping Federal restrictions on areas traditionally
reserved to the States should bear the burden of justifying Federal
intervention.  The proponents of this bill have not demonstrated the need
for Federal legislation that would override critical features of the
liability laws of the States as they apply to volunteers, nonprofit
organizations, and government entities.

Also, the bill's proposed abolishment of joint-and-several liability for
noneconomic damages (e.g., pain and suffering) means that victims
sometimes would not be fully compensated for terrible harm.  Where under
current law a joint wrongdoer will make the victim whole, under this bill
an innocent victim would suffer when one wrongdoer cannot pay his portion
of the judgment. This provision is all the more troubling because it
unfairly discriminates against the most vulnerable members of our society
-- i.e., the elderly, the poor, and nonworking women -- whose injuries
often involve mostly noneconomic losses.  There is no reason for this kind
of discrimination. Noneconomic damages are as real and as important to
victims as economic damages. A tort system should not be created in which
people with the greatest need of protection stand the least chance of
receiving it.
