Czech Republic and Race. On September 1, a member of the senior Initiative staff met with
visitors from the Czech Republic who wanted to learn more about the work of the Initiative.
The visitors are on a three-week visit to the United States sponsored by the USIA, and wanted to
discuss the development of a program to address discrimination against the Roma population
(Gypsies) in the Czech Republic.

Nevada State Legislatures. On September 4, Mickey Ibarra and a member of the senior
                                                              Automated Records Management System

FEDERAL AGENCY ACTIVITIES

Department of Justice

       Florida Voting Changes. On August 14, DOJ interposed an objection under Section 5
       of the Voting Rights Act to portions ofa state statute changing Florida's voting
       procedures. While DOJ precleared many provisions aimed at reducing election fraud, it
       objected to certain restrictions in absentee voting that appeared to have a discriminatory
       effect for minority voters. These included requirements to list the last four digits of the
       voter's social security number on the absentee voting certificate and that absentee ballots
       be witnessed by a notary or by a registered Florida voter. DOl's analysis revealed that
       during the limited time in which the state implemented these unprecleared absentee
       voting requirements, proportionately more minority voters' ballots were rejected for not
       complying with the new requirements than were white voters' ballots. In addition,
       DOl's analysis indicated that minority voters are more likely to utilize the absentee
       balloting system.

Department of Agriculture

       Cherokee Nation. On August 25, Secretary Glickman signed a cooperative agreement
       that will provide the Cherokee Nation with technical assistance and information to
       manage the delivery of USDA programs.

Department of Commerce

       National Minority Enterprise Development (MED) Week. Department of Commerce
       officials are planning and participating in regional activities commemorating National
       Minority Enterprise Development Week (September 20-26). On Sept. 9, Deputy
       Secretary Mallett will be a keynote speaker at a Dallas regional MED Week event. The
       National MED Week Conference will be held in Washington, DC, September 20-23, at
       the Marriott Wardman Park Hotel.

      Native American Welfare. On September 9, DOL plans to announce the final eight
      Native American Welfare-to-Work grants for fiscal year 1998. The grants, totaling
      $780,348 will be awarded to Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation (W A),
      Inter-Tribal Council of Nevada, Inc. (NY), Kiowa Tribe of Oklahoma, Lummi Tribe
      (WA), Maniilaq Manpower (AK), Nooksak Indian Tribe (WA), Cliff Band of Lake
      Superior Chippewa (WI), and Tohono Odham Reservation (AZ).

Department of Health and Human Services

      Surgeon General Address. On August 31, Surgeon General Satcher addressed the
      United South and Eastern Tribes board of directors in Cambridge, MA. He spoke about
      racial and ethnic disparities and his priorities as Surgeon General, including mental
      health, smoking, diabetes, and suicide prevention.

Department of Housing and Urban Development

      "Healing Neighborhoods" Conference. On September 27-29, HUD will sponsor the
      "Healing Neighborhoods" Conference as a follow-up to the White House Hate Crimes
      Conference held in November, 1997. The conference theme is Overcoming Racial and
      Cultural Conflicts. It will feature a series of high profile plenary sessions, opportunities
      for small group discussion, and workshops on topics such as: victim assistance, the law
      and prosecution of hate activities, designing responses to hate activities, and special
      initiatives offederal agencies.

      One America Training. Cultural diversity training, developed under an agreement
      between HUD and the National Association of Realtors began throughout the country on
      August 24. Real estate agents who take this one-day course and a refresher every two
      years will be authorized to use the trademarked One America logo on letterhead and
      business cards, in advertising, and in other ways specified in the agreement, provided they
      remain free offair housing violations. HUD plans to enter into a similar agreement with
      the National Association of Real Estate Brokers in September.


Small Business Administration

      Hispanic Partnerships. On August 29, SBA signed a partnership agreement in
      Columbus, OH with four Hispanic Chambers of Commerce during the first-ever
      Hispanic Small Business recognition dinner. To date, 23 national Hispanic
      organizations have agreed to sign a partnership agreement with SBA at the signing
      ceremony during Hispanic Heritage Month.
