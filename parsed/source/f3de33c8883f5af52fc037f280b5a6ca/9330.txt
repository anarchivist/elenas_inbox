TEXT:
House Rules committee accepted Bill Clay-sponsored class size amendement
as substitute for Dollars to classroom block grant.   Debate will begin
Thursday after 5:00pm, and vote will occur Friday before noon.   We will
lose. Larry Stein, Ann Lewis, Barbara Chow, I    and several others think
that POTUS should open his Friday afternoon statement to the PIR meeting
with a comment on how the Republicans made the wrong move by rejecting
smaller classes.  I'm working with speechwriting to get this into his
remarks.
