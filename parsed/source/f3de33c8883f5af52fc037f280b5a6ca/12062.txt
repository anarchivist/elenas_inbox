     Proposal


     Revised Pay Information Provision   (S.71 in 10Sth)

     Sec. 4 COLLECTION OF PAY INFORMATION BY THE EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY
     COMMISSION.

             Section 709 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e-4) is
     amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:

             0&(1) The Commission shall, not more than 18 months following the
     enactment into law of this subsection:


     A.  Complete a survey of data that is currently available to the federal
     government relating to employee pay information for use in the enforcement
     of the federal laws prohibiting pay discrimination and, and in
     consultation with other relevant federal agencies, identify additional
     data collections that will enhance enforcement of these laws, and

     B. After consideration of this study and consultation, by regulation
     provide for the collection of pay information data from employers who have
     100 or more employees for each working day in each of 20 or more calendar
     weeks in the current or preceding calendar year described by the sex,
     race, and national origin of employees.

              (2) In implementing Section (1), the primary factor the Commission
     shall consider is the most effective means for enhancing the enforcement
     of the federal laws prohibiting pay discrimination. The Commission shall
     also consider other factors including: imposition of burden on employers;
     the frequency of reports including which employers should be required to
     annually prepare reports; and the most effective format of the report for
     data collection.

             (3) the Commission is authorized up to $2 million to promulgate
     this regulation.
