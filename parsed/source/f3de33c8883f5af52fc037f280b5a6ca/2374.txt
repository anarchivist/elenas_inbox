TEXT:
Senators Ford, Hollings, Robb and Cleland have just sent a letter to the

VP saying that the President called for "comprehensive, bipartisan

legislation," and that they too want a bipartisan solution.    They want the

Vp to use tomorrow's event to "detail the steps the Administration is

willing to take, and to enter into direct negotiations with Republican

leaders by a date certain to achieve a bipartisan solution."   They end

with another call for the Administration to take "concrete steps to

initiate negotiations as soon as possible."
