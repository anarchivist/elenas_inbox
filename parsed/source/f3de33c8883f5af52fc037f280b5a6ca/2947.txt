TEXT:
A good friend in San Francisco (her name is Deena Lahn) got an invitation
from you to come to the child care planning conference on Wednesday.
Since it would be a bit of a stretch for her to come, she's wondering if
it's a worthwhile meeting.  Any guidance I can pass along to her
diplomatically?
