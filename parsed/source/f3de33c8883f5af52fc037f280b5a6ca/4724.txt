TEXT:
As Lauren and HHS Members were so kind to point out, we will not be at
work on Monday ... although it was nice of Laura Emmett and Jennifer Klein
to volunteer to corne in ...

The internal Child Care mtg will be in Janet's office, East wing, 112
on Tues @ 1:00pm.

Could you all let me know if this day is better?   Thanks.

Also, 10:00am on Tues we are going to try and do the long awaited blue dog
mtg in 2245 Rayburn.
