TEXT:
Erskine:  Kevin asked me to forward you a quick note on tomorrow's managed
care briefing by Donna Shalala and her staff.

Tomorrow, HHS will brief you on threats by a number of major Medicare
Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) to pullout of the program and
stop coverage to perhaps hundreds of thousands of Medicare beneficiaries.
The HMOs are citing concerns about "undercompensation and over-regulation"
as the underlying rationale for their decisions.

The American Association of Health Plans (AAHP) -- the trade organization
that represents numerous HMOs -- just held a press conference today to
advise the media that a number of health plans will announce that they are
pulling out of the program before next week's October 1st Medicare plan
participation deadline.
We are aware that, at the very least, the Wall Street Journal will have an
article on this issue tomorrow.

AS of this writing, it is unclear how many HMOs will choose to drop out of
the Medicare program. We know that Aetna, Prudential, Humana, and Cigna
has already indicated that they are pulling out of some Medicare markets.
We understand that PacificCare, United Health and some state Blue
Cross/Blue Shield plans are seriously contemplating leaving the program.

Although these plans represent many HMOs participating in Medicare, it is
important for you to know that they are selectively choosing which
Medicare markets they want to stay in depending on the level of their
regional payment rates and how large their markets are. As a consequence,
the number of beneficiaries affected represents a relative small
percentage (5-7 percent) of the 5-6 million beneficiaries participating in
Medicare HMOs.  In addition, this number does not even net ou·t the over 40


new contracts HCFA has received for new Medicare HMO business.  Having
said this, 5-7 percent of the current contracts who are threatening to
leave still would mean that between 100,000 and 500,000 beneficiaries
would be forced to opt for either a new HMO or return to traditional
Medicare fee-for-service coverage.

There are two reasons why these large plans can withdraw from the program
with very little impact on the number of beneficiaries served.    First,
only 16 percent of Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in managed care in
the first place.   And second, the HMOs appear to be keeping their
contracts with Medicare in those markets in which they have a large market
share and, conversely,  tending to drop those markets in which they serve
very small populations.   (Large market share protects plans from
unexpected, unwanted and expensive risk selection problems; they also
cover up the fact that most HMOs do not manage care very efficiently.)

Tomorrow's meeting will give HHS the opportunity to provide you with their
analysis of the Medicare HMO situation.  It will also give us the chance
to develop an Administration strategy around how best to respond to the
news.  (One quick final thought: I believe that most key Republicans on
the Hill, independent analysts, and the aging advocates will be fairly
skeptical about the HMOs' rationale behind their decisions to drop out of
Medicare; as a result, we need to make sure that we conclude on a strategy
that uses them all as allies so as to avoid making this an
Administration-only vs. HMO conflict.
