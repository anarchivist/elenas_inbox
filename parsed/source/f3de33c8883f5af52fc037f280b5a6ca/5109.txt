TEXT:
The Deputies meeting on Superfund was not particularly eventful. The
Republicans are prepared to make a final offer on the Senate, and the
Democrats are readying a response. Out of some twelve areas,
Administrator Browner and the Senate Republicans have only been able to
reach agreement in approximately three (including sustainable
communities). Agreement .on liabilities is still a long way off.

EPA, Justice, and CEQ believe that the negotiations in the Senate are
about to turn partisan.   I then raised the strategic question of whether
it was really in our interests for the negotiations to break down.
Apparently, there is some sentiment on the Hill that Democrats would like
to continue the logjam because they want to run on the environment in the
'98 election. I suggested that we should be thinking of ways to
strengthen Chairman Chafee's hands so that he can get his Republican right
back to the table.   People seemed to agree to that proposal in
principle.   However, Katie McGinty then suggested we sit tight for the
next three weeks, till the end of the session, and then regroup among
ourselves and think of ways to bring the parties back to the table.
