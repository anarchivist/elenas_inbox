We understand the Ron Hill at USDA GC has a few more changes to the language we
worked out last night. He's faxing those over shortly and we'll forward to you
as soon as we get them.

Please let us know as soon as soon as possible any changes you think are needed
to USDA's language. We'll review concurrently.    Ron is back from sick leave
today.
