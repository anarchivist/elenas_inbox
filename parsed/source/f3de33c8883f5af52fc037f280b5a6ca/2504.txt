           As you know, we have this outstanding meeting with ADAPT and

other

           disability groups on home and community-based services and other

           disability issues.    ADAPT is certain to want to talk about the

           CASA bill, and so we need HCFA's analysis of it.



           I'm not sure that the bill as introduced (by Gunderson, I think?)

           is as extreme as earlier summaries I had seen.     We would be

           particularly interested in cost implications.     could you get us

         something in the next week?==================== ATTACHMENT         1 ============
