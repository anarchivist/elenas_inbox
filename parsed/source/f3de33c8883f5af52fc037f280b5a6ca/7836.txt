TEXT:
Attached is our best guess of the strike Lugar and strike Ford vote
count.  Please hold it closely, we developed it in coordination with Ford
and Robb's staff.  You need a majority to strike. This count indicates
both sides might have been able to strike, the crucial question is who
would have gone first, and what effect would that have had on the second
vote, i.e. having voted against LEAF, would Senators vote against Lugar
(even if that is their inclination) if that means the end of any special
help for farmers.  Ford says he thinks the tide was turning in our
direction at the end and we would have won if the vote was this week.

Next Steps:

1. We are going to have a daily call (1 p.m.) to coordinate who is
reaching out to which senators and what response they are getting.  The
focus is on Durbin,  ??? D's, and the ??? R's.  The farm groups will reach
out to the tobacco state senatorS,the health groups to the health oriented
D's and R's. Glickman will reach out to the Ag. Cmttee members.

2.  There is on-going efforts on in-state press for McConnell, Thurmond,
Thompson.  McConel1 in particular is taking very tough attacks, making it
more and more critical to him that all the $18 billion be upfront money.
He is digging in.

3.  Strategically, we'd probably be in better shape if we could try and
strike Lugar first, that would leave tobacco staters with no choice but to
vote for LEAF or have nothing.  If there is any chance to flip and get
Ford to offer ahead of Durbin (who I guess had already started to offer
his amendment) that would be good.

4. I was convinced that floating even the rumor of a compromise at this
point is a bad idea.  So many people are looking for one, it would surely
kill LEAF, and the compromise would likely be unacceptable to
Ford/Hollings.  Better to fight this battle first and see if we can't win
with what we have -- if it looks like we will lose, put out a compromise
after LEAF loses but before the vote on Lugar.
