TEXT:
The Vice President's folks are pulling together all available numbers,
they think they can get up to 1,300.  If the number seems good, they'd
like the VP to do an event early next week welcoming the latest hiree to
the Dept. of Labor with a gathering of all the hirees and their
supervisors. I'll keep you posted.
