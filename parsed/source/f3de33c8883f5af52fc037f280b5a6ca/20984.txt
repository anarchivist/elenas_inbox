TEXT:
It looks like you didn't include our item reo racial/ethnic composition of
the welfare caseloads in the weekly last week.  Do you want us to wait.
until we have more definitive answers (we're pulling all the eggheads
together tomorrow). Here's what we submitted last week.

              Welfare Reform -- Minorities on Welfare Reform Caseload: The New York Times
     report on the increasing share of minorities on the welfare caseloads highlights some important
     trends and issues that we will explore further. In the meantime, it's helpful to put the
     information in context.

              First, the racial/ethnic composition of welfare caseloads has been changing gradually
     over the last 25 years: whites rose from 38 percent in 1973 to a peak of 42 percent in 1983 and
     have dropped steadily to 35 percent in 1997. The proportion of blacks has generally declined,
     from 46 percent in 1973 to 37 percent in 1997. As the New York Times points out, the most
     significant trend is the increase in the Hispanic portion of the caseload, from 13 percent in 1973
     to 23 percent in 1997. However, this is not too surprising given the rapid increase in the
     Hispanic population overall. The question is how welfare reform may be affecting these historic
     trends. National data on the racial/ethnic characteristics of welfare recipients are only available
     through June 1997, so it is hard to gauge the impact of the past year when welfare reform efforts
     accelerated so rapidly. Some states have more recent data which they shared with the Times, and
     which may reveal more significant trends. It is also worth noting that the caseload data only
     tells who is currently on the rolls; it does not tell the rate at which different groups are entering
     and exiting.

             Second, the number of white, black and Hispanic families receiving welfare have all
     dropped since 1994 (when caseloads peaked), but the rate of decline has been greater for whites
     than blacks, with an even slower decline for Hispanics.

                                       % Change
     Whites 1.9M      1.4 M       -26%
     Blacks      1.8M       1.5M       -18%
     Hispanics   1.0M         .9M           -9%

              Third, the changes are more dramatic than the actual mix of who is left on the caseloads,
     at least on a national basis. While the story pointed out important trends, the conclusion that the
     composition of the caseload has changed dramatically seems unwarranted.
                      94      .      97
     Whites 37%              35%
     Blacks           36%            37%
     Hispanics        20%            23%

             Fourth, there is some encouraging evidence from Census data that the employment rates
     offormer welfare recipients are increasing even faster for minorities than for whites (although
     the actual rates and the disparity between groups remains disturbing). Between 1996 and 1997,
     the percentage of all prior year welfare recipients who were employed in the next year increased
     by 28%. The increase was highest for blacks (33%), followed by Hispanics (22%) and whites
     (21%).

              Finally, there is longstanding evidence that minorities on welfare disproportionately share
     characteristics that may make it harder to leave the roils: lower education levels, lower marriage
     rates, larger families, employment and housing discrimination, and isolation from areas with
     jobs.
