o    The Administration is closely monitoring the settlement talks among the tobacco
     industry, state attorneys general, public health groups, and private lawyers. Any
     agreement would have to be passed by the Congress and signed by the President.

o    We will carefully review any settlement that emerges from the discussions, and we will
     seek the advice of the public health community. As the President has said, in reviewing
     any settlement proposal, our focus will stay squarely on protecting kids and the public
     health.

Q:   Would you support a settlement that caps punitive damages? That seems to be the
     key stumbling block.

A:   I'm not going to speculate on any particular aspects of a potential settlement. The
     Administration proposed the toughest measures ever to protect children from tobacco,
     and we are fighting in the courts to see that those restrictions take effect. Our focus in
     reviewing any settlement will stay on protecting kids and the public health. The President
     has made it clear he is not going to agree to anything with respect to tobacco that
     jeopardizes the public health.

Q:   Senator Lott and others are urging quick closure to the talks. They say that the
     window of opportunity is closing. Is the Administration trying to help close the
     deal?

A:   No. Because any settlement will have a profound and lasting impact on the public
     health, the Administration will have to consider a settlement in a careful and thorough
     manner. There will be no rush to judgment and no precipitous action. We are not going
     to take a position on a proposal until the Administration and the public health community
     have fully reviewed it.

     Does this work? Also, Todd's memo is misleading.   NBAC does NOT state
     that embryo research is scientificallly important and appropriate, as Todd
     says in his second paragraph.   NBAC simply punted the issue altogether.
     This is a critical difference.  NBAC's will clarify its position on
     embryos (which I assume will remain no position) at its Saturdy mtg., so
     we can capture in Sat. memo to POTUS.==================== ATTACHMENT   1 ===========

Background

On Saturday, June 7, at a local public meeting, the National Bioethics Advisory Commission
(NBAC) is expected to complete its review of cloning issues. In its draft final report, NBAC
concludes that it is morally unacceptable for anyone to attempt to create a child using the
technology that created Dolly the sheep. NBAC bases this conclusion on safety concerns,
finding that the technology is "likely to involve substantial risk to the potential child." NBAC
also concludes, however, that other forms of "human cloning" -- such as the cloning of DNA
sequences, cell lines, and tissues (which do not involve the creation of entire human beings) --
are scientifically important and not ethically problematic. NBAC chose not to address the
creation of embryos; its draft report neither sanctions nor condemns the cloning of embryos.

NBAC's draft final report calls for carefully-worded national legislation prohibiting anyone from
"attempting to create a child through somatic cell nuclear transfer techniques." The
Commission recommends a sunset provision and further review of the issues by an oversight
body prior to the sunset date. The Commission will vote on this recommendation at its public
meeting Saturday, and the President is scheduled to announce legislation implementing NBAC's
proposal in a White House ceremony Monday, June 9th.

TALKING POINTS

o      On Saturday, the National Bioethics Advisory Commission is scheduled to conclude its
       review of the ethical and scientific issues raised by possible human cloning. The
       President expects to receive NBAC's final report soon. We look forward to receiving
       and reviewing the Commissions recommendations.

Q.     The Washington Post reported Wednesday that NBAC will recommend a legislative
ban on creating a child through cloning but that the Committee won't prohibit the creation
of embryos using this technology. Where does the President stand? Does he think we
should allow cloned embryos?

A.      The President is very concerned about using this new technology to clone human beings.
 He is deeply troubled by the prospect that it might someday be possible to create a child from
one's own genetic material. That is why he asked NBAC to review the issue.

The question of creating embryos for research ~- as opposed to creating a child -- is a separate
question that raises distinct scientific and ethical issues. The President has already acted in this
area. In 1994 he directed the National Institutes of Health not to fund the creation of human
embryos for research purposes. Congress has also placed restrictions on the use of federal funds
for embryo research.

As you know, NBAC has not issued its final report, and the President has not yet reviewed their
recommendations. We. will have more to say about it after he has reviewed it.
