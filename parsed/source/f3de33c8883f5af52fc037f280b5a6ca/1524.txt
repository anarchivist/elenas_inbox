Subject:         IMPORTANT NOTICE: Weekly Reports

It has been called to our attention that many folks are planning to take
Friday off this week and many offices have inquired about their weekly
reports.


Erskine and Sylvia have asked me to issue the following guidance:

Offices may choose to submit short "hot issues" reports Thursday evening
in lieu of their more comprehensive Weekly Reports this week, and submit a
more comprehensive Weekly Report the following week.

Of course, offices may also choose -- if they desire -- to proceed as
usual with their Weekly Reports.



please let me know which your office will be doing.  If your office
chooses to do the shorter report, we will need it Thursday evening for
Erskine to read this weekend.  Reports turned in after Thursday evening
will not be read until Monday afternoon.




THANKS
