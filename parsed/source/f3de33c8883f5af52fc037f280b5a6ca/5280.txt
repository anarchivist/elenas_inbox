 I know you have been staying up nights worrying about Liggett's fate.  The
,President has received a letter from concerned AGs. The following fact
 should then be an enormous relief to you.  On 9/l7 I invested an imaginary
 $1,000 in PM, RJR, Loew's, BAT, Brooke, and UST. As of today, I still
have roughly $1,000 in each company except Brooke, Liggett's parent. At
 close today, the Brooke stock is worth $1,870 or roughly a 90% return in
 less than 2 months. 00 you think I should ask Treasury for analysis of w
hy this happened?
