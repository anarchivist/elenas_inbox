TEXT:
Attached for final clearance is a draft letter to the Senate
Appropriations Committee on the Agriculture and Rural Development Approps
Bill, FYOO. The Full Committee mark-up of this bill is scheduled for
Thurs, June 17.  Please provide your sign-off or clearance to me no later
than 10:00AM Thurs morning.  Thank you!

Please note that Jack Lew has not had the opportunity to review this
draft.

DRAFT

The Honorable Ted Stevens
Chairman
Committee on Appropriations
u.S. Senate
Washington D.C. 20510

Dear Mr. Chairman:

        The purpose of this letter is to provide the AdministrationD,s
views on the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration,
and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill, FY 2000, as reported by the
Senate Subcommittee.  Since the Administration has not had an opportunity
to review the SubcommitteeD,s bill and report language, our comments are
based on preliminary information. As the Committee develops its version
of the bill, your consideration of the AdministrationD,s views would be
appreciated.

        The allocation of discretionary resources available to the Senate
under the Congressional Budget Resolution is simply inadequate to make the
necessary investments that our citizens need and expect.  The PresidentD,s
FY 2000 Budget proposes levels of discretionary spending that meet such
needs while conforming to the Bipartisan Budget Agreement by making


savings proposals in mandatory and other programs available to help
finance this spending.  Congress has approved, and the President has
signed into law, nearly $29 billion of such offsets in appropriations
legislation since 1995. The Administration urges the Congress to consider
such proposals.

        The Administration appreciates efforts by the Subcommittee to
accommodate certain of the PresidentD,s priorities within the 302(b)
allocation. However, the Subcommittee bill is over $500 million, or four
percent, below the program level requested by the President.  The FY 2000
Budget would increase spending within the discretionary caps for
agriculture and other programs in the bill by 3.6 percent over comparable
FY 1999 spending. We urge the Committee to consider the over $600 million
in user fees proposed in the Budget in order to fund high-priority
programs. Given the current period of financial stress in the
agricultural sector, nQw is not the time to reduce assistance to farmers,
ranchers, and rural residents.

        Below is a discussion of our specific concerns with the
Subcommittee bill. We look forward to working with you to resolve these
concerns as the bill moves forward.



Food and Drug Administration

        While the Administration is pleased that the Subcommittee has
reportedly provided an increase over the FY 1999 enacted level for the
FDA, we are disappointed that the Subcommittee has apparently not funded
the full request for the FDA, including important youth tobacco prevention
activities and the proposed seafood inspection program transfer.

        The Administration is concerned that the Subcommittee's apparent
reduction of $40 million from the President's request for
non-foods/tobacco FDA activities would jeopardize the FDA's ability to
improve the public health infrastructure through enhanced product safety
assurance and injury reporting systems.

        The Administration is committed to Youth Tobacco Prevention
activities and urges
the Committee to provide the requested increase of $34 million for these
programs. Every day, three thousand young people become regular smokers.
Reducing young peopleD,s tobacco use would improve public health for
generations to come.  This is particularly important in light of the
recent decision of the conferees on the FY 1999 Emergency Supplemental
Appropriations Act to permit States to retain the entire amount secured
from tobacco companies without any commitment whatsoever from the States
that those funds be used to reduce youth smoking. To help discourage
youth smoking, we urge the Congress to consider the Administration
proposal to increase tobacco taxes.

Food Safety Initiative

        The Administration appreciates the SubcommitteeD,s support for the
PresidentD,s Food Safety Initiative through increases above the enacted and
House bill levels provided to USDA and FDA. Nonetheless, we are concerned
that the Committee has reportedly provided only $46 million of the $62
million increase over FY 1999 levels requested in this bill for the
Initiative. American consumers enjoy the worldD,s safest food supply, but
still too many Americans get sick, and in some cases die, from preventable


food-borne diseases.  The PresidentD,s requested increase would provide
critical resources to expand USDAD,s and FDAD,s food safety research and
risk assessment capabilities. We strongly urge the Committee to provide
full funding at the requested levels for these activities and consider the
AdministrationD,s meat inspection fee proposal.

Women, Infants, and Children Program

        The Administration strongly supports the $33 million increase for
WIC over the House level. The Committee mark should sustain a
participation level of 7.4 million in FY 2000. We remain concerned,
however, that this is still insufficient to support the projected average
monthly participation level of 7.5 million, thereby not achieving our
longstanding 7.5 million goal.

Food and Nutrition Service Research

         The Administration strongly objects to any provision of the
Committee bill that would prohibit the use of Food and Nutrition Service
 (FNS) funds for research and evaluations on nutrition programs. To
address program integrity and performance issues properly, it is crucial
that research on nutrition programs also occur in the context of the
programs' administration. We urge the Committee to provide funding for
these activities within FNS.

Common Computing Environment

        The Administration is very concerned by the SubcommitteeD,s
decision not to fund the Common Computing Environment, either directly
through the Support Service Bureau as requested in the PresidentD,s Budget
or by providing additional funds in the county-office agency salaries and
expense accounts.  Some in Congress have criticized USDA this year for
delays in providing the crop-loss assistance funds to farmers that were
provided in P.L. 105-277, the FY 1999 Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency
Supplemental Appropriations Act, and for long waiting periods some farmers
and rural residents have faced in receiving other assistance through USDA
county offices. Yet this bill would not provide the funds needed to
address the very problems that contributed to the delays. At a time when
the farm community is under financial stress and the demand for farm
credit and other programs is high, the need for timely and efficient
service to producers and rural residents has never been greater.  Without
the proposed $74 million in funding, it will not be possible to modernize
the technology in USDAD,s local field offices, create D&one-stop shoppingD8
for rural customers, and promptly deliver the programs that Congress
enacts with available staffing levels.

Conservation and Environmental Programs

         The Subcommittee bill appears to cut spending on key USDA
conservation programs by at least $140 million from the PresidentD,s
request.   The $26 million reduction in the Environmental Quality
Incentives program (EQIP) would mean 13,000 farmers and ranchers not
receiving needed financial and technical assistance to stop soil erosion,
improve waste treatment in animal feeding operations, and implement other
voluntary conservation measures critical to protecting our natural
resources. To further advance this important work, including addressing
the significant backlog of farmersD, requests for aid, the Administration
requested a $100 million increase in the EQIP program as part of its Clean
Water Action Plan.  The combination of the EQIP reduction and the
SubcommitteeD,s failure to fund the requested additional funds for


technical assistance to animal feeding operations could damage livestock
owner sO, progress toward ensuring that their operations are environmentally
sound and community-friendly.

        Other valuable environmental programs would be severely
underfunded by the Subcommittee bill, 'and we urge the Committee to restore
funding for them.   The Subcommittee failed to fund the $50 million
discretionary portion of the Administrationo,s request for the Farmland
Protection Program, which is part of the AdministrationD,s Lands Legacy
Initiative. AmericaD,s farmers need these funds to help them stay on their
land, through easements that permanently protect 80,000 acres of prime
farmland from development.   We urge the Committee to provide the $50
million in discretionary funds requested for the program and redirect its
savings from the Conservation Farm Option to this program, as well as to
the wildlife Habitat Incentives Program to assist over 3,000 farmers in
protecting and restoring wildlife habitat.   In addition, the Subcommittee
has not provided the $12 million requested in the Conservation Operations
account to assess soil managementD,s effects on carbon sequestration, and
$5 million for USDAD,s initiative to help communities make use of
geospatial data to make more informed land use decisions and promote smart
growth. The Administration recommends funds be redirected to these
high-priority activities, such as by eliminating the Forestry Incentives
Program as requested and as included in the House bill.

Outreach for Socially Disadvantaged Farmers

        The Subcommittee bill does not provide the requested $7 million
increase for the Outreach for Socially Disadvantaged Farmers program.
This program has proven effective in mitigating the decline in the number
of minority farmers by increasing their participation in agricultural
programs, assisting them in marketing and production, and improving the
profitability of their farming operations. USDA loan default rates have
also improved in areas where this program operates. The requested
increase is needed to expand this program beyond the limited areas in
which it now operates, to further these farmersD, equal access and their
opportunity for success, and to continue USDAD,s work to improve its civil
rights performance.

Research

        The Subcommittee bill would fund USDA's National Research
Initiative at $81 million below the request of $200 million, while
providing funding for a large number of unrequested, earmarked research
grants.  We urge the Committee to increase the funding for competitive
research grants and reduce earmarks for lower-priority programs.

Rural Development

        The Administration appreciates the support in the Subcommittee
bill for priority USDA rural development programs, such as water and
wastewater loans and grants, Business and Industry guaranteed loans, and
rental assistance for very-low income rural residents.  The Administration
is concerned, however, that the Subcommittee billD,s funding for Rural
Development salaries and expenses would jeopardize effective
implementation of these programs. The $25 million, or five percent,
reduction from the requested salaries and expenses funding could require
USDA to eliminate over 400, or six percent, of its staff through a
Reduction-In-Force.  We urge the Committee to provide the requested level
of funding to ensure an adequate delivery system for these vital programs
for rural America.



We look forward to working with the committee to address our mutual
concerns.

                                                Sincerely,




                                                Jacob J. Lew
                                                Director
