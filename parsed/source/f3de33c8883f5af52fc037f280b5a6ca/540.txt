TEXT:
There will NOT be a regular interagency/EOP meeting on timber this
afternoon. I do, however, expect to receive the draft REO memo we
discussed at last week's meeting sometime this week, and will make
sure agency reps. receive it.
There will be a meeting next Tuesday, January 21st, at the
regularly scheduled time.  The agenda for next Tuesday will
include (but not be limited to ) a discussion of the Small
Business Regulatory Flexibility Act's applicability to both forest
plans under NFMA and management plans under FLPMA.
On the following Tuesday, January 28th, instead of the regular
meeting, Katie McGinty will chair a meeting of the Interagency
Steering Committee.  Most, if not all, of the regional
executives will also be attending.   Two important agenda items
will be the analysis of new information resulting from the timber
rider on the Pacific Northwest Forest Plan, and a briefing from
the regional executives on progress made in implementing the
various monitoring activities committed to by the agencies in the
ROD for the Plan.
