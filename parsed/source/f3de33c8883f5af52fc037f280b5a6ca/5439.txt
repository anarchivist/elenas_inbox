 TEXT:
 We're meeting tomorrow morning with Barbara Chow, who will unveil OMB's
 preferred options to restore additional r.estorations to legal immigrants.
 They have been tight-lipped on this, but the staff just walked me through
 their recommended options orally. ,I still have no paper.    The invite
 list includes Mickey Ibarra, Maria Echaveste, Doris Matsui, and others,who
 will approach this more from a constituency perspective and less from a
 policy perspective.

 The proposed restorations total $3 billion over 5 years:

 1.   Food Stamp State Option            $1.2 billion over 5 years
 They want to give states the option of offering food stamps to legal
 immigrants, both those who were here before the law was signed and new
 entrants. We would pay 50% of the cost. They think this is more saleable
 politically than a simple restoration. A few states are already doing
 this with 100% state money.

 2. Medicaid/Child Health State Option $0.2 billion over 5 years
 This was our proposal from last year, with CHIP added in. CHIP doesn't
 cost anything since it's a block grant.  It says that states can choose to
 offer Medicaid or CHIP to children who entered after the law was signed,
 and we'll pay our regular share of each program.

 3. Refugees and food stamps             $0.2 billion over 5 years
 Refugees are eligible for benefits for the first 5 years in this country.
 We lengthened that to 7 years for SSI in the BBA. This would offer
 refugees the same 7 year exemption for food stamps.

 4.    S81 and Medicaid                          $1.4 billion over 5
 years
 This is what we did NOT get in our package last year:  SSI and Medicaid
 for new entrants who become disabled after entry.  This is a slightly
 tougher policy than last year because it requires deeming of sponsors'


income.

I am assuming your guidance is that you are not particularly anxious to.
spend $3 billion dollars this way, particularly given competing needs like
child care.   I think it would be nice to do something on food stamps, and
the state option is clever.    On the other hand, as Cynthia notes, it
seems unlikely Congress will do these. While the same could have been
said of last year's proposals, we had the impetus of the balanced budget
and the impending SSI cutoffs to pressure them. Next year we have little
or no leverage legislatively, and all the cutoffs have happened. Anyway,
if you have any guidance, let me know.
