TEXT:
I mentioned the possible HACCP plan to Barbara Wooley (to hold in
confidence) who works with farmer groups to get her political constituency
read. Her instinct was the groups would be upset if it involves
regulations or inspections that go onto the farms.  I think she'd like to
be able to go out and quickly vet such a plan pre-annoucnement if that is
where we end up. Regards, Tom
