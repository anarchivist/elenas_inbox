TEXT:
In general, I think the directive looks fine.  However, it would be useful
to see if there is anything positive that we can say this administration
has done --even if it is modest-- for law enforcement in Indian Country
which we might put in the beginning of the directive.  I can look into
that right now.

As for the confusing sentence, maybe it could read something like this:
"The dramatic increase in homicide rates in Indian Country-- 80 percent in
the last (cite time frame)-- now means that homicide levels on Indian
lands often surpass those in large American cities."

I agree we need to see the repogramming proposal. I will try to get that
too and will share it with Jose' ASAP to see if he has any comments or
concerns.

Thanks.
