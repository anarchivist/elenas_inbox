TEXT:
The Partnership is doing an event with Boeing, other businesses, and
state/local officials in Seattle on June 12th. They are going to invite
Secretary Shalala to do the keynote speech, with Secretary Slater as an
alternative. They wanted to extend the invitation to see if either POTUS
or VP were interested in doing this.  Looks like POTUS will be in CA. Lee
Anne, any chance VP might want to do this?
