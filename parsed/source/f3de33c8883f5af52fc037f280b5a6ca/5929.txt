Subject:         COPS Grants

Next week, DOJ will release their latest round of COPS grants. This round
will be over $120 million, covering over 600 departments, with over 1700
new officers.  They plan to notify their VIP's on January 13 and
Congressionals on January 14. They will have their general announcement
on January 15.  I am checking to see if you are interested in announcing
or adding a quote.   please let me know. Thanks
