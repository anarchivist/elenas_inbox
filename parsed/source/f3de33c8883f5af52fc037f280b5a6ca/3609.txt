TEXT:
A deal was cut last night --without consultation with Justice-- and the
bill was favorably reported out of the Judiciary Committee this morning.
The vote to report out bill was 12-6 with Feinstein and Torricelli voting
in favor.

The only amendment voted on was the Specter prevention/intervention
amendment which failed.

Accepted amendments:

*   separation of juveniles and adults in custody.

* expansion of the purpose areas of the prosecutor funding in the bill
($50 million) to allow for probation officers, and activities such as
Operation Night Light in Boston.

* Grassley amendment on drug-free schools which originally would have
kicked kids out of school for drugs and tobacco.  Supposedly this is a
substantially watered-down version but Justice has not yet seen.

* revocation of bill's provision to repeal the old prevention programs
authorized in title v.  Committee staff has promised to work with Kohl to
insert prevention language in current appropriations bill. (Approps has
$75 million for our new DOJ anti-truancy initiative, which could be used
to fund afterschool programs.)

No vote on Brady for juveniles. Hatch was planning to offer a
second-degree to delay implementation until insta-check goes into effect
   But this shouldn't have stopped the amendment from being offered in
committee. Biden's amendments on prevention and increased funding for
prosecutors were also held for floor.

Justice will be sending over a summary of markup later today.
