Talking points on Byrd motion to recommit
item veto conference report (expedited rescission)

o Senator Byrd's "expedited rescission" proposal -- described in
the attachment -- is favorable in a number of its details, but
the conference agreement is much stronger with regard to the
basic mechanism.
o The Byrd motion would permit the President to propose
rescissions of spending and repeal of tax benefits, which the
Congress would be required to vote upon within 10 session days
under expedited procedures.   The proposed rescissions (or repeal
of tax benefits) would remain effective beyond the congressional
review period
only if a majority of both houses of Congress voted to enact the
rescission (or repeal) proposals.
o By contrast, the conference report on S. 4 would delegate to
the President authority to cancel certain spending and tax
prov~s~ons;   the cancellations would remain effective unless the
congress enacted disapproval legislation (effectively requiring
2/3 of each house to overturn a cancellation).
o The Administration has consistently called for strong item veto
authority and therefore prefers the conference report mechanism.
o However, the Byrd proposal includes several details which are
favorable:  the definition of "targeted tax benefits" is much
broader than the narrow definition in the conference report;
the proposal would assign the authority to identify "targeted tax
benefits" to the President, rather than the Congress;   the
application of the authority to discretionary spending would
cover all or part of appropriated items; the President would have
20 days to review spending and tax bills;   and the Byrd proposal


would become effective upon enactment.
o Nevertheless, because of the stronger mechanism -- the

authority to cancel, subject only to congressional disapproval
the conference agreement is a much stronger authority, and more
consistent with the President's longstanding request for the
strongest possible item veto authority.
