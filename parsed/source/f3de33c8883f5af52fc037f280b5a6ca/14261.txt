TEXT:
For those of you wondering what the Monday meeting with Olivia
Golden at 12:30 is about - it is a meeting we had discussed a
while back to get from her and some of the other HHS folks a
better sense of how they are going to be reviewing state plans for
completeness. What their process will be, the questions they will
be asking etc.   This is the opportunity to raise concerns about
the level of information being obtained from states about what
they are doing.
