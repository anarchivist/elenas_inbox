TEXT:
Last I heard, it is still likely that we will have a small group discussion
with POTlJS concerning the race book some time this Friday. That could
change, but .

We should get together to share ideas about how best to use that time.
Maria is probably traveling with POTUS tomorrow (Wednesday), but the three
of us could try. Would late afternoon or early evening work? That way, if
we agree on some additional piece of paper, I'd have time to write it on
Thursday.
