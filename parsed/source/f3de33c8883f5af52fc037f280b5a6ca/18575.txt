 TEXT:
 According to Senator Breaux, the President mentioned to the Senator today
 that he (the POTUS) would like to meet the new Executive Director of the
 Medicare Commission -- 27-year, old, Rhodes Scholar, LA Medicaid
 Director, Bobby Jindal.  Breaux wants this to happen sometime next week
 and is under the impression that this is consistent with the President's
 desires.

 I have talked with Larry Stein about this and we mutually agree that it
 would be a bad idea for such a meeting to take place UNTIL AFTER the
 President meets with his own Commission appointees and at least calls the
 Democratic appointees (and perhaps the Republican appointees as well) .
 All of these Commission members rank above the Executive Director and
 might well take offense to learning of a meeting with Mr. Jindal that took
 place before the President expresses his personal thanks to the members
 for serving and outlines his desire to work with them throughout the
 process.   (Although I have yet to talk,to Gene re this, I am almost
 certain he would concur.)


 Gene Sperling and I are trying to set up a meeting with the Commission
 members for sometime within the next two weeks. We will try to expedite
 this meeting (and any associated calls to the other members) .

 Erskine, does this plan sound ok to you?
