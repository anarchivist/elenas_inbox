MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:          Bruce Reed
               Elena Kagan

RE:            DPC Weekly Report




       1. Crime: Child Safety Locks - Earlier this week, Smith and Wesson-- the world's
leading manufacturer ofhandguns-- announced that as of September 2, all of their handguns sold
for commercial use will come with a child safety lock made by Master Lock. The child safety
lock developed by Master Lock is a keyed, locking device that blocks access to the firing
mechanism. When the lock is in place, the trigger cannot be pulled until the lock is removed.
As you know, your juvenile crime legislation would require all federally-licensed gun dealers to
provide a child safety lock with every handgun sold. You also directed the federal agencies to
ensure that every federal law enforcement agent has a child safety lock for their handgun by
October 15.                                                  .

        2. Welfare Reform: Legal Immigrants Losing Food Stamps - This month,
approximately 900,000 legal immigrants will lose food stamps. The welfare law required states
to drop legal immigrants from the rolls within a year after the law was signed. With USDA's
assistance, most states have arranged to heavily backlit the cutoffs, so that the vast majority are
occurring this month, at the last possible moment. Legal immigrants who were not receiving
food stamps when the law was signed have been rejected by states since last August. While we
have proposed slight delays in these cutoffs, we have never proposed to rescind them in our
budget.

        With our support, Congress enacted a new option for states that allows them to purchase
federal food stamps for legal immigrants. Washington state is already doing this, with a number
of states expected to follow, including Massachusetts and New York. New York will pay for
children, the disabled, and the elderly legal immigrants.

        USDA is publicizing the fact that there are still food programs open to legal immigrant
children, seniors, WIC, etc. However, they do not have an estimate of how many of the 900,000
people can get access to other food programs.
                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion

        3. Civil Rights Investigations of Higher Education in California and Texas -- The
Office for Civil Rights (OCR) at the Department of Education is continuing its investigation of
the current admissions policies at the three University of California law schools. Preliminary
analysis indicates a significant disparity in the admission rate for certain minority group students
compared to whites. The investigation is now in an information-gathering phase, which is likely
to extend through the end of the year. The California investigation has recently been attacked by
Senators Hatch and McConnell, who wrote Secretary Riley July 31 to denounce the inquiry as an
affront to the voters of California and a bureaucratic attempt to preserve affirmative action. The
two senators have called for OCR to abandon the inquiry immediately, and have threatened
hearings and an amendment to prohibit the use of Department funds to investigate race-neutral
policies. OCR responds that it is obliged to investigate a legitimate complaint, and notes that
the investigation concerns current admissions policies, rather than the widely-reported decline in
minority admissions following the discontinuation ofUC's affirmative action program.

        An OCR-initiated investigation of the Texas higher education system, part of a series of
state higher education desegregation reviews, continues as well. The review will determine,
consistent with the Supreme Court's Fordice decision, whether vestiges of past discrimination
remain in the Texas system. The Fordice review has been combined with an investigation of a
complaint filed with OCR last fall, asserting that Texas continues to operate a dual system of
higher education and challenging the state's implementation of the Hopwood decision. As with
California, information-gathering for this investigation is likely to extend through the end of the
year.

        4. Health Care: FDA Reform Update. -- The Administration, Members of Congress,
as well as the pharmaceutical industry, are hoping that a mutually acceptable agreement can be
reached early this Fall on the FDA reform bill. Resolution on this issue is critical to the industry
and the FDA because it includes the reauthorization ofPDUFA, the Prescription Drug User Fee
Act. This legislation continues the successful user fee program that has produced additional
resources for FDA to expedite reviews and approvals of new drugs. It has been extremely
successful program and, without reauthorization, a 60-day notice of lay-off will be sent to
personnel doing reviews on October 1st. There are only a few outstanding non-prescription drug
issues, including some technical issues dealing with devices, environmental impact issues,
budgeting issues, and the one Senator Kennedy mentioned to you recently -- the Federal
pre-emption state regulation of cosmetics, which would prohibit state regulation of perfumes,
creams, etc. Almost all efforts to date to pass this legislation have taken place in the Senate, but
the time pressure of the impending lay-offs is expected to provide an incentive for the House to
start moving. HHS will be meeting with both Senate and House representatives next week and
early in September to push both sides to pass an acceptable bill that you can sign into law
hopefully sometime in October.
