                          CHARTER SCHOOLS: RAISING STANDARDS
                          AND EXPANDING PUBLIC SCHOOL CHOICE·


 [EJvery state should give parents the power to choose the right public school for their children. Their right to
choose will foster competition and innovation that can make public schools better. Our plan will help America to
create 3,000 of these charter schools by the next century ... so that parents will have even more choices in sending
their children to the best schools.
                                                     President Clinton, State of the Union Address, February 4,1997

Today President Clinton visited San Carlos Learning Center, one of the nation's first charter
schools, for a roundtable discussion with charter school principals, teachers, students, parents and
community supporters.

PRESIDENT CLINTON ANNOUNCES $46 MILLION IN NEW AND CONTINUING
GRANTS FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS. These grants are going to 21 states, the District of
Columbia, Puerto Rico and three individual schools to support the planning and start-up costs of
charter schools of about 500 additional schools. In addition to start-up costs, grants will also be
used for curriculum development, teacher training, technology, assessment development and
dissemination of best practices between charters and the rest of the public school system.

CHARTER SCHOOLS HAVE EXPERIENCED TREMENDOUS GROWTH UNDER
PRESIDENT CLINTON'S LEADERSHIP.                       In 1993, President Clinton proposed a public
charter schools program, which was enacted in 1994, as part of the reauthorization of the Elementary
and Secondary Education Act. With the President's leadership, the charter school program has
grown from $6 million in FY 1995 to $51 million in FY 1997. The President has requested $100
million from Congress from FY 1998 to support the development of approximately 900-1000 charter
schools. Under this program, the Education Department:
·       Provides funds for plaDl~ing and start-up of charter schools. Since 1995, 19 states
        and the District of Columbia have received a total of about $22 million to help launch
        over 450 charter schools. A number of studies, including the latest report from a
        national study of charter schools funded by the Department of Education, shows the most
        dire need facing charter schools is a lack of access to planning and start-up funding. The
        federal investment in charter schools helps meet this need.
·       Serves as a clearinghouse of information on charter schools for parents, teachers
        and policymakers. The Education Department provides technical assistance, organizes
        conferences and informational meetings, and has established a Charter Schools Website
        (www.uscharterschools.org).
·       Conducts research and evaluation on charter schools. The Education Department has
        contracted for a 4-year independent evaluation of charter schools nationwide that includes
        an annual survey of all charter schools that provides researchers and the public with most
        comprehensive data on the nation's charter schools and a long-term study of achievement data
        from 92 charter schools and 32 comparison schools. In addition, the Education Department
        is supporting research on charter schools in areas such as assessment and accountability,
        special education, school finance, equity, and leadership training.

As a result of these efforts and the President's continuing leadership, there has been a
"

                                                                              f-Iex-Dlift!jl ConversIon


    tremendous growth in the number of charter schools. When President Clinton took office, there
    was one charter school in operation nationwide and only one state with a charter law. This year,
    over 700 charter schools are expected to be in operation. Likewise, the number of states with
    charter laws continues to grow :- 29 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico have passed
    enabling legislation.

    CHARTER SCHOOLS PROVIDE FAMILIES WITH MORE OPTIONS WITHIN
    PUBLIC EDUCATION. Every parent should be able to choose what public school their child
    will attend. The administration's support for the development of high-quality charter schools is
    increasing the choices parents have about their child's education. Charter schools are run by
    groups of teachers, parents or other community leaders that operate with a contract -- or charter.
     Charters explain how the school will operate and how well its students will perform. In many
    states, as long as the school meets the terms of its charter it is freed from many of the rules and
    regulations covering traditional public schools.

    CHOICE WITH PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY. Charter schools are schools that are free to
    innovate and to demand high standards -- but they are schools that survive only if they produce
    results. Like all public schools, charter schools are nonsectarian, cannot charge tuition, are open
    to all students, and must still comply with health, safety and civil rights requirements. Charter
    schools are held highly accountable: if students fail to perform at levels described in their charter,
    or if the school breaks rules that have not been waived they can be closed.

    CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE PART OF OUR OVERALL STRATEGY FOR
    EDUCATION REFORM. Charter schools are not a magic bullet, but are piece of a larger
    strategy of promoting high standards and accountability. A hallmark of President Clinton's
    effort to improve American education has been that we should have high expectations for every
    student. He has urged states and school districts to adopt challenging academic standards in all
    core subjects, and to adopt high national standards in the basics of reading and mathematics.
    The President has strengthened existing federal programs and fought for new resources to
    improve local schools and help students reach those standards. Charters are promising vehicles
    for raising academic standards, empowering educators, involving parents and communities,
    increasing accountability and expand choice within the public school system. Lessons learned
    by charter schools can enhance accountability for all public schools, and can reinforce -- even
    accelerate -- other education reforms.

    CHARTERS ARE EVIDENCE OF THE KIND OF INNOVATION THAT RESULTS
    WHEN WE COMMIT TO IMPROVE -- NOT ABANDON -- OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS.
    Charter schools are examples of genuine public education reform -- they provide a mechanism
    for change with real public accountability for promised results. Unlike charter schools, private
    school vouchers offer no public accountability -- there are no standards to meet, and no way to
    shut them down.
