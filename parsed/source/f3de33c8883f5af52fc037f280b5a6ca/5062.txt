     Hatch Wants Tobacco Bill Draft

                                  By Darlene Superville
                                  Associated Press Writer
                                  Wednesday, October 29, 1997; 3:24 p.m. EST

                                  WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Judiciary Chairman Orrin
                                  Hatch said Wednesday that he wanted legislation
     enforcing a
                                  national tobacco settlement submitted before
     congress
                                  adjourns for the year although lawmakers are
     unlikely to act on
                                  it by then.

                                  --There are 101 issues that have to be
     determined, but we're
                                  determining them, "   Hatch, R-Utah, said after a
     Judiciary
                                  subcommittee hearing on the proposed $368.5
     billion deal
                                  between the tobacco industry and state attorneys
     general.

                                  Congress.must pass legislation for the agreement
     to take effect.

                                  Hatch said the bill being drafted would stick
     closely to that
                                  deal, by which the industry would settle dozens
     of state
                                  lawsuits and win protection from future lawsuits
     by paying
                                  $368.5 billion over 25 years, accepting limits on

advertising
                       and paying fines for failure to discourage youth
smoking.

                       He said he wanted a --discussion bill"     before
the end of the
                       session so that interested parties could offer
opinions before
                       hearings begin. Congress is expected to wrap up
business for
                       the year    someti~e   next month.

                       Hatch said President Clinton's recommendation to
boost
                       cigarette prices by as much as $1.50 a pack as a
deterrent to
                       youth smoking was a --likely benchmark."     He also
indicated
                       the bill would fund smoking cessation programs
and research
                       into smoking-related diseases, provide relief to
tobacco
                       farmers whose business might be jeopardized and
impose fines
                       on tobacco companies.

                       Hatch noted some state lawsuits head to trial
early next year.

                       --We're running out of time here, "    he told
reporters. --The key
                       here is to get something together that everybody
could support
                       or at least a broad coalition could support, and
that's not easy
                       to do."

                       At the hearing, .Federal Trade Commission Chairman
Robert
                       Pitofsky criticized a provision of the proposed
settlement that
                       he said would grant tobacco companies too broad an
                       exemption from federal antitrust laws.

                       The companies say protection is needed because of
the
                       possible need for them to work together to
enforce various
                       aspects of the agreement.

                       Pitofsky said --an exception of this kind would
be most
                       unusual."    He suggested that Congress narrow the
focus of any
                       exemption if it decides that such a provision is
necessary.
