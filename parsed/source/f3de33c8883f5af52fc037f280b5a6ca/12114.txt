TEXT:
judy shepard just called to tell me about russell henderson's guilty plea;
she and her family are very pleased with the outcome; i said she might be
interested to know the president would be speaking about hate crimes
tomorrow; she repeated her desire to work with us in any appropriate way
to advance our hate crimes legislation.
