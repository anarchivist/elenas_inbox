TEXT:
unless any of you want to scrutinize further.   Here's the description you
all received Friday --

On November 20th, California and Lockheed Martin mutually decided to
cancel their child support computer systems contract due to operational
problems and cost overruns. This puts the state out of compliance with
what is called the Advance Planning Document -- the plan that the state
submits to HHS for approval in order to get federal funds to help pay for
the computer systems costs.

HHS has drafted a letter from one of their OCSE staff to the state saying
that the feds will not pay for any more computer systems development until
the state submits, and has approved, a new Advanced Planning Document.
(The rest of federal financial support for child support enforcement will
continue to be provided.) Although this letter is from a mid-level staffer
to the state welfare director, I reviewed it for content and tone.  Do you
want to see this letter?

Keep in mind that this letter is particular to California, because of its
problems with its contractor.  However, after January 1, HHS will need to
send to all the states that do not have operating statewide computer
systems a notice of intent to disapprove their child support enforcement
plans. As you know, states without approved state plans get no federal
child support dollars of any kind. However, st.ates will continue to
receive federal funds until the appeal process is concluded, which could
last until 1999 (longer for judicial appeals)
