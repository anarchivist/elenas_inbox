TEXT:
Our former colleague Tim Keating, now a high-powered lobbyist for the
American Council of Life Insurers, has offered to arrange a briefing for
us with the authors of the forthcoming Rand study on punitive damage
awards (Ellen, I believe this is the same study you mentioned during
yesterday's meeting). According to Tim, the study will be unveiled within
the next two weeks and it will be considered during a June 24th hearing in
the Senate Judiciary Committee.

Tim's interest is that ACLI helped underwrite the study and they believe
it will show that most punitive damages are awarded in contracts cases and.
not in those cases where physical harm has resulted from a tortfeasor's
actions. Additionally, they expect the study to show the general rise in
punitives and the necessity to cap those awards.

Given Rand's reputation for independence, it is likely that this study
will have an immediate impact on the debate.  My recommendation is that we
meet with the Rand folks to get an idea of what's coming.  I am happy to
set up a meeting if everyone thinks its worthwhile.  Peter
