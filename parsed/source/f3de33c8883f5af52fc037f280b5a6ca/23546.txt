TEXT:
Here's what I was able to find out about Mayor Guiliani's plans to apply
welfare reform requirements to shelter residents. We'll monitor for
future developments and keep you updated.

Based on a 1981 court case, shelter has been provided in New York as a
legal right to anyone who is homeless, with few conditions attached.
State rules adopted in 1995 allow shelter to be treated as a.form of
public assistance, and shelter residents would therefore be subject to the
same requirements (including workfare) as other welfare recipients.  Other
areas in NY state have implemented these rules, but NYC has delayed doing
so due to pending court cases. Several recent legal decisions have come
out against homeless advocates, and it appears that that City staff is
now developing a plan to implement these requirements.  However, the Human
Resources Administration staff I spoke with maintain that the Mayor has
not yet made an official announcment, and the AP story on 2/20/99 confirms
that the City has not yet set a date to start following the state rules.

while it's hard to pin down the details of the rules while they are still
being developed, the 2/20/99 NYT story indicates the new rules would make
workfare and other welfare reform requirements a condition of eligibility
for approximately 4,600 families and 7,000 single adults in the NYC
shelter system.  It also indicates that shelter operators would be requir
ed to expel homeless individuals or families who were cut off from public
assistance (to prevent individuals who had been sanctioned under PA from
turning to the shelter system as an alterantive). Since about half of the
single adults and most of the families in shelters are on public
assistance and therefore already subect to NYC's welfare reform rules,
these are not necessarily new requirements on most of the individuals, but
would mean that individuals who did not comply with the requirements would
now risk losing shelter in addition to cash assistance.   The Mayor and
city officials maintain that extending the requirements to shelter would
help move people to self-sufficiency, while advocates and critics voice
concerns that this would take away a crticial safety net and force
children into the child welfare system.  It is not clear at this point how
the requirements would apply to individuals who might not otherwise be
subject to the requirements through the welfare system, i.e. children in
homeless families, individuals with mental or physical disabilities,
substance abusers or illegal immigrants.


The AP and NYT stories from 2/20/99 are attached


The NYT story mentions that there was to be a hearing on 3/11 on applying
the requirements to homeless adults. I did a Lex/Nex search on NY papers
beginning on 3/11 and found no coverage of the hearing or related issues.

HEADLINE: NYC Makes Homeless Work for Shelter

BYLINE: CHELSEA J. CARTER

DATELINE: NEW YORKBODY:
    Homeless people who sleep in city shelters will have to work at city jobs or
be expelled, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said Saturday.

  Critics of making workfare a condition to sleep in shelters say the move
would force thousands into the streets.

   Under workfare, those who receive public aid are required to work at city
jobs, including cleaning parks and perfonning clerical tasks, in exchange for
their benefits.

   The workfare condition would require city-funded homeless shelters to expel
any homeless adult or family cut from public assistance for failing to comply,
and as a result require officials to report any child to child protective
services in jeopardy of ending up on the street.

   Giuliani said officials try to reincorporate homeless people into the work
force. "Maybe that will do more for them ultimately than all the fancy
government programs that were keeping people dependent for 30, 40 and 50
years," he said.

   About 4,600 families and 7,100 single adults use the city's homeless shelters
at any given time.

   Although the mayor has not set a date to implement the plan, critics blasted
the plan, saying it would destroy families and the little stability that
homeless people have.

  "It's sick. The thought that because you are cut off public assistance, you
would then lose your place to sleep too is sick," said Mike Polenberg ofthe
Coalition for the Homeless in New York City.

HEADLINE: New York City Plans to Extend Workfare to Homeless Shelters

BYLINE: By NINA BERNSTEIN

BODY:
   Backed by state regulations, the Giuliani administration is preparing to make
workfare and other requirements a condition of shelter for the 4,600 families
and 7,000 single adults in New York City's homeless shelter system, said city
officials with knowledge of the plans.

     The change would make the city's homeless shelters subject to the same system
  of rules, work requirements and sanctions that its welfare offices have used to
. move more than 400,000 people off public assistance.

     Until now, shelter has been considered a form of aid separate from cash
relief. Under a 1981 court decree, the city has provided shelter as a legal
right to anyone who is truly homeless, virtually without conditions.

   But state rules adopted in 1995,treat shelter as simply another part of
public assistance, and to keep a bed, shelter residents must meet the same
eligibility standards as any welfare recipients. The city has held off putting
the new rules into effect because oflegal challenges.

   Although the city says the rules are intended to push people to
self-reliance, advocates for the homeless contend that the changes threaten to
send hundreds of homeless children and adults onto the streets.

   Elsewhere in the country, the effects of welfare cutbacks on shelters are
indirect because most shelter systems are supported by a patchwork of private
charities and limited public financing, and residents enjoy no legal right to
shelter. No other city in the nation has as comprehensive a publicly funded
shelter system as New York's.
                                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion
   Around the state, where the rules are already in place, some shelters have
been forced to close because the regulations made their budgets plummet with the
welfare rolls, pushing some people onto the street.

   New York City has not set a firm date to start following the state rules, but
three offour court decisions on the matter have gone against advocates for the
homeless, and the city has been quietly making preparations for systemwide
change.

   The rules require nonprofit agencies operating shelters under contract to the
city to expel any homeless adult or family cut from public assistance. If
children are in jeopardy, the agencies are required to make a referral to child
protective services for possible foster care placement. Although about half the
single adults and most of the families in the city's homeless shelters are
already on public assistance, all would be newly vulnerable to expulsion under
the regulations.

    Last month, the city began requiring all men who apply for emergency shelter
at the central intake center on East 30th Street in Manhattan to undergo
"finger-imaging" by the state computer system used in welfare offices for
identification, said Jack Madden, a spokesman for the State Office of Temporary
and Disability Assistance.                                .

   A team from the city's welfare agency has been inspecting all shelters under
contract to the city, including programs for the mentally ill, and asking how
many residents are capable of work and which programs could be equivalent to a
35-hour work week, said providers whose shelters were inspected in recent weeks.

   A plan to create a job center especially for the homeless, where shelter
residents could be required to report in order to keep their beds, has been
under discussion for months, said Debra Sproles, a spokeswoman for the city's
welfare agency, the Human Resources Administration. She said that the location
under discussion is a vacant welfare center at East 13Ist Street and Franklin D.
Roosevelt Drive, but she declined to provide details.

   Under the city's workfare program, welfare recipients are required to work at
city jobs, including cleaning parks and performing clerical tasks, in exchange
for benefits.

   Federal law, fully in effect, requires only half the welfare caseload to be
employed at anyone time. But Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has vowed to have every
recipient of aid doing 20 hours of work, plus 15 hours of work-related
activities like education or drug treatment, by 2000. Under current welfare
rules, single adults who miss a single hour of work can see their entire case
closed. Last year, 69 percent of these home-relief clients in the work program were sanctioned
                                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion
and removed from the rolls, for several months at least, city
records show.

    This week, the State Court of Appeals dismissed a motion by advocates seeking
a further appeal of the rules as applied to homeless families. A court hearing
is to be held on March lion whether applying the regulations to homeless adults
violates a 1981 court decree in which the city guaranteed a mattress, clean
sheets and soap to every homeless man, a legal right to shelter later expanded
to women and families.

    "We believe these regulations will help families move toward independent
living," Susan Wiviott, a spokeswoman for the city's Department of Homeless
Services, said yesterday. "We're working out how to implement the regulations
best. "

   Since the 1980's, a variety of mechanisms have made entry into the shelter
system harder and discharge easier, but requiring those seeking shelter to meet
the same eligibility rules as welfare recipients would dwarf past changes,
providers said.

   Asked about the preparations this week, Jason Turner, the city's welfare
commissioner, would only say, through a spokeswoman, that there had not been a
shift in homeless policy.

   But at conferences and in meetings with shelter providers, Mr. Turner has
expressed concern that some who were cut from the welfare rolls have been able
to go to shelters and food pantries without restriction, sidestepping sanctions
intended to push them to self-sufficiency.

   "We need to create, if you will, a personal crisis in individuals' lives"
that cannot be avoided by alternative programs, he said in a speech at a
Rockefeller Foundation forum attended by many shelter providers last fall.

   Ms. Wi vi ott said that the city has agreed to give Steven Banks, director of
the Legal Aid Society'S Homeless Rights Project, a five-day warning before
beginning to apply the state regulations to any homeless families.

   Mr. Banks has vowed to mount a new legal challenge on the basis of a 1985
court ruling that children cannot be placed in foster care for lack of housing.

   "It's a sea change," Mr. Banks said. "All along shelter was supposed to be
the safety net for people who had fallen through the cracks of other
bureaucracies. "

   Exactly how the city would apply public assistance requirements to the entire homeless shelter
                                                                         Hex-Dump Conversion
population remains unclear. Children in homeless families, the
mentally ill, the physically impaired, substance abusers and illegal immigrants
are the most at risk from the regulations, said many of the shelter providers at
the private, nonprofit agencies that operate most of the system's beds under
contract to the city. Many said they had only recently learned the implications
of the regulations.

    Frederick Shack, the president of the Tier II Coalition Inc., an organization
of 42 nonprofit agencies running shelters under contract to the city, said that
at any given time, at least 10 percent of sheltered families had been mistakenly
cited for noncompliance with public assistance regulations, and many others
arrived with cases that had been wrongly closed.

    "To heap loss of emergency shelter on top of the scramble for survival of a
family facing loss of income and child care and other public assistance-related
benefits will surely prove dangerous and expensive," he said last month in a
letter to the State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance.
