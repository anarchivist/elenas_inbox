Subject:         AMA Press Event - Tobacco

On Thursday, the AMA will hold a press conference to issue the release of
their statement on the tobacco settlement.  It is our understanding the
AMA will be in favor of the tobacco settlement, will share concerns of the
settlement including FDA regulation reform, see as a positive sign and big
opportunity for public health advocates.
