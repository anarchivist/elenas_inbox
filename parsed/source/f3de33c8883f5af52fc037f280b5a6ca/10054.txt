Q:    What are the two bills the President is signing today?

A:    (1) S. 1525: The Police, Fire, and Emergency Officers Educational Assistance Act of
      1998. On October 3, 1996, President Clinton signed into law the Federal Law
      Enforcement Dependents Assistance Act (FLEDA). The law provides higher education
      benefits for the spouses and children of Federal law enforcement officers killed or
      disabled in the line of duty. Today, President Clinton will sign S. 1525, which expands
      FLEDA to provide higher education assistance to the dependents of all public safety
      officers slain or incapacitated in the line of duty. The bill provides eligible applicants
      with nearly $5,000 per year for up to four years for full-time students to pay for tuition,
      room and board, and books. Part-time students may also receive assistance.

      (2) S. 191, a bill to throttle the criminal use of guns. This legislation clarifies and
      strengthens the federal penalties that apply to violent criminals and drug felons who
      commit crimes while carrying a gun. Following two U.S. Supreme Court decisions,
      this new law makes clear that violent criminals and drug felons who simply possess
      a firearm during the commission of a federal crime are subject to an additional
      5-year mandatory sentence. This new law also provides that -- in addition to the
      penalties that apply for underlying violent or drug crimes -- criminals receive a
      mandatory minimum sentence of at least 7 years for brandishing a firearm and of at
      least 10 years if the firearm is discharged. The bill also increases the penalty for
      subsequent convictions for these offenses from 20 years to 25 years.


Scholarships for Family Members of Slain Officers


Q:    Who is covered by this legislation?

A:    Spouses and children of Federal, state and local public safety officers killed or
      permanently and totally disabled by catastrophic injuries sustained in the line of duty are
      covered. In addition to law enforcement officers, the new law will benefit the families of
      firefighters, correctional officers, and rescue and ambulance squad members. The law
      will cover deaths after October 1, 1997.


Q:    Aren't there state programs that already cover these family members if their father
      or spouse is killed in the line of duty?

A:    According to the Justice Department, 34 states have programs that provide some sort of
      provide widely varying levels of educational assistance. The remaining states do not
      provide any educational assistance. The educational benefits under the bill signed by the
      President, under certain circumstances, can be provided in combination with other
      benefits.


Q:    How many public safety officers were killed in the line of duty last year?

A:    In 1996 -- the most recent year we have figures for -- there were 226 deaths of public
      safety officers reported. In 1995, which included deaths resulting from the Oklahoma
      City bombing, the total was 270.


Q:    How many family members have received assistance under the Federal law
      Enforcement Dependents Assistance Act (FLEDA)? And how much will the
      expansion being signed into law today costs?

A:    Since the President signed FLEDA into law October 3, 1996, 11 family members of slain
      Federal law enforcement officers have received nearly $90,000 in educational assistance.
      The Department of Justice has conducted extensive outreach to many other eligible
      families and hopes to make the FLEDA's benefits available to as many eligible applicants
      as possible.

      We estimate that expanding FLEDA to include state and local public safety officers will
      bring total program costs to about $515,000, and we have the funds in our FY 99 budget
      to pay for this increase.


Strengthened firearms penalties for criminals


Q:    Doesn't S.191 simply codify the Supreme Court's recent decision in Muscarello v.
      United States, in which the Court held that a person who knowingly possesses and
      conveys a firearm -- including in a locked glove compartment or trunk -- is subject
      to the 5-year penalty enhancement for "carrying a firearm."

A:    No, S. 191 goes further than the Muscarello case in several ways.

      First and foremost, the Court's decision in the Muscarello case did not reverse its 1995
      decision in Bailey v. United States. In Bailey the Court held that the additional 5-year
      penalty for "using a firearm" in relation to a federal drug or violent crime did not apply to
      criminals who merely possessed a firearms, but only to those who "actively employed"
      the use of a firearm. This narrowing of federal gun laws by the Court still stands today.

                                                               Automated Records Management System
                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion
in Muscarelllo by holding that criminals with a gun in their vehicle -- as opposed to on
their person -- were in fact eligible for the 5-year penalty enhancement for "carrying a
firearm," neither did it hold that mere possession of a firearm qualified a violent criminal
or drug felon for this penalty enhancement. S. 191 makes clear Congress' intention that
simply possessing a firearm in furtherance of a federal drug or violent crime should be
punishable by an additional -- and mandatory minimum -- sentence of at least 5 years.

And third, S. 191 include new and increased penalties for similar crimes. It establishes
an additional, mandatory sentence of 7 years for brandishing a firearm -- and of 10 years
if the firearm is discharged. S. 191 also increases the penalty for subsequent convictions
from a minimum 20 years to at least 25 years.
