Subject: POTUS Letter - Harkin

Janet is up on the Hill and asked that I give you the heads up that Sen.
Harkin has requested a POTUS letter against the Frist-Ashcroft amendment
and supporting the Harkin amendment regarding IDEA on the Juvenile Justice
bill.  Education is currently drafting the letter and substantative1y, it
is expected to be similar to a letter Sec. Riley sent to the Senate
Leadership on May 17.   I think that this is going to be a priority and we
will need a quick turn around.



Karen/Sara - Larry spoke with Harkin's COS and is expected to raise this
in the 8:30am. Thx.

                   May 20, 1999

Dear Mr. Leader:

      As the Senate further considers the
Frist/Ashcroft amendment to the pending
juvenile crime bill,   S. 254, I want to make
very clear my strong objection to that
amendment.   If enacted, it would allow school
personnel to suspend or expel children with
disabilities from their schools for unlimited
periods of time without any educational
services, including behavioral interventions,
for carrying or possessing a gun or other
firearm to, or at, a school function. Just two
years ago the Senate overwhelmingly approved
the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act
which gave school officials new tools to
address situations of this type.

     I urge the Senate to approve the Harkin
amendment to make clear that nothing prevents
school officials from reporting any crimes to
appropriate legal authorities or precludes
appropriate penalties from being imposed·by law
enforcement officials.   Importantly, the
Harkin amendment would ensure that schools
provide appropriate interventions and services
for all children removed from school for
violent behavior and would authorize funds to
cover those required services.

     I am committed to ensuring that all our
schools are safe, disciplined environments. A
school free from the fear of violence is

                                                    Automated Records Management System
                                                    Hex-Dwnp Conversion

        essential to enabling all children to learn to
        high standards. But experience has shown us
        that simply suspending or expelling a troubled
        young person without responding to their
        behavioral and educational needs does not
        protect our society.  We only need to remember
        the tragedy last year in Springfield, Oregon,
        where a young person who had been removed from
        school returned the next day armed and ready
        to kill.

             Our response to these tragedies cannot be
        to deny young people the educations and
        interventions they need.  Instead, we must act
        to ensure that troubled youth receive those
        services to help them and to protect others in
        their communities.

             I recommend the Senate reject the Frist
        amendment and, instead, adopt the Harkin
        amendment which offers real and constructive
        help in averting further tragedy.  In the event
        the Frist/Ashcroft amendment is before the
        conferees on this legislation, my
        Administration will work vigorously to see that
        it is dropped in conference so that a strong
        juvenile justice bill can quickly become law.

                          Sincerely,



        The Honorable Trent Lott
