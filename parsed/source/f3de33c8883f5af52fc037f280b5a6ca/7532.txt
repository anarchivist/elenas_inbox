MEMORANDUM FOR THE CHIEF OF STAFF

FROM:                 ELENA KAGAN
                      SALLY KATZEN

SUBJECT:              USDA's Proposed Organic Rule

        In 1990, Congress passed the Organic Food Production Act, which required the
Department of Agriculture (USDA) to establish a government certification program and national
standard defining the use of the term "organic" for use on food products. The legislation was
strongly supported by the organic industry which sought to involve the federal government in
creating a unified organic standard, rather than the myriad of private and state-endorsed
definitions.

         In December 1997, USDA published a proposed regulation to establish a national organic
standard. It has been the USDA position that the standard is solely a marketing description.
The Secretary has emphasized that the organic designation is not intended to convey information
about the safety, nutritional value, or environmental benefits of organic products and practices.
In some tension with this approach, the Administration has long promoted food safety and there
is a serious question whether an organic label will be construed as an indication of the improved
safety of the product.

         Since the publication of the proposed rule, it has been the subject of extensive criticism.
USDA has received almost 200,000 comments regarding the proposed rule, the most ever
received for a USDA rulemaking. The rule has also been the subject of unfavorable editorials in
many newspapers including the New York Times, the Washington Post, the Chicago Tribune,
and the Los Angles Times. Finally, 47 members of the House and 31 Senators have signed
letters to Secretary Glickman expressing concern about the proposed rule. The primary
complaint has been that the proposed rule does not explicitly prohibit the use of genetically
modified organisms, irradiation, and biosolids (sludge) in food that could be labeled "organic."
In the preamble to its proposal, USDA had requested comments on these products and practices
because of their possible safety benefits and consistency with Administration policy.

Current Status
       Secretary Glickman plans to issue a press release this Friday, (attached), indicating that
USDA will repropose the rule and "make fundamental changes in the new proposed rule on
organic standards." Specifically, the statement would indicate that biotechnology, irradiation,
and biosolids "will not be included in our revised proposal, and food produced with these
products and practices will not be allowed to bear the organic label." Articles last week in USA
                                                   Hex.l)ump Conversion

TODAY and the Washington Post have indicated that USDA is preparing such a statement.

         Representatives ofOMB (Don Arbuckle), NEC (Sally Katzen), and DPC (Elena Kagan)
have been concerned about USDA's approach to this issue. OMB has argued that consumers
will likely view a product labeled as organic as safe, even though there is no evidence to
demonstrate that organic food is any safer than non-organic food, or that genetically modified,
irradiated, or food grown using sludge is unsafe. To the extent that consumers read an organic
label as demonstrating safety, they may be misled. OMB points out that organic material might
be even worse than non-organic food in terms of some microbiological hazards. Organic foods
fertilized with manure have been and may in the future be linked to illnesses such as occurred in
the Odwallajuice outbreak. By contrast, foods using the three disputed techniques (e.g.,
irradiation) may have actual safety benefits. OMB and NEC therefore have suggested that
USDA consider modifYing the organic label to include a provision stating something along the
lines of "organic food may be no more or less safe than non-organic food" or that USDA
continue its comment review process and not prematurely prohibit using the term organic for
food using any of the three disputed techniques.

         USDA felt strongly that the label should not be modified and that a statement announcing
a reproposal needs to be made promptly. USDA states that the organic label is not intended to
signify the overall safety of the food, only the methods by which the food was produced, and that
it will not advertise the label as having anything to do with safety. USDA notes that the
disputed techniques are clearly not in keeping with the public's expectation of what constitutes
organic. The Food and Drug Administration has expressed general support for USDA's
position.

Recommendation                                   ,
        We recognize the need for USDA to clarify its position on organics, and recommend that
Secretary Glickman issue a statement indicating that biotechnology, irradiation, and sludge will
not be part of the revised proposal. We are still discussing with Secretary Glickman's office
the precise language of this statement, but think we can work out this issue. In addition, after
discussions with OMB, OSTP, FDA and USDA we have agreed upon two additIonal measures
that could ameliorate some concerns over safety. These include (1) having USDA and FDA
conduct a survey on consumer attitudes towards organic food to determine whether consumers
purchase organic products on the basis of unproven safety claims, and (2) having USDA insert in
the preamble of its new rule language indicating that the National Organic Standard Board should
report regularly to the Secretary on possible uses of new technologies and, whether they might
meet an organic standard.
