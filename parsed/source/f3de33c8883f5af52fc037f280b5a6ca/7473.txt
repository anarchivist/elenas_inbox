TEXT:
Dallas Smith at USDA thinks he may be able to come up with numbers showing
that since the June agreement the tobacco companies have bought less
domestic tobacco, but are importing more.

This would obviously be significant news in tobacco growing regions where
there is already a good deal of mistrust between growers and the
industry. It would help counter the strong industry offensive in those
states where they have been saying they are on the side of farmers.

I don't think it is a national story -- except to demonstrate industry
duplicity. That is, that the industry is publicly courting farmers, such
as at its Charlotte event,  at the same time it prepares to abandon them
for cheap foreign imports.

I think its worth having him put the numbers together, but do any of you
have another idea on how to use this information?
