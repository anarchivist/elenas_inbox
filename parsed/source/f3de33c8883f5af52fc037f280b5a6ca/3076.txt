SUBJECT:       Options on Minimum Wage for Workfare Legislation

As you know, we have been steadfast in our position that welfare recipients engaged in workfare
should receive the minimum wage. We oppose the current House proposal, arguing that it
would undermine the fundamental goals of welfare reform. Since the House appears poised to
pass a reconciliation bill contrary to our position, it is appropriate at this point for you/us to
consider whether there are any modifications to current law that we would consider, or whether
our opposition is so strong that you would veto any bill with a change to current law on this
issue.

Background: In May, the Department of Labor issued a ruling that the Fair Labor Standards Act
(FLSA) applies to welfare recipients in workfare programs, including payment of the minimum
wage and labor protections such as occupational safety and anti-discrimination laws. There is an
exclusion for trainees, but it is so narrowly drawn that states will probably find it difficult to meet
its requirements and still count the activity toward the welfare law's work participation rates.

Initially, it should be comparatively easy for states to comply with the minimum wage
requirement, particularly since we are allowing states to count food stamps as well. However,
the requirement becomes more difficult over time as the work requirements increase from 20 to
30 hours a week. (Actually, the law allows states to keep the requirement at 20 hours
indefinitely by using training to fill the hours from 20 to 30, but this is somewhat difficult from a
practical standpoint, and some states have passed laws with tougher requirements.)

For example, only Mississippi's welfare grant is so low that it would have difficulty converting it
into 20 hours of a minimum wage payment in 1998, in combination with food stamps, for the
average family size of three. In that same year, eight states would fall short of this mark for
families of only two. By the year 2000, the number of states with shortfalls grows to 21 for
families of three, and to 41 states for families of two.

It is important to note that workfare is hardly the only tool available to states to move people
from welfare to work. Workfare should have a limited, transitional role, since private sector
jobs are the only way to ensure that those on welfare become truly independent.

Congressional Proposals: The House Republicans have language in their reconciliation bill that
would exempt welfare recipients engaged in workfare from the Fair Labor Standards Act or any
other federal law, except OSHA. It would ostensibly require payment of the minimum wage,
but would render this meaningless by permitting states to count child care, Medicaid, and
housing benefits toward that payment. (The Department of Labor's ruling does allow states to
count food stamps, since this is permitted under current law.) We have stated our view that this
essentially creates a subminimum wage for workfare participants. Finally, it would also allow
states to count additional hours of job search, education, and training toward the welfare law's


                                                                           Automated Records Management System
                                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion
requirements, and it would be a substantial weakening.

House Republicans and Democrats are now engaged in negotiations on this issue. They are
considering dropping the Republican plan to count other benefits, relying instead on letting states
count education and training as work where necessary. The Republicans also appear willing to
compromise and extend anti-discrimination laws to those in workfare.

In contrast, the Senate has no FLSA language at this point, but they may simply be recognizing
the likelihood that they would have difficulty with the issue on the floor, preferring to let it come
up in conference.

If we decide to move from our current position, our alternatives would fall into four key areas.

Option I: Count benefits other than food stamps toward the minimum wage: Counting
Medicaid, child care, transportation, and/or housing benefits toward the payment of the minimum
wage would make it far easier on states, but it would raise a number of other issues. First, since
these benefits don't count toward the minimum wage for the working poor, it would effectively
create a subminimum wage for those on welfare. Second, it could set a precedent for further
erosion of the minimum wage by counting all kinds of other benefits for other low-wage workers.
 Third, it would make workers on workfare "cheaper" than those who are not, making
displacement more likely. Finally, placing a value on these benefits is often very difficult to do,
and requires recordkeeping and systems to keep them up-to-date that the states find burdensome.

Each agency offering a benefit feels strongly that that benefit should not count toward the
minimum wage. HHS feels very strongly about Medicaid and, especially, child care. HUD
argues vigorously against including housing benefits.

Option 2: Allow more activities to count toward the work requirements: This option is
probably the one most attractive to the greatest number of parties, but it is a fundamental
weakening of the hard-won work requirements in the law. Some may argue that we should
embrace this proposal since the Republicans have given us political cover by proposing it
themselves. However, to allow the states to throw the work requirements overboard at the first
sign of difficulty is not an auspicious start to implementing this law.

HHS and Labor would not oppose changes in this area.

Option 3: Exempt workfare participants from other labor protections: Although this option does
not help states find the money to meet the minimum wage, apparently much of the states' anxiety
on this issue is actually focused on labor protections. There seems to be general agreement,
even from the Republicans, that OSHA protection and race/sex anti-discrimination statutes
should apply. The hazier issues are enforcement of the minimum wage and other labor
protections. These include whether individuals should have a private right of action; whether
the Labor Department's Wage and Hour Division can bring an action; and whether workfare
participants are eligible for unemployment insurance and benefits, overtime, and family and

     medical leave (what about ADA?). Obviously, it is possible to pick and choose from this list,
     either by starting with existing law and specifying which protections are excluded, or by saying
     that existing law does not apply and adding back certain protections.

     The Department of Labor feels most strongly that we should not consider changes in this area,
     particularly in the area of enforcement.

     Option 4: Exempt workfare recipients from FICA and the EITC: Treasury still has not ruled
     whether current law requires payment of FICA taxes and EITC for workfare recipients. These
     two issues are linked legally so that either both or neither will apply. The IRS is developing two
     scenarios for release. One outlines what type of state work program would require FICA and
     EITC payments, while the other explains the type of work program that would not trigger these
     payments. It seems probable that most states' programs would fall into the first category,
     making the states extremely unhappy. The IRS is still probably a few weeks away from
     completing this analysis.

     We could agree to legislation specifying that workfare participants are not required to contribute
     to FICA and are not eligible for the EITC. This would be partially consistent with our 1994
     welfare reform bill, which allowed the EITC but did not apply FICA. The logic of doing so is
     that it keeps private sector jobs more attractive than workfare for individuals, which is a crucial
     policy goal for us. And not allowing the EITC avoids increasing its identity as a "welfare"
     program.

     Treasury strongly prefers to avoid amending the EITC, because they fear opening the program up
     to change on the Hill at this time.
