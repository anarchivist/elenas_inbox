                          Needle Exchange Q&As


Q:   Why did the Administration choose to release the findings that needle
     exchange programs reduce HIV transmission and does not increase drug use
     yesterday?

A:   Because the science is there. We already knew that needle exchange programs do
     not increase drug use, and yesterday, the Secretary made clear that the scientists,
     including all the respected leadership within the National Institutes of Health,
     have concluded that these programs do not increase drug use.

     Communities around the country, who are making their own decisions on this
     issue, should know that appropriately designed needle exchange programs can
     reduce HIV transmission and do not encourage illegal drug use.

Q:   Is this a permanent Administration position?

A:   New factors could emerge that could cause us to reevaluate this issue. However,
     we do not anticipate a change in our decision at this time.


Q:   If the science concludes that needle exchange programs reduce the
     transmission of HIV and do not increase drug use, why aren't you releasing
     Federal funds for needle exchange programs?

A:   Releasing Federal funds for needle exchange programs would have likely ignited a
     debate that could have threatened the locally administered programs that are
     currently in place and hindered additional communities from being able to make
     these decisions for themselves.

     We have always said that communities themselves, based on all the available
     scientific information and their own unique perspective, should make their own
     decision on this issue. Opening up a debate over Federally funding would have
     inappropriately shifted the focus away from where these decisions should be made
     to the much more highly politicized Federal leveL

     The Administration concluded that such an outcome would be unacceptable and
     chose instead to give the scientific guidance that is necessary for communities to
     make their own decision. (Elena - Chris does think we need the mixed signal
     line h/c the primary criticism is from the left not the right).

             Background: Congress gave the Secretary of Health and Human Services the
             responsibility to make two determinations: whether the scientific research findings
             conclude that needle exchange programs reduce HIV transmission and whether
             they increase drug use, In 1997, the Secretary made a determination that needle
             exchange programs do reduce the transmission ofHIV. Yesterday, the Secretary
             held a meeting with her senior scientific advisors, including Nobel Laureate and
             head of the National Institutes of Health, Dr. Harold Varmus. These scientists
             agreed that the science-based standards have been met with regard to drug use as
             well.

             A 1998 NIH Consensus Conference report on the effectiveness of treatment for
             heroine addiction found that drug treatment programs can assist heroin users in
             halting their drug use. An October 1997 study of needle exchange programs in
             Baltimore Maryland found that needle exchange programs that are closely linked
             to or integrated with drug treatment programs actually reduce the incidence of
             drug use with high levels of retention in drug treatment. In March 1997, the NIH
             published the Consensus Development Statement on Interventions to Prevent HIV
             Risk Behaviors that concluded that needle exchange programs "show a reduction
             in risk behaviors as high as 80 percent in injecting drug users, with estimates of a
             30 percent or greater reduction in HIV."

        Q:   What is General McCaffery's viewpoint on this issue?

        A:   Like all senior members of this Administration, General McCaffery supports this
             decision. We will let him speak for himself. However, it is the responsibility of
             the Secretary of Health and Human Services to determine whether the scientific
             research findings meet the standards established by Congress. All of the senior
             scientific advisors ofHHS agree that the science-based standards have been met
             and, as a result, the Secretary made her announcement today.

             Weare also all in agreement on the importance of reducing drug use in this
             country, especially among teenagers. No one should doubt that illegal drugs are
             wrong and that they can kill you.

     Q:   Won't this send a message to young people that drugs -- especially injectable
          drugs like heroin -- are ok?

     A:   Absolutely not. Injectable drug use is illegal, unhealthy and wrong. It is clearly
          a major health problem as well as a significant law enforcement concern. That is
          why the entire Federal government is sending a unified message to all Americans,
          particularly young people: Drugs put your future at risk; they can kill you; and
          they can infect you with HIV.

          This Administration has an extremely strong record on fighting drugs. We have
          increased the availability of drug treatment, We have worked in partnership with
          communities to fight drugs in and around schools. We have worked with state and
          local governments to put 100,000 more police officers on the streets, and we have
          doubled the number of border guards. We will continue to fight drug use in this
          country and to offer drug treatment to those who are addicted so that they stop
          using drugs. Moreover, the goal of needle exchange programs is to be part of a
          comprehensive HIV prevention strategy that can provide an entry into a drug
          treatment program.


     Q:   How many needle exchange programs are there currently operating in the
          United States?

     A:   According to the latest data reported to the CDC, needle exchange programs are
          operating in 28 states and one U.S territory.
