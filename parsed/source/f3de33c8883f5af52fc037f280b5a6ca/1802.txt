TEXT:
New Language for the second bullet on the exec memo:

II.     Establish "Child Care Masters Programs" in the Military
Services, in which model military child care centers serve as training
centers for civilian child care providers. These programs could
demonstrate effective practices for child care centers, family child care
homes and school-age facilities throughout the United States.   Training in
the area of infant and toddler care would be particularly beneficial.
