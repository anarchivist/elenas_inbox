TEXT:

PRINTER FONT 12 POINT COURIER
Rich Tarplin called me to update me on the technical corrections
package. He says that HHS now has an internal process underway
on the technical corrections package, with documents being worked
on by ACF, HCFA, and immigration folks at HHS.  They expect to
clear it internally by the end of this week. They have talked to
SSA; I advised them to talk to USDA and DOJ/INS as well.
There are format questions and strategic questions.
Strategically, Rich said he thought it would be better to dispose
of as many items as possible now, deferring fewer things to next
year's more substantive legislative package, s6 that that package
is cleaner, with fewer items to trade off and more focus on the
key changes we want.
Also, we need to bring in Hilley's office at the appropriate
time.
