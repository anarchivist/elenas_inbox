Staff Secretary has this final version and it will go to the President as

Dear Representative Greenwood:

      I am writing to express my concern over the Congress' plans
to override my veto of H.R. 1122, a bill banning so-called partial
birth abortions. In this vote, Congress is once again opting for
partisanship over progress; it is turning the painful debate over
this issue into an opportunity to score political points, rather
than to pass legislation restricting this procedure.

     The procedure addressed in H.R. 1122 poses a difficult and
disturbing issue. I strongly believe that we generally should
prohibit the use of this procedure. I have insisted, however, on
exempting those few but tragic cases in which this procedure is
necessary to save a woman's life or to protect her against serious
injury. I again call upon Congress to add such a narrow, tightly
drawn exception to this bill, so that I can sign the legislation
and put an end to all other uses of this procedure.

     The legislation that you have sponsored with Representative.
Hoyer -- which prohibits all late-term abortions, except those
necessary to save the life of a woman or prevent serious harm to
her health -- is also consistent with my principles. As you know,
I have long opposed late-term abortions, and as Governor of Arkansas,
I signed into law a bill that banned them, with an appropriate
exception for life or health. If Congress were to pass your bill,
I would sign it immediately.

     Congress's refusal to consider such constructive proposals --
proposals that would put an end to inappropriate abortions while
protecting women from death or serious injury -- prevents us from
resolving these issues and moving forward. Similarly, Congress's
recent votes restricting safe medical choices and access to family
planning information and services stand in the way of progress on
these issues. I urge Congress once again to move beyond ideology
and political maneuvering, to protect women's lives and health, and
to reduce the need for abortions.

                             Sincerely,



The Honorable James C. Greenwood
