TEXT:
There is a meeting at 5p.m. today in Chuck Ruff's office to discuss the
issue of whether attorney's fees should be available in the pre-complaint
stage of the EEO process for federal employees.    OMB's potential
compromise would generally not allow attorney's fees to be calculated for
pre-complaint activities unless the AJ finds discrimination and the agency
disagrees with it, and the employee ends up prevailing on appeal.  Below
is memo of pros and cons on the compromise that OMB has drafted.

Sally,
"



 Your are scheduled to meet with Chuck Ruff and Maria Echaveste on Monday
to discuss the one remaining issue on the EEOC Final Rule - - attorneys
fees.  Recall that EEOC's draft final rule would allow attorneys fees to
include pre-complaint activities. Treasury, Commerce, and several other
agencies have raised significant concerns with this approach.  Yesterday,
Danny Werfel sent you memo that stated out arguments on both sides of the
issue. Set out below is a potential draft compromise position with some
pros and cons.

    Let us know if you have any further questions or reactions.   Thanks.

Potential Compromise Position: The rule would not allow attorneys fees to be awarded for
pre-complaint activities, with one exception. In the event that the AJ issues a finding of
discrimination, and the agency's final order is not to implement that finding (i.e., "a thumbs
down"), and the employee ends up prevailing on appeal, then attorneys fees can be awarded for
pre-complaint activities.

Pros:

        Without a guarantee of attorneys fees for pre-complaint activities, attorneys will take
        more care in deciding to get involved in cases in the precomplaint stage. This has
        several benefits:

        (i) Addresses agency goal of maintaining and "informal" environment by significantly
limiting the number of attorneys that enter cases in the precomplaint stage.                .

       (ii) Moves in the direction of EEOC's policy, because the presence of this exception
makes it will be more likely than under the current system that attorneys will enter at the
pre-complaint stage.

        (iii) Attorneys looking at cases in the pre-complaint stage may limit themselves to valid
but contestable claims that are likely to end up before an AJ (in the hopes of getting the attorneys
fees exception, since if the agency agreed with the AJ no fees would be awarded), and shy away
from cases that appear closer to settlement or agency-AJ agreement.

        Agencies will take more care in issuing a "thumbs down" because their liability is
        increased if the employee ends up prevailing. This will have two beneficial effects:

(i) Creates a discincentive for agencies to issue "knee jerk" disagreements with the AJ
        decisions.

(ii) Backlog will be decreased because more cases will be completed following the AJ
        decision.

        The new approach would be an appropriate complement to the "offer of resolution"
        procedure. Under the "offer of resolution" if an agency makes a settlement offer to an
        employee, the employee rejects that offer, and the employee ends up prevailing but with a
        judgment not as favorable as the initial settlement offer, then the employee loses the right
        to attorneys fees.

Cons:

   May not go far enough to meet EEOC's policy goal to bring equity into the system by giving
   employees a fair opportunity to be represented by counsel at each stage of the complaint
   process.

   Creates a slightly more complicated system, where pre-complaint attorneys fees are available
   in some situations but not in others.
                                                            Hex-Dump Conversion


Could have the unintended consequence of attorneys working to prevent settlements in order
to get to an AJ decision so that there is a higher probablity that the pre-complaint attorneys
fees exception would kick in.
