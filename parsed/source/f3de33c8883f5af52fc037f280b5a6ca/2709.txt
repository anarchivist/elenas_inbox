Cathy -- Geri Palast will get the new Ways and Means draft tomorrow
morning. Bruce said he wants to have a conference callat 11:00 (like the
one we just had).  Before then, Geri will fax you the draft and Bruce said
he'd like to fax it to the people who will be on the 11:00 conference
call. After the conference call, a small group may go to the Hill for
another meeting with Ron Haskins at 12:00 in necessary .

. Also, I am typing up a one-pager reflecting Ron's latest proposal which
  reflects our input which Bruce says he wants to get around to people in
  the White House tonight to update them on our progress.
