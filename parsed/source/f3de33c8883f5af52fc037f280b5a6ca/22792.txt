The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has the final rule ready for you
to announce -- a new universal method for installing child safety seats in cars and light trucks.
This rule will require each new child seat to have three attachments -- one on top and two at the
base, and by 2002, will require all new cars and light trucks to be equipped with standard anchors
in the back seat designed specifically to link to the child seat attachments. NHTSA estimates
that currently about 80 percent of child seats are improperly connected putting children at risk.
This rule is expected to prevent as many as fifty child deaths and 18,000 injuries each year. You
annouced the proposed rule in your radio address on February 15, 1997. There has been a good
deal of press reports anticipating the new rule, including articles in the Washington Post and on
AP. You are tentatively scheduled to announce this new rule in your-radio address on February
27,1999.
