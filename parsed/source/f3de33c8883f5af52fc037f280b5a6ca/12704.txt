If we're still looking to do things on the Hollywood front, what about
advocating for additional content standards in the movie ratings?

The movie rating system has been subject to quite      a
                                                    bit of criticism
because it is only an age-based, rather than a content-based system. The
MPAA sees the movie and gives it a an age rating, but doesn't widely
publicize why the movie got the rating it did, e.g., was "Scream" rated R
for violence and gore, or for sexual content. Right now the rationale for
the MPAA's movie rating is provided in movie ads on the Internet and in
some newspapers, but is not provided in television ads for movies or on
movie posters and the like.  For example, on the Internet, a parents'
rating guide is available that describes what aspect of the movie, e.g.
strong language, sexuality or horror violence, earned the film its
rating.

Also, the TV ratings system was originally modeled on the movie ratings
system, and because of the criticism of the lack of content in their
ratings, the networks eventually added in content standards.

At the very least, we could advocate for wider publication of the
rationale for the movie rating, so people, particularly parents, have a
better sense of what they are going to see.  There seem to be a lot of
steps they could take on this front.

I'm happy to pursue more research of this issue, if you think that makes
sense.
