TEXT:
Treasury and the AFL had a conference call this morning that was not very
satisfactory to either party.  The AFL felt that Treasury didn't have very
good answers to their questions/concerns.  Treasury felt that there is no
way to satisfy the AFL.  Everyone wants to know what happens next.
Treasury says they will be ready to issue the notice Wednesday if we want;
I told them that was probably good but I would get back to them with a
definite answer.
