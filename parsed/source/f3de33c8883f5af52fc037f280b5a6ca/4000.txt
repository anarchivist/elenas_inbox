The American Spectator
August, 1997

Great News for Sen. Hatch
Hillary Rodham Clinton will spearhead a major legislative push for
federally
subsidized child care this fall. A detailed six-to-eight-month schedule
mapped
out by White House staff foresees a White House conference on child care
to be
chaired by the first lady, and a major address by the president (perhaps
his
1998 State of the Union address) to layout pro-child specifics. Other
plans
call for a federal child-care system modeled on several Pentagon programs


already in place at military bases around the country. These provide fully
subsidized, all-day child care, in-home care for special-need children,
and free
or partially subsidized medical care to pregnant women. "Right now,
everything
is up for grabs," said a White House staffer familiar with the planning.
II But

we're going in with the idea that the federal government is going to have
to
heavily subsidize any child-care plan we put forward. The idea that tax
breaks
will resolve this national problem isn't realistic." Health and Human
Services
Secretary Donna Shalala has been promised a role in the project, and the
White
House has already met with aides to wayward Vermont Republican Jim
Jeffords, to
prepare for hearings by his Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee.
