Prop. 10 Would Cut Teens' Smoking, Survey Finds
              By NICHOLAS RICCARDI, Times Staff Writer

        A survey of Los Angeles County's teenage smokers shows
                           that nearly half would cut back or try to quit
i f proposition
                      10 passes Tuesday and cigarette prices increase by
50 cents per
                      pack, health officials announced Thursday.
                      The survey by the county's health department was
part of a
                      yearlong analysis of attitudes toward smoking among
teenagers and
                      adults. A separate poll found that 69% of adults
support raising the
                      cigarette tax, and the vast majority also back
current smoking
                      restrictions.
                      Further analysis found that the price increase from
the additional
                      cigarette taxes mandated by Proposition 10 would
ultimately lead
                      to 75,000 fewer adolescents smoking, preventing
24,000
                      premature deaths among young people in the county.
Officials
                      contend that it would save the county an estimated
$1 billion in
                      public health costs.
                      At a news conference Thursday, health officials said
they would use
                      the findings to help hone media campaigns against
teenage smoking.

                       Former smoker and county Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky
seized on
                       the survey to reiterate his support for Proposition
10.
                       . "This tax is going to discourage a large number of
kids who are the
                       target population of the tobacco industry," he said.
"We are in a
                       war with the tobacco industry for the hearts and the
minds of
                       teenagers."



                       The Board of Supervisors has endorsed the statewide
measure that
                       would boost cigarette taxes and use the estimated
$700-million
                       annual revenue for anti-smoking campaigns. Sponsored
by actor
                       Rob Reiner, among others, Proposition 10 initially
had wide support
                       in early polling. But tobacco companies have
contributed $27
                       million to defeating the initiative, and an intense
advertising campaign
                       has narrowed its margin of approval.
                       But county Director of Public Health Jonathan E.
Fielding said that
                       when people are asked flatly whether they support an
increase in
                       the cigarette tax, the answer is a clear yes for 7
of 10 residents
                       polled.
                       Although the poll of adults was conducted last year
by the Field
                       Research Corp., it was not analyzed until recently,
Fielding said. He
                       added that its findings should remain valid. "Our
experience has
                       been that the answers to these kinds of questions
are relatively
                       stable."
                       The survey of teenagers, Fielding said, is not as
representative as a
                       poll because it is harder to gather a true random
sample of
                       adolescents.
                       The survey found that 9% of the 400 teenagers
questioned would
                       quit immediately if cigarette prices rose 50 cents;
16% would try
                       to quit, and 23% would cut down.
