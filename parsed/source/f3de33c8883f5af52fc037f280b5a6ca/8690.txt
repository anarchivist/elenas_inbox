        TEXT:
        Last night, Lowey was able to rewrite her contraceptives amendment so that
        it was germane.  It passed 224-198.   I have revised the letter
        accordingly, taking out the paragraph on Lowey. The question is, given
        this vote, whether Congress is quite as extreme as we portray them.
        Certainly, the Mexico City Policy would still lead to more abortions and
        unintended pregnancies, so I left that in.==================== ATTACHMENT     1 ======

              I am writing to express my concern over the Congress's unprecedented effort in recent
     weeks to restrict safe reproductive choices for women. It is regrettable that some Members of
     Congress have chosen to pursue a series of initiatives designed to create a political issue at the
     risk of increasing unintended pregnancies and abortions and of compromising women's health
     and safety.

             I have long said that I believe abortion should be safe, legal, and rare. All of the
     proposals being offered would restrict safe medical choices. 8eme One would actually restrict
     access to family planning infonnation and services and could have the perverse effect of
     increasing the number of unintended pregnancies and abortions. I urge the Congress to put
     partisan politics aside and instead put women's health and safety first.

             First, I am very disappointed that the House struek Congress"'loman LOYley's proflosai to
     require health plans partieipating in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program to eoyer all
     FDA approved preseription eontraeeptiyes. The Lowey proposal would have improved basie
     health eare eoyerage for many y.;omen and helped reduee unwanted pregnaneies and the need for
     abortion.

             Seeond, First, I strongly object to the amendment to impose restrictions on international
     family planning programs. By prohibiting foreign non-governmental organizations from
     receiving United States funds if the organization uses any non-US government funds for
     abortion-related services, the amendment jeopardizes funding to health care providers who are
     working to meet the growing demand for family planning and other critical health services in
     developing countries. Moreover, requiring recipients of US funds to refrain from advocating
     changes or even calling attention to alleged defects in abortion laws would interfere with lawful
     free speech and the ability of organizations to participate in the democratic processes of their
     own countries. Ultimately, the result ofthis amendment's provisions could also be an increase in
     unintended pregnancies, abortions, and maternal and infant death.

             Third, Second, I. find it deeply disturbing that Congress the House would take the
     unprecedented step of intervening in the Food and Drug Administration's drug approval process
     by banning funding for the approval or testing of drugs such as RU-486. For years, the FDA has
     used vigorous testing and the highest scientific standards to protect public health. This
     amendment substitutes political ideology for sound science. It would restrict scientific research
     that can protect women's lives and offer them safe medical choices.

              Fourth, Third, I am disappointed that the House chose to reject the changes that I
     proposed to the Child Custody Protection Act. As my Administration conveyed to Congress, I
     would support properly crafted legislation that would make it illegal to transport minors across
     state lines for the purpose of avoiding parental involvement requirements. I have repeatedly
     stated that I would sign a bill if it were amended to exclude close family members from criminal
     and civil liability and to ensure that individuals who provide only infonnation, counseling,
     referral, or medical services to the minor cannot be subject to liability. As amended in this way,
     the legislation would prevent the circumvention of state parental involvement laws, while
     ensuring healthy family communications. Unfortunately, the Congress has ignored these
                                                                          Hex-Dump Conversion

             proposed changes, as well as those designed to address constitutional infirmities in particular
             provisions identified by the Department of Justice. In doing so, this Congress has demonstrated
             that it is not truly interested in passing legislation, but only in creating another partisan political
             Issue.

                      Finally, Congress is again indicating that it will tum the difficult debate over so-called
             partial birth abortions into an opportunity to score political points, rather than to pass legislation
             restricting this procedure. I have long opposed late term abortions, and I believe that we
             generally should prohibit the use of this procedure. I have insisted, however, on exempting
             those few but tragic cases in which this procedure is necessary to save a woman's life or to
             protect her against serious injury to her health. I again call upon Congress to add such a narrow,
             tightly drawn exception to this bill, so that I can sign it and put an end to all other uses of this
             procedure.

                    I urge Congress to move beyond ideology and political maneuvering, to abandon
             extremism, and to protect women's lives and health, while reducing the need for abortion.
             Congress's current course would remove appropriate reproductive choices for women, seriously
             jeopardize their health, and very possibly increase the frequency of abortions. I will strongly
             oppose these efforts.
