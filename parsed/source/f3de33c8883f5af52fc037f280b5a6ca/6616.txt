                                            March 9, 1998                Hex-Dump Conversion

      Background:

               Since the 1930s, tobacco prices have been supported and stabilized by the federal
      government's commodity support program. The tobacco program operates through a
      combination of marketing quotas, which limit supply, and no-net-cost tobacco loans, which help
      to balance supply with demand. There are two main types of tobacco, Flue-cured and Burley.
      Flue-cured is common in North Carolina, Burley is more popular in Kentucky.

               The settlement agreement with the Attorneys General did not outline a plan to
      compensate farmers for the negative effects of diminished domestic tobacco sales that might
      result from comprehensive legislation. The President, however, made protecting tobacco
      farmers and their communities one of the five key elements of his plan for comprehensive
      tobacco legislation.


      Status in Congress:

              Thus far, three types oflegislative approaches have been discussed. First, Senator Lugar
      has proposed legislation that would quickly "buy-out" quota owners from the governmental
      system at approximately $8 a pound. In Senator Lugar's plan, tobacco prices would then be
      subject to the free market. Second, Senator Ford has proposed legislation that would maintain
      the current quota system. However, if prices decline Senator Ford would require the
      government to compensate farmers for the difference between the prices farmers would have
      enjoyed without legislation and the diminished prices they may experience -- up to a total of up
      to $8 per pound. Senator Ford's bill also includes approximately a $500 million a year
      transistion fund for communities. Finally, Senator Robb has legislation that would combine
      elements of both pieces of legislation. Senator Robb plans on buying-out farmers, but replacing
      the quota system with a production control system based on licenses. Unlike quotas, licenses
      would be given only to those who actually grew tobacco and could not be bought or rented.

               No consensus has yet emerged in the tobacco growing community as to which legislation
      is preferred. Senator Ford's proposal, the LEAF Act, appeals most to Burley growers like
      those in Kentucky who have small farms and want to continue the quota program. Senator
      Robb's approach has gained some support from Flue-cured farmers (based mainly in North
      Carolina and Virginia) who believe the buy-out and license system better fits more
      capital-intensive Flue-cured production. Senator Lugar's approach has some appeal to
      conservative farmers but has not attracted widespread support, and even those tobacco-state
      senators like McConnell who may philosophically favor this approach likely would not come out
      for it publicly.

            Senators Ford and Robb have discussed a compromise bill which would treat Flue-cured
      and Burley tobacco differently. Under this approach, Flue-cured growers would be bought-out




       and remaining growers would use a license system like that supported by Senator Robb, Burley
       growers would remain subject to the quota system as favored by Senator Ford in the LEAF Act.
       The Administration has encouraged their efforts at compromise. Many members of the House are
       looking to Ford and Robb for a workable compromise which could then be introduced by a
       tobacco state coalition in the House. The major issue separating Ford and Robb at this point is
       Robb's belief that there should be a decrease in the legislatively-set price of Flue-cured tobacco
       so it can be more competitive internationally. Senator Ford has opposed this, and the
       Administrationhas expressed concern to Robb's staff that decreasing the price of tobacco, no
       matter how small its effect on the price of cigarettes, is likely not compatible with comprehensive
       tobacco legislation. Senators Helms and Faircloth originally saw Senator Ford's bill as a useful
       block in place of Senator Lugar's bill, and Ford attracted their initial support along with that of 4
       other Republican co-sponsors. Senator Ford continues to work with Helms and Faircloth in
       crafting a bill that can obtain bipartisan support.




                                                                         Automated Records Management System
                                                                         Hex-Dump Conversion
