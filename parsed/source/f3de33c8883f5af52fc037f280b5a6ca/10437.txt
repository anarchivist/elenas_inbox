TEXT:
Budget updates from me and Tom:

1.   We just heard from OMB that the 1000 new Native American teachers is
not funded, and that OMB is expecting it from the DPC funds.

2.   If we could fund only $1 million for a toll-free number for economic
development assistance to Native Americans, this little bit of money could
go a long way.

3.   We also just heard from EEOC that none of their equal pay initiative
was funded. OMB said they are open to it, but it would have to come from
DPC funds.   Also, some of the money they need to reduce the backlog has
not been funded.  EEOC is sending some additional information on how much
they need to meet the goals that the VP announced in January like reducing
the time it takes to process a case to 6 months by 2000.
