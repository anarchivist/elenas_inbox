TEXT:
The President is scheduled to shoot a video tomorrow for the American
Cancer Society's National Fundraising Kickoff; the OPL and the ACS want it
to be about tobacco and our battle against the tobacco industry, among
other things (the proposed script suggests language like: "I know that you
are as anxious as I am to iron out the details of the 'tobacco settlement'
and finally put the blame and the burden of smoking where it belongs -- on
the tobacco industry").  Only issue is that the tape will air two days
after our statement on the settlement.

I plan to keep the script short and talk about accomplishments, not the
industry or the settlement.  I wouldn't bother you if it weren't for the
odd timing.  Please advise.
