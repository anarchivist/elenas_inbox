    As all of you probably are aware, the special provisions of VAWA for
    battered immigrant women have been undercut by recent legislation. A
    number of our congressional friends, especially those in the Congressional
    Women's Caucus, spoke of their concern about this during their one minute
    floor speeches prior to adjournment. The advocacy groups are getting
    geared-up and are wanting relief on this issue and would like for the
    White House, the groups and our congressional friends to have a united fron
    t in getting this "fixed" before Congress reconvenes. Bonnie Campbell and
    Janna Sidley have spoken with me about this but do not want to encourage
    the groups one way or the other until they know the White House plan.
    Additionally, Bonnie says the Justice Dept. is supportive of remedies on
    this issue. Please advise as to our plan.

    If there is no plan, could we have a discussion   thanks.
