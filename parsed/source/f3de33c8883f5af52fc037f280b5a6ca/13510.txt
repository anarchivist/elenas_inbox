TEXT:
In our first victory in any of the timber rider-related cases, the
Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit just granted the
government's motion to extend the stay for the marbled murre let
"known to be nesting" sales until they issue a decision on the
merits (oral argument is May 7th).   Apparently, the panel issued
their ruling before the industry even filed their brief; they gave
the industry 14 days to file their brief, but the read is that the
stay will stay on, so to speak.   (I don't know who was on the
panel yet, but. it is the same panel that will hear the merits).
