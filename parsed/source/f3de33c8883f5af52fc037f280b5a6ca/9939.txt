This was as short as I could get it without dropping principals and choice.

I'll send you AmeriCorps in the morning -- it will be short.

EDUCATION

1. Ending Social Promotion. This past year's budget proposal included $300 million for
Education Opportunity Zones in districts that agreed to remove bad teachers, tum around failing
schools, and end social promotions. Congress never took it up in the budget negotiations
because it required authorization, which Goodling will never give us. For next year, we
recommend a simpler approach that uses existing authority and focuses entirely on ending social
promotion. We would like to expand our after-school program from $200 million to $700
million, and dedicate the $500 million increase to districts that end social promotion. School
districts could use the money to provide extra help after school and mandatory summer school
for students who need it. This initiative will enable us to afford a solid increase in after-school
funding and say to school districts everywhere: If you follow Chicago's lead and stop
promoting students who don't meet standards, we'll give you the money for after-school and
summer school to make sure they do. (COST: $200 million above FY99 budget.)

2. Teacher Quality and Recruitment. Now that we're on track to begin hiring 100,000 new
teachers to reduce class size, we have an even greater responsibility to help communities build
more classrooms and to attract talented new teachers to the profession. We envision a five-part
strategy on teacher quality and recruitment: 1) To recruit talented young people into teaching, a
$100 million increase in the teacher recruitment scholarships we enacted this year in the Higher
Education Act, which would put us on course to attract 60,000 new teachers at high-need schools
over the next five years; 2) To recruit mid-career professionals from other fields, a $60 million
initiative -- modeled after the successful Troops-to-Teachers program -- that would help states
expand alternative certification routes and attract talented people from other professions,
especially military personnel, employees in firms being downsized, etc.; 3) A nationwide
crackdown on teacher education schools, including new regulations authorized by the Higher
Education Act to require report cards for education schools; 4) A $50 million increase in the
Eisenhower program to send secondary school teachers who teach outside their field back to
college to take additonal courses in the subjects they're teaching, coupled with a new
requirement that new secondary teachers pass competency tests in a subject before they can teach
it; and 5) As we implement the class size initiative over the next year, a high-profile effort to help
states make the most of the 15% set-aside for teacher quality. (COST: $210 million above FY99
budget) {ck with Mike} We are also exploring the possibility of a politically interesting counter
to private school choice: vouchers for private school teachers -- an incentive program to
encourage private school teachers to teach in the public schools.

3. Work-Site Schools. One of the most promising new education ideas sprouting up around
the country is the creation of public schools located at the work sites, designed primarily to serve
employees' children. School districts provide the teachers and curriculum; companies provide
facilities and upkeep. These schools-at-work serve a host of objectives at once, by 1) providing
new facilities at no cost to the district, 2) increasing parental involvement in the schools and
parental satisfaction in the workplace; 3) reducing employee turnover and absenteeism; and 4)
increasing school diversity, because work sites are much more diverse than residential
neighborhoods. We propose a $50 million increase in an existing magnet school program to
provide grants to 50 communities to launch work-site schools. We also are working with

       Treasury to develop a tax credit for businesses that start on-site schools, similar to the Kohl
       business tax credit for on-site child care that is already in our budget. By providing a role for
       business, this tax credit may help make it even harder for Republicans to oppose our school
       construction initiative. (COST: $50 million for start-up grants. No estimate yet for tax credit,
       but it will be very small.)

       4. Expanding public school choice. As support grows for private school vouchers, we must
       continue our efforts to expand choices within the public schools. Charter schools are one
       answer, and we recommend a $20 million increase, to $120 million, to keep us on track to 3,000 .
       charter schools by 2002. Work-site schools are another. We also recommend increased
       funding for 1) an existing grant program that helps urban and suburban school districts reduce
       racial isolation by forming interdistrict magnet programs; and 2) magnet schools on university
       campuses, especially in urban areas. (COST: $25 million for 10 interdistrict magnet programs;
       $15 million for 10 university-based schools.) {ck wlMike, who wanted 5 times that}             .

       5. School leadership academies. Research has long shown that an effective principal is the
       single most important indicator of school success, yet little has been done at the national or state
       level to improve the management skills of principals. We propose a small initiative to create
       school leadership academies that would provide training in management, teacher evaluation,
       school discipline, and other areas, to elementary school principals in high-poverty districts.
       (COST: $50 million above FY99.)

       6. Class size. To stay on course to reach 100,000 new teachers in seven years, we will ask for
       $1.3 billion [ck] in the FY2000 budget. We are planning an ambitious rollout of the class size
       initiative over the next year, as we award first-year funding, issue guidance to local districts on
       how the program works, and so on. We also will press Congress to restore the local matching
       requirement and strengthen the provisions to require competency testing of new teachers.
       (COST: Ongoing initiative.)
