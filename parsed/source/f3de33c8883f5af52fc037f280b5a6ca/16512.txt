Elijah E. Cummings
Member of Congress
1632 Longworth Building
Washington, D.C. 20515

Dear Elijah:

Thank you for writing in support of the recommendation made by the Attorney General and Drug
Director to reduce the disparity between crack and powder cocaine sentences. I have reviewed
and accepted their recommendation and have asked them to work with you and other members of
Congress on this matter.

As I have stated before, I believe that some adjustment to the current penalty structure for
cocaine trafficking is warranted as matter of sound criminal justice policy. Reducing the
sentencing disparity to a ratio of 10 to 1 makes good law enforcement sense and addresses issues
of perceived unfairness in the criminal justice system.

Again, thank you for your support on this very important matter.
