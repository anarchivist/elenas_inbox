I've left off HUD, Treasury, and CEA from the list of people I've given
Laura to invite to the meeting tomorrow on FLSA and anti-displacement
provisions, since the conference bill does not include tax and housing
issues.  I've included HHS and Labor, DPC, NEC, Leg Affairs,
Intergovernmental) .   Does that sound right to you?
