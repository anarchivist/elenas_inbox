     Subject:         Discussion of Dept. of Labor Budget issues for the OMB Director's
     Review

     In the absence of a PAD, I invite you to sit down with me and Larry
     Matlack to go over the issues to be presented to the Director in the Labor
     Director's Review for the FY 1999 Budget.   This will be your opportunity
     to hear how we are thinking about the issues and to influence that
     thinking by sharing your advice and counsel, which we will reflect in our
     materials for the Director (even if, perchance, we don't agree with you) .

     At the session, we will show you the Department's request in total and for
     major items, compared to recent budget history, to the current estimate of
     the outcome of the FY 1998 appropriation, and to the OMB Planning
     Guidance. We will also want to hear your views on some issues on the
     mandatory side, especially UI and perhaps TAA.  You will also, of course,
     be free to raise any DOL issues not on our list that you believe should be.

     Given the timing for preparation of the Director's Review materials, we
     need to do this sometime Friday afternoon, preferably around 3 pm. We
     will use Ken's old office, 260 OEOB.

     Please contact Iratha Waters in my office bye-mail or phone (5-6150) to
     ,.
'.        confirm your attendance.  If enough people need a later or a bit earlier
          time that afternoon, we can do that as well.

          If I have missed anyone in the White House staffs with an interest in
          Labor budget issues, our apologies; please share this invitation with them
          and let me know of their interest.

          For those with interests in other agencies in my Division, rest assured, I
          will offer the same opportunities before those Review materials are
          completed.
