TEXT:
FYI, he is meeting tomorrow morning with the Washington representatives
from the five corporations we've enlisted in the welfare to work effort.

Originally, I was going to speak to them just to give them some background
on the issue, but it turns out there is legal problem, so, instead, we
recruited will Marshall to speak to them.

I also put written background info. together for Eli on specifically what
corporations can do to put recipients to work -- how the WOTC works, the
mechanics of the wage subsidy, using intermediaries, etc.
