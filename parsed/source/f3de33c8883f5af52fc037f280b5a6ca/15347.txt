TEXT:
According to DOL, a number of welfare advocates and labor unions are
planning a press briefing on the application of' labor laws to welfare
recipients 5/1 at 12:30. Sponsors are AFL-CIO, AFSME, SEIU, Center on
Budget and Policy Prioirities, Women's Legal Defense Fund.   Speakers
include Kathy Wilkinson--the minimum wage worker who intorduced POTUS at
min wage bill signing. Hill visits are like to happen as well. According
to DOL, message is "not to attack us for inaction but provide support for
a favorable decision".

Not helpful.      Any chance we'd make our decision known (with privitization)
by then?
