ARE TAXPAYERS READY TO SUBSIDIZE HEROIN ADDICTS?

FRC TO INTRODUCE NATIONAL POLL ON
NEEDLE EXCHANGE PROGRAMS

WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Donna Shalala is feeling the heat.   The
American Medical Association, the National I~stitutes of
Health, the U.S. Conference on Mayors, and others are
"strongly urging" her to lift the ban on federally funded
needle exchange programs (NEPs). Last month, the Washington
Post said that "study after study shows that the exchanges do
not promote greater use of illegal drugs" (July 14). On July
8, the Los Angeles Times reported that "several major studies
have shown that the programs that give addicts clean needles
in exchange for used ones decrease HIV infection in
injected-drug users by 30%." And Rep. Elijah Cummings told
USA Today that NEPs have "cut the spread of the virus while
not increasing drug use" (August 5). But is this the whole
truth? Are NEPs stopping the spread of AIDS?

In 1986, Switzerland began implementing NEPs.  Chaos resulted.
Syringes were made available in every pharmacy, and then in
public vending machines.  Zurich's Platzpitz Park was opened
as a "safe haven" for Zurich's own drug addicts and needles
were distributed freely.  The city was soon flooded with
foreign addicts and the number of exchanged needles skyrocketed
to 12,000 per day!  In 1992, the city closed the distribution
center and thousands of addicts relocated to a nearby
abandoned railway station called Letten.  There, it evolved
into a war zone among gangs dealing drugs, while the number
of exchanged needles reached 15,000 per day.  By February
1995, Letten was closed. Addicts were moved to government-
sponsored centers and "shooting galleries."

The result -- Switzerland now claims the highest number of
heroin addicts and the second highest HIV infection rate in
Europe. It also experiences Europe's highest heroin drug
overdose death rate each year.

Now, the United States may be on the verge of federally
funding NEPs, but the Family Research Council will fight to
keep this from happening.

On August 20, FRC will release an unprecedented national poll
declaring what the American people really think about needle
exchanges. Anti-drug leaders will join FRC's president Gary
Bauer and senior policy adviser Robert Maginnis to brief the
press on this urgent matter. The meeting will be held in the
National Press Club's Conference Room at 10 a.m.
