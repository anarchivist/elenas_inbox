U. S. Justice names veteran l·awyer for
tobacco case

WASHINGTON, Feb 9 (Reuters) - A veteran U.S. Justice
Department lawyer who has handled complex environmental injury
cases was named on Tuesday to lead the task force in charge of
the government's planned lawsuit against the tobacco industry.

J. Patrick Glynn, a 27-year Justice Department lawyer, will head the task
force that will make the
key decisions in the case against the tobacco industry to recover the
money spent by the federal
government on smoking-related illnesses.

President Bill Clinton announced the planned lawsuit in his State of the
Union speech last month.
Senior administration officials have said the lawsuit could seek hundreds
of billions of dollars from the
cigarette companies.

Glynn was the first member named to the Justice Department task force,
which is expected to include
about 20 lawyers initially.

Glynn for the past 13 years has headed up the section of the department's
civil division responsible
for environmental civil cases, including handling the government's
asbestos litigation and defending the
government in litigation involving human radiation experiments. He
previously worked in the office of
consumer litigation. Glynn started his legal career as a local and then a
federal prosecutor in St. Louis
in the early 1970s.

The task force is expected to include other attorneys from the Justice
Department's civil division and
outside lawyers also may be included on the team.
