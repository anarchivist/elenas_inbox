Amplification

I want to clarify that what I had in mind was simply to get your views and
support for bringing in state and local officials for a briefing on our
ISTEA victory and where we stand on our efforts to get a Tobacco bill
which is also.a huge win for them in it's current form.  The idea is to
get a two-fer from a single trip by the right elected officials, at the
right time, and for the right issues. Your guidance is important to us.
Thanks
