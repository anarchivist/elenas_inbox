TEXT:
Elena, we have been holding back sending the draft executive memorandum to
Staff Secretary for clearance purposes and to Beverley Barnes for
leak-pitching purposes for your sign-off.  FYI, the important paragraph
directing HHS to develop this plan was highly litigated (we think we did
the best we can do), but we are happy to discuss over the weekend if you
have questions. Thanks.
