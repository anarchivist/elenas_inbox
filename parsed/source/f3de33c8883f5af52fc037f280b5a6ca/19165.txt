        Martin Feldman testified before the Commerce Committee yesterday that the President's
        proposal would cost $644 billion over 25 years. What is your response to this?

                The President's budget includes $65 billion in spending over five years from tobacco
        legisation. We have not done, and never do, budget projections beyond five years. We propose
        industry payments at a level that would result in a $1.10 per pack price increase in order to cut
        youth smoking nearly in half and prevent a million deaths over the next five years. This means
        that over the next five years, 3 million fewer underage teens would be kept from smoking. The
        $1.10 figure is based on its projected impact on youth smoking, not on its ability to generate
        revenue.

        What are the new figures that Larry Summers is releasing today?

                Larry Summers is releasing a new Treasury Department analysis that shows that smoking
        costs this nation's economy $130 billion a year in terms oflost productivity and higher medical
        costs. By reducing youth smoking by 60 percent, as proposed by the President, we would save
        an estimated $78 billion in costs.
