TEXT:
To clarify the topics for Friday's 12:30 meeting on a variety of
welfare reform topics, the agenda items are:
1.   "Allor none":   this is the question, I believe, of whether
the law allows states to pick and choose among classes of legal
immigrants as they make their Jan. 1 Medicaid/TANF/SSBG decision.
(Elena, I'd be interested in your take on this.)
2.   $500 million:  this is the HCFA admin money for eligibility.
HCFA has promised to share their approach with the states next
week (no paper). This is the issue where the states will want a
straightforward formula distribution of this money, but HCFA wants
to use some of the money to reward states that do a good job on
eligibility/outreach.   So states may not be happy.
3.   1931 b vs. d waiver issue:  This once-major issue has boiled
down to having a very minor impact (really just Nebraska)
regardless of the legal theory HHS chooses to interpret the law,
but there is still a political overlay, in that the states will be
mad if they choose one interpretation; and Chafee/advocates will
be mad if we choose another.


 4. The issue formerly known as "the California issue":    they will
 have a preliminary take on whether they think states can become a
 TANF state and get the money early, but defer compliance with time
 limits, etc., until the first Federal dollar is drawn down.
 (Note to the Medicaid types:  we are getting a copy tomorrow (at
 the meeting) of their draft manual issuance. They want to share
 it with states on Wednesday of next week, so are seeking our
 comments by COB Monday.  I don't know what issues are lurking in
 it.  I assume the health division will come to tomorrow's
 meeting. )
