    Jury Awards $B1M in Tobacco Lawsuit

                                By WILLIAM McCALL Associated Press Writer

                                PORTLAND, Ore.    (AP)   -- In the biggest liability
    verdict ever
                                against the tobacco industry, a jury ordered
    Philip Morris to
                                pay $B1 million Tuesday to the family of a man
    who died of
                                lung cancer after smoking Marlboros for four
    decades.

                                The victory by the wife and children of Jesse
    Williams was the
                                second major hit against Philip Morris this
    year. A San
                                Francisco jury awarded $51.5 million last month
    to a Marlboro
                                smoker who has inoperable lung cancer.

                                The jury, which found Williams and the company
    to be equally
                                negligent, awarded $1.6 million in compensatory
    damages and
                                $79.5 million in punitive damages.

                                Oregon's product liability laws require a
    plaintiff to be no more
                                than 50 percent at fault to win damages.

                                Although no smoking liability verdict against
    the tobacco
                                industry has survived on appeal, Wall Street
    analysts had· been
                                watching the Portland case closely to see if
    huge damage
                                awards against Big Tobacco were now a trend.

                                "It- will make the stocks go down," said Gary
    Black, an industry
                                analyst with the New York brokerage firm Sanford
    C.
                                Bernstein & Co.   "This will persuade the industry
    to start
                                thinking the tide may be turning."

                                The Williams family, who sought $101 million,
.'
     alleged the
                             company knew its cigarettes could cause cancer.

                             Testimony portrayed Williams, a former janitor
     with the
                             Portland school system, as a three-pack-a-day
     Marlboro
                             smoker who believed the manufacturer wouldn't
     sell a harmful
                             product and who was heavily addicted to nicotine.

                             Williams died in 1997 just five months after he
     was diagnosed
                             with small-cell carcinoma of the lungs. He was
     67 and left
                             behind a wife, Mayola, and six adult children.

                             "My late husband -Jesse Williams had a dying
     wish,"   said Mrs.
                             Williams. "He wanted to make cigarette companies
     stop lying
                             about the health problems of smokers."

                             Philip Morris attorney Walter Cofer said he will
     appeal. He
                             noted the tobacco industry has a 40-year history
     of prevailing in
                             such cases.

                             "If you look at this verdict, it was not
     supported by the
                             evidence," Cofer said.   "It was a product of
     passion and
                             prejudice."

                             The 12-member Circuit Court jury, which included
     three
                             smokers and 'four former smokers, spent a little
     more than two
                             days reviewing a month of technical and often
     conflicting
                             testimony from experts in such areas as cancer
     diagnosis,
                             radiology and the chemistry of tobacco smoke.

                             Much of the medical testimony on both sides was
     aimed at
                             showing that williams' cancer arose either
     before or after 1988.
                             If the jury concluded that Williams' cancer was
     caused by
                             cigarettes smoked before 1988, Philip Morris
     couldn't be held
                             liable under Oregon law.

                             That's because Oregon law allows plaintiffs to
     seek damages
                             going back only eight years before the filing of
     a product liability
                             suit.

                               Besides the San Francisco case, u.S. juries have
        awarded
                               damages in smoking liability cases only three
        times -- twice in
                               Florida and once in New Jersey. All three
        verdicts were
                               overturned on appeal.

                               "As little as three years ago most people
        thought the tobacco
                               industry was invulnerable. This case shows we
        have a crack in
                               the dam," said John Banzhof, executive director
        of Action on
                               Smoking and Health, a leading tobacco opponent.

                               In closing arguments in the Portland case,
        attorneys for the
                               Williams family cited internal Philip Morris
        documents to bolster
                               their claim that the company long knew about the
                               cancer-causing potential of cigarettes and hid
        that information
                               from its customers.

                               Cofer said Williams was well aware that smoking
        could harm
                               his health and had been warned of that by
        doctors and family
                               members.
