  TEXT:
  Attached is a draft press one-pager for Friday's community college event
  that Bob Shireman and I have prepared.    A couple of things I want to
  flag, because they also need to be reviewed when the speech is circulated
  later tonight: 1. NEC wants to use this as an opportunity to hit the
  Republicans on the Pell Grant/Independent Student issue in the
  appropriations fight; Mike thinks they're right. This is not something
  that we had talked about before, but is incorporated in the draft.   2. The
  one-pager does not refer to the anti-affirmative action referendum in
  Houston, although we know that the POTUS will refer to this in his
  remarks.    I have tried to bring in the "opening the door" theme a little
  to playoff the Little Rock event.

  Thanks.==================== ATTACHMENT     1 ====================

     MAKING TWO YEARS OF COLLEGE UNIVERSALLY AVAILABLE, AND
               PROMOTING A LIFETIME OF LEARNING
    President Clinton fought for a Bipartisan Balanced Budget that included a $1,500 HOPE
    Scholarship and a Lifetime Learning Tax Credit for middle income families, and a $3,000
    maximum Pell Grant scholarship for lower-income families. Today the President will release a
    new report which shows how these initiatives will help ensure that anyone can afford tuition and
    fees for two years at a cOl11111unity college, and highlights how community colleges are providing
    a high-quality education and preparing millions of Americans to participate in the 21st Century
    economy. The President will also challenge Congress to follow through on the Balanced
    Budget Agreement, not shut the door on thousands of adult students.

    Community Colleges are Dynamic Institutions that Provide a High Quality, Affordable Education.
    Today the President travels to San Jacinto College, near Houston, to release a new report on community
    colleges by the U.S. Department of Education. Fifty years after the Truman Commission Report called
    for a nationwide network of public community colleges, this report highlights the critical role being
    played by community colleges in preparing the workforce of the 21st Century. The report describes
    how these institutions provide a high quality education to a diverse array of Americans at various stages
    in their lives and careers, and underscores that community colleges are remarkably affordable, with an
    average cost expected to run just over $1,300 next fall.

    The HOPE Scholarship Cuts Tuition and Fee Costs at Community Colleges by 88%. New projections by
    the Departtnent of Education indicate that in the 1998-99 school year, the maximum HOPE Scholarship
    will cover 88 percent of the national average full-time tuition and fees at community colleges. In seven
    States, including Texas, HOPE covers 100 percent of community college tuition and fees. In 35 States,
    the maximum HOPE Scholarship covers 75 percent or more of tuition and fees. 5.8 million students
    are expected to benefit from the HOPE Scholarship at all types of higher education institutions.

    Pell Grant Increase Will Benefit 1.4 Million Community College Students. The Departtnent of Education
    estimates that 1.4 million community college students will receive an average Pell Grant in 1998-99 of
    $1,810. Pell Grants are available on a sliding scale based on income. The Bipartisan Balanced Budget
    Agreement includes the President's proposal for the largest increase in the grant in two decades, to a
    maximum of $3,000.

    7.1 Million Will Benefit from Lifetime Learning Tax Credit.   For students beyond their first two years of
    college, including those who are returning to school (full or part time) to upgrade their skills or change
    careers, the Taxpayers Relief Act offers a 20 percent tax credit for the first $5,000 of tuition and fees paid
    by a student. It is expected that 7.1 million students will take advantage of the credit to help pay for
    postsecondary education.

    Many Adults Who Return to School Will be Left Out if Congress Does Not Finish the Job. The
    Departtnent of Education estimates that 218,000 students -- and millions more who could consider
                                                                          Hex-Dump Conversion

college -- will not be able to benefit fully from HOPE or Pell unless the President's budget request for
the Pell Grant program is adopted -- as required by the Bipartisan Balanced Budget Agreement. The
President's request included a provision to ensure that so-called "independent" students -- those who are
over age 24, or are married or veterans, can receive Pell Grants if they are low-income. (Like other
low-income students, their eligibility for HOPE Scholarships is limited by their tax liability). A
House-Senate conference committee is currently considering this issue. If they do not ad to address
this problem, college may be out of reach for students like these:

   ·   A 22-year-old veteran making only $10,000 a year.

   ·   A married 35-year-old with joint income of only $14,000.

   ·   A 30-year-old with income of only $11,000.
