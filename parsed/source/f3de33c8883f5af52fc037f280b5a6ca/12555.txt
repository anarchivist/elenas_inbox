PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
CLOSING REMARKS
AT THE WHITE HOUSE STRATEGY SESSION
ON CHILDREN, VIOLENCE AND RESPONSIBILITY
THE ROSE GARDEN
May 10, 1999

         We have just concluded a very productive strategy session in the
East·Room here at the White House.    ID,m encouraged by the many good ideas
I heard.      by the many ways Americans are already working together to
reduce youth violence . . . and by our resolve to redouble those efforts.
When I first called upon this group of Americans, representing all sectors
of society, I had hoped for this sort of session.   It was free of
finger-pointing, and dedicated instead to the search for common ground and
concrete solutions.

        Earlier this morning, I said we wouldnD,t be asking who takes the
blame, but who takes responsibility.  And today, the answer youD,ve given
is a powerful one: youD,ve said, weD,re all in this together.  We may not
agree on every issue, but we do agree on this plain and simple truth: a
civilized society keeps its children safe.

        In the weeks and months ahead, as we launch our National Campaign
to Reduce Youth Violence, we will build on this strong foundation.    We
will cultivate the connections made today . . And we will draw upon the
ideas and experiences shared at this morningD,s session.    I know we will
all think of the children who spoke today with such bravery and maturity.
WeD,ll think of the parents who spoke, of the ways they struggle to pass
their values on to their children -- while struggling, at the same time,
against a swelling tide of images and ideas that sweep into their homes
and can submerge those values.  WeD,ll think of these educators, ever
watchful for the warning signs of troubled youth, ever mindful that
schoolchildren should have little more to worry about than their
schoolwork. And weD, II reflect on the views of so many others here today
with special insight into the minds of children, or a special impact on
young lives.

        As our National Campaign gets underway, we know that we face many
challenges. But we also know that we can overcome them by consistently
challenging ourselves to do better, and to overcome old ways of thinking
and of doing business. We have seen some of that resolve already, in the
support that the gun manufacturers and sportsmen here today have given to
our common-sense gun measures.  And we have seen it in the efforts of
networks like ABC and CBS, and private family foundations like Kaiser, and
agencies like the FCC, to give parents tools like the V-Chip to protect
..
children from violent programming.

        But we know there is more that each of us must do. At home and at
school, in Hollywood and in the heartland, and here in Washington, we must
challenge ourselves, and each other, to step up to our responsibility.

        First, and most fundamentally, we must remember that the way
children turn out is determined by the way they are raised.  I challenge
parents to turn off the television when they donO,t like what they see,
keep an eye on the computer screen, and refuse to buy products that
glorify violence.  If no one consumes these products, no one will produce
them.

        To the media and entertainment .industries, I say this: enlist
wholeheartedly in our cause, in our National Campaign. You have enormous
power -- not just to entertain our children, but to educate them.   I
challenge you to embrace that responsibility. Ask yourselves whether it
is really necessary to assault the eyes and ears of youth with what
degrades and destroys.  Consider the consequences of what you produce.
Make your movies, CDS, and videos as if your own children were the
audience.

         Finally, I urge the Congress: Step up to your responsibility.  I
have introduced legislation to keep guns out of the hands of both
criminals and children. As these gun manufacturers and sportsmen have
made clear, these are common-sense measures.  So I challenge Congress:
pass these gun proposals now.  Give AmericaO,s children the safe childhoods
they deserve.

        If Americans meet these challenges, coming together from all walks
of life to seek and share solutions, then we can truly put an end to the
culture of violence -- and build in its place a culture of the values we
would all be proud to pass along to our children. Thank you.
