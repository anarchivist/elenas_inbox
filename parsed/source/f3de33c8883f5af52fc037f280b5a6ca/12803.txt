     Dear LID Member:

     PLEASE CALL CONGRESSMAN JERRY NADLER. CONGREESSMAN ANTHONY WEINER AND YOUR
     MEMBER OF CONGRESS TODAY! !

     Today or tomorrow the U.S. House is scheduled to vote on the Religious
     Liberties Protection Act (RLPA).  This bill was originally introduced in
     the
     105th Congress and was introduced in the 106th. The prinicipal purpose of
     RLPA is to restore meaning and effect to the 1st Amendment's "free
     exercise"
     clause, which was largely gutted in a Supreme Court decision a number of
     years ago. The free exercise clause had, in essence, guaranteed the
     citizens' right of free religious exercise unburdened by the government.
     Congress has previously acted to restore the free exercise clause, but the
     prior act was also tossed by the Court.    .

     In its current version, RLPA would enhance the protection of certain
     religious expression that could conceivably be burdened by arguably neutral
     state or local laws.  While this is a laudable and generally agreeable
     goal,


the concern that LID, the ACLU, and many other progressive organizations
have about RLPA is that it may create a new and powerful defense against
civil rights claims brought under state and local civil rights laws. An
unamended RLPA could especially undermine state and local laws that
protect
groups that already get the least protection from the courts and federal
government including protections, including sexual orientation, disability,
familial status, marital status, pregnancy status, and possibly gender and
even some minority religions. As such, WE OPPOSE RLPA in its current form.

We ask our members and others to IMMEDIATELY CONTACT REP. JERRY NADLER,
REP.
ANTHONY WEINER as well as his/her own Member of Congress, and urge him to:
1. Offer and vote in favor of an AMENDMENT to RLPA that would preserve the
reach of state and local civil rights protections for lesbians and gays and
others;
2.   Failing the passage of an effective and meaningful amendment, to VOTE
NO
ON AN UNAMENDED RLPA.

Members of Congress may be reached at 202-225-3121.   PLEASE CALL TODAY
BECAUSE CONGRESS IS ACTING ON RLPA NOW!!
