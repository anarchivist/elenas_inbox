 TEXT:
 I had a lengthy conversation this morning with Donna Lenoff from the
 National Partnership for Women and Families. The Labor Cabinet and the
 groups are wanting us to have a FMLA 5th Anniversary event either the last
 couple days of July or first of August.

  Deliverables could be: Support for expansion legislation since we have
  not discussed since State of Union Announcement; we could possibly
  announce an educational campaign targeted at small business between SBA
, and Labor for voluntary compliance; and support for study of the National
  Academy of Sciences' work on how to make FMLA more affordable for working
  Americans.

Also, the Families and Work Institute has a new study about business
benefits vs. cost which is very positive.  So that could be released.

·
    Anyway, I'm trying to gauge the possibility of the President or Vice
    President doing this.
    I'm happy to put forth the request and see if we can work this through,
    but I'd like some feedback.  thanks
,.'
