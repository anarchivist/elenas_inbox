TEXT:
According to the February 9, 1998 issue of Newsweek, a
          tobacco lobbyist named WILLIAM HECHT helped place
          LINDA TRIPP in a White House job during the Bush
          Administration. After the 1992 election, Tripp stayed on at
          the White House as a "confidential assistant" to White
          House advisor BERNIE NUSSBAUM, a senior member of
          WACHTEL LIPTON ROSEN & KATZ, which happens
          to be one of the leading law firms representing the tobacco
          industry . . . Later, after Tripp had accumulated a complete
          collection of Lewinsky tapes, she turned the tapes over to
          another partner of Wachtel Lipton named GEORGE
          CONWAY, who gave them to one James MOODY (who,
          to our knowledge, has no tobacco connection), who gave
          them to STARR. Conway was the author of the brief that
          persuaded the u.S. Supreme Court to permit the PAULA
          JONES case to proceed. . . Another mysterious
          coincidence occurred when VERNON JORDAN, a
          member of RJR Nabisco's Board of Directors and President
          Clinton's supposed friend, agreed to help MONICA
          LEWINSKY find a job in New York. According to
          Newsweek, Jordan got her an interview at
          BURSON-MARSTELLER, a public relations firm that
          happens to have Philip Morris as a long-standing client and
          is currently managing the grass roots movement in
          California to overturn the smoking ban in bars.
