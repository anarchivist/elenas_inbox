TEXT:
Thought I ought to give you an update on the testing event.  First, the
good news.  The following cities are 98%+ nailed down, though I need an
additional phone call to each to make sure:

1. Broward County FL
2. Cincinnati
3. EI Paso (which may bring a consortium of 2 other school districts)
4. Houston
5. Long Beach
6. Los Angeles
7.  Philadelphia
8. San Francisco
9. San Antonio (if we want to bring them in for this, since they already
announced at the Family Conference)

The following are in play:
l.  New York City    which I think will work out
2.  Memphis
3.  New Orleans

In addition, I have a call into the Mayor's office in Milwaukee as per the
meeting with Bruce and Rahm; am waiting to here from Mickey and Lynn
Cutler if they have gotten to Daley, and will reach out to Seattle and
Omaha tomorrow (the Omaha superintendent is quoted in a recent Education
Week story saying he thinks Omaha should participate in the tests)

With respect to states, Alaska is already signed up, and we are waiting
for Colorado, Vermont, Missouri and Delaware to make good on promises to
get us something within the next week.  I am trying to find one Republican
state as well, focusing on Wisconsin and New Jersey as the first targets.
Riley and Thompson are scheduled to be at the same conference tomorrow,
and Riley will try to work Thompson.

I am still trying to work out the event logistics.  I had a good
conversation with Jennifer Palmari this morning, and I think she will help
make sure there is some time for the leaders of these states and cities to
meet briefly with the President (for photo's) before he speaks to the
elementary school principals. However, I need to nail this down some more
before I can figure out how many from each place to invite. And, dealing
with governors and mayors will make this a bit more complicated.
