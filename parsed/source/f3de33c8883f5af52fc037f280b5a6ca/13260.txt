TEXT:
The First sale contains 5,100 mbf and the Last sale has 6,700 mbf,
for a grand total of 11,800 mbf.
Of perhaps more importance than the volume is the fact that the
National Marine Fisheries Service has stated that the First and
Last sales will have result in adverse effects, including
potential jeopardy to coastal coho salmon (Oregon Coast) and
a distinct population of Umpqua River cuthroat trout.
