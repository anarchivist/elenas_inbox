                    EARL Y CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT AND LEARNING
                               POLICY ANNOUNCEMENTS

Today, the President and First Lady are hosting The White House Conference on Early Childhood
Development and Learning: What New Research on the Brain Tells Us About Our Youngest
Children. The day-long conference highlights new scientific findings on brain development in very
young children and points to the importance of children's earliest experiences in helping them get off to
a strong and healthy start and reach their full potential.

Clinton Administration Commitment to Young Children. The Clinton Administration has
invested heavily in research to help us better understand the importance of the first few years of
life to child development and learning. President Clinton has also strengthened efforts to support
families with young children by investing in Head Start, the WIC Supplemental Nutrition
Program, immunization and other early childhood programs.

At the White House Conference on Early Childhood Development and Learning, the President will
make a series of policy announcements that build on the Clinton Administration's commitment to
young children:

Improving the Quality of Child Care By Learning from the Military. Child care experts believe
that the military child care system is now the best in the country. The President is issuing an
executive memorandum directing the Secretary of Defense to use the Department's resources and
expertise to improve child care across the nation. The memorandum asks the Department to: (1)
"adopt" civilian child care centers in the community to help them improve quality and become
accredited; (2) share the materials and models used by the military for worker training,
accreditation and evaluation, financing and other ingredients to their success; and (3) work with
State and local government job training programs to allow military child care facilities to serve as
training locations for welfare recipients moving from welfare to work.

Providing Health Coverage for Children. The President's fiscal year 1998 budget includes a
children's health initiative that will extend coverage to up to 5 million uninsured children by thc
year 2000 by strengthening Medicaid for poor children, building innovative State programs to
provide coverage for working families, and continuing health coverage for children of workers
who are between jobs. Today, the Association of American Medical Colleges issued a letter of
support for the Clinton Administration's children's health proposal. The President is also
pleased that Kaiser Permanente is taking steps to give our nation's children the health care they
need by commiting $100 million over the next five years to provide health insurance to uninsured
children in California.

Importance of Early Education. The President recognizes that children must be nurtured and
stimulated in the earliest years. That is why he is announcing two initiatives geared toward early
learning.

·      Expanding Early Head Start. The Department of Health and Human Services is requesting
       proposals for new Early Head Start programs to expand Early Head Start enrollment by one-third
       next year. Created by the Clinton Administration in 1994, the Early Head Start program brings
       Head Start's successful comprehensive services to families with children ages zero to three and to
       pregnant women.
                                                                                    Hex-Dilmp Conversion ·

·      Giving Parents and Caregivers Early Childhood Tools. The President's America Reads
       Challenge is releasing "Ready*Set*Read" Early Childhood Development Activity Kits. The kits
       offer suggestions to families and caregivers about developmentally appropriate activities for
       children ages zero to five. They will be distributed to early childhood programs across the
       country and to callers to a Department of Education hotline.

Police Partnerships for Children Exposed to Violence. [NEED NEW NAME] The Department of
Justice is establishing a Police Partnership for Children Exposed to Violence to provide training on early
childhood development to community police officers, prosecutors, probation and parole officers, school
personnel and mental health providers. This program will better prepare law enforcement officials to
respond to young children exposed to violence and can help prevent today's children from turning into
tomorrow's criminals. The initiative is built on the successful partnerships between community police
officers and mental health providers funded by DOJ in New Haven, Connecticut and three other
communities which has changed the way police officers respond to children who are either victims of or
witnesses to violence.
