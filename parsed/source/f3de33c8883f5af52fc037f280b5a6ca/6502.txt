TEXT:
If it helps, here is a first cut at a meeting list:

Lou Gerstner, IBM
Ed Rust, State Farm (head of National Alliance of Business, Business
Roundtable Education Task Force, and new member of ACHIEVE Board.
Gov. Engler or Gov. Voinavich (the political people here will go nuts over
Engler, but he's the best R gov. if we want to use this to move our
testing agenda forward.
Gov. Hunt, Gov. Romer or Gov. Carper
Diane Ravitch
Mayor Daley or another mayor into education (if Rahm really wants a mayor)
Bill Schmidt (head of TIMSS study)
Norma Paulus, Oregon state superintendent of education
Paul Kimmelman or another representative of Chicago-area 1st in world
consortium
2 outstanding math/science teachers
Bob Corrigan, President of Cal. State U system, or Richard Atkinson,
President of UC system (and former head of NSF in Carter Administration)
Hugh Price
a few scientists/mathematicians, and a few people who would add greater
diversity to the list.
Bob Chase and Sandy Feldman if we want them


This list is too long--and will take some work to keep to a manageable
size and still give us what we need.

A Wednesday announcement -- almost two weeks before the meeting--is a
guarantee that we will spend considerable time between now and then
dealing with people who are ticked off that they are not invited, or
represented in some way.
