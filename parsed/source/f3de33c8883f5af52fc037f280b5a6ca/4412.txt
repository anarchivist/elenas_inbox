HD   * A POTENTIAL STEP BACK ON AIDS
PD   *   09/18/97
SN       Chicago Tribune

          A proposal before Congress to permanently ban federal funding
         or endorsement of clean-needle programs as an AIDS-prevention
         strategy puts politics and rhetoric ahead of science and common
         sense. It should be defeated.

            Five years ago congress imposed a provisional ban on
         clean-needle programs, pending certification and assurances by the


        Health and Human Services secretary that first, such programs were
        helpful in reducing HIV infections among intravenous drug users,
        and second, that they did not foster addiction.

          In February of this year, HHS Secretary Donna E. Shalala did
        just that: She submitted to Congress a compendium of all the major
        scientific evaluations of needle exchanges--which unanimously
        indicated that they help reduce the rate of HIV infections without
        promoting drug use.

          The next logical step would have been for the Clinton
        administration to lift the ban on federal funding of clean-needle
        programs. And that's probably why Republican Reps. Tom A. Coburn of
        Oklahoma and J. Dennis Hastert of suburban Aurora attached an
        amendment to a House appropriations bill that would make the
        funding ban permanent, regardless of proof of their usefulness.

           The latest round of opposition relies partly on two recent
        Canadian studies that seem to run counter to the flood of research
        supporting the needle exchanges. Or do they? The Vancouver
        researchers, for example, do not advocate elimination of the
        exchanges but instead argue for a more comprehensive set of
        measures, including drug counseling. And nowhere does either of the
        studies suggest that needle exchanges encourage drug addiction--one
        of Hastert's chief concerns.

           Other facts, however, remain indisputable.   Today in Illinois,
        41 percent of the HIV infections are directly   or indirectly
        attributable to contaminated needles. Saddest   of all are the
        infected babies, 90 percent of whom inherited   the virus from their
        drug-addicted mothers.

          AIDS is a monster that won't be slain by anyone bullet. But
        needle-exchange programs, combined with counseling and
        rehabilitation programs, have been proven time and again to be a
        key part of an effective AIDS prevention strategy.

          The Coburn-Hastert amendment was approved by the House 'but
        failed in the Senate. It's now headed for a conference
        committee--which is as far as it deserves to go.
