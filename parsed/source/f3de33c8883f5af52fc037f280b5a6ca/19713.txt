Subject:         Spending in Certain Areas of McCain

As mentioned, we're trying to develop spending estimates on the following
six areas of the bill, where admittedly, it is difficult to know what
levels McCain is contemplating.  If you can give us any sense of the
dollar magnitudes that the Committee may have in mind in these areas, it
would be a real help to us.

Cessation      p. 131, line 15-16, includes language "such sums as may be
necessary" .
Public Education Program       p. 137, line 9, includes "such sums as may
be necessary".
Community Action Program -- p. 138, line 9, includes "such sums as may be
necessary" .
Block Grant for State Retail Licensing -- p. 138, lines 14 & 22,    any
indication on the size of these grants?
Indians -- a)   Public Health Payments p.186, line 20 and p. 187, line 10,
provides grants to -eligible indian tribes; b) Trust Fund Payments to IHS,
p. 188, lines 15-17, would fund programs to reduce consumption and promote
cessation activities.
Minorities Counter-Advertising -- p. 394, lines 16-17, includes "such sums
as may be necessary".
