Q:    What steps is the Administration taking to improve food safety?

A:    Last year we were able to increase spending on food safety by approximately $40 million ..
       This year, our budget will seek an even more substantial increase in resources to
      improve food safety. The resources will go to a variety of initiatives, including: giving
      FDA authority to prevent the import of produce from countries without safety precautions
      equivalent to our own; hiring FDA inspectors to improve the safety of our nation's fruits
      and vegetables, both domestic and imported; developing new ways for federal inspectors
      to detect food-borne illnesses in meat and poultry and determine the source of
      contamination; improving educational outreach on proper food handling; and expanding
      CDC's surveillance activities for food-borne illnesses.


Q.    Is this a new issue for the Administration?

A.·   No, our actions are part of a continuing effort that has seen real accomplishment every
      year:

      *       October, 1997. President announces new initiative to enhance FDA oversight
      over imported foods and to develop guidance on good agricultural and manufacturing
      practices for fruits and vegetables; to seek legislation to give FDA the same authority that
      USDA has to inspect imports; and to seek funds to greatly expand FDA's inspection
      force.

      *      January, 1997. Administration announces comprehensive new initiative to
      improve the safety of nation's food supply detailing a $43 million food safety program,
      including measures to improve surveillance, outbreak response,education, and research.

      *       August, 1996. President signs Safe Drinking Water Act of 1996. The law
      requires drinking water systems to protect against dangerous contaminants like
      cryptosporidium, and gives people the right to know about contaminants in their tap
      water.

      *      August, 1996. President signs Food Quality Protection Act of 1996, which
      streamlines regulation of pesticides by FDA and EPA and puts important new
      public-health protections in place, especially for children.




                                               1                 Automated Records Management System
                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion




              *       July, 1996, President Clinton announces new regulations that modernize the
              nation's meat and poultry inspection system for the first time in 90 years. New standards
              help prevent E.coli bacteria contamination in meat.

              *       December, 1995. Administration issues new rules to ensure seafood safety.
              Utilizes HACCP regulatory programs to require food industries to design and implement
              preventive measures and increase the industries' responsibility for and control of their
              safety assurance actions.

              *      1994. CDC embarks on strategic program to detect, prevent, and control
              emerging infectious disease threats, some of which are food borne, making significant
              progress toward this goal in each successive year.

              *     1993. Vice-President's National Performance Review issues report
              recommending government and industry move toward a system of preventive controls.


         Q.   A recent story revealed that USDA did not close down a plant despite 1,700
              violations, what are you doing to make sure our meat and poultry are safe to eat?

         A.   We do need to keep doing a better job on food safety. And I am committing more
              resources than ever to the problem, and modernizing food safety for meat and fruits and
              vegetables and the water we drink. There are several important facts to remember in
              regard to this specific story. First, in every instance cited in the story, inspectors took
              action to prevent unsafe food from reaching consumers and to correct unacceptable
              practices by the plant. Second, the story is based largely on events in 1996. Since that
              time the Administration has developed the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points
              (HACCP) which we began implementing in January 1997. Under this system the Food
              Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) can insist on preventative measures to improve food
              safety before a plant can reopen. Under HACCP inspectors will use non-compliance
              reports to document food safety violations. These actions will lay the groundwork for
              documenting repeated failures. And where there are repeat failures, FSIS can and will
              take formal action to shut down the plant. Finally, the Administration has asked .
              Congress for additional enforcement authority to fine companies for violations of food
              safety standards. Currently, USDA can't fine companies that violate food safety
              standards.
