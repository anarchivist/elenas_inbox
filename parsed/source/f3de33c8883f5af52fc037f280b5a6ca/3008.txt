         A.    Welfare Reform -- US Conference of Mayors Resolution

         Overall:

               The resolution agrees with our goal of reforming welfare with an emphasis on
               work, and supports many of our specific policies, such as creating a $3 billion
               welfare to work program, enacting a targeted welfare-to-work tax credit, and
               restoring benefits to legal immigrants. It also voices concerns about the end of
               the entitlement to assistance, the level of budget cuts in the welfare law, and
               whether there will be enough jobs for welfare recipients in many cities. It goes
               beyond the policy in the President's budget by supporting restoration of food
               stamp benefits for legal immigrants (we restored SSI and Medicaid, but not food
               stamps) and including SSI for non-disabled elderly legal immigrants, as well as the
               disabled.

         Possible suggestions for improvements:

         1.    Drop Item 2, which is an unnecessarily negative description of the welfare law.
               They will probably resist.

         2.    We could ask them to drop references to improvements we were not able to secure
               in the budget agreement -- but it is not critical, and they will rightfully protest, so I
               would not recommend asking. These items are: restore food stamps to legal
               immigrants; restore SSI to elderly non-disabled legal immigrants; restore food
               stamps to childless adults who can't find work; repeal other food stamp cuts (i.e.,
               shelter deduction, standard deduction, vehicle asset limit).

         B.    Education Resolution --U.S. Conference of Mayors Resolution

         Overall:

         1.    This poses no problems for us and is basically fine as is. The primary focus of the
               policy is on the role of Mayors in education partnerships. It essentially provides
               encouragement for mayors to carve out a role for themselves in education, working
               in partnership with local superintendents, regardless of whether the mayor has a
               formal governing role in K-12 education. In this context, it calls for Mayors to
               promote: the adoption of academic standards, business partnerships,
               school -to -work efforts, technology, and school safety initiatives. It also supports
               specific efforts with regard to reading programs, technology, school construction,
               and community schools/after schools programs. These are all consistent with the
               President's Call to Action.

         2.    The resolution also focuses on a handful of federal programs: Title 1,
               School-to-Work, school construction, technology, and after-school programs.
               This is an important but limited set. It would be helpful if the resolution also


                                                                  Automated Records Management System
                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion

       The President's Call to Action for American Education overall, or, specifically,
       America Reads
       The President's call for national standards and tests in 4th grade reading and 8th
       grade math. These tests can be very powerful tools for raising expectations for
       urban students, and for promoting accountability.

3.     I understand the Education Department's Office of Intergovernmental Affairs has
       been working with Mayor Menino's office, and may have already secured his
       support for adding America Reads (which is patterned after Read Boston) and,
       possibly, the Call to Action.

C.     Health Care -- U.S Conference of Mayors Resolution

Overall:

       We do not have any major problems with the mayors list. However, we should note
       that while the mayors office is endorsing Hatch-Kennedy in response to the problem of
       uninsured children, the President has not supported this legislation in the context of the
       balanced budget negotiations .. We believe it is important for the mayors and others to
       emphasize the $16 billion already in the budget agreement adnd to help ensure that these
       dollars are invested to cover as many children as possible. Supporting additional
       funding for children's health care at this time, we believe could possibly undermine the
       budget agreement, and in particular the $16 billion for children's health care.

       Finally, we want to note that the resolution calls for the Administration to support
       legislation to provide reimubursement for annual mammography screening. The
       President's budget already proposes to wave copays and deductibles for annual
       mammography screening.


D.         Crime -- U.S. Conference of Mayors Resolutions

Overall:

            Generally, the resolution praises the COPS program and how it has been
       administered by the Department of Justice. The resolution also calls for two
       changes: (1) for Congress to restore appropriations for the 15 percent of the COPS
       funds that can be used for non-hiring purposes; and (2) for the Administration
       and Congress to extend COPS grants to cities beyond their 3 years of funding in
       cases of fiscal hardship. The Administration is generally supportive of this
       resolution. We have supported the flexible use of COPS monies and are about to
       waive the $75,000 per-cop cap for cities that seek funding this year. However, we
       have not yet embraced extending COPS grants into future years.
