TEXT:
Elena,

As you know, Sally wants to convene a Deputy's meeting on HIB this week.
Ceci and I are working on a background memo for you and Sally which you
should have by the end of the day.   The memo discusses proposed HIB
reforms and training in some detail, in order to allow you 'all to
determine whether there are versions of these reforms that we would not
support.

Sally would like for the meeting to take place Thursday afternoon (at 2 or          Ii
3pm). However,  I        PS/(b)(S)           I
                                        she may not be able to make it and     [CO \ )
would like you to convene. According to Laura, you have some time
Thursday afternoon.  Should Laura go ahead and set this up? Thanks.

Julie
