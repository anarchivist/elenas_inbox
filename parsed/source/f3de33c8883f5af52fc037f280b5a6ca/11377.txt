I'm sorry a meeting with the VP prevented me from attending the meeting,
which I gather was very productive. (I should stay away from more
meetings. )

I just wanted to add an option for future consideration: Asking the US
civil Rights Commission to study the "the problem" -- and I'd consult with
Chairman Mary Frances Berry on the deiniftion of "the problem" to include
in the the PResident's charge to the Commission.

Finally, with specific reference to NYC, I just want to remind everyone
that the Mayor has suffered a serious political body blow in his approval


ratings among all groups based on his handling of this matter: his
eagerness to stand by the police department, emphasizing that most cops are
great Americans, and his reticence to express a sense of shock or outrage,
and stand shoulder-to-shoulder (figuratively) with people who are upset and
want better accountability for police misconduct.

Comparable reticence from the President would be unfortunate, and I doubt
it would reflect who he is. He should be allowed to decide whether, when
and how to speak. And he should be given the choice urgently, before the
Administration takes body blows, too.
