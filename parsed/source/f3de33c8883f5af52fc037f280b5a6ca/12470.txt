       TEXT:
       To follow, for your review, are ED's proposed changes to the Bilingual
       Education part of ESEA.


       1. Replace the current "Termination" prov~sJ.ons, sections 7114 (b) (2) and
       7115 (b) (2), in both the Comprehensive School and Systemwide Grant sections
       with:

                         (2)   by amending subsection (b) (2) to read as
       follows:
                      "(2) PROGRAM IMPROVEMENT PLAN.--(A}  The Secretary, before
      making a continuation award for the fourth year of program services, shall
      determine if a program is making continuous and substantial progress in
      assisting children and youth with limited English proficiency to learn
      English and achieve to challenging State content and performance standards.
      The Secretary shall base the determination on--
                      "(i) the indicators established under section 7123(d} and
      the data and information collected under section 7123; and
               "(ii) such other data and information as the Secretary may
      require.
                              "(B) (i) If the Secretary determines that a program
      requesting a fourth-year continuation award under this section is not
      making
      continuous and substantial progress under paragraph (2), the Secretary
      shall
      require the recipient to promptly develop and submit to the Secretary a
      program improvement plan for its program,


                                   "(ii)   The Secretary shall approve a plan
only if he or she determines that it holds reasonable promise of enabling
students with limited English proficiency participating in the program to
learn English and achieve to challenging State content and performance
standards.
                          "(C) (i)   If the Secretary approves a plan under
subparagraph (B), the recipient shall report to the Secretary within one
year on the success of its activities under the plan in enabling such
students to learn English and achieve to challenging State content and
performance standards.
         "(ii)  If the Secretary does not approve a plan under subparagraph
(B), the Secretary shall take such other action as he or she determines to
be appropriate, such as the denial of a continuation award.
                          "(D)   If the Secretary, after receiving the
recipient's report under paragraph (C) (i), determines that the recipient's
program is not making continuous and substantial progress, the Secretary
shall deny the recipient a continuation award.";
2.   In section 7116, "Applications", replace the subsection (i) (1) ,
"Priority", with:
                  (4)  in subsection (i) by--
                          (A)   amending paragraph (1) to read as follows:
                  "(1)  Priority.    The Secretary is authorized to give
priority to applicants that--
                                   "(A)   experience a dramatic increase in the
number of limited English proficient students enrolled;
                                   " (B)  demonstrate that they have a proven
record of success in helping children and youth with limited English
proficiency learn English and achieve to high academic standards; or
                                   " (C)  propose programs that provide for the
development of bilingual proficiency both in English and another language
for all participation students.";
3. Replace proposed section 7123 (d) in our bill with a new paragraph (d):
                  (3)  adding a new subsection (d) to read as
follows:
         "(d)  PERFORMANCE MEASURES. The Secretary shall establish
performance indicators to determine if programs under sections 7114 and
7115
are making continuous and substantial progress, and may establish
performance indicators to determine if programs under section 7113 are
making continuous and substantial progress, toward assisting children and
youth with limited English proficiency to learn English and achieve to
challenging State content and performance standards.".
