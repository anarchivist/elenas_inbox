TEXT:
I don't know how DOJ works in situations like this.

Clearly we would have to check out the exact grounds of the suit before
saying anything, but I would think from a strategy perspective that we
would try to use it as part of our momentum to get our legislative changes
enacted.  It's hard to see criticizing Chiles when we are on record as
agreeing with him.
