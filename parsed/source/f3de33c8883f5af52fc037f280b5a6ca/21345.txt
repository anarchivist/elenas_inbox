"A new survey, released this week in Des Moines, shows that Americans are
more concerned about food safety than about crime prevention or even water
quality. Their principle food safety concern was E. coli 0157-H7, with
91% of them saying they were J&concerned,08 or O&very concerned,08 about
this pathogen.   Illnesses from this organism have been linked to a number
of different fresh fruit and vegetable products, both domestically and
internationally. Consumers expect the government and industry to respond
to these concerns."
