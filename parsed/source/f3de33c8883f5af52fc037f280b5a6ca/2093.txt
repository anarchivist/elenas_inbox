MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:            Bruce Reed

RE:              DPC Weekly Report




       1.)   Displacement You asked whether there are protections in the welfare law to prevent
worker displacement. The law expressly forbids federally· subsidized welfare reform programs
from placing welfare recipients in job openings created by company layoffs, terminations, or
involuntary reductions of the workforce (section 407(t) of the law). Welfare recipients can,
however, be placed injobs that are vacant for reasons other than firings or layoffs (openings
created, for example, by attrition or the cancellation of a vendor contract). Moreover, while
states must have a grievance procedure for resolving complaints of alleged displacement, the law
does not require specific procedures or proscribe penalties for state violations, leading some to
argue that the prohibition against displacement is unenforceable.

 Thus, the April 23rd USA Today editorial was correct in saying, "The law bars employer from
firing existing workers to hire welfare recipients whose compensation is subsidized by the state.
But its intent can be defeated by reducing hours, wages or benefits for existing workers or
terminating outside contracts; workfare recipients can then fill vacancies."

During Senate consideration of the welfare legislation, Senator Rockefeller, with some help from
Republicans like Senator D' Amato, fought unsuccessfully to strengthen this provision.




2.) Work Partnership: We have made plans with Eli Segal for a May 20th White House event
to launch the Welfare to Work Partnership, which was formed by the five CEOs you praised in
the State of the Union. You will announce that 25 or more additional companies have accepted
your challenge to hire welfare recipients. We also plan to have you announce your commitment
to ensure that funds are available for innovative transportation efforts to ensure that welfare
recipients can get to work. You would announce pilot grants to 25 states to develop welfare to
work transportation plans and promote your proposal to provide $600 million in welfare to work
of the companies present would commit to providing matching funds for such welfare-to-work
transportation efforts.

 3. Education Town Hall Meeting: We are working to arrange an "Education Town Hall
Meeting" focused on your national testing initiative, and designed to provide you with an
opportunity to explain what high standards are really all about -- perhaps by literally
working through a couple of sample test items from NAEP. You would then take
questions from an audience of educators, parents and students. We are exploring a
number of possible locations for this event, with Kentucky the leading contender at the
moment.

4. National Testing Initiative: Last week Mike Cohen met separately with Rep. Frank
Riggs, who chairs the House subcommittee on Early Childhood, Youth and Families, and
with Rep. Dale Kildee. Both are strong supporters of your testing initiative. In addition,
Secretary Riley testified before Mr. Riggs' subcommittee on this issue. These were mainly
positive developments, though they also helped to define the nature of the opposition we
will face on Capitol Hill. There is strong support among House Democrats on this
committee for your initiative, including from George Miller, Tim Romer, and Patsy Mink,
in addition to Dale Kildee. On the Republican side, Frank Riggs and Mike Castle are
strong supporters. However, Mr. Goodling has apparently reversed his previous
position of support, and has now expressed serious concerns over this initiative, on the
grounds that the tests would lead to the ranking of individual schools. In addition, both
Mr. Goodling and Mr. Riggs argued that a move to national testing ought to involve
Congressional authorization (though Mr. Riggs concedes that we already have general
statutory authority to undertake the development of the tests).

These developments do not suggest any change in our basic strategy to developing the tests
and signing up states. However, we will work closely with Congressional supporters on
both sides of the aisle to determine how best to move this initiative forward, including
through the appropriations process, with the broadest base of support.

                                                                          Hex-Dump Conversion
