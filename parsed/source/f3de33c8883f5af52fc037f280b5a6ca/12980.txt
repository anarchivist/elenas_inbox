MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:                  Bruce Reed
Elena Kagan

SUBJECT:               DPC Weekly Report

        1. Guns -- Crime Gun Report on Youths Age 18-20: At a Monday event with the
U.S. Conference of Mayors, the Vice President will release a joint Treasury-Justice Department
report on gun crime in the age group of 18-20. This age group leads all others in using guns in
homicides and non-lethal crimes, including assault, rape, and robbery. Among the key findings
of the report are:

(1) Eighteen, nineteen and twenty year-olds ranked first, second, and third in the number of gun
    homicides committed in 1997. Youths in this age group committed 23.5 percent of all gun
    homicides nationwide.

(2) For non-lethal violent crimes, 18 to 20 year-old offenders were more likely to use a firearm
    than offenders in the other age groups.

(3) Of crime guns recovered and traced by law enforcement officials in 27 cities, more crime
    guns were possessed by 19 year-olds than any other age. Crime guns possessed by 18
    year-aIds ranked second.                                                 '

(4) Crime guns recovered by law enforcement from 18 to 20 year-olds are mostly handguns,
    especially semiautomatic pistols.

The report confirms that the high rate of crime in the 18-20 age group is linked to excessively
easy access to firearms. To address this, your gun legislation contains provisions to ban
handgun, assault rifle, and large capacity clip possession and transfer to youths under age 21, and
measures to crack down on illegal gun trafficking and straw purchasers by toughening penalties
on gun traffickers and limiting handgun sales to one per month.

         2. Guns -- Brady Report: Early next week, the Justice Department will release a
Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) report showing that under interim Brady (3/94-11/98), Brady
background checks stopped over 312,000 prohibited purchasers from buying handguns. Of this
total, two-thirds (207,000) of the individuals were barred for felony convictions or indictments.
In addition, since the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) took effect in
2.21 million background checks it conducted. While we do not have the total number of gun
sales rejected by states that run their own background check systems, BJS reports that states
conducted roughly the same number of checks as the FBI (2.22 million). States generally have
slightly higher rejection rates than the FBI. We expect to announce the updated Brady number
closely timed with the House vote on gun and juvenile crime legislation set for next Tuesday.

        3. Crime -- COPS: On Thursday, the Senate Commerce, Justice, State appropriations
full committee voted out a bill which would zero out the COPS Program. The Senate bill funds
the Administration's request of $350 million for law enforcement technology included in our
COPS initiative, but would transfer the funds to Office of Justice Programs and shut down the
COPS office entirely. Administration officials will continue to amplify our opposition to the
elimination of the COPS program during this weekend's meeting at the U.S. Conference of
Mayors. As you know, the Mayors have been strong backers of the program and support its
extension and our 21st Century Policing Initiative. The House appropriations committee has
not yet acted on Commerce, Justice, State bill.

        4. Welfare - Two Parent Participation: As you may recall, in late December we
announced that all states met the 25 percent participation rates required for all families in
TANF's first year, FY 1997; however, about half of the 39 states who were required to report for
this early period did not make the tougher 75 percent work rate required for two parent families.
HHS has now sent letters to states advising them of the amount of the penalty and giving them
the option to accept the penalty, submit a plan showing how they will achieve the 1997 target by
a future date, or file an appeal. For most states except California, the penalties, if imposed, will
be very small (ranging from $224 in Alabama to $223,000 in Washington) because the amount of
the penalty is adjusted for the share of the state's caseload consisting of two-parents and for the
amount by which the state missed the participation rate target. The penalty for California could
be $4.5 million - a large amount, but still less than one percent of the state's 1997 TANF grant --
because the state has a high proportion of two-parent cases and missed the target by a large
amount. While a few states are accepting minimal penalties, most are submitting corrective
action plans outlining how they will revise their programs to come into compliance. We expect
to have participation rates for FY 1998 later this summer.

        5. Welfare - Civil Rights Guidance: We and the counsel's office are currently
reviewing the final version of civil rights guidance to be sent to state welfare agencies and other
interested parties. This guidance -- intended for use by welfare caseworkers and other staff --
explains the civil rights laws that apply to federally funded programs and to the workplace, using
clear language and numerous practical examples. As you may recall, civil rights laws apply to
TANF programs as they do to any other federally assisted programs, and they apply to employees
on T ANF just as they do to any other employees. This guidance, prepared by HHS with
assistance from the Departments of Justice, Labor, Education, and Agriculture, will be
distributed shortly.


                                                               Automated Records Management System
                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion
Division is involved in negotiations over proposed expansions of predominantly
Africa-American charter schools in East Baton Rouge, Louisiana. East Baton Rouge is a 56,000
student school district under a longstanding desegregation case, and two thirds of the district's
students are African-American. Last week, the East Baton Rouge School District asked the
Justice Department to sign on to ajoint motion requesting the Court to approve expansions at
each school-- currently enrolling just under 100 students each -- by one additional grade next
year. The Justice Department has previously expressed concerns about the impact of the
proposed expansions on efforts to desegregate other schools in the district and on the district's
ability to comply with the desegregation decree, but has made clear that they are open to
supporting the expansions if they receive information from the school district that addresses their
concerns. The information requested by the Justice Department --which has not yet been
supplied -- includes information on the projected racial composition of the schools' student
population, the impact of the schools on the racial composition of other schools from which
students are drawn, assurances that the location and size of the schools will not be changed
without Court approval, and a determination by the school board that the expansions will not
impede the ability of the district to comply with the consent decree. While the Justice
Department is open to supporting the expansions, their specific concerns appear to be that that
the charter school expansions might 1) draw minority students from predominantly white schools
(or perhaps white students from predominantly minority schools), thereby causing a few schools
that are now marginally desegregated to become one-race schools, or 2) take away funding from
the school district that would impede its ability to make the improvements in one-race schools
that are required under the consent decree (e.g., wiring schools, fixing the school building).
Amidst rumors in East Baton Rouge that the Justice Department is going to oppose the
expansions, Clint Bolick and the Institute of Justice may be preparing to file a lawsuit on behalf
of the two charter schools. Meanwhile, a private foundation may also step in to support the new
grades at these schools as private schools, given concerns that their expansion as public schools
may not be approved.

Bill Lee is recused from the case because of his prior involvement with the NAACP legal defense
fund, which is also a party to the consent decree. But after Clint Bolick wrote a Wall Street
Journal editorial suggesting that Bill Lee not be confirmed because of this and other charter
school cases, Senator Landrieux requested and received briefings on this case from the Justice
Department. This week, Education Department Assistant Secretary Norma Cantu was asked by
a House Oversight committee to testify on charter schools and desegregation at a June 22 hearing
that will also deal with high-stakes testing issues.

       7. Education - Troops to Teachers: The Defense authorization bill passed by the
Senate includes a provision that would continue the Troops to Teachers program, however the
provision differs from your ESEA proposal in a few important ways. Most importantly, the
Defense bill does not include the "transition to teaching" provisions, which would allow the



                                                           Automated Records Management System
                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion
high-need subjects in high-poverty schools. A SAP noting our objections, and suggest
modifications to address them, is currently being drafted for Defense conferees.

In addition, next week Congressmen Roemer and Davis will be introducing a Troops to Teachers
bill which is essentially the same as the provision in your ESEA proposal.

         8. Education - School Uniforms: You requested an update on the number of school
districts adopting school uniform policies. The Department of Education has not collected new
data on this practice since July 1998. At that time, you announced that the Department of
Education estimated that 3% of all public schools had mandatory school uniform policies --
including New York City, Dade County (Miami), San Antonio, Houston, Chicago, Boston and
Albuquerque. Since the Department's last report, the adoption of school uniforms has been
proposed statewide in Massachusetts, and all principals in DC public schools are considering
adopting a mandatory school uniform policy. Education is currently updating this data and will
have a new report on the pace of adoption of school uniform policies by XX date.

         9. Education -- Republican Teacher Empowerment Act/Class Size: Republicans
have introduced a teacher quality bill (McKeon) that has some similarities to your Title II
(teacher quality) proposal of ESE A, particularly a focus on sustained, high-quality professional
development and an effort to improve alternative routes to teacher certification.        However, the
bill's attempt to address class size reduction is problematic. The McKeon bill does not provide a
separate funding stream for class size reduction, does not target the reduction toward the early
grades, and would allow districts to opt out of class size reduction activities for a multitude of
reasons (e.g., lack of facilities or qualified teachers) and use the funds for other purposes. The
bill's language also appears to preclude federal funding for the National Board for Teacher
Certification. The current expectation is that the bill will be marked up in committee before the
end of the month. On Friday, Education staff will meet with Congressional staff (Goodling,
McKeon, Clay, Martinez) to try and work out differences on the bill. Education staff will stress
that in order for us to support this bill, it must include continuation of the bipartisan class size
program and support for the national board for teacher certification.

         10. Education - Social Promotion in Los Angeles: On Monday, officials of the L.A.
Unified School District unveiled their plan to end social promotion and launch intervention
programs for 139,000 students in danger of being held back in June 2000. The $71 million
initiative will use results of the Stanford 9 and teacher's assessments to identify and enroll tens of
thousands of students in voluntary summer school, after school and weekend classes. Generally,
all students in grades 2,3,4,5, and 8 (with appropriate exceptions for LEP and disabled students)
will be expected to meet minimum standards in reading, language arts and math. Community
response has been extremely positive, with parents overwhelmingly in favor of the effort, and
7,000 teachers applying to provide the special instruction.

                                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion
Thursday, the three Medicare policy payment advisors to the Congress (CBO, GAO, and the
Medicare Payment Advisory Commission) testified before the Senate Finance Committee on
their views about the validity of health care provider complaints about the Balanced Budget Act
of 1997. Notably, all three concluded that there was insufficient evidence that the BBA had
caused significant access and quality problems and that moves to repeal or moderate the law
would be premature. While acknowledging the Medicare baseline had declined significantly, they
uniformly attributed the vast majority of that decline to success in curbing fraud and abuse, a
better than expected economy with lower inflation, and some payment cycle issues that were
short term in nature. The one exception appeared to be concerns about the physical therapy cap
policy (which we opposed) that Chairman Thomas (R-CA) had inserted in the legislation at the
end of the conference. This testimony will somewhat reduce the pressure to put significant BBA
giveback provisions in your Medicare reform initiative. However, recognizing the serious
concerns that are continuing to be raised by providers, we still are reviewing options that will
send signals to this community that we want to work with them to moderate any excessive
burdens on their ability to provide affordable, accessible, quality care to Medicare beneficiaries.

         12. Update on Privacy Legislation: Next Tuesday, Senate Labor Committee Chair
Jeffords is scheduled to hold a markup on the privacy legislation. While there are a number of
issues that remain unresolved, the two major provisions that continue to be the major barrier to
progress are the enforcement mechanism and protection provisions for minors. As has been the
case in many health care bills this year, the issue that frequently stands in the way of bipartisan
consensus is that related to enforcement and the ability to obtain remedies for those harmed by
violators of the legislation. The current language raises the privacy act standard to willful and
intentional rather than willful or intentional; moreover, it appears that the RepUblicans are
pressuring Senator Jeffords to eliminate punitive awards and limit non-economic awards to
$50,000. These provisions clearly weaken privacy protections and would be viewed by all the
Democrats to be unacceptable. The minors' issue has been raised by both the pro-choice and
pro-life communities because they have concerns about how this provision will impact on
teenagers' ability to access abortion services without parental consent. Both sides claim they
want to maintain the status quo, but neither believes the current language achieves that end.
Senator Jeffords is attempting to work out a compromise between the women's groups and the
Catholic Health Association; ifhe does before Tuesday, it appears likely that he will mark-up the
legislation and see ifhe can get further compromises on enforcement at the mark-up and at later
stages in the process. We are currently reviewing compromise positions on the enforcement issue
to prepare for the eventual negotiations that we must have with the Republican leadership on this
Issue.
