MEMORANDUM FOR JOHN PODESTA

THROUGH:           Jacob J. Lew
                   Sylvia Mathews

FROM:      Don Arbuckle

SUBJECT:           Heads-Up Clearance of Regulations

        Within the next several days we will be clearing four high profile
regulations.

DO            Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) final regulation from
HHS

        We have completed our review of the Department of Health and Human
ServiceD,s (HHSD,) Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF)
regulations on Friday, March 26th. This final rule implements the 1996
welfare reform statute. The TANF rule as proposed in November 1997,
generated significant criticism from States and advocates for poor
families. They argued that the proposal was overly burdensome, discouraged
State innovation, and demonstrated a mistrust of how States will exercise
the discretion that the statute intended to provide.  In response to these
comments, HHS has revised the final rule significantly to increase
flexibility and reduce burden while maintaining accountability.

        The final rule will likely receive significant attention.
Reaction is expected to be mostly favorable given the changes from the
NPRM, although the rule could still receive criticism for excessive
requirements on States. A rollout is being planned by DPC for mid-April.

DO            OFHEO Risk Based Capital Regulation

        OMB completed its review of the Office of Federal Housing
Enterprise Oversight Risk-Based Capital Regulation for Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac on Thursday, March 25th. The rule was sent to the. Hill
Friday afternoon, March 26th. At about the same time, OFHEO issued a
press release.  Congress will have 15 calendar days to comment on the rule
before it is published in the Federal Register and the public will have
120 days after that to comment on the proposed rule.

        The rule specifies the risk-based capital stress test that will
determine the amount of capital each Enterprise is required to hold to
maintain positive capital throughout a ten-year period of economic
stress. There is great interest in Congress and the financial community
in seeing the proposed rule and determining its impact on the Enterprises
and mortgages markets.  Fannie Mae has publically expressed concern about
the possible impact on its operations and mortgage markets, while Freddie
Mac has called for its publication.




DO        Workforce Investment Act (WIA) Regulations from DOL

        On Thursday, March 25th.OMB completed its review of the Department
of LaborD,s (DOL) interim final regulation implementing the Workforce
Investment Act (WIA) of 1998. Based on the PresidentD,s G.I. Bill for
AmericaD,s Workers proposal, WIA reforms and streamlines the nation's
employment and training system by consolidating numerous publicly funded
job training and employment .programs.  Key WIA reforms include the
development and implementation of a network of one-stop centers that
provides a central point of entry to services, and individual.training
accounts, or vouchers, to finance adult training.

        The interim final rule may receive some attention from locally
elected officials who have lobbied DOL for a greater role in the
governance of the system. Also, members of both the minority and majority
on Hill sent a letter to the President (11/24/98) stressing the importance
of coordination between the Federal agencies in providing services though
the one-stop.  In response to this letter, DOL conducted extensive
consultations with its Federal partners and State and locals in developing
this interim final rule, and will continue this consultative process
during WIA implementation, which begins on July 1, 1999. DOL expects to
publish a final rule in December 1999.

DO        DOL D&HelpersD8 Regulation

        OMB will be completing its review of the Department of LaborD,s
proposed D&helpersD8 regulation during the early part of the week of
March 29th. The proposed regulation governs the use of semi-skilled
helpers, who assist skilled journeymen on Davis-Bacon construction
projects.  The proposal would place into regulation the DepartmentD,s
current policy of strictly limiting the use of helpers. This issue has
been the subject of Congressional riders and court decisions over the past
15 years, which for all but a short period in 1992-93 also had the effect
of strictly limiting the use of helpers on Federal construction contracts.

Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns on any of these
regulations.
