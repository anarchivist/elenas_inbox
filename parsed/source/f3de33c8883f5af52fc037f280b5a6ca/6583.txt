MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:          BRUCE REED
               ELENA KAGAN

RE:            INS Structural Reform



       In its final report to the Congress last fall, the United States Commission on Immigration
Reform (CIR) called for significant reforms to our nation's immigration system, including
dismantling the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) and reallocating its major
functions to other Federal agencies. The FY 98 Commerce, Justice, State (CJS) legislation
required the Attorney General to report back to the Congress on the CIR proposal by April 1.

        The DPC worked with interested White House staff, including OMB, NSC, OPL, and
White House Counsel, and led a thorough review process of the CIR's recommendations and
other INS reform proposals. Our process included meetings with representatives from the
Department of Justice, the INS, the Department of State, the Department of Labor, the CIR, and
immigrant advocacy groups. Our goal is to have a plan ready for the Justice Department to
present in response to the April I deadline.

       Based on this process, we recommend two things: (1) reject the CIR proposal to
dismantle the INS; and (2) restructure the INS to create a clear separation of immigration
enforcement and service operations.

Discussion

1.     Reject the CIR proposal to dismantle the INS.

        The CrR criticized that the INS's dual responsibility of welcoming immigrants who enter
legally and deterring those who attempt to enter or stay illegally has resulted in "mission
overload." The major thrust of their proposed reform would move all immigration service
functions to the Department of State, and would consolidate all immigration enforcement into a
new federal law enforcement agency within the Justice Department.

        There were serious concerns raised by nearly everyone consulted about the State
Department's ability to assume all of INS' current immigration service operations. Such a
substantial shift of responsibilities across agencies could require a six or seven-year transition,
thereby exacerbating the existing concerns about long delays in processing basic immigration
services. The State Department echoed these concerns, in part because they are currently in the
process of absorbing two other agencies: the United States Information Agency (USIA) and the

                                                                 Automated Records Management System
                                                                 Hex:Dump Conversion
domestic focus of many of INS's services conflicts with the State Department's foreign policy
mission. In addition, immigration advocates raised strong objections to moving responsibility
for visa allotment decisions and naturalization to the State Department, primarily due to the
non-reviewability of consular decisions.

         Both the CrR and the legislation introduced by Congressman Reyes propose
consolidation of all immigration enforcement -- Border Patrol, inspectors and investigators -- at
a newly-created agency within the Justice Department. This would elevate immigration
enforcement to a level similar to the FBI or DEA. However, rather than strengthening
immigration enforcement, this change could weaken it. Effective enforcement depends, in
part, on close communication and coordination with the service operations. For example, an
immigrant's status can often change from a person receiving benefits to one suspected of illegal
activity; thus, an enforcement agent must be able to easily coordinate and share data with service
officers. Housing enforcement and services in separate agencies could hinder the coordination
and communication necessary to maintain the integrity and effectiveness of enforcement
operations. Advocates were also concerned that the creation of a separate immigration
enforcement agency would leave a stand-alone immigration services agency politically
vulnerable.

       Thus, given these concerns, we recommend that we reject the CIR's proposal to move
immigration service operations to the State Department and consolidate immigration
enforcement operations at the Justice Department.

2.     Restructure the INS to create a clear separation of immigration enforcement and service
       operations.

        There was a consensus reflected in both the reform proposals considered and among those
consulted, that a separation of immigration service and enforcement operations would
significantly improve the current immigration system. We believe that a clearer delineation
between the functions could yield many benefits, including: (1) strengthening accountability by
creating a direct line of authority within each function between headquarters and the field; (2)
improving efficiency and effectiveness by allowing the service and enforcement operations to
focus on the unique management, knowledge, skills, and abilities required to carrY out these
distinct functions; and (3) establishing a more substantial career path for both agents and service
officers, thereby improving professionalism and retention.

        We have also concluded that retaining some linkage between enforcement and
services helps both functions work together to accomplish our overall immigration policy
goals. To perform effectively, INS's service function must have ready access to the data
collected by immigration enforcement officers. Similarly, enforcement must be adept at
understanding services eligibility to ensure standard enforcement of our immigration laws.

       We believe that we can achieve the benefits of separation and coordination by effecting a
dramatic restructuring within the INS. This could be done by creating two distinct lines of

                                                                   Automated Records Management System
                                                                   Hex-Dump Ccnversicn
headquarters. Under this model, each function could be organized in a way best suited to its
core responsibility. Enforcement operations could be organized regionally (i.e., Southwest
border; Northwest border, etc.), while the benefits operations could be located around centers of
high immigrant concentrations.

         Our FY 99 budget indicated our intention to more clearly separate enforcement from
services within the agency, which has received generally positive feedback from the Hill. We
are also aware that the Carnegie Endowment is preparing a report on INS reform to be released
later this month. Their report will support our preliminary conclusions by rejecting the CIR and
Reyes proposals, and instead recommending a restructuring within the INS that effects a clear
split between service and enforcement operations.

Congressional Interest

        We have started to meet with key Hill staff to understand where the Congress may be
headed on the INS reform issue. It has been reported that there is considerable interest by the
Congress to overhaul the INS, and major reforms could be included in the FY 99 CJS
appropriations legislation. Chairman Rogers of the House CJS appropriations committee has
been trying to gamer support to dismantle the agency along the lines of the CIR
recommendations.

       Other key Republicans, such as Senators Abraham and Gregg, and Representative Lamar
Smith, though open to making significant changes to the agency, have indicated an unwillingness
to completely dismantle the INS. At this time,' though no agreement exists on how to proceed
with INS reform, there appears to be some bipartisan support for greater separation between
immigration enforcement and services.

Recommendation

       We recommend that we continue to move forward to develop a reform model that clearly
separates enforcement and service operations within the INS. The Department of Justice has
contracted with a consulting firm to assist in developing a plan to operationalize this model for
our consideration .. We will receive their final report within the week. We also intend to
continue to work with Congress in an effort to build consensus on this issue.

       Apart from these primary recommendations on restructuring INS, we also plan to address
the widespread concerns about duplication, overlapping responsibilities, and problems of
coordination between the INS and the Departments of Labor and State.
