  TEXT:
  Even though you haven't sent any memo to president re options on exec
  order on police brutality, apparently there's a desire (at least in some
  people's heads) to have vp announce when he addresses very large NAACP mtg
  in detroit on Sat (this is 10,000 people).   We've always talked about
  this as a Presidential event--especially since all the pressure is on the
  President to be seen speaking on this issue--What's your recommendation
  (assuming of course that this is actually resolved before Friday)?

  1.   Bradley is giving a race speech today, about Diallo, etc.

  2.  Elaine is enthusiastic about VPOTUS announcing executive order on
