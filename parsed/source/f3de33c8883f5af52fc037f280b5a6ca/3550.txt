TEXT:
Good meeting. OPM was very pleased.    On cessation and bargaining, simple
langauge changes -- (1) affirming agency heads discretion to fund
cessation programs and (2) clarifying that areas of flexibility can be
subject to collective bargaining -- would go a long way to addressing
their concerns. We could be more directive     (e.g. agency heads SHOULD
CONSIDER funding smoking cessation programs) .    Should I draft some
specific language with OPM?

Re. indoor air -- that's messy.  I refrained from seeking empathy for my 4
years breathing the air at Waterside Mall. Do you want me to check into
what we might say, if anything, on the issue?   I highly doubt it will
make sense to put anything in the EO itself.
