TEXT:
1. schools.    the NEA resolution in favor of peer review is strong on
helping teachers with counseling etc., but it also explicitly
acknowledges the possibility of termination, noting, for instance, that
after extensive assistance there may be a "recommendation to intitiate
nonrenewal or termination proceedings .... " "Mike and I have talked about
this and I think we should look hard at this as a jumping off point for a
method to endorse for weeding out weak teachers.     It is obviously
politically tricky, but it may be significant enough to be worth pushing
on ... as is the case with failing schools. ( we have memos on the NEA
resolution if you want) ...

2.  fyi. sidney b. said he's thinking about what to focus on and asked if
there was specifc issues you thought he should be working on, i said i
would pass it along ...

3. brady.   this really is an offensive issue for us, if even a few other
states drop it, it would be a strong radio address.
