MEMORANDUM TO THE PRESIDENT

FROM:                   Jacob J. Lew

SUBJECT:                Naturalization Backlog -- Congressman Becerra

Purpose: Congressman Xavier Becerra (D-CA), who will be on your flight back from New
Mexico, may speak to you regarding the backlog of naturalization applications at the
Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) and the Administration's proposed increase in the
naturalization application fee. Immigrant advocates are upset that INS continues to provide poor
service and that the naturalization backlog continues to grow -- yet applicants will have to pay
more under the new INS fee schedule. Congressman Becerra agreed to call off planned protests
on this issue by immigration advocates that were to occur at the Social Security Conference and
has indicated a willingness to work with us to develop a plan to address this problem.

Background: Many immigration advocates have expressed serious concerns over the
naturalization backlog and INS' proposed immigration service fee increases -- primarily
naturalization. The dramatic increase in naturalization applications (from 540,000 in FY 1994
to almost 1.6 million in FY 1997), along with the dedication of substantial resources over the
past nine months to implement quality assurance, has resulted in an increase in the number of
pending applications. As of the end of May 1998, nearly 1.9 million were pending. Currently,
most applicants are experiencing a wait of 18-24 months.

        The naturalization program is funded through application fees. The immigrant advocates
have been asking for a one-time allocation of funds (either through a budget amendment or
reprogramming) to assist with backlog reduction efforts. At the same time, the Administration is
planning to issue a regulation (with an October 1, 1998, effective date) that would increase fees
for the provision of immigrant services, including naturalization (from $95 to $225). This fee
increase would more accurately reflect the actual cost of processing an immigrant service
application for benefits.

        Your FY 1999 budget projects a reduction in average waiting time for a naturalization
applicant from the current 18 to 24 months to 10 to 12 months by the end of FY 1999. This
change was expected to result primarily from a Department of Justice sponsored re-engineering
of the naturalization process. These projections were based on INS' estimates of an average of
1.6 million new applications in FY 99, enhanced productivity, and other factors. The INS now
estimates that it will receive a total of 850,000 naturalization applications in FY 1998 and
700,000 in FY 1999 -- 46% fewer than prior estimates. This reduction in application levels
translates into an estimated $99 million revenue loss in FY 1998 and a $302 million revenue loss
                                                                          Hex.Dump Conversion


in FY 1999. This significant change in expected revenue has required the INS to reevaluate and
prioritize base program funding and planned enhancements for backlog reduction and process
re-engmeenng.

        The Domestic Policy Council and OMB staff have been working with INS to develop a
plan to achieve progress in reducing the backlog using current revenue projections, including the
anticipated increase in the naturalization fee. The plan provides for both management and
process improvements to tackle the backlog and improve customer service. This plan, to be
implemented by October 1, 1998, would: (1) implement organizational improvements such as
merging the existing office of naturalization into INS' management structure to increase
accountability by district directors; (2) implement selected Coopers & Lybrand process
recommendations (such as improving customer service and moving the English and civics testing
to the beginning of the naturalization process); and (3) provide for backlog reduction "SWAT"
teams (to focus backlog reduction efforts in the five cities -- including Los Angeles -- that handle
65% of the naturalization workload). OMB has also evaluated the INS' current budget
projections and will work with INS to identify ways to generate more revenue (through
reallocation or reprioritization of resources) for the naturalization effort.

                    Naturalization Backlog Reduction Talking Points
                 for a Potential Conversation with Congressman Becerra

·   We agree that the growing backlog is unacceptable. The Administration is committed to
    both management reforms and providing the resources necessary to reduce waiting times.
    In the past year, the INS has implemented several reforms to the naturalization process
    that are designed to expedite processing, while maintaining integrity. .However, we
    recognize that there are enormous challenges ahead and we are committed to addressing
    those challenges expeditiously.

·   Our FY 1999 budget anticipates significantly reducing the waiting time for naturalization
    applicants. However, the INS has recently determined that it expects a 46% reduction in
    naturalization applications in FY 1999. Such a reduction changes both revenues and the
    rate at which the pending caseload increases. OMB and the Domestic Policy Council
    have worked with INS to reassess INS' backlog reduction strategy in light of these new
    projections. Our goal is to have these management and process reforms in place by
    October 1, 1998.

·   We recognize that in some cases the anticipated increase in the application fee will create
    a hardship. We will make sure that any proposal to increase the fee is accompanied by a
    waiver for those for whom the burden is too much. However, given the budget realities,
    an increase in the fee is the best way to reduce the backlog.
