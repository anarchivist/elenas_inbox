TEXT:
The VP is booked so Elaine Kamarck will speak. To accomodate Elaine's
schedule, the meeting will now begin at 10:30. We are still waiting on
Sec. Shalala, but it looks good. This will basically be a rah rah type of
meeting to thank the small agencies for participating, talk about the
importance of the welfare to work "movement", and get them excited about
hiring welfare recipients.

Bruce--you, Elaine and Sec. Shalala will speak followed by James King.
We'll then have a couple of small agencies with good plans present their
plans.  It will be pretty straight forward.
