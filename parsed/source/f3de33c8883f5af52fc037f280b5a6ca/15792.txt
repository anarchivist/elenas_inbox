TEXT:
Well, that's an interesting question.  I'd rather they did not have a
formal role. But, one of the ED's major responsibilities is to assist the
Advisory Board with administrative matters and brief them on an ongoing
basis of the results of the staff's work.  I think I'm going to discuss
with Cheryl whether she thinks the ED needs to have a formal role set up
with the AB in order to carry out these functions.
