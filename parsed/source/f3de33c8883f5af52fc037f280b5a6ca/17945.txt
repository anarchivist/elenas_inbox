TEXT;
The high performance bonus regulation is not ready yet. HHS is concerned
that we are now in the first year whose performance is supposed to be
measured ('99 grants will be based on '98 performance), and states have
nothing to go on. Even if the reg is published in the next few months, it
will be "proposed" and therefore not binding in any way.

Therefore, HHS wants to issue guidance very soon that will govern this
year, but not later years.  They have sent us a draft and want our
comments ASAP.

They propose 6 measures -- actually 3 items where they would measure both
absolute performance and improvement in performance;

1.   job entry rate                          4.  increase in job entries
2.   job retention rate             5.   increase in job retention
3.   gain in earnings               6.   improved earnings gains

HHS would let states use whatever data they had handy to measure these.
They still want to pursue requiring UI data, but acknowledge that that
will have to be part of the reg.    These are baSically the same measures
they developed this summer with NGA, etc., minus teen pregnancy. Any
guidance? HHS is pushing us hard for a reaction.   I know you had earlier
raised points about whether workfare counts as a job (we'll check), were
skeptical about the earnings gain measure, and thought simpler was better.
