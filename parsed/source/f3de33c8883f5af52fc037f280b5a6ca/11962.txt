This is just a reminder that I will be on leave beginning on Monday, March
29 and will return to the office on Tuesday, April 13.   I very much
appreciate your understanding and allowing me to take this leave for a
trip that my husband and I had planned for some time.  I will leave you a
status report on issues that are pending and contact persons for those
issues.    I also will leave a phone number where I can be reached.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks again.
