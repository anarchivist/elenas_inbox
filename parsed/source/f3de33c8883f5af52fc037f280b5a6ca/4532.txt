TEXT:
Yesterday, the Senate Banking and Urban Affairs Committee passed by a vote
of 11 to 7, a Moseley-Braun amendment creating a Welfare-to-Work program.
The Senate's version of program would authorize annual appropriations of
$100 million annually.  Senator Mosely-Braun indicated that the program
would be a 50-50 match and competitive, and stressed that local
communities would make the decisions.
