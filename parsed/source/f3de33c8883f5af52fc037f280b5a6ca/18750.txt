Subject:         FAR/SBA Affirmative Action Rules

You asked, under the Congressional Review Act, to which committees the SBA
and FAR rules go. You also asked the process for Congress voting on them
during the 60-day hold-over period.

Under the Congressional Review Act (CRA) , the agency is to send the rule
to the Speaker of the House, the President of the Senate, and the GAO.
The Speaker/President is to send the rule to the "standing committee of
jurisdiction", i.e., the authorizing committees.

The SBA rules, I assume but do not know, go to the House and Senate Small
Business Committees.

The FAR rules, issued jointly by DOD, NASA, and GSA, would presumably go
to the pertinent authorizing committees -- namely, Senate Armed Services
(DOD), Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation (NASA), Senate
Governmental Affairs (GSA), House Government Reform and Oversight (GSA),
House National Security (DOD), and House Science (NASA).

The OFPP publication of the Commerce Dept. bench marks would also have to
go to the Speaker and the President of the Senate, and then to Senate
Governmental Affairs and House GRO as well.

The timing of what happens under the CRA is a bit tricky.


          First, the 60-day delay in effective date for a "major" rule is
calendar days, and has nothing, statutorily, to do with when Congress can
vote to disapprove a regulation.    (Statutorily, the delay in effective
date and the disapproval procedures are not linked.    In practical terms,
it presumably is easier to disapprove a rule that has not yet taken
effect. )

        The expedited procedures under which Congress can vote to
disapprove a regulation are a bit tricky.  (Congress is always able
under the normal legislative process -- to vote any disapproval it wants,
e.g., the nullification of the long-time-ago FDA saccarine prohibition.)

In summmary, if the applicable deadlines are met, the Senate can move free
of a filibuster; the House has no special procedures until the Senate
passes a resolution of disapproval ..

                A Member of either House has 60 days (excluding any days
that either House is adjourned for more than 3 days during a session of
Congress) to introduce a joint resolution of disapproval.  (Joint
resolutions are like legislation, in that they are submitted to the
President for signing or possible veto.)

                ((I ignore the special procedures available for
regulations submitted to Congress 60 session or legislative days before
the end of a Congressional session -- roughly late April to early June,
depending on the date of final recess)).

                Then, in the Senate, there are expedited procedures which
need to be implemented within "60 session days" of the submission of the
rule to Congress (or publication of the rule in the Federal Register,
whichever is earlier).

In othe:r; words, a "major" rule cannot take effect for 60 days of
submission of the text to the Senate, the House, and GAO (or publication
in the Federal Register) or publication in the Federal Register, which
ever is later.    For a period somewhat longer than that, a Member is able
to introduce a joint resolution of disapproval, which -- to avoid a
possible Senate filibuster-- has to move ahead within 60 session days of
the submission date (generally earlier than publication date -- because
agencies generally send the final rules to the Congress and the Federal
Register on the same date) .    Given current timing, Congress would have to
move by relatively late this Session to disapprove these rules under the
expedited procedure.    ((By June or so, the disapproval process presumably·
would rollover until next year.))

How, exactly, all this would happen is not clear -- Congress has not yet
tried to implement the detailed procedures.

If you have any questions about this, please call (395-3176).
