TEXT:
It appears that this mysterious legislative language is targeted at the
concern of the Lamar Smith-types that some pregnant women who are
undocumented deliberately cross the border in order to have their children
in the US, making them US citizens. We believe that this language must
have been added by a member of Congress who was seeking to defuse this
issue by saying that the federal government should pay for such labor and
delivery costs.
