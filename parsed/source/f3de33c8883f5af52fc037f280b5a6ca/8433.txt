TEXT:
Some good new and some me.diocre from Treasury on several issues I have
been working on. They are working hard on getting Child Care in on the
Low Income Housing Tax Credit piece, but they are taking. the easy route
off on EFT, making it an almost completely voluntary program.

Paul, sorry that Cliff and I missed your meeting. We were quadriple
booked.  Please give me a call to let me know how things went.

On your CDFI question:

The Fund has held two rounds of CDFI awards totaling $80 million, to 81
CDFls. The third round applications have been received, and awards will
be made before the end of September.

The Fund has held two rounds of BEA awards totaling $30 million to 92
institutions. The third round applications have been received, and
awards will be made before the end of September.

The Fund has also held one Presidential Awards for Micro-Enteprise
round.  The second round i~ underway, and awards will be made before
the end of calendar year 1998.

The Fund has also launched a $5m technical assistance round, focused
on building the capacity of smaller, newer CDFls, with awards to be
made before the end of September. The Fund will soon launch a $15m
   ·
training procurement, focused on building the capacity of the field to
provide t.a. to CDFIs, with decisions before the end of September.

The Fund will spend approx. $92m by the end of the fiscal year, leaving
approx. $18m to carryover to FY 1999 (no funds will lapse), to begin
funding program rounds that will be obligated in FY 99.

The Appropriations subcommittees have both issued chairman's marks.
The Senate at $55m; House at $80m.  They will not complete their work
until likely in September, as part of a larger budget package.

On your Fair Lending question:

We sent in our joint letters on Reg. B and Reg. C.  The Fed. received
hundreds of comment letters. Our position was supported by large
banks, community and consumer groups; our position was opposed by a
number of smaller banks. The Fed. is unlikely to issue a proposed rule
until this fall at the earliest. We continue to monitor this closely.

On low income housing tax credit:

In the Senate, there are 57 cosponsors. The House has 239. We tried to
get the credit put on the IRS restructuring bill, but failed.  We'll try
again
on the next likely vehicle, an extenders bill later this summer. Also, we
have agreement on child care facilities being eligible for credits.

On EFT '99:

We will issue a press release today on the EFT '99 regulation governing
waivers, basically saying we're treating this as a near voluntary
program. We expect to issue the regulation in July.   On the ETA
accounts, which is where we might be doing some good that we'd like to
play up, we expect to issue a proposed account structure in July.

On CRA:

We expect a heated fight on our CRA-lite credit union provisions and on
a likely Shelby CRA small bank exemption amendment.   We've been
strategizing to be sure we're ready for such a fight.

On IDAs:

I'd still like to see Treasury administer this program, so that we can
link it
with financial institutions policy, EFT '99, CDFI and our saving agenda.
Please weigh in.
