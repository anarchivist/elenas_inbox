Subject:         Re: GAO numbers

Lisa is sending me the document with GAO numbers.   She said that we should
not let anyone know that we got the document from their office. She and
Sabrina felt that the document was distributed so widely at their meeting
that they don't see a problem in widening that circle at bit more.   She
did say, however, that GAO warned everyone that they had not put these
numbers through their formal review process, so if we claimed that these
are official GAO numbers, the GAO. will probably deny it, because it didn't
go through their official process. Lisa is still trying to find out who
requested the numbers, and she will get that information to me later.
