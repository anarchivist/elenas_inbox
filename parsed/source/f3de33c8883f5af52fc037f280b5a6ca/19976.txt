              Talking points on the State Tobacco Settlement Funds and Child Care

         The Administration has been negotiating with Senator McCain and the National Governors
Association on the state allocation ofthe tobacco settlement funds. Our negotiations have resulted in
Senator McCain adopting as a manager's amendment a measure that would allocate $12.5 billion over
five years for states to draw from for seven program options, the largest of which is the Child Care and
Development Block Grant. We believe this will result in a significant expansion of child care and that
it is an important first step in our efforts to ensure child care is more affordable, accessible and safe.

·      Tobacco legislation is at risk. If our efforts to reduce teen smoking are going to be
       successful, tobacco legislation must pass the floor of the Senate this week -- before
       Memorial Day. A significant number of Republicans, including the leadership, are
       looking for any and all excuses to walk away from tobacco legislation. Their best cover
       would be NGA opposition to the Senate bill, particularly because the Governors began the
       tobacco suits in the first place. Given the current Congress and the difficulty we have
       encountered in the appropriations process, including child care as part of tobacco legislation
       is an important step to advance child care.

       Where we began: Harkin-Chafee. We had to begin discussions with the NGA with
       Harkin-Chafee language --which is extremely flawed. That legislation gave states 50
       percent outright to spend as they please from the $25 billion overall allocated to the states,
       and only nominally restricted the other 50 percent. In fact, Harkin-Chafee included 20
       program options for the restricted share, including Medicaid and the Social Services
       Block Grant (which does not require a state match).

       What we got: Children's programs. We succeeded in narrowing the list of options for
       the 50 percent restricted funds -- which is $12.5 billion over five years -- to seven
       programs, six of which are exclusively for children. The seventh program, Substance
       Abuse and Mental Health Administration programs, also has a significant focus on youth.
        This entire list is directed at the health and well-being of children and families most in need of
       assistance.

       Child care is the largest program in the spending options. Of the seven spending options,
       the Child Care and Development Block Grant is the single largest program. Thus, if
       states increased all program spending proportionately, child care would receive about $5
       billion in additional Federal funds over 5 years. And compared to other options on the
       list, the child care block grant has a lower match, thereby making it even more attractive
       to states. Therefore, spending on child care could be considerably higher.

·      States have flexibility to spend more. If the demand for child care continues to grow in the
       coming years as more people move from welfare to work under welfare reform, states have the
       flexibility to invest a greater and greater share of overall expenditures on child care.

·      Strong commitment to child care. Under the President's proposal, only one third of his child
       care initiative was to be paid for through tobacco legislation. The Administration strongly
       supports further Congressional action to direct substantial new federal funding to all the
       components of the President's child care initiative, including: subsidies for low income
       working families; child care tax credits for other working families; tax credits for
       business investments in child care; challenge grants to states and communities to improve
                                                             Automated Records Management System
                                                      .      Hex-Dump Conversion
    the quality of child care and early childhood services; grants to schools and communities
    for after-school care; scholarships for child care works; funding for standards
    enforcement; and research and evaluation activities.
