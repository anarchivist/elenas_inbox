TEXT:
It looks like the House and Senate are at or close to a pretty reasonable
deal on the child support incentives bill. The House may pass the
compromise today.  Here are some highlights:

On penalties for failure to have a certified child support computer
system, they found a middle ground.  Penalties would be 4%, 8%, 16%, 25%,
and 30% for years 1-5, respectively, beginning in FY98.
There are two breaks on penalties.' First, if a state cleans up its act
and gets certified during a fiscal year, it would have 90% of that year's
penalty forgiven.  Second, there is a special break for FY98 penalties:
if a state asks HHS to review its computer system by August 1, 1998 and
then gets certified as a result of that review, it would have no penalty
for FY98.
No special help or relief for LA County.
The Cardin amendment will probably get jettisoned. The Senate doesn't
like it.  Cardin is trying to save it, but the House is prepared to
proceed without it if he fails.  (The Cardin amendment would require the
INS to check for particularly egregious child support scofflaws who are
legal immigrants at the border.)
They reached a deal a while back on making it easier to establish medical
support orders.
Andrea will tell us more about the two welfare to work technical changes
DOL is seeking.

The Senate is unlikely to take this up until after the recess, so that may
give LA County some time to try to gin up support in the Senate over the
break.  (procedurally, instead of a conference report, the House will take
up the Senate bill, amend it, and send it to the Senate.)
