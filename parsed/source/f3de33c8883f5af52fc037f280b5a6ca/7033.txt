Subject:         Speech

Here are some other elements that may be of us in the speech.

1. If we pass the President's principles,  58,000 kids in KY.  would be
stopped fom smoking over the next 5 years, between now and 2003, and we
would prevent 19,000 premature deaths in KY over the next 5 years. The
numbers are based on raising privces $1.10, and advertising and marketing
restrictions.


2.   The rate of teen smoking in KY.   We will try and get you tomorrow.

3. We can laud Senator Ford for his hard work on putting this legislation
together. I have some rhetoric on this.  I'm at 65587.
