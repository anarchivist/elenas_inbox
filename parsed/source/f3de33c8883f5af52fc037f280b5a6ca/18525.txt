            HEALTH CARE THAT STRENGTHENS AMERICA'S FAMILIES


Passing Comprehensive Bipartisan Tobacco Legislation That Reduces Teen Smoking and
Changes the Way Tobacco Companies Do Business. Every day 3,000 young people start
smoking and 1,000 of them will die prematurely from a tobacco-related disease. Moreover,
90 percent of adults who smoke began before the age of 18. The President called on Congress to
pass comprehensive national bipartisan legislation that includes five key prinicples: (I) it must
mandate the development of a comprehensive plan to reduce teen smoking, including raising the
cost of cigarettes by $1.50 per pack if that is what it takes to stop children from smoking;
(2) it must affirm the FDA's full authority to regulate tobacco products; (3) it must include
measures to hold tobacco companies accountable, especially for marketing products to children;
(4) it must include concrete measures to improve public health, from investing in research to
reducing second hand smoke to expanding smoking cessation; and (5) it must protect the
financial well-being of tobacco farmers and their communities from the loss of income caused by
our efforts to reduce smoking.

Protecting Patients Through a Consumer Bill of Rights and Genetic Screening Protections.
 The President called on Congress to pass Federally enforceable consumer health care
protections before it adjourns this fall. This health care bill of rights should contain a range of
protections, including guaranteed access to needed health care specialists to ensure that patients
are provided appropriate high quality care, access to emergency room services when and
where the need arises, an assurance that medical records are confidential, and access to a
meaningful internal and external appeals process for consumers to resolve their differences
with their health plans and health care providers. The nation's health care system has
changed dramatically, as more than 100 million Americans are now in managed care plans.
This legislation will ensure that whether Americans have traditional health insurance or
managed care, that they are assured quality care. Moreover, to ensure that new advances
in genetics are used to improve health rather than to discriminate, the President has called
for legislation that ensures that genetic screening is not used to discriminate in health
insurance and employment.

Creating a Historic "21st Century Research Fund" With an Unprecedented 50 Percent
Increase in Biomedical Research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) over five years,
including an unprecedented $1.15 billion increase in FY1999. Scientists are on the cusp of
important new breakthroughs in biomedical research which could revolutionize the way medical
experts understand, treat, and prevent some of our most devastating diseases. New imaging
technologies are giving new insights into the structure of disease and revolutionary progress in
genetics are charting new ways to conquer diseases, such as cancer, Alzheimer's, AIDS, and
brain tumors. The President's budget contains a historic upfront investment in biomedical
research and, for the first time, proposes a sustained investment in NIH over five years which
results in a 50 percent increase. Under the President's proposal, over $20 billion would be
dedicated to biomedical research the NIH in 2003.

     Providing New Options for Americans Ages 55 to 65 to Access Health Insurance, Including
     Buying Into Medicare. Americans ages 55 to 65 are one of the most difficult-to-insure
     populations: they have less access to and a greater risk oflosing employer-based health
     insurance; and they are twice as likely to have health problems. The President's proposal gives
     this vulnerable population three new options to access health insurance by: (I) allowing
     Americans ages 62 to 65 to buy into Medicare, through a premium that ensures that this policy is
     self-financed; (2) providing vulnerable displaced workers 55 and over access to Medicare by
     offering those who have involuntarily lost their jobs and their health care coverage a similar
     Medicare buy-in option; and (3) giving Americans 55 and over who have lost their retiree
     benefits after they retire access to their former employers' health insurance.
