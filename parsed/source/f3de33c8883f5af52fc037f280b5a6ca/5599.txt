TEXT:
Jeremy Travis wanted me to pass along that a program that Bruce had been
interested in, a $5 million a year 5 year plan to miniaturize DNA
technology for use at crime scenes, didn't make it into the OMB passback.
It is in the AG's appeal, and he's hoping Bruce will want to push for it.
He is sending me some background on it.
