TEXT:
I'd like to get the Breaux/Hollings folks in here Thursday at 1pm to
discuss the Breaux alternative.   I think they have made some changes since
I sent around the last draft so I'll get an updated one and get it around
before the meeting.    I've been "painfully" honest with the Senator
himself and his staff and I've told them that his first approach is
really not something we can work off of because our constraints are within
our veto message.   I think they'll be trying to persuade us that their
alternative is worth another look substantively.

Room # TBD.
