MEMORANDUM FOR DISTRIBUTION

FROM:                  STEVE SILVERMAN
                       DIANA FORTUNA

SUBJECT:               Summit Task Forces

Planning for the Administration's involvement in the Philadelphia "Summit for America's
Future," scheduled for April 27-29 in Philadelphia is under way. The first White House
working group meeting will take place Wednesday, March 5 at 3 pm. At that meeting we will
begin to discuss the role of the principals, objectives, message/communication, and
service/volunteer commitments. However, before that meeting your attention is needed on the
following issue.

 "Summit for America's Future" organizers are setting up a series of "Summit Objectives Task
Forces" which will coordinate substantive follow-up from the Summit. We have received the
attached proposed list of Summit Objectives Task Force Chairs and Co-Chairs from the
organizers. While Americorps, led by Harris Wofford, has been consulted on this list, the White
House has not yet had an opportunity to comment. Sylvia suggested that we forward the list to
you for comment. Organizers have suggested that these announcements could be made this
week.

Thus, your attention to this matter as soon as possible is vital. Please call Steve (x6-2572) or
Bruce Reed (x6-6515) with your comments by tomorrow morning and we will forward them.
