                                March 19, 1999 -- DRAFT
                                       POTUS


Q:   Yesterday the Senate firmly rejected an amendment to the supplemental
     appropriations bill that would have ensured states spend half of the tobacco
     settlement funds on programs to prevent tobacco use, promote public health, and
     protect farmers. What do you think of this vote?

A:   I am disappointed that this amendment was not adopted. Without this amendment states
     won't have to spend one penny of the tobacco settlement to reduce youth smoking,
     promote public health, or assist farmers. I strongly oppose giving up the federal share of
     the states' tobacco settlement without any commitment by the states to use these monies
     to prevent youth smoking, protect farmers, improve public health, or assist children. My
     advisers are recommending that I veto the Senate supplemental bill if it is sent to me
     with a rider which gives up the federal share of the settlement without such a
     commitment.

Q:   What are you going to do next on this issue?

A:   Weare going to work with our allies to try to proposed different versions of the language
     which may be more acceptable. This is a critical opportunity to reduce youth smoking
     and improve the health of millions of Americans for decades to come, and we must move
     forward.
