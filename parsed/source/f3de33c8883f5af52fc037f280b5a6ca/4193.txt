TEXT:
There is a project that has promise: Govs Romer and Levitt (Utah) have
started what is essentially a collaboration of 20 or so large western
universities who will be putting their classes on the internet for
students who can then recieve class credit and eventually degrees.
(they've gotten it accredited). 20 western governors have signed on to
it. They really need limited federal help, but it has good implications
for improving worker retraining availability, and eventually expanding the
reach of quality education. Bruce and Mike C., who've met the Govs,    like
the project.  I think it has real potential for a future, large
bi-partisan event. Sidney B. pulled me into a meeting on it.
