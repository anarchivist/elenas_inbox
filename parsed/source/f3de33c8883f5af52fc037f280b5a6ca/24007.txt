Maria -

On Wed 6/2, Janet, Steve and I met with representatives from some of the
advocacy groups on INS Restructuring.   We had a good meeting and they


seemed satisfied where the Administration is on this issue and we will
continue to work together to make sure INS Restructuring occurs in a way
that is consistent with Administration's principals.

They expressed concern that there is a vacuum of leadership on the Hill on
this issue and asked that the Administration take a more visible role on
this issue.

We informed them that we are pushing INS to develop a bold and credible
plan that would withstand any argument that INS is not making fundamantal
changes.    They were also aware of the meeting that Reno is having with
Rodgers to discuss INS Restructuring matteris and we explained that Reno
plans to discuss the Administration's principles of the INS Restructuring
and to lay the groundwork for a working relationship with Rodgers to
develop a plan that would be consistent with both our goals.

They also strongly suggested that the INS restructuring plan be presented
by someone other than the INS and we explained that that the Department of
Justice and the AG herself would be the lead person on this issue.   This
is a preferable approach given Reno's good relationship with Rodgers and
they seemed pleased with that strategy.

The groups informed us that they have sent letters to key members of
Congress on their principles (this letter was attached to the letter they
sent to you) which are quite similar to our principles.   They are also
planning to follow up with Congressional staff meetings with the
Congressional Hispanic Caucus (6/18), states with high immigrant
populations, and key ·members on the House and Senate side particularly
members of the House Appropriations Committee including -
Serrano, Roybal-Allard, and Pastor.

please let me know if you have any questions.   Thanks.

(Janet and Steven - let me know if I left anything out.)

                                        Irene
