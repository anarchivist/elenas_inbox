Jose:   I edited Jon's draft to tighten it up.


 Q: If these findings show that many of our schools are unsafe, why
shouldn't vouchers be given to children in these unsafe schools to go to
the private school of their choice?

A: The most important thing to keep in mind is that we know how to make
all of our schools safer--clear discipline policies that are fairly and
firmly enforced, parental and community involvement, strong partnerships
between schools and police.  The proper response when there are schools
that are unsafe is to implement the practices that work so that all
students can be safe.  Simply sending a few students to other schools and
leaving the rest in an unsafe school is simply no answer.

         You can end the answer there or continue with the longer version
below
We must continue to invest and strengthen our nation's public schools.
This means reducing class size, raising academic standards, modenizing our
schools, creating after-school programs, and connecting schools to the
internet so that all of our children can get the education they need and
deserve.   Vouchers would drain resources from our nation's public schools
-- schools that are attended by 90% of our children -- to subsidize
private schools.   The right way to help children in failing or unsafe
schools isn't to drain those schools of resources -- it is to take drastic
actions to fix and turn around the entire school for the benefit of all of
the children in the school.    We owe it to our children to preserve this
nation's time-honored commitment to public education and our commitment to
provide a good education to all of our children.

I wanted to update the two of you on the Head St?rt quality set-aside.
HHS and OMB are still arguing, and HHS is under significant pressure to
brief the hill on our position on reauthorization.    (Olivia is also
testifying next week.)    After about seven weeks of OMB's thinking about
options, they have proposed; (1) removing the requirement that 50% of
quality funds be used for salary and benefit improvements; (2) requiring
HHS to do an evaluation of the quality set-aside; and (3) changing the
structure of the research reserve.   HHS is fine with 2 and 3, but
adamantly opposes 1.   I have been working with Barbara Chow and told her
 (after our conversation at the staff meeting, Elena) that DPC (and NEC,
according to Chuck Marr) agrees with HHS because changing the salary and
benefit requirement would provoke an unbelievable uproar from labor and
children's advocates as well disturb the delicate balance on the hill that
was reached during the last Head Start negotiations.

I have called Jack Lew to let him know that I think this really needs to
be resolved as soon as possible and that it needs to be resolved in HHS'
favor (although I haven't reached him yet). Nicole will follow this
tomorrow.
