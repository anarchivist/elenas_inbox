TEXT:
I've been talking to Sally Paxton and OMB about the wage data collection
request.  The two sides are in pretty different spots but Josh Gottbaum
realizes saying no is not enough and he suggested we sit down with him,
Sally, and Kitty Higgins to find the common ground which we will set
up.    For her part, Sally Paxton wants to send you and me a brief Labor
has written laying out the whole issue,  I said fine.   My goal is to
solve the problem by getting OMB to be a bit conciliatory -- there is some
common ground on the merits.  I've still got to talk to Sally Katzen who
has been in on this issue.
