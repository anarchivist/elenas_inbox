TEXT:
Do you have few minutes to sit down to discuss next steps on the workplace
religious freedom bill idea? We are at a bit of a crossroads.   Our group
with Bill Marshall, DOJ, and EEOC have put together a draft Adminstration
bill, but there are some complications including some differences with the
constuency groups and when/if to reach out to Coates/Kerry about this.  It
would be helpful if we could sit down with you and Bill Marshall and OPL.
