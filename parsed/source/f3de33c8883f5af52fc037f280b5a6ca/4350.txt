I know you're busy, but let me know if you have any specific concerns
withe Secret Service meeting. I think I'm the lead DPC rep if you're not
going, and Rubin and others will be there.

Also, I spoke to Sylvia about the Race staff calling Michael Deitch to get
preliminary budget info for next year's budget. She and I agreed that
there's no reason why the Race staff should get budget info before the
rest of the White House has seen it and chimed in on its issues. Also,
she and I agreed that talk of the FY 99 budget and Race should be part of
our workgroups and process.  I'll follow-up with Judy's policy deputy, but
wanted you to know.
