TEXT:
A dime of that is what we used to call the upfront payment (which is no
longer upfront, but $2.4b a year spread over 5 years, I think).

For what it's worth, Gary Black's statement on the wires today is 30 cents
a pack by year end, rising to a total increase of 35 cents within 4
years.  Ironically, unlike last year, he's now in the position of trying
to minimize the price impact.
