         TEXT:
         Rep. Marty Meehan sponsored a bill, H.R. 193, that designates 29 miles of
         the Assabet,
         Concord, and Sudbury rivers in Massachusetts as components of the national

"       wild and
        scenic rivers systems, The legislation arose from a grassroots movement
        started over a
        decade ago and hundreds of people have worked extremely hard to make this
        legislation happen.

        This is the very first piece of legislation that Meehan has passed, and he
        is hoping for a
        bill-signing ceremony.  If we can coordinate the timing on receiving the
        bill, what about
        signing this in Boston on April 16? Sen. Kennedy took the lead in the
        Senate and Reps. Olver,
        Neal, McGovern, Frank, Tierney, Markey, Moakley, and Delahunt are all
        cosponsors.
