TEXT:
fyi -- when I got this, I sent him a note back asking if he was planning
to include the amendments adopted in committee.   Would we want him to
prepare both -- managers package and managers package with amendments?

Subject: S. 1415, with technicals



    I am going   to create a new file that will take the Committee
    substitute   (except for title XV) and plug in all the technicals so
    we'll have   a clean electronic yersion if anyone wants to use all or
    part of it   as an amendment to other legislation.

     This will take a couple of days.

     If you want a copy, electronic or hard, let me know.
