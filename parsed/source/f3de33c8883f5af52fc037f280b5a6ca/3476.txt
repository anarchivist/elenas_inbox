TEXT:
Congresswoman Lowey may offer an amendment today prohibiting the use of
federal funds for tobacco crop insurance.  Secretary Glickman sent a
letter to Appropriations Cmt. Chairman Skeen earlier today opposing the
amendment.  Public health groups will support Lowey'S amendment.

Q.      Why is the Administration supporting subsidies for tobacco
growers? Isn't that inconsistent with the President's anti-tobacco agenda?

A.      Crop insurance (including tobacco crop insurance) is an
essential part of the producer safety net envisioned by the
Administration's agricultural policy. The Lowey amendment would have a
detrimental effect on thousands of small farmers and their communities in
the event of a disaster.

While it's a fair question to ask whether the government should subsidize
tobacco growing, we should consider any changes to policies toward tobacco
farmers in a broader context, not bit by bit. We will consider farmers'
concerns in our review of the proposed tobacco settlement.   Today,
Secretary Shalala and Bruce Reed are meeting with Farm Bureau heads from
tobacco states and with Governor Hunt to begin that consultative process.
