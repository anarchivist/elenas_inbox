The email I described   is attached.
Is the recommendation   you mentioned support for the creation a
commission or support   for this bill? DOJ has some concerns about
the breadth of powers   HR 497 would grant to the proposed
commission.

No substanative comments, just a red flag I want to raise as we
think about our position on this bill. The Tribes see this bill
as a fundamental attack on their gaming establishments, and
therefore their sovereignty.  From what I have seen written about
this proposed commission, it makes no distinction between Las
Vegas-style gaming and Tribal Gaming, which funds essential tribal
operations like roads, schools, and health clinics.  If we come
out supporting this commission, which we may have to for various
reasons, we need to be prepared for a HUGE backlash from the
Tribes.  In the wake of our taking so long to invoke the
sovereignty argument on the Gaming Tax issue, this will look like
another example of the Administration not understanding, or not
caring, about Tribal sovereignty. And let me assure you that the
furor over our position on the gaming tax issue is nothing
compared to what will come if we support this act.
