SUBJECT:       New Community Prosecutors Initiative

        Over the past month, we have spoken with the National Institute of Justice (NIJ), the National
District Attorneys Association (NDAA) and the American Prosecutors Research Institute (APR!)
about a new initiative to promote community prosecution as a local crime fighting strategy. For
several years these organizations have been working with the handful of "pioneers" in this area, and
they are eager to work with the Administration to launch a" new initiative to promote community "
prosecution throughout the country. This memorandum outlines such an initiative and recommends
that you include it as part of the FY 1999 Budget and State of the Union.

Background on Community Prosecution

        Community prosection is the natural next step to community policing. Over the past few
years, as thousands of police departments have transitioned from reactive policing to working more
proactively with community residents, new demands have been placed on local prosecutors -- as well
as on the criminal justice system in general. Initially, local police and community residents called on
prosecutors be active participants in their anti-crime coalitions. Usually, they wanted prosecutors to
know their concerns and expected them to focus on prosecuting certain types of offenders. Over
time, however, prosecutors have been increasingly asked to dedicate attorneys to work in the
neighborhoods, to playa role in solving local crime problems and to fundamentally reorient their
emphasis from simply processing cases to taking on quality oflife issues and preventing crimes from
happening in the first place.

        Perhaps the best example of the evolution of community prosecution can be found in
Multnomah County (Portland), Oregon. As part of an overall strategy to revitalize the Lloyd
District of Portland, local business leaders called for a series of private and public responses,
including -- improved lighting, better and more coordinated private security, more police officers and
-- surprisingly -- a special prosecutor assigned to the Lloyd District. When government funding
could not be obtained for a dedicated prosecutor, the local business community raised the money to
pay for a prosecutor themselves. Although this raised legitimate ethical issues and concerned some
in the community, District Attorney Michael Schrunk decided that establishing a one-year,
neighborhood-based pilot prosecution project was in the public interest and accepted the funds on the
condition that -- if the project was a success -- public funding would be made available to similarly
serve all areas ofthe county. Today, Portland has 7 Neighborhood District Attorneys (NDAs). All
attorneys salaries are paid for out of public funds.

               It is worth noting that the community's original request for a dedicated prosecutor was fueled
      by the desire to crack down on recidivist offenders. Moreover, even the senior attorney assigned to
      the Lloyd District originally envisioned his role as prodding "enhanced case processing." That is to
      say, he sought to ensure that perpetrators did not become anonymous in the criminal justice system,
      and that -- during trial and sentencing -- judges were aware of the impact certain criminals had on the
      community as a whole. Within a few months, however, the community began to place non-tradition
      demands on the NDA, expecting him to do something about prostitution, public drinking, drug use
      vandalism, street fights and car prowls. Many of these problems were tied to the transient population
      that illegally camped at a nearby site. The NDA focused his attention on this issue and implemented
      a long-term plan to solve the problem. First, he worked with police to sweep the area. Next, he
      collaborated with local residents to display prominently post "no camping sings" with homeless
      shelter information listed on the reverse side. Based on citizen reports, the NDA would work with
      police officers to quickly respond to new illegal campers at the site. Over time, citizens themselves
      approached new campsites and asked transients to leave. The illegal campsite has now been entirely
      eliminated as a problem.

              Others prosecutors that have embraced community prosecution in some form include: Boston,
      MA; Chicago, IL; Denver, CO; Indianapolis, IN; Kansas City, MO; New York City and Brooklyn,
      NY; Milwaukee, WI; Austin, TX; and Washington, DC (initiated this past year by former U.S.
      Attorney Eric Holder). Most local prosecutors, however, depend primarily -- and nearly half
      exclusively -- on limited county funds for their budgets, and simply do not have the resources to
      pursue community prosecution. In the short-term, with a $100 million in direct grant; the
      Administration will have the ability to reach a majority of the estimated 2,400 prosecutors' offices,
      and to help them join with their police departments and make the transition to community-based
      crime strategies. Over the long-term, however, investing in community prosecutors now will help
      build support among police and prosecutors for future initiatives to promote community-based
      approached in the courts and corrections system.

      Outline of Proposed Initiative

               Similar to the COPS program, this proposal calls for $100 million for FY 1999 (and for each
       of the next 2 fiscal years) for the Attorney General to make direct grants, on a competitive basis, to
     . state and local prosecutors for the following purposes:

              (1) Community Engagement. To substantially increase the number oflocal prosecutors
              interacting directly with members of the community ("community prosecutors" or
              "neighborhood DAs"); and

              (2) Problem Solving. To encourage local prosecutors to reorient their emphasis from the
              "assembly line" processing of cases to solving specific crime and disorder -- or quality oflife
              -- problems in their communities.

              A minimum of 80% of the grant funds ($80 million) would be used to pay for the salaries and
      training costs associated with hiring or reassigning prosecutors to work directly with police and
      community residents. Grants would be for 3 years and pay for a maximum of75% of the costs--
      with the federal share declining over the life of the grant. A maximum of 20% of the grants ($20
                                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion
million) could be used for other non-salary costs, such as:

       - providing specialized training to prosecutors to enhance their problem-solving, conflict
       resolution mediation and other skills needed to work in partnership with the community;

       - developing and implementing innovative programs that permit members ofthe community
       to assist prosecutors in crime control and prevention (i.e., developing new legal tools to close
       down crack houses and citizen-driven search warrants);

       - increasing prosecutors involvement in community activities that are focused on crime
       control and prevention (i.e., coordinating with existing community policing strategies); and

       - developing and establishing new administrative and management systems to facilitate the
       adoption of community-oriented prosecution as an organization wide philosophy.

        Finally, this initiative proposes allocating half of the grant funds ($50 million) to prosecutors'
offices serving populations of 500,000 or more persons and the remaining half ($50 million) to
smaller jurisdictions. This distribution means that sizable grants of $1 million or more could be
made available to a majority of the 130 jurisdictions serving the largest metropolitan areas, and that
smaller grants (about $50,000 to $75,000) could be made available to nearly half the remaining,
full-time prosecutors' offices (of which there are about 1,600 total).
