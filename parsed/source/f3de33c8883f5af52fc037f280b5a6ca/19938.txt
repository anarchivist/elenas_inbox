MEMORANDUM FOR ERSKINE BOWLES

THROUGH:                  Franklin D. Raines

FROM:                     Donald R. Arbuckle

SUBJECT:                  FDA Proposed Rule on "Off-Label" Uses


      We will be concluding review by COB Tuesday of a proposed FDA rule allowing the
dissemination of information on unapproved uses (commonly referred to as "off-label" uses) for
marketed drugs, biologics and medical devices. The proposal implements the off-label
provision of the Food and'Drug Modernization Act of 1997 (FDAMA) which permits
manufacturers to disseminate certain written information on the safety, effectiveness, or benefits
of a product's use that has not yet been approved by FDA. For example, an antibiotic may be
approved by FDA for
use in treating sinus infections but also may be widely used by doctors in treating ear infections --
a use not yet approved for that particular drug. The proposal would require that sixty days
before disseminating the information, manufacturers must first submit to FDA for approval a
complete copy of the information and an application seeking approval for the new use.

      The proposed rule also sets limits on the types of information that manufacturers can
disseminate: it must be in the form of an unabridged medical journal article and must disclose
that the use has not been cleared by FDA. And, the proposal limits who may receive the
information
    doctors and insurance companies, for example, but not individual patients.

       This provision was a key Administration concern during FDA reform that was resolved
during the legislative process. The rule adheres closely to that compromise. While it may gain
some attention in the press, we do not expect it to be highly controversial. FDA is anxious to
publish the proposed rule as soon as possible in order to meet a statutory deadline for publication
of a final rule by November 21 st of this year.

      Please let me know if you have any questions.
