TEXT:
Due to the Secretary Shalala's schedule, and pending any other concerns,
we are recommending that the VP and the Secretary do the tobacco
announcement on FRIDAY instead on WEDNESDAY.

I'd like to still have the conference call Tuesday morning at 9:30 so we
can get started on planning for the event. Thank you.
