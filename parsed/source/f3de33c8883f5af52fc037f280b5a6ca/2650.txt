TEXT:
fyi -- Kohlenberger said their further talking points on this are
basically what Ann Lewis said in the follow-up press briefing.

In terms of what is under development, you may already have gotten details
from Ron Klain, but its sounds like there will be three key elements to
what they have been working with the industry on and that's to be
announced (in the wake of the S.Ct. decision):

1. The software would be included in 95% of new web-browsers; these turn
over quickly, so the market would be covered in a very short time (in
contrast with TV's, where it could take many years)

2. They are working with the industry on how to make multiple different
ratings systems available to families (responding to a problem with the
industry developed rating systems for TV)

3. There will be an enforcement mechanism.
