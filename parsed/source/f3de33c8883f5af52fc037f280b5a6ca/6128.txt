 TEXT:
 Here's a draft answer back to McCain. McCain's letter stressed the need
 for specific Administration legislation.    This is a general answer with an
 explanation of the core elements approach that Tarplin is fine with.
 Tarplin asked that we not specify that it is Donna we would send up to the
 hearings just commit to a representative.==================== ATTACHMENT     1 =======

                                          DRAFT 1/22/98



    Dear Senator McCain,

            Thank you for your letter regarding the need for tobacco legislation to improve the health
    of our nation's youth. I believe comprehensive tobacco legislation offers a unique opportunity
    to impose a system of controls on tobacco companies and limit the devastating effects of
    cigarettes on our nation.

             I agree with you that building a consensus will be critical if we are to enact legislation
    that is in the best interest of the nation. The effort to protect the health of America's youth is not
    a Democratic or Republican issue, but a public health issue, and one of our country's highest
    priorities. I am glad that you have scheduled hearings on this important issue, and I can assure
    you that my Administration will cooperate to the fullest extent possible. I will make appropriate
    representatives of my Administration available for your hearings and to answer any questions you
    might have.

            As you may know, when I announced my plan for comprehensive tobacco legislation, I
    noted five key elements that I said must be at the heart of any national tobacco legislation. I
    took this approach because I wanted to identify the elements that I believe must be at the core of
    the legislation, and then to work closely with you and the rest of Congress to develop bipartisan
    legislation that incorporates these elements. I have told my staff that they should be available to
    meet anytime and anywhere to discuss this issue and provide whatever assistance is useful to
    work with you in reducing teen smoking. I am confident that together we will avoid
    counterproductive partisan disputes and, as you note in your letter, build a vital consensus on this
    issue.

            Again, thank you for your commitment to this legislation. I look forward to working
    closely with you. Together, I believe we will be able to enact comprehensive bipartisan tobacco
    legislation this year.


                                                   Sincerely




                                                                      Automated Records Management System
                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion
