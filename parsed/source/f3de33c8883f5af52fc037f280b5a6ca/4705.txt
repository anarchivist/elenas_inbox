  Robin or I would like to be involved in the meeting.  We received a call
  yesterday from Pat R. at NOWLDF. She is concerned that we are not taking a
  strong stand on FVO and the clarification language and that Senator Murray
  is getting mixed messages. Additionally, we are pulling together
  representatives from State domestic violence programs next week (they are
  scheduled to be in town for meetings) and this issue has come up in the
  planning. Let me know when you are getting together.   thanks

 Elena and Cynthia--if I remember correctly, HHS was working on     some regs
 to address this issue of domestic violence and welfare to work     but we had
 no firm date for publication--shouldn't that still be our plan     as we had
 discussed a couple of months ago rather than pursue the Murray     legislative
 approach?

      1. VPOTUS is doing a welfare to work event today in 450 with Glickman,
      Shalala and USAID, Duffy.

      2. The main focus of the meeting was a discussion on Senator Murray's
      conversation with the White House over a proposed amendment (domestic
      violence) to the Labor/HHS Appropriations bill. Audrey and Robin you may
      want to have a conversation with both Cynthia Rice and Elena. NOWLDF did
      call Elena yesterday.   HHS and DPC were going to regroup this morning to
      discuss what we're doing.
