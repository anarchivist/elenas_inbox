TEXT:
I understand that Jose is working on this and that you are reviewing a
list of invitees; however, there is now a little more urgency in that Al
Sharpton/Rev Jackson are apparently planning some type of press
event/demonstration on Thursday on the subject of police brutality.  I
think figuring out how we respond in the interim to Price will help us
develop press guidance and a response to Thursday's thing--so can we do
this tomorrow--Chuck is also expressing some concern and urgency.

I believe Jose and Laura are in the midst of putting together a meeting
for sometime this week.
