TEXT:
I just talked with David Frank of the Education Department and Pat
Forgione re the NAEP release, scheduled for 8/28. We agreed that Pat
would talk to his board about moving their release to 9:00 am on 8/30, to
be followed by the President's radio address. Pat will explain the reason
as a way to get more attention for the report; releasing it on Thursday
8/28 would mean the Friday paper of Labor Day weekend -- not a great hit.
Waiting until 8/30 increases the chance we can get Sunday coverage --
still Labor Day but Sunday is a lot better and the
radio address can really bump it up.
      If asked by their press why they are moving to Saturday morning -
not their expected release date - they would explain it was an effort to
get more attention .
    Pat asked how sure we were that this would be the President's topic. I
said 95 %-- that given the legislative situaiton, and the fact that this
is one of our best opportunities before Congress comes back, this would be
a go unless we had some really unexpected event .
