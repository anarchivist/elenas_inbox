PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
REMARKS ON CHILDREN, VIOLENCE AND MARKETING
THE ROSE GARDEN
June 1, 1999

Acknowledgments: the First Lady; AG Reno; FTC Chairman Robert Pitofsky;
Arthur Sawe [SAH-way] and his mother Caroline; Mayor Deedee Corradini, US
Conference of Mayors; Wash. State Rep. Mary Lou Dickerson; Pam Eakes,
founder, Mothers Against Violence in America

        In recent weeks, and in the wake of tragedy, we have witnessed
something truly remarkable: Americans from all regions and all walks of
life coming together to prevent youth violence. As you may recall, the
First Lady and I traveled to Colorado recently and spoke with the students
of Columbine High School.  In one sudden moment, just six weeks ago, they


lost much of the innocence of youth; but I am pleased to say that they
have lost little of its idealism. They have held fast to their faith in a
better future 0) a future where hatred no longer hardens the heart; a
future where values, and not violence, make up our common culture.

         The national grassroots campaign Hillary described is rooted
firmly in that faith.  We know we can prevent youth violence if we work
together, across all the lines that may divide us; and assume
responsibility rather than assign blame. That responsibility, of course,
begins at home.  Parents must guide children as they grow, and stay
involved even as children become more independent. That responsibility
must be reinforced at school; in houses of worship; and in the community
as a whole.  The more invested we are in the lives of our children, the
less isolated they can become.

         Those of us in public service must also do our part, and fulfill
our responsibility to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and
children. To that end, there is a broad and growing national consensus
that says we must do more.  I am grateful that a number of gun
manufacturers came here to the White House last month and voiced their
support for our common-sense approach. And I am encouraged that the
Senate agreed to close the deadly gun-show loophole; require that safety
locks be sold with every handgun; ban the importation of large-capacity
ammunition clips; and ban violent juveniles from owning guns as ~dults.
To the House of Representatives I say:  Pass these common-sense measures
into law, and do so swiftly when you return from recess.  DonO,t put our
childrenO,s safety on hold 0) put it at the top of your agenda.

Members of the entertainment industry must also do their part.   They 0) and
the rest of us 0) must not kid ourselves:   our children are being fed a
dependable, daily dose of violence.   Studies show that the typical
18-year-old has seen 200,000 dramatized acts of violence and 40,000
dramatized murders.   Kids become numb to it.  They have to.  And as their
exposure to violence grows, so does, in some deeply troubling cases, their
taste for it. We should not be surprised that half the video games the
typical seventh-grader plays are violent ones.

Anyone who doubts the impact of this cultural assault can look at hundreds
of studies, three decadesO, worth, showing the direct link between violent
entertainment and violent behavior. What these studies tell us is that
for adults, the boundary between fantasy and reality is a bright line; but
for vulnerable children, it can be blurred.  Kids who are steeped in the
culture of violence can become desensitized to it and more capable of
committing it themselves.

That is why I have strongly urged people in the industry to consider the
consequences of what they create. One can value our First Amendment right
to free expression and, at the same time, act with restraint.  Our
administration has worked to give parents the tools to protect their kids
0) and block violent programming from entering their living rooms.   We have
worked with the industry to develop a voluntary rating system for
television, and a V-Chip that enables parents to enforce it.  We ,ve also
made progress on parental screening for the Internet and ratings for
Internet game sites.

Still, when violent entertainment made for adults is marketed to children,
it undermines the rating systems designed to protect them.  Advertisements
have the power to egg children on and lure them in.  Every parent knows
what response a commercial for sugar cereal 0) or the latest O&Star Wars[J8
toy 0) will get from their kids.  They want that product and, one way or


another, theyO,re determined to get it.   So we should think twice about the
impact of ads for so-called O&first-person shooterOS video games ~) like the
recent ad for a game that invites players to n&get in touch with your
gun-toting . . . cold-blooded murdering side.US Now, Arthur obviously has
the inner strength and the upbringing to reject that kind of violent
appeal.  But not every child will.

Today, I am asking the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade
Commission to study the extent to which the video game, music and movie
industries market violence to children 0) and whether those industries are
abiding by their own voluntary systems of regulation.  To any company that
sells violent products, I say this: Children are more than consumers.
They are our future, and our most precious resource.  They should not be
targets in the marketing of violence.  DonO,t make young people want what
your own rating systems say they shouldnO,t have.

I also issue this challenge to the owners of movie theaters and video
stores, to distributors, and to anyone at the point of sale:  enforce the
ratings systems on the products you sell.  Check IDs. Draw the line.   If
underage kids are buying violent video games or getting into R-rated
movies, then ratings systems should be strictly enforced to put a stop to
it. And if gratuitous violence is getting into PG-13-rated movies, then
ratings systems should be reevaluated.

I want to thank Senators Brownback, Lieberman, Hatch, and Kohl for the
work theyO,ve done on this issue.  And I want to commend Washington State
Representative Mary Lou Dickerson, who is here with us today.  Inspired by
an article she read about young Arthur, Rep. Dickerson helped create a
task force on video game violence. And, thanks to her work with Mothers
Against Violence in America and the Washington Retailers Association, both
of which are represented here today, video game retailers in Washington
State will now voluntarily sign a pledge to parents, committing themselves
to check IDs and block sales of violent games to minors.

I urge others to follow their lead.   For this, in the end, is the way we
will make progress:   by constant and coordinated effort 0) as individuals
and industries, as communities and as a nation.   Youth violence is a
problem we face together 0) and it is a problem America can solve
together.  By joining hands in this effort we can truly build a safer
future for all our children in the 21st Century. Thank you.
