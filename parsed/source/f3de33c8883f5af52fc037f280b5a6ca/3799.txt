TEXT:
Friday I attended (for Mike C.) a Mack McLarty-run meeting on the u.s.
agenda proposals for the Santiago Summit of the Americas.   In discussing
the education proposals, attendees made it clear that they see education
as the single most prominent item from the u.S. standpoint.   In
particular, it was suggested that the u.S. should pursue a major ramping
up of U.S.-Latin America educational exchanges--not just a little (the
draft agenda says 25%) but perhaps a lot; it was suggested that this could·
be something major for the President comparable to Fulbright
scholarships. It was further suggested that the focus of exchanges should
shift from the postsecondary level to something that would better reflect
the President's concern with K-12 education -- maybe an exchange of
elementary and secondary teachers.   McLarty indicated strong support for
doing something big on educational exchanges generally and said he thought
he had some ideas on where resources could come from, but did not
elaborate on $ or the specifics.

Other items discussed as possibilities (either for adding explicitly to
the agenda or for more "spontaneous" agreements)  included policies on
promoting freedom of the Internet, a hemispheric alliance on drugs, and a
gun-running initiative (I have alerted Jose to the latter two items).

State and NSC will be working with the agencies and others in the EOP to
continue fleshing these possiblities out.
