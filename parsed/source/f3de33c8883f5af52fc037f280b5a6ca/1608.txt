TEXT:
Elena,

Bob Stone at NPR has been pushing hard to encourage the agencies to set
specific numerical targets in their welfare to work plans.  I have
reiterated several times the earlier decision NOT to ask agencies to set
specific targets, but Bob Stone would still like to do so.  I suggested to
his staff that he might want to call you to discuss this as I'm not in a
position to make any changes on this policy. He may call either you or
Bruce in the morning.

Specifically, as you remember, we decided not to set targets for the
agencies and not to ask them to come up with their own numerical targtes
in their plans, but to encourage each agency to put together a plan best
suited to its workforce, hiring needs, outreach ability, etc.  If that
means the agency wants to set its own numerical targets, fine, but we
decided we wouldn't ask them to do it.
