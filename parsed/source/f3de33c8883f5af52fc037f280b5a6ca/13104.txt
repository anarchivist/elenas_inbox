Elena
I have finally reviewed and certified your financial disclosure report. While
reviewing, I learned that you are on the Board of Governors of the Chicago
Council on Lawyers.
You should know that there is a White House policy that prohibits service as an
officer of, or on the Board of Directors (or Governors or Trustees), of any
organization (whether for- or not-for-profit). Therefore, you will need to
resign your position on the Board.
Please send me confirmation when you have done so.
Thanks,
-- Kathi
