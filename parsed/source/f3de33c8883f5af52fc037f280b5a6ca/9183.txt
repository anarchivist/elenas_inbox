                                 105th CONGRESS

                                    2d Session

                                      S. 53



                                     AN ACT

To require the general application of the antitrust laws to major league
baseball, and for other
purposes.

     Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
United States of
     America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

        This Act may be cited as the 'Curt Flood Act of 1998'.



SEC. 2. PURPOSE.

     It is the purpose of this legislation to state that major league
baseball players are covered
     under the antitrust laws (i.e., that major league baseball players
will have the same rights
     under the antitrust laws as do other professional athletes, e.g.,
football and basketball
     players), along with a provision that makes it clear that the passage
of this Act does not
     change the application of the antitrust laws in any other context or
with respect to any other
     person or entity.

SEC. 3. APPLICATION OF THE ANTITRUST LAWS TO
PROFESSIONAL MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL.

     The Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. Sec. 12 et seq.)   is amended by adding at
the end the following
     new section:

     'SEC. 27. (a) Subject to subsections (b) through (d), the conduct,
acts, practices, or
     agreements of persons in the business of organized professional major
league baseball
     directly relating to or affecting employment of major league baseball
players to play baseball
     at the major league level are subject to the antitrust laws to the
same extent such conduct,
     acts, practices, or agreements would be subject to the antitrust laws
if engaged in by
     persons in any other professional sports business affecting
interstate commerce.

     '(b) No court shall rely on the enactment of this section as a basis
for changing the
     application of the antitrust laws to any conduct, acts, practices, or
agreements other than
     those set forth in subsection (a). This section does not create,
permit or imply a cause of
     action by which to challenge under the antitrust laws, or otherwise
apply the antitrust laws
     to, any conduct, acts, practices, or agreements that do not directly
relate to or affect
     employment of major league baseball players to play baseball at the
major league level,
     including but not limited to--

          '(I) any conduct, acts, practices, or agreements of persons
engaging in, conducting
          or participating in the business of organized professional
baseball relating to or
          affecting employment to play baseball at the minor league level,
any organized
          professional baseball amateur or first-year player draft, or any
reserve clause as
          applied to minor league players;

          '(2) the agreement between organized professional major league


baseball teams and
          the teams of the National Association of Professional Baseball
Leagues, commonly
          known as the 'Professional Baseball Agreement', the relationship
between organized
          professional major league baseball and organized professional
minor league baseball,
          or any other matter relating to organized professional
baseball's minor leagues;

          '(3) any conduct, acts, practices, or agreements of persons
engaging in, conducting
          or participating in the business of organized professional
baseball relating to or
          affecting franchise expansion, location or relocation, franchise
ownership issues,
          including ownership transfers, the relationship between the
Office of the
          Commissioner and franchise owners, the marketing or sales of the
entertainment
          product of organized professional baseball and the licensing of
intellectual property
          rights owned or held by organized professional baseball teams
individually or
          collectively;

          '(4) any conduct, acts, practices, or agreements protected by
Public Law 87-331
           (15 U.S.C. Sec. 1291 et seq.) (commonly known as the 'Sports
Broadcasting Act
          of 1961');

          '(5) the relationship between persons in the business of
organized professional
          baseball and umpires or other individuals who are employed in
the business of
          organized professional baseball by such persons; or

          '(6) any conduct, acts, practices, or agreements of persons not
in the business of
          organized professional major league baseball.

     '(c) Only a major league baseball player has standing to sue under
this section. For the
     purposes of this section, a major league baseball player is--

          '(1) a person who is a party to a major league player's
contract, or is playing baseball
          at the major league level; or

          -(2) a person who was a party to a major league player's
contract or playing baseball
          at the major league level at the time of the injury that is the
subject of the complaint;
          or

          '(3) a person who has been a party to a major league player's
contract or who has
          played baseball at the major league level, and who claims he has
been injured in his


          efforts to secure a subsequent major league player's contract by
an alleged violation
          of the antitrust laws: Provided however, That for the purposes
of this paragraph, the
          alleged antitrust violation shall not include any conduct, acts,
practices, or agreements
          of persons in the business of organized professional baseball
relating to or affecting
          employment to play baseball at the minor league level, including
any organized
          professional baseball amateur or first-year player draft, or any
reserve clause as
          applied to minor league players; or

          -(4) a person who was a party to a major league player's
contract or who was
          playing baseball at the major league level at the conclusion of
the last full
          championship season immediately preceding the expiration of the
last collective
          bargaining agreement between persons in the business of
organized professional
          major league baseball and the exclusive collective bargaining
representative of major
          league baseball players.

     -(d) (1) As used in this section, -person' means any entity, including
an individual,
     partnership, corporation, trust or unincorporated association or any
combination or
     association thereof. As used in this section, the National
Association of Professional
     Baseball Leagues, its member leagues and the clubs of those leagues,
are not -in the
     business of organized professional major league baseball'.

     -(2) In cases involving conduct, acts, practices, or agreements that
directly relate to or affect
     both employment of major league baseball players to play baseball at
the major league level
     and also relate to or affect any other aspect of organized
professional baseball, including but
     not limited to employment to play baseball at the minor league level
and the other areas set
     forth in subsection (b) above, only those components, portions or
aspects of such conduct,
     acts, practices, or agreements that directly relate to or affect
employment of major league
     players to play baseball at the major league level may be challenged
under subsection (a)
     and then only to the extent that they directly relate to or affect
employment of major league
     baseball players to play baseball at the major league level.

     -(3) As used in subsection (a), interpretation of the term -directly'
shall not be governed by
     any interpretation of section 151 et seq. of title 29, United States
Code (as amended) .

     -(4) Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect the
'A




     application to organized
          professional baseball of the nonstatutory labor exemption from the
     antitrust laws.

          '(5) The scope of the conduct, acts, practices, or agreements covered
     by subsection (b)
          shall not be strictly or narrowly construed. ' .

     Passed the Senate July 30, 1998.

     Attest:

     Secretary.
