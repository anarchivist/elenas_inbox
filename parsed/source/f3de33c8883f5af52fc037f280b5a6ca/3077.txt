TEXT:
Leaders of the aging community will be hold a press conference today at
noon at the National Press Club to speak out against the proposed Medicare
changes by the Senate Finance Committee.  They will highlight the lack of
the low-income premium protection, means-testing, age eligibility (65-67),
and the home health co-pay.  Particpants include:

Jim Firman, President of National Council on Aging
Steve Protulis, Executive Director, National Council of Senior Citizens
Johnetta Marshall, President, Older Women's League
Sam Simmons, President, National Caucus and Center on Black Aged
Martha McSteen, President, National Committee to Preserve Soc Security and
Medicare.

Also, I understand that the Senate Dems are organizing a Medicare event at
3:00 PM today with Kennedy, Reed or Reid?, and maybe Daschle.
