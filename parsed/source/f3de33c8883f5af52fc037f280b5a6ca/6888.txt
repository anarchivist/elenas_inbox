SUBJECT:   UNZ MEMO UPDATE--IMPORTANT

TEXT:
Karen, Maria, Mickey, Janet and I have had a number of meetings over the
past week and a half--with Boxer and Feinstein'·s staff. with Becerra and
Hinajosa, and again last night with Becerra himself.   Secretary Riley has
also become more personally engaged in this issue within the last week.
As a result of all these discussions, we've shifted our views about what
we ought to recommend to the President. Briefly, here are the key
differences in where we all are corning out, compared to the memo from a
week ago:

1.  In opposing Unz, the President should tak about principles for
strengtheing bilingual education (our "mend it don't end it" approach) but
should not propose changes to the existing federal bilingual education
program.
Proposing changes to the existing law is risky--our proposal is very
unlikley to be taken up by this Congress, but its existence could feed or
encourage more substantial attacks on bilingual ed programs.
Boxer and Feinsteins staff in particular urged us not to propose statutory
changes, because such as step would force Dems in the CA delegation to
take a position on the President's proposal.   They didn't think that would
be helpful during the campagn season.
Becerra and. others in the Hispanic Caucus, as well as the advocacy groups,
also urged us not to propose changes in the bilingual ed program--whatever
we propose is likely to cause controversy within the Caucus, fuel the
debate in CA over bilingual ed and detract from efforts to focus public
attention on the weaknesses in the Unz initiative.


Attached is a rough draft of the principles and how they might be fleshed
out. I am working on incorporating them into our memo, which I would like
to circulate by COB today.


2.   Our principles should make clear that participation in bilingual
education programs should not be an open-ended party--but we should not
specify a three year (or other specific) time frame for mastering English.
The CHC and the advocacy groups are adamantly opposed to talking about a
3-year time limit. They argue that this is arbitrary and unsupported by
any research, and that any discussion of a time limit will undermine their
criticisms of Unz.   Politically, it will undermine any political credit we
would get with that community by opposing Unz, and start an unwinnable
debate over how long is long enough.

3.  Final issue: Karen, Riley, and Maria have each indicated that we
should use this debate to make the case for having more of our students,
including native English speakers, become bilingual in order to better
participate in the global economy.
Riley argues that it would be seen as bold, gutsy and unexpected
While I agree with the basic argument, I'm afraid that we have not laid


any groundwork for this argument, and that it will seem a bit contrived in
the context of opposing Unz.


Please give me a call this afternoon and let me know your reactions.

                                       Principles forEducating LEP students


               There are 3.2 million limited English proficient students in our schools. Immigrant children are the fastest
               growing group in our schools. The language problems they face are compounded by the fact that about
               three-fourths of these students are in high poverty schools. The vast majority of limited English proficient
               children are Hispanic. Over the last 20 years, there has been little progress in closing the achievement gap
               between Hispanic and non-Hispanic white students in reading, math, and science. These problems are at
               the core of the 20% drop-out rate for Hispanic students enrolled in the Nation's elementary and secondary
               schools. Accordingly, many young Hispanic adults do not have the basic level of education necessary to
               participate in today's or our future economy, which demands high level skills. To ensure that our nation's
               workforce is competitive, limited English proficient students must succeed. As a Nation, our efforts to
              ·accomplish this must be based on a clear understanding of what works best, not on politics or ideology.


      1. Our goal must be to help all students become proficient in English as quickly as
      possible, and meet academic standards in all subjects.
      ·      This is a universal goal--shared especially by parents and students who have come to this
             country for greater opportunity and who are eager to fully participate in the life of their
             community and country
      ·      Every school district should establish and make public clear timelines for LEP students to
             become proficient in English and to participate in regular classrooms where English is the
             language of instruction. Participation in bilingual education should not be open ended or
             never-ending,
      ·      (Possible: Federal law now requires that federally funded bilingual education programs
             ensure that students master English within 3-5 years. No district should set a longer
             timeline, and I believe we can do better in many cases). Issue a directive to Riley to
             develop guidelines for local school districts reflecting the best knowledge of how quickly
             it is reasonable and appropriate for LEP students to become projicient in English, and
             identifYing approaches, strategies and programs that can help speed things up.

      2.. SchoolslDistricts must be accountable for performance and results
      ·      School districts must be held accountable for perfomiance, and must help students
             become proficient in English as rapidly as possible.
      ·      School districts must assess students periodically (annually) to measure progress. If a
             student is not making adequate progress, the school/district must provide additional help.
             If programs are not helping students progress rapadily enough, they should be
             strengthened or another approach tried.

      3.   There must be local flexibility in how to reach the goal
      ·      No one-size-fits-all prescription for how to educate limited English proficient
             children will work.
      ·      Experience and research, including a 1997 report of the National Academy of
             Sciences, indicate that no one approach is the answer for all limited English
             proficient children.
                                                                         Hex-Dump Conversion

·      Rather -- whether the approach is bilingual education, English as a second
       language, structured immersion, or some variation or hybrid of them -- the
       success of programs turns on the needs of the students, the resources available
       to the community, and the quality and commitment of the school and teacher.
·      A National Academy of Sciences study released March 18 shows that LEP
       children with no English proficiency are best taught to read English by first being
       taught reading in their native language, if teachers and instructional materials
       in their native language are available.          Thus, while a structured English
       immersion approach maybe effective for some limited English proficient
       children, it is likely to be ineffective for many others.

4. Regardless of approach, our focus.must be on quality
·     Students must be taught by well-prepared teachers; no approach will work well if its
      implemented by teachers who lack the knowledge and skills to get the job done
      effectively. That is why the Administration has proposed $xx million to invest in teacher
      training in its bilingual education program
·     All students must be expected to meet challenging academic standards. Academic
      instruction in bilingual education programs must be aimed at preparing LEP students to
      meet the same academic standards all other students are expected to meet--and they must
      be exposed to the same challenging curriculum. We must not accept watered down
      expectations for LEP students
·    .To improve the academic performance of LEP students, and to help them master English
      as quickly as possible, we must strengthen the· public schools they attend, as well as
      strengthening the language acquisition programs that serve them. That is why the
      President's agenda of higher standards, smaller classes, greater choice and accountability,
      etc ... .is so important.
