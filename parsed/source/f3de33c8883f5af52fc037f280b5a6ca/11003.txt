TEXT:
Below is a graph from the tribute to Thurgood Marshall I am working on for
POTUS.  (tomorrow night's ribbon cutting)  Is it accurate?


The 14th Amendment -- and its promise of equal protection under the law --
was his key, his sword, his shield.   Like Lincoln, who saw how the ideals
embedded in the Declaration of Independence compelled us to crack open the
bonds of slavery, Thurgood Marshall saw how the fourteenth amendment
could dismantle the walls of segregation, brick by brick. He breathed
life into a moribund amendment and transfomed it into a living charter of
freedom -- as vital a guardian of our ideals as the Declaration of Indepe
ndence and the Bill of Rights.
