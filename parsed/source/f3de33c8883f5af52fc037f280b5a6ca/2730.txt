TEXT:
fyi--I notice from today's sports page that the National Women's Law
Center has filed 25 separate complaints with ED's Office for civil Rights
(OCR) against 25 colleges and universities to represent the 25 years of
Title IX.   I imagine that's what prompted a call we got earlier today from
the press office asking whether there is a Title IX event planned for this
month.    I gather there is an event set for June 17; the actual 25th
anniversary is June 23.
