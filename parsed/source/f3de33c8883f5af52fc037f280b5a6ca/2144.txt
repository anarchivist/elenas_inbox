  TEXT:
  Dorothy Robyn and I suggest the following change to Slater's letter --
  drop last two lines about directing his staff to work w/Lautenberg's staff
  to achieve legislative solution, and just say, "I look forward to working
  with you to achieve our mutual goals" -- i.e. don't commit to actively
  pursuing a resolution.  That solves it for Dorothy and me. O.K?

   Comments by 5:00 P.M. Today, Please

  DOT is asking us to clear before tomorrow's hearing a letter from Slater
  to Lautenberg on his .08 BAC sanctions proposal. As you know, NEXTEA has
  .08 incentive grants. DOT's letter concludes, "in the case of 0.08, a
  strategy that combines incentives first and sanctions as a last resort may
  be an appropriate way to achieve our mutual goal to reduce drunk driving.
     I have directed my staff to work with your staff to determine if we can
  find a legislative way to achieve our common goal."   This says to me
  we'll support sanctions if Congress does.  I can live with it.  Is it too
  stong given our implicit decison not to take on .08 sanction fight?

   Comments by 5:00 P.M. Today, please

   This is DOT's proposed letter on S. 412.        (Please note that while


expressing considerable
sympathy for the bill , the letter stops somewhat short of an outright
endorsement. )
 We are also distributing this via LRM.  Could you provide any comments by
5:00 p.m.
today, please? DOT is requesting that clearance be provided today so that
the letter
may be sent prior to tomorrow's hearing on ISTEA reauthorization.  Thanks.



DRAFT




The Honorable Frank R. Lautenberg
United States Senate
Washington, D.C 20510-3002

Dear Frank:

Thank you for your letter requesting the Administration's support for S.
412,
the "Safe and Sober Streets Act of 997," a bill you joined with
Congresswoman
Nita Lowey in introducing.  S. 412, which is modeled on the Age-21 Minimum
Drinking Age Law and the Zero Tolerance Law for underage drivers, would
direct
the Secretary of Transportation to withhold 5 percent of a State's
Interstate
Maintenance, National Highway System, and Surface Transportation funds in
fiscal
year 2001 if it fails to make 0.08 blood-alcohol concentration (BAC) the
legal
standard of driving while intoxicated (DWI).  This withholding would rise
to 10
percent each fiscal year after 2001 until the State adopts 0.08 as its
standard
for DWI.

A standard of 0.08 is highly desirable.   In a 1992 report to Congress, the
Department's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)
recommended
that all States lower their legal standard for DWI to 0.08 BAC for all
drivers
aged 21 and above.   At 0.08, virtually all drivers are substantially
impaired
with regard to braking, steering, lane changing, and judgment--critical
driving
tasks.   In 1995, 17,274 people were killed in alcohol-related crashes.
During
that same year, over 80 percent of the drivers involved in fatal crashes
who
were determined to have a positive BAC level had levels exceeding 0.08.

A 0.08 BAC standard also is highly effective.  Fourteen States have
adopted 0.08
as their standard for DWI.  A recent study of five of these States show
that


significant decreases in alcohol-related fatalities can be achieved by
adopting
0.08 BAC as the per se standard for DWI.

As you know, the Department's ISTEA reauthorization proposal, S. 468,
includes
an incentive grant program directed at preventing alcohol-impaired
driving.
This program, which would begin in fiscal year 1998 and conclude in fiscal
year
2003, contains an incentive grant designed to encourage the States to
adopt 0.08
BAC laws. This incentive approach is one we believe has the greatest
chance of
gaining wide-spread political acceptance.  Your bill, S. 412, would
ensure, by
fiscal year 2001, that the States adopt 0.08 laws by using the sanction of
withholding a portion of a State's highway funds if it fails to enact this
legal
standard.

Sanctions obviously do work, and so do incentives.  The fourteen States
that
have adopted 0.08 show there is already considerable momentum to the
consideration and enactment of this standard. The Department believes
that, in
the case of 0.08, a strategy that combines incentives first and sanctions
as a
last resort may be an appropriate way to achieve our mutual goal to reduce
drunk
driving.  I have directed my staff to work with your staff to determine if
we
can find a legislative way to achieve our common goal. I look forward to
working with you on this matter.

The Office of Managment and Budget advises that, from the standpoint of the
Administration policy, that there is no objection to the submission of this
letter for your considertation.

Sincerely,


Rodney E. Slater
