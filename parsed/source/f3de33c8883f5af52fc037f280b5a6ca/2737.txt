     TEXT:
     Shortly, you should receive a faxed copy of a draft letter for OMB
     Director Raines' signature to transmit the "benefits for immigrants"
     proposals in the Bipartisan Budget Agreement.   (Also attached for your
     information is the final legislative language for these proposals.)
     Please review the letter and provide comments to me by 11 a.m. tomorrow
     (6/4/97) .



    If we do not receive comments from you by the deadline, we will advise the
    Director that you have no objection.
