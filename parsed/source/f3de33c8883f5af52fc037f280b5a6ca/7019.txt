TEXT:
AS you can see, there is a movement afoot for Maria to run our 3-year goal
by Becerra.  I fear it could scuttle where we are headed just as we are
about to bring this to closure.

On the other hand, Becerra was clear that he expected some advance notice
on where we are headed, and we will get some points for not surprising him
when we announce.

 I haven't been able to convince myself that Maria could in any way soften
his opposition. The best we get, I think, is that we have an accurate
guage as to whether Becerra will go ballastic on this, on merely by
really ticked off.

All said and done, I think it will take a call from you rather than me to
turn this one off.

Not to belabor this too much, but are you all sure that the "3 year goal"
is not going to cause erruptions among Latino electeds? My instinct tells
me that we are not going to be OK on this, 'unless we do some serier
pre-announcement outreach with Becerra, et al.



Do we want to test this with Becerra first?

I am not comfortable recommending the VP help roll this out unless we can
clarify this.

THANK YOU FOR ADVISING
