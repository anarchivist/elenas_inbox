        The meeting was uneventful. Glantz tried       lobbying the VP on the Gregg
        amendment, and the VP was quite firm with      him and stuck up for the
        President's position noting that the most      strident opponents of tobacco
        legislation voted with Gregg because they      believed it would kill the bill
        and that they may have gotten their wish.
