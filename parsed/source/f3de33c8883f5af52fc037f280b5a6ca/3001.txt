 TEXT:
 The SAP still hasn't gone out, but it probably will momentarily.  Also
 fyi, NEC is pushing to
 slightly alter our language on legal immigrants by adding the phrase,
 "While the administration
 is sympathetic to the goal of covering the elderly non-disabled," the
 ChairmanD,s mark doesn't
 reflect the budget agreement.

 Here's the language on the attempt to recover the CBO money.

          Cost Allocation Language -- The Administration understands that
 amendments
 may be offered during Committee consideration, the purpose of which is to
 prevent costs
 from increasing in Food Stamps and Medicaid due to cost-shifting for
 common functions
 from the TANF block grant, which places a cap on TANF administrative
 costs. We
 understand the CBO baseline includes costs of over $5 billion in FYs 98-02
 because
 CBO assumes administrative costs shifting from TANF to Food Stamps and
 Medicaid.
 This proposal seeks to reduce the extent of the cost-shift to the Food
 Stamp and Medicaid
 Programs, which could yield substantial gavings against CBOD,s baseline.
 While the
 Administration is generally supportive of this effort -- to prevent States
 from changing
 cost allocation plans in order to shift greater administrative costs from
 the capped TANF
 block grant to the open-ended Food Stamp and Medicaid administrative costs
 that are
 matched by the Federal government     we would need to carefully review the
 specific
 mechanism proposed.   In addition, we would have very serious reservations
 about
 proposals that would cap Food stamps and Medicaid administrative costs.

          The budget negotiators discussed changes to the Food Stamp and
 Medicaid
 Programs at considerable length.   An amendment reducing these programs and
 directing


  savings to other programs was neither raised nor included in the Budget
  Agreement.
  The Administration has strong reservations about such an approach.
