TEXT:
rei Cuomo's draft outline for State of the Cities.

 FYI. There is a lot of good stuff to expand on regarding city/suburbs
interrelationships.  The theme is that cities effect everyone, the whole
region's economy is tied together.   Several areas have notable
governmental efforts going on in this arena: Portland, St. Louis, Miami.
And there is a lot of good research going in this direction.
