TEXT:
I am hearing from the advocates working on the hill that Harkin and others
are willing to fight for $1 billion if they feel that they have the
support of the Administration.   I've also heard from hill staff that the
advocates aren't helping us at all to get bur three programs funded.   All
I've said so far is that of course we support a big number, but that the
Administration has agreed to work for the $180 for our three programs.
Can I go any farther or is it worth talking to Jack or Sylvia about the
signals we can send?
