Subject:        Charter school conference in Denver

Maria,

When I met with Norma Cantu last week to discuss a number of
education/civil
rights issues, she mentioned that there is going to be a conference on
charter schools in Denver on March 15-17, at which a number of civil
rights issues related to charter schools will be discussed.  I went to the
conference web page
and found a number of the agenda items related to these issues, and I have
listed them below.

Given the novel issues that charter schools raise, and old civil rights
issues they potentially
address, I think it would be very helpful to me and our efforts if I
attended some
or all of this conference. There is no fee for federal employees, but
there would be travel costs.
I don't know how these things generally get approved, but if you agree
that this is important,
would you approve the travel costs of having me attend? If so, how do I
go about making
arrangements?

If you don't think it is worth the time or money, that's fine; I just
thought there might be some
opportunity for us to jointly support our education and civil rights
agendas.  Please let me know
what you think.  Some of the agenda topics are listed below:

--General Admissions, Recruitment and Lotteries
--Meeting the Equity Challenge in Charter Schools
--Creating Charter Schools with Diverse Students - Multiracial Charter
Schools
--Outreach Efforts To Include Diverse Communities in Charter Schools
--Federal Technical Assistance Resources
--Title I
--Strategies for Success in the Rural School
--Special Education and Charters: School-level Strategies for Making
IDEA Work
--Federal Technical Assistance Resources
--Residential Schools and Charters for Homeless Students
--Limited English.Proficient (LEP) Issues in Charter Schools
--Charter Schools for At-risk Populations
--Strategies for Success in Urban Settings


Thanks, Peter

      Kelly,

      The charter schools conference will take place March 15 - 17 at the
      Adam's Mark Hotel in Denver. Over 1,000 participants are expected.
      The majority of the participants will be from charter schools.
      However, individuals from ED, LEAs, and SEAs will also attend.

      An agenda for the charter schools conference is available at
      http://www.uscharterschools.org. One would also register for the
      conference at this web site. To view the agenda, one would need to
      register on-line, but it is a self-explanatory process. The topics
for
     civil rights-related sessions at the conference include the following:
     Admissions/Recruitment/Lotteries, Special Education: A Discussion of
     Charter Schools and Students with Disabilities, Limited English
Proficient
     Issues in Charter Schools, Creating Disciplined Environments and
     Appropriate Policies, and Deregulation Versus Non Regulation:   Finding
     Balance and Accountability (this sessions will include a discussion
of the
     effect of existing deseg. plans, court orders and other agreements on
     charter schools) .

      I am forwarding to you an e-mail message about travel and hotel
      accommodations for the conference.

      Alex Medler, 205-9786, and Mikel Morton, 260-0834, who work in OESE's
      Charter Schools Office, would have additional information about the
      conference.

      David

     I need information to send to someone in the WH who may be interested
     in attending.  Why don't you stop by to discuss?
