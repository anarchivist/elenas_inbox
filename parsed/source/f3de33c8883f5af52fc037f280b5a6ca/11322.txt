Here is what I sent Maria: we should tell Chris what we've already
proposed, and work with Gene on something new if need be, since obviously
something "BIG" would involve MONEY.

First we should put in one place the proposals we're already pushing to
help jobless young men.  For example, 20% of our welfare-to-work proposal
is dedicated to helping fathers (most of them in this age group) get
jobs. We also have a DOJ proposal we pushed at the President's request to
expand work/training for federal prisoners. Gene has more proposals in
the budget as well, and if there's a desire to come up with still more
ideas, NEC would be the right one to host a process.
