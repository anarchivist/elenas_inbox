TEXT:
The Hefley amendment, which tries to block any funding for enforcement of
the sexual orientation executive order, will probably come up for a vote
later in the week. We met with the Human Rights Campaign and Martha Foley
last week, who both thought this would be a close vote.  Richard Socarides
and others thought that a legal letter would help some of the undecided
folks join in opposing the Hefley amendment.

Richard asked the counsel's office to draft a letter which essentially is
a legal opinion that refutes the Republican arguments on the executive
order, e.g. that the President exceeded his power, etc.  Below is a draft.

The current draft of the letter says that the President would veto the
bill. We need to decide whether to send this letter and from whom it
would come (Chuck Ruff?). Let us know

The Honorable ----::-::---
United States House of Representatives
Washington, D.C.

Dear Congressman _ _ _ _ __

       I am writing to state the Administration's vigorous opposition to the amendment offered
by Congressman Hefley to H.R. 4104, the Treasury and General Government Appropriations bill
for 1999. The Amendment is an effort to legitimize discrimination by the United States
government against its own citizens simply based on their sexual orientation. This
Administration will not tolerate such gross unfairness, and neither will the American people. If
this Amendment is adopted, the President's senior advisers will recommend that he veto the bill.

      The Amendment seeks to prevent the Administration from spending any funds to
implement, administer or enforce Executive Order l3087, which the President issued on May 28,
1998. That order amends Executive Order 11478, which bars discrimination by the federal
government based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, handicap or age.   The
amendment merely adds sexual orientation to the list of prohibited bases of discrimination.

         The arguments mustered against this Executive Order are spurious.       First, the Order
confers no "special rights." It bars the Government from discriminating. The right to be free
from governmental discrimination is not a special right. It is the inalienable right of every
American. No one should be denied a job based on attributes that have nothing to do with their
ability.

        Second, the wild claims that have been made about what this Executive Order means are
false and distorted. The Order is clear. Plainly and simply, it bars discrimination based on
sexual orientation in the federal civilian workforce. It does not mandate affirmative action based
on sexual orientation. It does not allow preferential treatment. It does not require that agencies
find out which of their employees are gay, or how many gay employees they have hired. It does
not cover federal contractors. And -- to confront the most irresponsible charges -- it does not
authorize sexual misconduct in the workplace. Sexual orientation has the commonly understood
meaning stated in the Employment Non-Discrimination Act of 1995, "homosexuality,
bisexuality, or heterosexuality." These false issues should be forever laid to rest. This is the
President's order, and the President's intent as to what it means is conclusive. See Sea-Land
Service, Inc. V. Interstate Commerce Commission, 738 F.2d 1311, 1314 (D.C. Cir. 1984) ("The
'law' at issue in this instance is an Executive Order promulgated by the President, and it is to his
intent that we must tum for guidance ... ").

       Third, this order does not reflect any new policy and creates no new law. The Civil
Service law, enacted in 1978, prohibits "discrimination for or against any employee or applicant

                                                              Automated Records Management System
                                                              Hex·Dump Conversion
employee or applicant or the performance of others." 5 U.S.C. 2302(b)(10). In 1980, the
Office of Personnel Management interpreted this law to mean what it clearly said, "applicants
and employees are to be protected against inquiries into, or actions based upon, non-job-related
conduct, such as religious, community, or social affiliations, or sexual orientation." OPM
reiterated this interpretation in 1994 and 1997. Most federal agencies and departments have
issued regulations, policy directives, or memoranda from agency heads to implement this law.
All President Clinton's Executive Order does is make the policy uniform for the entire civilian
federal workforce.

        Fourth, the President unquestionably has the power to issue this Order. Presidents since
George Washington have directed Executive Orders to their employees in the Executive Branch.
In 1966, Congress specifically authorized the President to ''prescribe regulations for the conduct
of employees in the executive branch." 5 U.S.C. § 7301. Presidents have frequently exercised
that authority over the federal workforce, issuing scores of Executive Orders. This particular
Order by President Clinton amends Executive Order 11478, issued in 1969 by President Nixon,
barring federal employees from discriminating based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin,
handicap or age. The same authority that supported that Order supports this one. President
Reagan issued Executive Order 12564, requiring a drug-free federal workplace, and Executive
Order 12353, governing charitable fundraising by federal employees. . President Bush issued
Executive Order 12674, setting forth principles of ethical conduct for government employees. It
would be nonsensical to contend that the President can regulate the ethical conduct of federal
employees, that he can prescribe standards for fundraising and require drug testing, but cannot
instruct federal employees to refrain from discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation.

       When we strip away all these specious arguments, the sole remaining basis for this
appropriations rider is prejudice. That is not an appropriate basis for legislation. We will
oppose this effort to sanction discrimination by the federal government.

                                                     Sincerely,




                                                             Automated Records Management System
