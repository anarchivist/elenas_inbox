bob chase met w/ john podesta. two issues that came up that i also spoke
w/ elena about were 1. our strategy re: ed flex and 2. the iea
regulations at doe--timing and substance.   i am open to handling this
anyway that bruce and elena think will work -- they could call ME
Teasley,   I could put a conference call together -- I'd like something to
happen sooner rather than later -- would you speak w/ laura and cathy and
see how they think their principals would like to handle these issues.
thanks, kt
