TEXT:
Do you know anything about a late term strategic planning meeting with
outside groups? I heard something is happening but neither Barbara
Woolley (who does the physician groups) or I were invited.  I don't
actually care because I'm tired of knowing only about half of the late
term meetings, but Barbara should be there.

P.S.   I'm not cranky with you, I'm just cranky.
