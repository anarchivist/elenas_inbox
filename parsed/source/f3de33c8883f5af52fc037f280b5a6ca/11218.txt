PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
EXCERPTED REMARKS
ON LONG-TERM CARE TAX CREDIT
DOVER, NEW HAMPSHIRE
February 18, 1999

         I want to talk this morning about meeting the greatest challenge
of the new century: the aging of America. As the Baby Boom becomes the
Senior Boom, long-term care will become a growing need.   So it is more
important than ever that we help families provide that essential kind of
care for their loved ones.   In my balanced budget, I have proposed and
paid for a long-term care tax credit of $1,000 to help families do exactly
that . .

        Providing long-term care at home is, more and more often, a common
choice, but it is rarely an easy one. . . We have taken steps to ease the
burdens on these families in a number of ways: by strengthening Medicare,
by extending the trust fund, by promoting prevention and cracking down on
fraud and abuse.  But the aging of America in the 21st Century will demand
more of us.  The long-term care tax cut I proposed last month would help
to meet the needs of individual families, empowering them to do what is b
est, showing them how very much we value the work they do.      Caregiving
is a vital and sacred compact among generations -- and one we should
recognize and reward as a nation.



        A long-term care tax cut is exactly the kind of tax cut we should
be making. As you know, we are engaged in a great national debate right
now about how to use the budget surplus.   Now, we can all agree that
America should have tax cuts. But there are two very different ways we
can go about it.  First, there is the old way -- failed and full of risk
-- that some Republicans are trying to resurrect.   They are saying:
splurge today, save tomorrow.  ThatD,s not the approach that Vice
President Gore and I have proposed. Our approach says invest today, save
for tomorrow.  Our kind of tax cut is one that doesnD,t destroy our fiscal
discipline, but preserves it. Our kind of tax cut is not indiscriminate,
but is, instead, targeted to meet peopleD,s real needs for the future.
Above all, our kind of tax cut allows us to meet our responsibility to
future generations -- and to invest the lionD,s share of the surplus in
saving social Security and Medicare first.

        Even some Republican moderates are coming to see the wisdom in
this approach, in targeted tax cuts.  I look forward to working with them
to make the right choices for future generations -- to make sure we donD,t
squander our historic opportunity to save Social Security and Medicare,
and pay down the debt. As I said in my State of the Union Address one
month ago, we can make good on that opportunity -- while providing tax
relief like USA Accounts, and while making targeted tax cuts in areas from
urban investment to clean energy technology, and from child care to
long-term care. That is the way we should use our surplus: We should
invest it.  Invest it in AmericaD,s future.

TEXT:
As you know the Iowa AG sent us a memo arguing that the state settlements
were based on three types of claims -- Medicaid, consumer fraud, and
miscellaneous (including civil penalties, antitrust, and nuisance) -- and
argued funds should be allocated among these categories and the federal
government can only claim a share of the first category.

DOJ makes the following points:

Under a legislative resolution of claims, one could devise whatever
Medicaid/non-Medicaid allocation one chose to.

Under an administrative recoupment, there are statutory constraints:

         (1) The statute requires reimbursement of Medicaid claims first.
It would be inconsistent with DOJ's usual litigation posture and bad
precedent to allow allocation of claims as Miller proposes, if the overall
settlement amount is less than the Medicaid claims.   Here's how it usually
works: say someone on Medicaid gets injured on the job, and Medicaid pays
$50,000 for his health costs. The person settles with the employer for
$25,000.   In this case, the federal government always argues that all the
$25,000 should go to reimburse· Medicaid and rebuffs arguments that a share
of funds were awarded due to, say, pain and suffering, and should
therefore remain with the individual.

         (2) However, DOJ thinks it is acceptable to discount claims for
litigation risk, e.g., the risk that one would lose in court.   In our
example, this would mean that the federal government would argue that all
$25,000 should reimburse Medicaid.   However, if the lawyers thought there
was, say, a 10 percent risk of losing the case, the lawyers could settle
for $22,500 out of the $25,000.

Thus, they believe a good faith effort to apportion based on litigation
risks would be allowable, if we wanted to go there, but again this applies
only to administrative recoupment.

Perrelli says Tom Miller called Phil Bartz last week.  Phil apparently
told Tom that people were looking into this and have concerns but did say
anything specific.
