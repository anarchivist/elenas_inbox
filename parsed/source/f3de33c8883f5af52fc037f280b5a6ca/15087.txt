Subject:         FCC letter/DISCUS press conference


At 10:30 am today the·Distilled Spirits Council held a press conference at
the Press Club regarding the information I delivered to your offices a few
minutes ago. They are calling for the President to convene a
meeting/discussion with the liquor, beer & wine, and Broadcast Industry to
create a Common Code of Advertising.

They delivered their letter to The President this morning and we will need
to respond to it soon and obviously Mike may get questions today.

Let me know what I can do to help.
