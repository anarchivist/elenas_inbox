TEXT:
Representative Goodling, along with 99 other questions, has asked
Secretary Riley in writing whether Davis-Bacon applies to our school
construction proposal.

Attached is our current q & a on the issue, which is a basically "we're
looking at it" non-answer   (Note: I made a minor change to what we gave
the VP previously      I dropped the "we've been asked to look into it"
part and left the "we're look at it part")

This is what we'll go with unless folks have serious concerns. If you do,
let me know and we can do a conference calIon Monday. Thanks.

                                        March 5, 1999

Q:     Would Davis-Bacon apply to the Administration's new school construction proposal?

A:     First of all, I want to reiterate the Administration is a strong supporter of the application
       of Davis-Bacon when Federal Government outlays are involved.

·      Whether Davis-Bacon should apply to this tax cut proposal is an issue that has come up in
       the past and we are taking another look at it.


Background:
The Administration position has been Davis-Bacon would not apply to our school construction
proposal because it is on the tax side of the budget (where Davis-Bacon historically has not been
applied) and not on the spending side (where Davis-Bacon does apply). Other similar tax
subsidies, such as tax exempt bonds and the Low Income Housing Tax Credit, have not
historically been subject to Davis-Bacon
