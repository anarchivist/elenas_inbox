TEXT:
Summers is resisting testifying before Senate Judiciary on Wednesday on
Hatch.  They claim he is going to be traveling on Monday and Tuesday and
will not be able to be prepared by Wednesday and in the same breath claim
they are trying to be team players.  They propose to have Ed Knight, the
Treasury General Counsel, testify.  (Ed is Neal Wolin's boss.)  Marti
Thomas says one of you needs to call Summers to get him to do it.

Better news reo the Democratic Task Force -- Treasury wants to send Gary
Genzler (sp?).
