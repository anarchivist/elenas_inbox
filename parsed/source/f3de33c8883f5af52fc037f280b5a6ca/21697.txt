TEXT:
FYI -- John Fraser tells me that CNN is doing a program on H-2A that is
scheduled to air either December 6th and 7th or December 13th and 14th.
According to John, the angle is that growers are abusing the program and
that they are intentionally avoiding hiring U.S. workers.  CNN told John
that they had interviewed 50-100 farmworkers (domestic and H-2A); DOL
(including John F. and John Beverly) and the North Carolina Growers
Association.
