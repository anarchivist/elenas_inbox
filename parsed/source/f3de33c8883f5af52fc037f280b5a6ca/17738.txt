                            White House Conference on Hate Crimes
                                     November 10, 1997


        Some 27 centuries ago, the Greek poet Homer described hatred as "a little thing at first,
[which] thereafter grows until [it] strides the earth with [its] head striking heaven." We have
seen in our own century many awful examples of hatred, born of prejudice and arrogance,
destroying lives and fracturing nations. We are here today to open and advance a discussion of
this perilous threat as it affects America today: through the appalling profusion and persistence
of hate crimes.

       Hate crimes are as pervasive as they are perverse. They target homes and houses of
worship. They feature arson, assault, and murder. They exempt no race, region, or religion.

        And they are vicious. Hate crimes are much more likely to involve assault, lead to
physical injury, and require hospitalization. And they are much more likely to be perpetrated
against a complete stranger -- because in hate crimes, the perpetrators attack for the sole and sick
 purpose of punishing people for being "different."

        The act of attacking people for being different should send a shiver through the soul of
America. We are a nation of expanding diversity, founded and sustained and distinguished
among the nations of the world by our commitment to the equality of human beings, and to the
protection of their inalienable rights. Any attack by some Americans against the rights of other
Americans on the basis of race, color, religion, gender, disability, national origin, or sexual
orientation is an attack on America itself.

        That's why President Clinton has taken unprecedented action to curb hate crimes. The
President pushed for, and signed, the Hate Crimes Sentencing Enhancement, that lengthens
sentences for hate crimes. We have vigorously prosecuted hate crimes under federal civil rights
statutes. We have deployed the expertise of the ATF in investigating bomb and arson
incidents; we have established, within the FBI, a Hate Crime Unit, and begun collecting national
data on hate crimes. We have begun to study the psychological effects of hate crimes,
assembled a task force to investigate and prosecute cases of church arson, and deployed the
Department of Justice Community Relations Service to cool the hot sparks of hate crimes before
they can burst into flame and engulfan entire community. We have also begun working with
schools to prevent the kind of behavior that leads to hate crimes.

        We are proud of our record in fighting hate crimes, but we are not finished. We must
press on to repudiate and discredit acts of hatred and bigotry in our own communities, and teach
future generations of Americans never to hate or discriminate. This is a lofty goal, but if we
hope to live together in peace, diversity and democracy, how can we aim for anything less?

       We are lucky -- in this pursuit -- to be able to tum to the leadership of a man who
witnessed -- growing up -- the awful effects of hatred and prejudice, and turned decisively in the
open-minded men in America -- a President with boundless faith in the goodness of human
beings, and in the promise of America. Ladies and Gentlemen: President Bill Clinton.
