                                             PRESIDENT CLINTON:
                             "WE MUST PASS A BIPARTISAN PATIENTS' BILL OF RIGHTS"

                                                             May 28,1998

"This bill says, how can you let some person with the mentality of an accountant, who will only see the number of what it costs to
have somebody do her surgery, who will only see the number at the bottom line of what the chemotherapy costs, make a
decision. We're not that kind ofpeople; we're not that kind of sOciety. "

                                                                                  President Bill Clinton
                                                                                  May 28,1998

Today, President Clinton is joined by Vice President Gore, Secretary of Health and Human Services Donna Shalala, and Secretary of
Labor Alexis Herman, in calling on Congress to pass a Patients' Bill of Rights, legislation which offers certain protections to all
Americans when they become ill. The President will also release a report showing the impact of health care issues on women, and
why a Patients' Bill of Rights is necessary to protect all Americans.

   PATIENTS' BILL OF RIGHTS. The nation's health care system is undergoing significant change. Many Americans
   worry that these changes may reduce their health care options and lower the standards of care. The President has
   already signed an executive order requiring that all federal agencies substantially comply with the Patients' Bill of
   Rights. Now, these protections must be extended to all Americans. A Patients' Bill of Rights would give Americans
   much needed protections, including:

   ·    Access to health care specialists to ensure patients receive the appropriate care they need;
   ·    Access to emergency services when and where the need arises;
   ·    Access to easily understood infOrmation to help patients make informed decisions;
   ·    Grieyance and appeals processes for consumers to resolve their differences with their health plans and health care providers.

   A PATIENTS' BILL   OF RIGHTS HELPS ENSURE WOMEN GET ACCESS To THE SERVICES 'THEY NEED.             Women are particularly affeaed
   by health care issues.   A new study shows that:

   ·    Oyer 60 percent of physician visits are made by women. and women make three quarters of the health care decisions in
        American households. Without adequate patient protections, women will be unable to effectively navigate through the
        nation's rapidly changing health care system.                                                                          .
   ·    Women in managed care plans are increasingly dissatisfied with the quality ohare. Nearly 70 percent of privately insured
        women ages 18 to 65 are in managed care plans. Almost two-fifths of these women worry that they will not be able to
        get speciality care when they need it. And 27 percent of these women worry that they will be denied a medical procedure
        they need.
   ·    Without a patients' bill of rights. women may not receiye important preyentiye services. The consumer proteaion that gives
        women direct access to an obstetrician/gynecologist is not only necessary to make sure that pregnant women get the care
        they need, but is also important to ensure that women get important preventive services. Studies show that gynecologists
        are almost two times as likely as internists to perform timely, needed women's preventive services.
   ·    Patients' Bill of Rights legislation must be passed. The only way to assure that all women, and all Americans, have the
        patient protections they need is to pass and enaa a Federally-enforceable Patients' Bill of Rights.

   STATE LAWS CANNOT PROTECT ALL CmZENs. The President congratulates the 44 states who have passed at least one element of
   the Patients' Bill of Rights. However, over 122 million Americans are enrolled in health care plans which are not fully
   governed by state law, and therefore do not enjoy the full protection that these laws are intended to give.


   CHALLENGING CONGRESS To ·PASS A FEDERALLy-ENFORCEABLE PATIENTS' BILL OF RIGHTS THIS YEAR. The President
   renews his call to Congress to pass a Patients' Bill of Rights this year. Without this legislation, the millions of Americans in
   private health plans will never be assured these basic protections.
