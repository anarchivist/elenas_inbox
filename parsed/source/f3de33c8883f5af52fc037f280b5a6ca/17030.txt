TEXT:
Well, like, what do we do when a legally married same-sex couple file a
joint US tax return, or file for any federal benefit that legally married
people would otherwise be entitled to under federal law. Do we even know
what all these benefits are? In other words, I don't think anyone has
given any thought to how we should enforce, and just as importantly what
do we say about the enforcement, of the Defense of Marriage Act.   I just
think we ought to be thinking about it, or ask someone to think about it.
