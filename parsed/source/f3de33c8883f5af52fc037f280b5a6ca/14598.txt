TEXT:
On Friday, 2/14 from 3pm to 4pm in 472 OEOB we will have a meeting to
discuss alternative spending cap plans for campaign finance reform.    We
will review and discuss several alternative spending cap plans that do not
include aggregate spending caps as currently envisioned in McCain-Feingold
and Shays-Meehan.   Data on these alternative plans, and how they would
have impacted last fall's Senate races, will be distributed on Thursday.
Hope you can attend.,
