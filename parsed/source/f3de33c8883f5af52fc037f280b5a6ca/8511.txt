        Retailers Back Teenage Id Card

        Shopkeepers are backing a national identity card for teenagers in a drive
        to stamp out under-age
        purchase of alcohol, cigarettes, scratch cards, fireworks, videos and
        solvents.

        The Citizen Card, which would bear a photograph and a hologram, would be a
        voluntary scheme
        available to youngsters aged 12 and above.

        It will start at age 12 because that is the first threshold when a child
        needs to prove they are old
        enough to see 12-certificate films and videos.

        Other important ages are: 14 when a teenager can enter a pub with by an
        adult and have a soft
        drink; 15 when further films and videos can be seen; 16 when tobacco and
        scratch cards can be
        bought, some fruit machines used, and youngsters can drink beer, cider and
        (in Scotland only) wine
        with a meal in a pub; 18 when alcohol and fireworks can be bought and
        young people can enter
        betting shops, bingo halls and some nightclubs, and 21, the minimum age
        for many nightclubs.

        Youngsters would have to pay ?5 to buy the card, but, if successful, it
        could end up being used by
        up to seven million people.

        The card would protect retailers by allowing them to demand sight of the
        card, making it easier for
        them to stay within the law by only selling to children who are old enough.

        The scheme is, reportedly, being considered by 16 trade associations, the
        National Lottery and
        Railtrack. It also has the support of the Tobacco Manufacturers
        Association and the National
        Federation of Retail Newsagents.



    John Carlisle, public affairs director of the Tobacco Manufacturers
    Association, said: "We are
    certainly one of the card's supporters.

    "It is absolutely essential with the ever growing problem of under age
    abuse of substances, which
    includes tobacco, alcohol and glue, and has our full support.

    "If the Government support us that would be the icing on the cake. I'm
    confident that the
    Government will support us," he said.
