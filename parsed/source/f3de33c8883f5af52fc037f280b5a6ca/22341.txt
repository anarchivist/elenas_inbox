TEXT:
After last night's rehearsal, we worked with Michael to rewrite the
reference to school discipline in an effort to address the point Janet and
Minyon raised.

I also called Wade Henderson to get his advice.  He said discipline is a
concern for all parents, and it was fine to talk about it in the way we
discussed, as long as the details of the legislation are sensitive to the
concerns you brought up last night. We'll be meeting with civil rights
leaders several times over the next several weeks as we write the bill,
and we'll make sure to get this right.

wade thought the Times story on education was terrific, and was glad that
we're finally talking about holding states and school districts
accountable for results.  (He also appreciated the Post story on civil
rights enforcement.)
