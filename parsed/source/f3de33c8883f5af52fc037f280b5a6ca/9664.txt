TEXT:
NEC has asked that we clear the letter below on HR 3150 - Bankruptcy
Reform Act of 1998 in order to be release early this evening.  House Rules
& Floor action is expected shortly. Position: Senior Advisers would
recommend veto.  Please provide comments/clearance as soon as possible.
Thanks.

The Honorable Orrin G. Hatch
Chairman
Committee on the Judiciary
United States Senate
Washington, D.C. 20510

Dear Mr. Chairman:

        I write to provide the AdministrationD,s views on the conference
report to H.R. 3150, the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1998.

        The Senate worked on a bipartisan basis to produce a balanced bill
that would have reduced abuses of the bankruptcy system and required
debtors and creditors alike to act responsibly.  Unfortunately, H.R. 3150,
as agreed to by the Conference Committee, contains many flawed aspects of
the House bill, and if this version of the bill is presented to the
President, his senior advisors will recommend that he veto it.

        On the central issue of means-testing, the Conference Report uses
the Senate framework but would, like the House bill, impose a rigid rule
that denies bankruptcy judges adequate discretion to decide whether the
debtor has the capacity to repay successfully a portion of debts under
Chapter 13. The bill would require a moderate income debtor to
demonstrate that each monthly expense for housing, clothing,
transportation, and food that exceeds a predetermined level is necessary
due to D&extraordinary circumstancesD8 before that person could get their
debts discharged under Chapter 7.

        At the same time H.R. 3150 produces a rigid system to ensure
moderate-income debtors repay their debts, it does not impose meaningful


limits on the homestead exemption -- the mechanism used by the wealthy to
shield hundreds of thousands of dollars of wealth from their creditors.

        The Senate bill took laudable steps to enhance consumer
protections from coercive and predatory behavior by creditors.  This
version of H.R. 3150, however, fails to limit adequately abusive creditor
practices such as coercive affirmations and violations of the automatic
stay, and rolls back consumer protections.  The bill would also deny
consumers the most effective remedy for harm from such practices -- class
action liability -- and eliminate the current authorization for punitive
damages against creditors for intentional violations of borrower rights.

        Finally, the bill does not include the provisions of the Senate
bill that would discharge debts that could compete with child support and
alimony payments after a debtor has been declared bankrupt.  In addition,
the bill would make nondischargeable any debt that was incurred within 90
days of bankruptcy to pay nondischargeable debt and any debt resulting
from certain cash advances. This, in effect, puts some debt owed to
credit card companies in competition with social priorities like child
support and alimony, taxes, and educational loans.  All too often
pressures from an aggressive creditor trying to collect a nondischargeable
debt can keep a struggling debtor from making child support and alimony
payments.

        The overwhelming vote on the Senate   floor for the balanced
legislation that body produced demonstrates   that reasonable and
responsible bankruptcy reform is possible.    Unfortunately, H.R. 3150 as
developed by the Conference Committee, does   not provide such reform.

                                                 Sincerely,




                                                 Jacob J. Lew
                                                 Director



Identical Letter Sent to The Honorable Orrin G. Hatch,
The Honorable Charles E. Grassley, The Honorable Jeff Sessions,
The Honorable Patrick J. Leahy, The Honorable Richard J. Durbin,
The Honorable Henry Hyde, The Honorable John Conyers,
The Honorable George W. Gekas, and The Honorable Jerrold Nadler
