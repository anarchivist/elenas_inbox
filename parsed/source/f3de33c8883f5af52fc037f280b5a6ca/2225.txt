TEXT:
The 4th Circuit has granted ours and plaintiff's petitions for
interlocutory appeal but denied our motion for expedited appeal.   However,
the court's briefing schedule is close to the schedule we proposed.
Plaintiffs file opening brief 6/3; gov't files opening brief 6/23;
plaintiffs file answering brief 7/11; we file reply brief 7/21 (we
requested 7/3 deadline for reply briefs). This schedule leaves open the
possibility that, as we proposed, the court will rule before August 28,
the effective date of most of the rule's provisions.
