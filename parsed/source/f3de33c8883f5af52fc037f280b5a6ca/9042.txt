TEXT:
I talked to Moore and Gregoire. The talks will not resume until the week
of Aug. 24th. The CEOs were meeting today to decide whether to resume the
talks at all. Gregoire thinks that if the talks resume, they will go
quickly, because she needs a decision either way by the week of Sept.
14th. But she says there appears to be a real split between PM and RJR.
In the four state settlements, PM agreed to help with RJR's cash-flow
problems by picking up a disproportionate share of the cost, but PM is no
longer willing to do so (because RJR turned around and used the money it
would have had to spend on settlements to increase spending on
promotions). RJR is now worried that PM wants to maximize its competitive
advantage by making RJR pay its share of the upfront payment and agreeing
to some advertising restrictions that will make it harder for RJR to
reverse its declining market share. RJR would then be incredibly
vulnerable to another Marlboro Friday, where PM slashes prices to gain
market share. She'll let us know what she hears from the CEOs.
