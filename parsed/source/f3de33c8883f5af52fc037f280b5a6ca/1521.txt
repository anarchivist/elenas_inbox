TEXT:
We met with summit organizers last night (Stuart Shapiro, Powell's guy,
Points of Light guy, and Corp) and learned the following things of
interest:

1. They do plan to announce the formation of the partnership on
Thursday.  Powell wants to announce it in an interview with the Phila
Inquirer, along with a $1 million grant from Pew. The current name they
are working with is "America's Promise: The Alliance for Youth." Let me
know if you want me to follow up in any way.

2. Governors attending so far include Rowland, Carper, Zell Miller,
Edgar, O'Bannon of Indiana, Weld, Engler, Shaheen of NH, Whitman, Hunt of
NC, Keating, Ridge, Almond, Janklow of SDakota, Sundquist, Dean, Locke of
Washington, Geringer of Wyoming. They predict Wilson will come. Marcia
may push Romer and Bob Miller to come too.

3. We are planning to meet with their PR team soon. New production
company hired includes Bill Kitchen, who did Inaugural.

4.  President's Service Awards won't be ready until the summit itself.
The group thought maybe the President could award these on Sunday.  (they
originally wanted Monday night.)

5. There is some left-wing protest planned for Sunday, with rhetoric that
this is a sham designed to cover up increasing poverty and signing of
welfare bill. Endorsers include Mumia Abu Jamal, the celebrated guy on
Death Row, Noam Chomsky, Ramsey Clark, lots of labor union locals,
although apparently not the leadership, and a zillion small left groups.

6. Sunday day of service on Germantown Road has kickoffs at 10:30 and 1:30
led by Powell, with calisthenics led by Schwarzenegger. They asked if
POTUS would be there Sunday in time for 1:30; we said we'd get back to
them.

7. We said we'd want a speaking role for VP on Monday am, and for FL on
Tuesday. They said they'd "get back to us." Sounded more positive about
VP, although they will put him earlier in the Monday program, before all
the Presidents talk.
