TEXT:
Oan Mendelson has a new idea of a fall-back on Hutchison: to add language
enabling lawsuits on the federal portion of the Medicaid costs and stating
the settlements to date were for just state costs. He's going to get the
OMB GC to look into the legality and whether such a provision would be
possible and likely upheld as constitutional if done on a retroactive
basis.

I would much prefer to have states devote a portion to youth smoking, but
what do you think?
