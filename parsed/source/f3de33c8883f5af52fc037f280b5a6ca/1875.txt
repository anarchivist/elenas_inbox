TEXT:
Bruce Lindsey has one change to recommend, as shown below:

The Securities and Exchange Commission has just released a
report that I requested, assessing the effects of last yearO,s legislation,
including the ActO,s impact on litigation, investor protection, and
information made available to investors. We will be
reviewing the SEC study and other reports and data to assess the
need for further legislation action. We look forward to working with you
on this important issue.

Thanks.
