Subj ect :         Q & A FOR PRESS CONFERENCE

The President will do a joint press conference with President Kim of South
Korea Friday night.   I have noted below the Q & A we think we need from
each office, but more is welcome if you you think it's necessary.

 With the time change, we need to submit our briefing book to him COB
Thursday, so please e-mail your guidance to Heather Riley by Thursday noon.

The press conference should be short (3 questions apiece) so hopefully
this project won't be too taxing on everyone. As always, thanks to all
for your help.

NEC
Social Security (conference, Livingston, bipartisan progress)
Asia Economy (Japan package)
Russia Economy
Trade (fast track, Asia)

DPC
Can't think of anything -- let us know if you can.

NSC
Iraq
Mid-East
