TEXT:
1. CEQ decided to send the American Heritage Rivers memo without Bruce'S
signature just for the purpose of getting it out.   They are anxious to
make clear that they appreciate our leadership on this so far.

2. Brad Campbell should be e-mailing you a version of the kids e.o. to go
into interagency review (probably this weekend). Brad tells me he has
fully incorporated my replacement structure, which I hope will respond to
OSTP et al.   (we will still have some tough issues on this order, and may
need a principals mtg). If you have any problems or want to discuss this
please call me at home this weekend, I will be on my own with kids for a
few days and can not come into work Sat or Sun. I can easily talk on the
phone, reach me at I   P6/(b)(6) I
3. As you know I will be out on Monday getting an earful from labor and
enviros on NY-NJ dredging. I will give you an update upon return.

4. My detall here runs out in exactly one month. Next week, I would very
much like to discuss how to make sure we don't lose track of the
priorities I'm working on--whether or not you want to make a change in
staffing (or DPC's role in these issues).
