TEXT:
Cynthia and I met with-Mark Greenberg yesterday to quietly get his advice
on potential ways out of the minimum wage/workfare box, if that becomes
necessary.

His best idea was to return to an idea floated during debate on the law
let states count people toward the work requirements if they leave the
welfare rolls for a private sector job, for a limited number of months.
The obvious arguments against this are:  It is just another way to loosen
the work requirements; and this idea was an alternative to the caseload
reduction credit that was ultimately enacted, _so this would allow double
dipping by states.

Mark's response to this was that this is a better way to loosen work
requirements than other ways, because it creates an incentive, relative to
current law, for states to stress private sector jobs over workfare.
(Also, it is rhetorically better than approaches like counting job search
or education -- we are saying give states credit for private sector
jobs. )

He also argues that states with low benefits like Mississippi are at a
disadvantage relative to state with high benefits and generous income
disregards, like Michigan, and this would help redress that -- i.e., many
people that Michigan puts to work are able to remain on the welfare rolls
because of these more generous policies, and still count toward the work
participation requirements, while someone who works just a few hours in
Mississippi has income too high to keep their benefits, and therefore
Mississippi can't count them as a success.

He also    argued that the double count problem was not all that significant,
because    the case load reduction credit is lagged a year, but Cynthia and I
weren't    so sure his logic was good here. Maybe we could do this and shave
back on    the caseload reduction credit? Not sure if that works.

We are checking to see if this was in our 94 and 96 bills.
