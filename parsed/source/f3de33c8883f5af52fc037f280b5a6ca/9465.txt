H.R. 2327 - Drive for Teen Employment Act
(Combest (R) TX and 80 others)

The Administration opposes H.R. 2327, which would weaken existing
restrictions on the employment of minors in jobs requiring the operation
of motor vehicles.  The Administration is concerned that this legislation,
which would increase the permissible amount of on-the-job driving by
minors, could result in an increase in the number of automobile-related
injuries and fatalities involving young and inexperienced drivers.

* * * * * * * * * *


 (DO Not Distribute Outside Executive Office of the President)

This position was developed by LRD (Benton) in consultation with HRD
(Matlack/Bond). The Departments of Labor (), Justice (), Commerce (),
Transportation (), and Health and Human Services have reviewed the
proposed position and have either no comment or no objection.

Legislative History

H.R. 2327 was introduced on July 31, 1997. On March 5, 1998, H.R. 2327
was approved by the Workforce Protections Subcommittee by voice vote, with
an amendment in the nature of a substitute. The amendment made a number
of changes intended to clarify that the bill would not affect the
requirements of the Department of LaborO,s current regulations governing
job-related driving by teenagers. On April 1, 1998, the Education and the
Workforce Committee ordered the bill reported without further changes.
The Committee report is not yet available.

Administration position to Date

The Department of Labor sent a letter to Representatives Ballenger and
Andrews on March 5, opposing H.R. 2327 as introduced.  In its letter,
Labor expressed its opposition to the bill and concern that the bill could
"increase the number of automobile-related injuries and deaths caused by
young and inexperienced drivers."

Labor sent a similar letter to Rep. Goodling on March 31, 1998, prior to
the full CommitteeO,s consideration of the bill.

Background and Summary of H.R. 2327 as Ordered Reported

  Current Department of Labor regulations (29 CFR 6570.52) permit minors
  between the ages of 16 and 18 to operate motor vehicles as part of their
  jobs, if: (1) driving is "occasional and incidental" to the job; (2) all
  driving is performed during daylight hours; (3) the driving does not
. involve the towing of vehicles; (4) the minor has completed a
  State-approved driverO,s education course and holds an appropriate
  license; (5) the vehicle is equipped with an adequate number of seat belts
  and the employer has instructed the minor employee to use them; and (6)
  the vehicle being operated does not exceed 6,000 pounds gross vehicle
  weight.

The billO,s sponsors argue that the regulations are poorly defined and
outdated, and have been too narrowly construed by Labor. According to the
billO,s sponsors, a number of employers have been fined for allowing their
teenage employees to perform limited job-related driving.  They argue that
LaborO,s current interpretation of the regulations restricts the ability
of teenagers to gain workplace experience and participate in
school-to-work activities. H.R. 2327 is intended to clarify the amount of
job-related driving 16- and 17-year old employees are permitted to perform
as part of their jobs.

H.R. 2327 would amend section 13(c) of the Fair Labor Standards Act (29
U.S.C. 213(c)) to permit individuals between the ages of 16 and 18 to
operate automobiles or trucks as part of their job, provided that certain
conditions are met.  with the exception of the "occasional and incidental"
requirement, the bill would add to the FLSA all of the conditions
specified in the regulations.  In addition, the bill would establish two
additional l~mitations on job-related driving by minors: (1) the job
cannot involve driving beyond 50 miles from the minor employeeO,s


workplace, and (2) the amount of driving cannot exceed one-third of a
minorD,s workday and 20 percent of a minorD,s workweek.

Pay-As-YOu-Go Scoring According to HRD (Bond), H.R. 2327 would not affect
direct spending or receipts; therefore, it is not subject to the
pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of
1990. CBO concurs.
