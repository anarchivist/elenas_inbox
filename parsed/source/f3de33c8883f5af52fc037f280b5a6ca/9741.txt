The following is a brief summary of Magana-Pizano v. INS, 1998 U.S. App. Lexis 21355

Facts

Magana-Pizano was convicted in February 1995 in California state court of being under the
influenc~ of cocaine and methamphetamine, a misdemeanor offense. On May 17, 1996, the INS
issued an Order to Show cause to Magana-Pizano alleging that he was deportable as a result of
that misdemeanor criminal conviction. At his deportation hearing, Magana-Pizano conceded his
deportability as a result of his drug conviction, but indicated that he would apply for a
discretionary waiver of deportation under Section 212(c) of the INA.

Unbeknownst to him, Congress had already passed the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty
Act of 1996 (AEDPA) which amended Section 212(c) to eliminate discretionary relief for aliens
convicted of most drug-related crimes, including Magana-Pizano's. As a result of this statutory
change, the INS filed a motion to pretermit Magana-Pizano's application for relief under INS
Section 212(c), arguing that Section 440(d) of AEDPA and its amendment of Section 212(c)
were effective as of the date of passage on April 24, 1996. The Immigration Judge granted the
INS's motion to pretermit Magana-Pizano's application and ordered Magana-Pizano deported to
Mexico.

Magana-Pizano appealed this decision to the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) which
sustained the deportation order. Magana-Pizano then filed a timely petition for review of the
BIA's decision with the 9th Circuit.

Magana-Pizano also filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.c. 2241 in the
U.S. District Court. In his habeas petition, he argued that the BIA's decision and interpretation
of section 440(d) of the AEDPA violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution. The
district court dismissed the complaint for lack of jurisdiction, explaining that the statutory basis
for habeas review for aliens in custody pursuant to an order of deportation was repealed by a
different section of the AEDPA (section 401(e». Magana-Pizano filed an appeal to the 9th
circuit of that decision.

Issues on Appeal

·       Whether the BIA correctly held that Magana-Pizano was ineligible for discretionary relief
        under Section 212(c) of the INA. Magana-Pizano challenged the BIA's interpretation of
        AEDP A section 440( d) and its applicability to this case.

·       Whether INA Section 242(g) violates the Suspension Clause ofthe constitution by
        eliminating habeas corpus jurisdiction in cases where no other avenue of judicial review
        exists.

The 9th Circuit held that it could not reach the merits of the first issue, because of new
limitations that Congress has placed on the court's ability to hear such claims. The court further
held that Magana-Pizano could pursue habeas corpus relief under 28 U.S.c. 2241 in the U.S.
                                                                Automated Records Management System

1.      Appeal ofthe BIA decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals

Prior to the passage ofIIRIRA, the U.S. Court of Appeals was the proper tribunal for parties who
wished judicial review of a BIA decision. INA Section 106(a) provided that an alien could
obtain judicial review by the appropriate court of appeals after entry of a final order of
deportation. That section of the INA was repealed by IIRIRA. Because the BIA's decision
holding Magana-Pizano statutorily ineligible for relief was issued March 17, 1997 (prior to
IIRIRA's April 1, 1997 effective date) IIRIRA's transitional provisions apply to his case.

The transitional rules clearly establish that "there shall be no appeal permitted in the case of an
alien who is inadmissible or deportable by reason of having committed a [covered] criminal
offense." Under this new scheme established by IIRIRA, the circuit courts retain a limited scope
of judicial review for aliens who are deportable for these criminal offenses to determine whether
the petitioner is (i) an alien; (ii) deportable (iii) by reason of a criminal offense listed in the
statute.

The court concluded that by creating the transitional rules, Congress evidenced a specific intent
for IIRIRA to apply retroactively to pending cases. It then further held that Magana-Pizano's
argument -- that the Immigration Judge's and BIA's reading of AEDPA Section 40(d) constitutes
an impermissible retroactive application ofthe amended statute -- is not within the narrow scope
of the circuit court's review on direct appeal under IIRIRA'a transitional rules. Thus, the court
dismissed Magana-Pizano's petition for review for lack of jurisdiction.

2.      Judicial review pursuant to 28 U.S.c. 2241

Prior to the passage of AEDPA and IIRIRA, aliens wishing to challenge the constitutionality of a
final order of deportation via habeas corpus did so using one of two general methods: (1)
proceeding pursuant to INA Section 106(a); or (2) proceeding pursuant to the general statutory
habeas provision of28 U.S.C. Section 2241. The AEDPA repealed INA Section 106(a) and
eliminated most judicial review for criminal aliens subject to removal. The statute provides a
streamlined approach for consideration by the courts of appeals of claims arising from removal
orders and the procedures leading to them. See 8 U.S.C. 1252(b) (giving the courts of appeals
jurisdiction to hear those claims by way of a petition for review of a final order of removal).
However, those subject to the transitional rules -- applicable to cases arising before the effective
date ofIIRIRA -- do not get the benefit of the judicial review provisions of 8 U.S.C. 1252(b).

The question in this case was whether INA Section 242(g) (the statutory provision eliminating all
federal court jurisdiction) can be constitutionally applied in cases where no other avenue of
judicial review exists. The court held that it could not -- i.e., that eliminating all judicial review
of executive detention violates the constitution. The court further held that to the extent that
habeas remedies in immigration cases are protected by the Suspension Clause, relief is afforded

    through the statutory remedy of28 U.S.C. 2241.

    Conclusion

    This case, most significantly, stands for the proposition that INA Section 242(g) does not remove
    jurisdiction under 28 V.S.c. 2241 for cases where no other avenue of judicial review exists for
    constitutional claims.

    Rob Weiner is looking into the specifics of this case, including whether the Department of
    Justice intends to pursue an appeal in the Supreme Court.
