      So much for getting ONDCP to agree on holding off on the veto threat --
      and so much for arguing w/something a bit more persuasive (i.e., violating
      balanced budget, not supporting the office, not including tobacco) .

      UMcCaffrey rejects House drug-fight goals



     WASHINGTON (AP)    The White House is considering a veto of a
 House-passed bill that would require the administration to cut drug
 use by more than half within four years, said President Clinton's
 top drug policy adviser.
     The bill reauthorizing the Office of National Drug Control
 policy would tie federal money to congressionally set goals,
 including reducing drug use from the current 6.1 percent of the
 population to 3 percent by the end of 2001.
     --As political rhetoric, that's OK, " Barry McCaffrey, who heads
 the drug-control office, told reporters Wednesday. But cutting
 anti-drug money if the nation fails to reach an unreachable goal
 will hurt drug-fighting efforts, he said.      .
     --There was a debate over whether I should send over a threat of
 veto"   over the proposed bill, he said. --We didn't do it, yet."
     Rep. Dennis Hastert, R-III., chief sponsor of the bill, said the
 goal --is a virtual drug-free America by the year 2001. " The
 measure passed by voice vote Tuesday.
     The Clinton administration will make --a serious attempt to run
 drug abuse in America back where we think it ought to be, which is
 3 percent or under by 2007," McCaffrey said, saying the goal took
 a year to determine.
     House Speaker Newt Gingrich criticized McCaffrey's goals in an
 Oct. 7 letter released by MCCaffrey.
      --Winning the war on drugs does not mean that 10 years from now
 we should have more than 5 percent of our children as young as 12
 years old on drugs, " wrote Gingrich, saying the administration
 must --begin to take seriously the threat drugs pose to our
 children and their future.' ,
     Calling Gingrich --a brilliant man, " McCaffrey said he hoped
 that --some young polemicist wrote"   the letter and that Gingrich
 hadn't read it.
     McCaffrey said he was very confident the Senate --will sort this
 out" with the help of Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, who chairs the
 Judiciary Committee.
     McCaffrey, just back from a South American tour, said new·
 leadership in Bolivia will lead to an end of that country's coca
 cultivation. Most of the coca leaf used in U.S.-consumed cocaine
 comes from Bol:lvia.
     Bolivia's drug production has stayed level or risen slightly
 despite $850 million in U.S. anti-drug support the past five years,
 but McCaffrey said that could soon change.
     --The young guys (in top government positions), meaning the ones
 in their 40s, want to no longer be ashamed of their standing in the
 world, and they have publicly stated that they're going to
 eliminate co.ca production in five years,"  he said. --I am
 convinced their thinking is sound and their commitment appears to
 be genuine.' ,
