TEXT:
John asked me to send this note since he is out of the office.

The Charter School meeting that was tentatively scheduled for this Friday
has been moved at the request of the Dept. of Education and will be
rescheduled for sometime next week.  Education requested more time to work
on background material for this meeting.

Jon - I left a message for Stuart Ishimaru of DOJ/Civil Rights Div
