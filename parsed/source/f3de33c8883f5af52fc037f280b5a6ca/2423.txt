TEXT:
Elena      Maria's feeling was that the very fine economic development/job

outline JUlie, Paul et al. have developed is "too late" to attach to the

paper we've already sent to POTUS. But if we in fact meet with him

tomorrow, we can hand it to him depending on how the meeting goes.



I suggest you chat with Julie about my comments on the draft, and our plans

for the next steps.



[of course, all of this assumes he wants to move forward, and that he wants

to do so using Maria's process]
