 PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
 REMARKS BEFORE NATIONAL BOARD FOR
 PROFESSIONAL TEACHING STANDARDS
 THE WHITE HOUSE
 OCTOBER 24, 1997

 Acknowledgments: Sec. Riley, Rebecca Palacios [Puh- LAY-see-ohsl, Members
 of Congress


         I want to congratulate Governor Hunt on ten successful years at
 the helm of this very important organization.  Because of you and the work
 of the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards. more teachers
 are being challenged to fulfill their greatest potential as teachers and,
 just as important, being rewarded for their innovation and commitment to
 our children.

         Arid r know if anyone is up to the task of filling Governor HuntO,s
 shoes, itO,s Barbara Kelley. She has worked tirelessly to improve
 education in he~ home state of Maine and has already served the National
 Board very well as its vice-chair. Barbara, r have to say, youO,ve drawn
 quite a crowd for your first day on the job.

          Six years ago, I challenged America to envision a bold course for our
 country in the 21st Century -- to make the American Dream come alive for
 every person responsible enough to work for it, to keep our country the
 worldO,s strongest force for peace and freedom and prosperity, to bring
 our people together across all the lines that divide us, into one America.

         Together, weO,ve made great progress -- our economy is growing,
 crime is down, our social fabric is mending.  But we have much more to
 do. Every one of you here is engaged' in the most important task our
 country faces -- providing all of our children the world-class education
 they need to make the most of their lives in the next century. The future
 rests in your hands -- and in the hands of teachers just like you.

         As you know, meeting this challenge wonO,t be easy. No quick-fix
 will fix our schools. No single gimmick will give our children the
 education they are counting on.  Instead, we need patient progress and
 comprehensive reform. My Administration is fighting to raise academic and
 teaching standards, to bring more choice and competition into public
 education, to equip our classrooms with the latest technology, and to
 empower parents to take active roles in their childrenO,s education.

         I have called on all Americans to work with me to make sure that
 every eight-year old can. read, every l2-year old can log onto the
 Internet, every lB-year old can go to college, and all Americans can keep
 learning throughout a lifetime.

          The historic balanced budget I signed last summer brings us closer
 to these goals, throwing open the doors of the college even wider through
 education IRAs, expanded Pell Grants, Hope Scholarships and other tax
 credits. The budget will also go a long way toward completing our mission
 to (connect ,every classroom and library to the Internet by the year 2000.
          But these things will mean little unless our children master the
 basics. I am committed to setting high national standards of academic
 excellence and voluntary tests in fourth grade reading and eighth grade
 math. Through national standards, our parents and teachers can make sure
 that their children gain the skills they need to thrive in our global
 economy. And I thank Governor Hunt for being one of the first Governors
 to support national standards.

         And we must work through American Reads to send an army of
 volunteer reading tutors into our schools to help every child read
 indepenoently by the end of third grade.  rO,d like thank Congress for
 taking the first step toward making this idea a reality.

         Raising the quality of teaching is an essential part of my
 comprehensive plan. As we all know from experience, a single
 extraordinary teacher can literally change a childO,s life, providing him


 or h~r with the inspiration and the' tools to fulfill his most cherished
 dreams.

         We must reward excellence in teaching and national board
 certification defines excellence. That is why I have asked Congress for
 $105 million over the next five years to help 100,000 teachers earn board
 certification as master teachers. Think of the difference one master
 teacher -- one of you -- can make in each school across our country.  I
 know that if we can get at least one master teacher in every school, then
 that one teacher can inspire colleagues, revitalize classrooms, and
 challenge our children to reach higher than ever.

         All across America, states, school districts and businesses are
 already stepping up to the challenge. , Eight states and many local school
 systems offer board certified teachers higher salaries. Last month, the
 Los Angeles Unified School District and the United Teachers oD Los Angeles
 agreed to reward board certified teachers with a 15 percent raise. And
 just a few days ago, the McGraw-Hill company joined forces with the New
 York City Board of Education, the United Federation of Teachers, and New
 York University to prepare more teachers for board certification.

          These public-private partnerships are crucial to our schools.  I
 call every state, every school board, every business to help our teachers
 become master teachers. Our students can only reach high standards if our
 teachers do.

         And as the National Board continues to define "what teachers
 should know and be able to do," I urge you to make the effective use of
 technology an important part of these standards. Our teachers should be
 as comfortable with a computer as they are with a chalkboard.

         Finally, we must challenge more of our finest young people to
 consider teaching as a career. I call upon Congress to support my
 proposal for a $350 million scholarship program modeled on the National
 Medical Service Corps. The scholarship will pay for a talented young
 personD,s education in exchange for a promise to teach children growing up
 in our most underprivileged communities. And it will strengthen teacher
 training in those colleges that work directly with inner city and poor
 rural schools.

         So I thank all of you for the important work you do every day on
 behalf of our children. Every one of you made a decision that you would
 give yourselves to the next generation, that you would prepare America for
 tomorrow.  Henry Adams once said that D&Our teachers affect eternity; they
 can never tell where their influence stops.DB But we know where it begins
 -- with each child whose life is enriched by your talents and dedication.
