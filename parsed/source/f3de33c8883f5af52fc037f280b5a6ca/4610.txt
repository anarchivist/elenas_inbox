TEXT:
The new numbers show welfare caseloads have declined by 26% or 3.6 million
since President Clinton took office (down from 24%). Wyoming's caseload
has now declined a whopping 70%.  Thirteen states· have declines over 40%.
California is now down by 3%; Hawaii is still the only stae with an
increase (36%).

We are holding these for an appropriate announcement    for example, the
child support/fathers radio address this weekend (if we do one) .
