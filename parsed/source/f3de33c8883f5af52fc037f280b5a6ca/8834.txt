TEXT:
Sorry about the botched last message everyone.  The companies have been
buying very little of the farmers' tobacco in the early sales thus far,
creating anxiety in their community.   I was dropping a line to tell you
that tobacco companies and farmers were on the hill yesterday reportedly
meeting with Faircloth as they attempted to negotiate increases in future
tobacco sales. The farmers feel they are in a very precarious position
and would like to help push something.

Senator Robb's office called offering to sponsor something that would
supplement an AG settlement -- such as the equivelent of an additional 40
cent per pack increase that would do FDA, counteradvertising, repay some
federal health costs and, of course farmers.

Senator Ford's office suggests conveying to Easley that he should not be
negotiating a settlement that does not include farmers.  Ford tried
putting together a deal including the tobacco states including $20 billion
for farmers over 25 years.  Whatever figure we believe is right, they'd
like the WH to convey that we think there should be money put aside to
protect farmers as the markets decline.

Waxman
Cynthia and I had suggested to Waxman that in order to solve his problem
 (of looking for a no-cost provision they could add for farmers) Waxman
consider including a domestic tobacco purchase requirement in their
tobacco bill. E. Drye faxed over some language. USDA has now reviewed
that language, says it looks fine in terms of making the companies buy
domestic tobacco but as expected, would have serious GATT problems.   They
don't have any better alternative that comes at no cost.   I would suggest
that Waxman reach out to Etheridge and see what they suggest and if they
would prefer this included in the bill.
