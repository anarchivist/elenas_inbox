MEMORANDUM FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
                  SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY

Subject         Preventing fireanns sales to prohibited purchasers

Since 1993, my Administration has worked to give law enforcement agencies and the
communities they serve the tools they need to rid our neighborhoods of gangs, guns and drugs --
and to reduce crime and the fear of crime. Our strategy is working. Through the historic 1994
Crime Act, we have helped drive down the crime rate for six years in a row -- to its lowest point
in a generation. Keeping guns out of the hands of criminals has been a key part of our strategy,
and tough -- but sensible -- measures like the Brady Law and ban on assault weapons have
contributed to our success. In fact, over the past 5 years, the Brady Law has helped prevent well
over a quarter of a million handgun sales to felons, fugitives, domestic violence abusers and other
prohibited purchasers -- saving countless lives and preventing needless injuries.

On November 30, 1998, the permanent provisions of the Brady Law will take effect, and the
Department of Justice will implement the National Criminal Background Instant Check System
(NICS). The NICS will allow law enforcement officials to access to a fuller set of records than is
now available and will -- for the first time -- apply to the sale of long guns and to firearms transfers at
pawnshops. Overall, under the NICS, the number of background checks conducted before the
purchase of a firearm will increase from an estimated 4 million to more than 12 million.

We can, however, take additional steps to strengthen the Brady Law and to keep our streets safe from
gun-carrying criminals. Each year, an untold number of firearms are bought and sold at the estimated
5,000 private gun shows that take place across the country -- with most of these sales skirting the
Brady background check requirement. This loophole makes gun shows prime targets for criminals
and gun traffickers -- and effectively thwarts law enforcement efforts to trace firearms that are later
used in crimes. It should be closed once and for all.

Therefore, I request that, within 60 days, you recommend to me what actions our Administration can
take -- including proposed legislation -- to ensure that fireanns sales at gun shows are not exempt
from our federal gun laws.
