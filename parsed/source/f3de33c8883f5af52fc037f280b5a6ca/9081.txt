 TEXT:
 Aside from the usual "keeping America's food supply the safest in the
 world," is there anything in particular you think the radio address
 should, urn, address? I will ask Mary what the actual differences are
 between the President's Council on Food Safety and the Joint Institute for
 Food Safety Research we announced last month.  But is there a larger
 message framework, etc.?

 Also, any idea whether they're going to tape it live on Saturday?    Please
 let me know if you do.
