TEXT:
It shouldn't be too much trouble to produce a draft quickly on cloning.
My only question is to what extent are we refering to the Chicago
scientist who is publicizing his plan to clone human beings?

 Dr. Seed (that's really his name) just did an interview on CNN in which he
  said he was "an independent thinker," who "disagreed with the
  President." I'd love to use this a little (e.g., "this is not
  thinking -- it is science independent of ethics" or something.     P6/(b)(6)
I               P6/(b)(6)          ~  He is a PhD, working with a medical
  doctor who has said that he will not go forward until he receives
 permission from the American Society of Reproductive Physicians.

Other issues:

Progress of President's Bioethics Advisory Board?
Status of Legislation banning human cloning?

Let me know where you want me to go with this.    Thanks.
