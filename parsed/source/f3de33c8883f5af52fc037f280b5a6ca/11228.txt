PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
REMARKS ON LONG-TERM CARE TAX CREDIT
DOVER, NEW HAMPSHIRE
February 18, 1999

        Acknowledgments: Gov. Shaheen; panel members TK

         I want to thank the Governor for her remarks, and I especially
want to thank her for all sheD,s doing to improve the quality and
availability of health care here in New Hampshire.   I think her proposals
are good ones. And I think they will go a long way toward helping the
people of New Hampshire meet the challenges of health care in the 21st
Century.

        Today, before we hear from our panelists, I want to talk briefly
about another health care challenge and what we are doing to meet it. As
the Baby Boom becomes the Senior Boom, long-term care will become a
growing need.  So it is more important than ever that we help families
provide that essential kind of care for their loved ones.

        I will have more to say about that in a moment.  But first, let me
just step back and put this issue in a larger context. Really, what
weD,re talking about this morning is not just health care but the choices
you in New Hampshire are making and people allover America are making for
the future.

        We in Washington have some choices to make, too. As you know, we
are engaged in a great debate right now about how to use the budget


surplus. Now, we can all agree that America should have tax cuts. But
there are two very different ways we can go about it.   First, there is the
old way -- tried-and-true, failed and full of risk. Some Republicans say
cut taxes first, save Social Security later.       Cut taxes first,
strengthen Medicare later, if at all . . . Cut taxes first, pay down the
national debt later, if at all. We have heard this plan before.     It says:
splurge today, save tomorrow.

        That is not my approach. My approach says invest today, save for
tomorrow.  My kind of tax cut is one that doesnD,t destroy our fiscal
discipline, but preserves it. My kind of tax cut is not indiscriminate,
but is, instead, targeted to meet peopleD,s real needs for the future.
Above all, my kind of tax cut allows us to meet our responsibility to
future generations -- and to invest the lion's share of the surplus in
saving Social Security and Medicare first.

        If we make the right choice, future generations wonD,t say we
squandered our historic opportunity to save Social Security and Medicare,
and pay down the debt. As I said in my State of the Union Address one
month ago, we can make good on that opportunity -- while providing tax
relief like USA Accounts, and while making targeted tax cuts in areas from
urban investment to clean energy technology, and from child care to
long-term care. That is the way we should use our surplus: We should
invest it.  Invest it in AmericaD,s future.

         The long-term care tax cut I proposed last month makes exactly the
right kind of investment. .It will help meet the needs of one of the
fastest-growing segments of our population -- people over 85. Nearly half
need help with everyday tasks, from eating to visiting the doctor, and we
cannot expect them to fend for themselves. That is why millions of
households are now caring for elderly relatives and neighbors and people
with disabilities.

        Providing long-term care at home is, more and more often, a common
choice, but it is rarely an easy one.  Since this kind of care is rarely
covered by private insurance or Medicare, out-of-pocket expenses can be
high.  So, too, are the professional costs.  Caregivers who hold jobs
outside the home -- and that is a vast majority -- may have to take unpaid
leave or work fewer hours to fulfill all their responsibilities.

        We are working to ease the burdens on these families in a number
of ways: by strengthening Medicare, by making it more flexible, and by
improving nursing homes.  But the aging of America in the 21st Century
will demand more of us. And that is why I have proposed a long-term care
tax credit of $1,000 for people with long-term care needs or for the
families that shelter them. This targeted tax cut is paid for in my
balanced budget.  It would help meet the individual needs of individual
families -- supplementing the care they already provide, empowering them
to do what is best, showing them how very much we value the work they do.

         Our parents worked and saved and sacrificed for us in our youth;
adult children are working and saving and sacrificing for their parents in
old age.   It is the cycle of life and one we should recognize and reward
as a nation.

        There is more we must do to keep America strong and healthy in the
21st Century, and the Governor talked about some of those things. We
should also join together across party lines to pass a strong, enforceable
PatientsD, Bill of Rights -- as well as the landmark legislation proposed
by Senators Kennedy, Jeffords, Roth, and Moynihan to allow people with


disabilities to keep their health insurance when they go to work.  We must
keep working to help small businesses insure their employees; and keep
working until our uninsured kids have the coverage they need and deserve.
In 1997, we passed the largest investment in childrenO,s health in a
generation, helping extend coverage to up to 5 million children; and now,
in states across the country, Governors like Jeanne Shaheen are working to
implement their programs.

          I know our panelists have some important perspectives on these
issues.    I am looking forward to starting that discussion.
