TEXT:
There are two education events we can do in the near future:

1. Ending Social Promotions: We can release a guidebook from Education
on ending social promotions, and announce our FY 2000 budget proposal to
help schools do this with after-school money.-

The guide is near completion, but not yet there, and Mike Smith and I have
substantive differences in the tone and approach. Given the other things
we are wrestling over, I'm not sure if we will get this done by the week
between CHristamas and New Years, but early-mid January is a good bet.

2.  Implementation of New Education Initiatives.   The grants announcements
for GEAR UP and Teacher Quality (HEA Title II) are in OMB for review.
The Guidance for Class Size implementation is in its second draft.   These
should be ready for announcement' early-mid January.
