TEXT:
FYI, orginally this was going to be announced with the adoption report.
However, since there is now no scheduled event around the adoption
directive/report, do we still want to do something with the Ohio child
welfare waiver? HHS is working out final details with the state and can
be ready to go with it anytime.
