MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:                     Bruce Reed
                          Gene Sperling
                          Elena Kagan

SUBJECT:                  New Initiatives on Discretionary Side of Budget

OMB is working on finding an additional $6 billion for discretionary spending. Within that
constraint, the NEC and DPC ahve agreep on allocations that OMB has signed off on. While
you may find that Department appeals call for decreasing the funds for new initiatives, we
wanted you to see how your White House budget team would allocate funds under these
constraints.

We already have given you detailed memos on most of these initiatives. If you approve the
initiatives, you can announce any or all of them in the State of the Union.

Because so many of the new initiatives involve education, we are attaching an appendix to this
memo that shows recommended funding levels for the Department of Education's major base
programs.

Education

1. Education Opportunity Zones ($225 million): This initiative will provide funding to about
25 high-poverty urban and rural school districts for agreeing to adopt a "Chicago-type" school
reform agenda that includes ending social promotions, removing bad teachers, reconstituting
failing schools, and adopting district-wide choice.

2. College-School Partnerships ($150 million): This initiative, which builds on Eugene
Lang's model of helping disadvantaged youth, will provide funding for college-school
partnerships designed to provide mentoring, tutoring, and other support services to students in
high-poverty schools, starting in the sixth grade and continuing through high school. The
six-year funding path would provide help to nearly 2 million students. It will also include Chaka
Fattah's idea of early notification to disadvantaged 6th graders telling them of their Pell Grant
and loan eligibility.

3. Campaign on Access to Higher Education ($20 million): This initiative will fund an
intensive publicity campaign on the affordability of higher education. The goal of the campaign
will be to make every family aware that higher education is now universally accessible -- and that
                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion
                                                                                                       2

it is the key to higher earnings. As part of this effort -- and to complement the college-school
partnership program described above -- we will provide families at high-poverty middle schools
with an official notification of the $20,000 or more that is already available for their children to
go to college.


4. Teacher Recruitment and Preparation ($67 million): This initiative, which you previewed
last July at the NAACP Conference, will provide scholarships to nearly 35,000 new teachers over
five years for committing to work in high-poverty urban and rural schools. It also will upgrade
the quality o(teacher preparation programs serving these communities.

5. Technology Teacher Training ($222 million): This initiative increased the Technology
Literacy Challenge from $425 million to $475 million and then dedicates 30 percent of the
Technology Literacy Challenge Fund to ensure that at least one teacher in every school receives
intensive training in the use of technology for education, so that they can train their colleagues.
An additional $80 million will begin an effort to train every new teacher in the latest technology.

6. Hispanic Education Action Plan - ($195 million or more): This initiative will increase
funding for a number of existing programs to improve education for Hispanic Americans and
other limited English proficient (LEP) children and adults. It would double our investment in
training teachers to address the needs ofLEP children; boost the Migrant Education Program by
16 percent; increase the TRIO college preparation program by 10 percent; and create a 5-year,
$100 million effort to disseminate best practices in ESL training for adults. We would
accompany these program increases with administrative actions to help Hispanic students
complete high school and succeed in college.

Child Care

       We recommend placing most of the child care initiative -- in particular, the proposed
increase in the Child Care and Development Block Grant and the establishment of a new Early
Learning Fund -- on the mandatory side of the budget. The smaller pieces of the initiative that
we propose placing on the discretionary side are the following:

1. After-School Program Expansion ($150 million): This program expansion will increase
funding ofthe 21st Century Community Learning Center Program (now funded at $40 million)
for before- and after-school programs for school-age children at public schools. Depending on
the exact funding level chosen, this investment will create new programs in 1,500-4,000 schools.

2. Standards Enforcement Fund ($100 million): This new fund will support state efforts to
improve licensing systems and to enforce health and safety standards, particularly through
unannounced inspections of child care settings. The fund also will enable states to issue report
cards, for use by consumers, on the quality of the facilities inspected.
                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion                     3


  3. Provider Training ($51-60 million): A new Child Care Provider Scholarship Fund, which
  you proposed at the Child Care Conference to fund at $50 million annually, will support 50,000
  scholarships each year to students working toward a child care credential. The students will
  commit to remaining in the field for one year for each year of assistance received, and will eam
  increased compensation or bonuses when they receive their credential. An additional $1-10
. million will allow the Department of Labor to expand its Child Care Apprenticeship Training
  Program, which funds providers combining work toward a degree with on-the-job practice.

4. Research and Evaluation Fund ($10-30 million): This new fund will provide grants for
research projects, establish a National Center on Child Care Statistics, and set up a national child
care hotline.

5. Paid Leave Demonstration Fund ($10 million): This small evaluation and demonstration
fund will support communities and organizations that are testing and/or studying innovative
approaches to providing financial assistance to parents who wish to stay home with their
newborns.

6. Head Start and Early Head Start Expansion ($334 million): This level of increased
investment in the overall Head Start budget should permit doubling the set-aside for Early Head
Start without reducing the resources available for children 3-5. The doubled set-aside would
enable more than 35,000 additional children to receive Early Head Start services in 2002.

Welfare, Housing, Urban

1. Welfare-to~Work Housing Vouchers ($283 million): This initiative will provide 50,000
new housing vouchers to help welfare recipients in public housing who need to move in order to
find employment. HUD will distribute these vouchers on a competitive basis to public housing
authorities working with local TANF agencies and/or grantees of the new $3 billion
welfare-to-work program.

2. Housing Portability/Choice ($20 million): In addition to the new welfare-to-work housing
vouchers discussed above, our proposed package on housing portability and choice expands
Regional Opportunity Counseling sites and takes administrative actions to eliminate obstacles to
portability in the Section 8 housing program.

3. "Play-by-the-Rules" Homeownership Proposal ($30 million): This initiative would
enable the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation to assist approximately 10,000 families who
have a perfect track record of paying their rent on time become homeowners. This initiative will
help families become homeowners through downpayment assistance, interest rate buydowns, or
rehabilitation loans.

 4. Homeownership Opportunity Fund ($11 million): This initiative will allow HUD to
 develop a loan guarantee program to allow state and local governments to leverage current
 HOME funds with private-sector investments to fund large scale, affordable housing
 developments in distressed cornmunities.

 5. Community Empowerment Fund ($400 million): This initiative establishes a
 public/private fund ("Eddie Mac"), which will invest in inner-city businesses and create a
 secondary market for economic deVelopment loans (like Fannie Mae).

 Raise FHA Loan Limit (Raises $150-$200 million): The budget currently includes this
 proposal to raise the FHA loan limits, helping more middle-income Americans get home
 mortgages which have low downpayment requirements. The first $150 million of revenue
 raised through this proposal would be used to pay for Round II of Empowerment Zones .

. Homeless Assistance The budget currently includes a substantial increase in homeless assistance
  of approximately $341 million (above FY98). This includes $177 million to help 32,000
  homeless receive Section 8 vouchers.

 Homeownership Voucher Initiative (No Cost): The budget will include our proposal to allow
 Section 8 vouchers to be used for homeownership. This proposal was originally included in our
 Public Housing Reform bill. You should know that Freddie Mac has already agreed to purchase
 up to 2,000 of these Section 8 voucher mortgages from lenders -- secondary market participation
 is essential to reassure, and therefore, recruit lenders. The downpayment for these mortgages
 would be set at 3 percent, to allow low and very-low income families to participate.

 Fair Lending (No Cost): As described in previous memos, we are working on a fair-lending
 initiative which has no budgetary impact. The proposals being developed by an interagency
 working group include, for example, (1) an examination of the impact of credit scoring and
 risk-based pricing on the availability of credit/capital to lower-income and minority individuals;
 (2) a Presidential call to obtain more data on reasons for home mortgage loan denials; and (3)
 collection of race and income data as part of the CRA small business lending report requirement.

 Fair Housing: The budget provides an additional $8 million for enforcement which will help
 HUD meet the goal of doubling Fair Housing Enforcement actions. The budget also includes
 $10 million for a new system of Metropolitan Area Testing to root out the vestiges of housing
 discrimination.

 Labor and Workforce

 1. Child Labor ($89 million): This initiative is anchored by a $30 million commitment -- up
 from $3 million -- to the International Program on the Elimination of Child Labor (lPEC). The
 initiative also will include funding to improve Customs Service enforcement of U.S. law banning
                                                             Hex-Dump Conversion                       5

the import of goods made with forced or bonded child labor ($3 million) and to double the
Department of Labor's enforcement of child labor laws in the agricultural sector ($4 million).
Finally, the initiative will provide additional funding to the Migrant Education Program so it can
reach 50,000 more migrant children ($50 million). We are developing non-budget items to fill
out the package.

2. Community Adjustment ($50 million): This initiative will fund the creation of the Office
of Community and Economic Adjustment (OCEA), which we proposed as part of the Fast Track
debate. As you know, this office will be modeled after the Defense Department's Office of
Economic Adjustment - the Administration's first point of contact with communities
experiencing a military base closure or defense plant closing. We expect the Office to help
35-40 communities in its {"Irst year of operation. The initiative also will fund a variety of
other efforts to assist communities that face sudden and severe economic dislocation.

Health

1. 21st Century Trust Fund ($1 billion): This initiative will provide substantial additional
funding to NIH ($750 million) and NSC ($250 million), ramp~ng up substantially over time, for
research activities, including into the treatment and cure of diseases. We will provide you with a
separate memo on this initiative in the next day or two. Funding for this initiative will come
from comprehensive tobacco legislation.

  2. AIDS Programs Expansion ($165 million): A funding increase for the Ryan White
  Program of about 15 percent will go principally toward ADAP, to ensure that new and effective
  treatments of AIDS reach those who need them. Some of the funds will support education and
  prevention programs operated by states, cities, and community health centers, as well as by the
. CDC.

3. Racial Disparities in Health Care ($80 million): This initiative will address racial
disparities in six areas of health care: infant mortality, breast and cervical cancer, heart disease
and stroke, diabetes, AIDS, and immunization. The proposal includes additional funding ($50
million) to established public health programs to adapt and apply their prevention and education
strategies to eliminate racial disparities. It also includes funding ($30 million) for thirty local
pilot projects to test innovative approaches to reach this goal.

 Crime

1. Community Prosecutors ($50 million): This initiative will provide grants to prosecutors for
innovative, community-based prosecution efforts, such as Eric Holder adopted in the District of
Columbia. A fill 80 percent of the grants will go to pay the salaries and training costs associated
with hiring or reassigning prosecutors to work directly with community residents.
                                                                                               6
                                                         Hex-Dump Conversion

A number of the above proposals --~, education opportunity zones, university-school
partnerships, housing vouchers -- can be presented as part of the race initiative, because they
target predominantly minority areas or provide disproportionate benefits to members of minority
groups. Other proposals described above -- the Hispanic dropout plan and the race and health
initiative -- have obvious and explicit race connections. In addition:

1. Civil Rights Enforcement ($68 million): This initiative will fund reforms to the EEOC and
the civil rights offices at DOJ, HUD, HHS, Education, and DOL. Most importantly, additional
funding of$37 million will allow the EEOC to expand its mediation program (allowing more
than 70 percent of all complainants to choose mediation by the year 2000), increase the average
speed of resolving complaints (from over 9 months to six) and reduce the EEOC's current
backlog (from 64,000 cases to 28,000). The initiative also will fund a dramatic expansion of
HUD's civil rights enforcement office (in the 30th anniversary year of the Fair Housing Act) and
improve coordination among the government's civil rights offices. We are preparing a number
of non-budgetary administrative actions, especially involving fair housing and lending, to
accompany our budget proposals in this area.
