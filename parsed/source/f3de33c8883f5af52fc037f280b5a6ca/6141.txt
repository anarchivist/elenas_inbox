TEXT:
I talked with Bob Deigleman (Justice/JMD) this afternoon concerning the
INS Booze-Allen study -- he was very upbeat.   He reported good news.
Booze-Allen, through their review effort to date, has come to the same
conclusion as the OMB passback -- enforcement and benefits should be
totally separated both in the field and headquarters.    Booze also agreed
to continue their contract and will focus on the implementation of this
concept through the March 1 contract due date.   Booze will have a draft
report completed by 2/16, as we suggested, and both Michael and Elena will
be invited to Senior Policy Board Meeting -- the first will be scheduled
next week (I told Bob that Julie and I would likely be the attendees --
but that Michael and Elana should be formally invited) .

Bob said that the meetings held last week turned this process around.  He
also reported that the AG told the Commissioner that she wanted INS to
ensure that DPC/oMB were fully involved in the restructuring process and
that the final outcome reflected what we wanted.  Bob also said that prior
to the Friday meeting, the Commissioner said that there shouldn't be any
disagreement with DPC/oMB because INS essentially got what it wanted
keeping the agency intact. Hopefully, this effort can now continue in a m
ore positive/constructive vein.

JMD/Booze will contact me and Julie tomorrow to further discuss the OMB
passback approach.  I will keep you posted.
