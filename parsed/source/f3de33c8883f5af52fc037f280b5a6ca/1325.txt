Message Creation Date was at 12-MAR-1997 20:28:00

TO:   DIRECTOR FRANK RAINES
  DEPUTY DIRECTOR JACK LEW
  DEPUTY DIRECTOR JOHN KOSKINEN

FROM: OMB LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS

DATE: MARCH 12, 1997

SUBJECT:   LEGISLATIVE REPORT


The House today passed H.Res. 89, calling on the President to submit another
budget to Congress by April 7th that balances by CBO, does not use a trigger or
a tax sunset mechanism, O&achievesOB a significant portion of the savings in
the first three years, and makes sufficient reforms to extend Medicare for a
O&substantialOB period of time.   The Resolution passed by a vote of 231 to
197. Freshman Republican Members Sununu (NH) , Granger (TX), and pitts (PAl led
the debate for the Resolution. Rules Committee Chairman Solomon and Kasich
reiterated their charges against the Administration Budget -- $69 billion
deficit in 2002, increases the deficit by $24 billion in FY98, 98% deficit
reduction in the last two years.   Kasich closed by assuring the House that they
would have a budget to consider on the House floor by April 15 or closely
thereafter.   Budget Ranking Member Spratt stressed the .RepublicansO, inability
to complete work by statutory deadline.   He repeated demands for the majority
to submit a budget, and charged that they do not know how to accommodate their
tax cuts in the context of a balanced budget.   Stenholm and Minge joined Spratt
in suggesting the Resolution is harmful to potential negotiations because it
could polarize the Democrats and Republicans in the House.

Professor Michael Boskin and Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Chairperson
Katherine Abraham testified today before the House Budget Committee on possible
revisions to the Consumer Price Index.  In his opening remarks, Kasich said
that he hopes we will do the right thing, be accurate, have a Commission, and
that the President will O&adopt the issue as another child.OB He said his
greatest concern was that O&demagogues will rule the day.OB Later, when Kasich
drilled Abraham on the calculation of cell phones in the CPI, she replied with
a reprisal: 0&1 thought demagogues were not to rule the day.OB



Congressman Spratt stressed that he wants to make changes professionally and
through the BLS. He echoed that, to the extent that it is a reasonable problem
or a manpower problem, he hopes the Committee will be willing to give the BLS
the resources that it needs.   Abraham, Boskin, and the Committee acknowledged
a D&substitutionD8 problem with the CPI figure, and said that the BLS should be
able to get a more accurate calculation'on the O&substituteD8 bias in the
market. Abraham lacked conviction, however, that the BLS can draw conclusions
about quality changes that result from new or disappearing goods.

On Thursday, the Government Reform and Oversight Committee will hold a hearing
on maximizing benefits from the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA).
Mayor Giuliani will testify.   (10:30am, Cannon 311) Also on Thursday, the
House Education and Workforce Committee will hold a hearing on the PresidentD,s
Education Proposals. (10:00 am, Rayburn 2175)

The Senate began consideration of S.J.Res. 18, the Hollings Constitutional
Amendment on Campaign Finance Reform.

HOUSE
The House adopted the·Rule to accompany H.Res. 89, Requesting the President
Submit another Budget, by a vote of 226 to 202.   (Mr Traficant was the only
Democrat who voted for the rule.)  Prior to the vote, the House ordered the
previous question on the Rule, which would have allowed for consideration of
the Coalition amendment.  It failed by a vote of 226 to 200.

The House passed (231-197) H.Res. 89, Requesting the President Submit another
Budget.   (Two Republicans voted against the Resolution, and eight Democrats
voted with the Republicans.)   While under consideration, the House rejected
(202-225) a Spratt motion to recommit the Resolution to the Committee, which
would have required the Congress -- and not the President -- submit a budget
and meet the statutory deadlines.
