          I would think the Administration would be opposed to having anyone

          testify about how specific provisions in the tobacco resolution proposed

          by the state Attorney Generals should be improved.     Such comments

          imply that the Administration has accepted that proposal as the basis for

          legislation.     The President rejected that approach and instead set out the

          five principles that should be the cornerstones of any legislation.



      Additionally. he met with Congressional leaders this week and suggested

          that they work together to draft legislation that would meet his five

          objectives.    The WH has been very careful not to address any specifics

          at this point.    The concerns of the Tribal Justice office can be raised

          during the review of any legislation that emerges from the process the

          president has suggested for global tobacco legislation.



          To provide specific comments on the proposal offered by the state

      Attorneys General would seem contrary to the tack the president is

          taking on this.



          I have taken the liberty of faxing the proposed testimony to Elena Kagan

          who is Chief of Staff to Bruce Reed who heads up the Office of

          Domestic policy in the White House.     This will get to them quicker than it

          would through regular channels.




Thanks, George
