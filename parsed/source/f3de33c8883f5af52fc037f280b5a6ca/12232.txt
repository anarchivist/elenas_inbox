TEXT:
Podesta had told Harkin the Administration would review his comparable
worth bill to see if we could endorse it.   So far, no one has told the
staff/Harkin that we can't endorse.   Caroline Fredrickson asked that she
and I go up today/tomorrow and deliver the bad news to Harkin's staff.
I'll do it, but am very open to alternatives or suggestions on how to
describe our conclusion.   Ideally, I'll keep the conversation focused on
the positive team aspect of the effort (the shared goal of getting rid of
the wage gap, the steps we should take together including our budget
measure); the shared problem we face (keeping the issue alive so the bills
keep getting attention -- noting the difficulty of even passing Daschle as
a first step);  and while we don't think we can get a consensus to endorse
Harkin's bill -- we think it is a winning situation to work together to
keep our focus on the problem.   Suggestions?
