      TEXT:
      HHS reports that today's rehearing before the Fourth Circuit seemed to go
      well. (Because one of the judges in the prior panel died, a new panel was
      assembled.)   The judges asked only a few questions (unlike last time,
      when many hostile questions were posed).  There was some press interest (2
      cameras, one WPost reporter). Apparently the panel is comprised of the
      judge who heard the case in the district court, one of circuit court judge
      who was on the panel last time, and one new judge.
