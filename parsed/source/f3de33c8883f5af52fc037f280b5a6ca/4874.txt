  I held back sending in the memo pending discussions with lawyers and
  getting ,a read from Bob Nash and Ginny Apuzzo, which I hope to get today.

  Larry Haas got the same question from the Post and is responding by saying
  that the Administration is reviewing agency consumer affairs activities to
  see how these activities might be maintained.

       Steve Barr of the Post tells me the VA-HUD appropriations bill (currently
       awaiting POTUS signature) zeroes out the Office of Consumer Affairs,
       former home of such well-known Americans as Esther Peterson, Virginia
       Knauer and Elizabeth Dole.   (Don't know who current head is.) Steve,
       assuming we are not going to veto the bill over this, is asking what we
       plan on doing. Do we plan to reconstitute this office in some other
       form? Has anybody thought about this?

       Steve is trying to write for tomorrow, so if we want to get into this
       story, I need to hear from somebody.
