    Paragraph you requested on when states passed laws prohibiting sales of
    cigerettes to minors that Mary has gathered.  [It might be worth pointing
    out this data doesn't necessarily mean tobacco companies are liable, if
    that's what the President wanted to say-- the evidence wouldn't
    necessarily show they were selling only making marketing plans].  ==================

          RJR Documents and State Prohibitions Against Sales to Children

          In light of documents released by Rep. Waxman showing RJ. Reynolds Tobacco Company had
          plans for targeting children, you asked us to find how many states had laws prohibiting sales of
          cigarettes to persons 18 or younger at the time the documents were written. The 81 documents,
          spanning from 1973 to 1990, provide evidence of the company marketing to children as young
          as age 14. In both 1974 and 1975, documents discuss the need to market to the 14-24 age group
          because they "represent tomorrow's cigarette business." According to data gathered by the
          National Cancer Institute, as of 1974,27 states had passed legislation prohibiting the sale of
          cigarettes or other tobacco products to those 18 and under. Starting around 1980, RJR officials
          stopped specifically referring, even internally, to marketing to anyone younger than 18.
          However, beginning in around 1987, RJR started its Joe Camel advertising campaign. As of
          1987, at least 35 states had passed legislation prohibiting the sale of cigarettes or tobacco
          products to those 18 and under. Today, all 50 states, including the District of Columbia, have
          laws prohibiting the sale of cigarettes or tobacco products to those 18 or under.
