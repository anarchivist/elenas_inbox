        I commend the Sentencing Commission for moving forward with recommendations to
Congress to reduce the disparity between crack and powder cocaine penalties. My
Administration will give them very serious consideration. I have asked Director McCaffrey and
Attorney General Reno to review the recommendations and to report back to me in 45 days. I
look forward to working with the Congress on this issue.

       In October 1995, I signed legislation disapproving the Sentencing Commission's
recommendation to equalize penalties for crack and powder cocaine distribution by dramatically
reducing the penalties for crack. I believe it was the wrong approach then, and would be the
wrong approach now.

        Current law creates a substantial disparity between sentences for crack and powder
cocaine. I have stated before that some adjustment to this penalty structure is warranted as a
matter of sound criminal justice policy. Federal prosecutors should target mid- and high-level
drug traffickers and federal resources should go towards these important prosecutions. An
adjustment to the penalty scheme can ensure this allocation and make our federal efforts in
fighting drugs more effective. [It would also reduce the disparate racial impact of the current
sentencing scheme.] That is why the legislation I signed directed the Sentencing Commission to
undertake additional review of these issues and to report back with new recommendations.

        The sentencing laws must continue to reflect that crack cocaine is a more harmful form of
cocaine. The Sentencing Commission's new recommendations do so. Trafficking in crack, and
the violence it fosters, has a devastating impact on communities across America, especially
inner-city communities. Any change in penalties must ensure that more dangerous offenders
receive tougher sentences.

       I am also pleased that the Sentencing Commission has increased penalties for
methamphetamine offenses pursuant to the legislation which I signed into law last year. This
law asked the Commission to toughen penalties on this emerging drug to prevent the kind of
epidemic we saw in the 1980's with cocaine use. We will carefully study these new penalties.

        My Administration has fought to stop drug abuse and its destructive consequences.
Overall, drug use in the United States has fallen dramatically -- by half in 15 years. And cocaine
use has dramatically decreased since the high point in 1985 -- the number of current cocaine
users is down by 74% over the last decade. While these are encouraging figures, I am fully
committed to doing 11l0re to keep bringing drug lise d,)I\"!1 - - p:1r::~l::,:i":y ~1:;]01ig our ehi;c::cI1.
