          NW FORESTS: USFS MAY REJECT ENVIRO BID TO BUY TIMBER
             The Northwest Ecosystem Alliance was the highest bidder in a
        recent federal timber sale in Washington state, but the US Forest
        Service may reject the $29,000 bid because the group doesn't plan
        to cut the trees, NPR's Jennifer Schmidt reports.  The 275-acre
        parcel in the Okanogan Nat'l Forest, called the "Thunder sale,"
        was burned by wildfires in 1994.  It lies in a large tract of
        undeveloped forest providing habitat for chinook salmon and one
        of the last remaining Lynx populations in the lower 48 states.
             Alliance Dir. Mitch Friedman says the Thunder sale violates
        water quality and other enviro laws, but the group can't sue to
        stop the sale because of the salvage law signed by Pres. Clinton
        in 7/95. Freedman says no matter who buys the timber, its a bad
        deal for taxpayers:  "The public is still only going to get 10
        cents on the dollar for the investment and the market is bad."
             USFS is expected to decide the sale in the next few weeks.
        The alliance said if it loses the bid, it will appeal to the
        Agriculture Dept. ("Morning Edition," NPR, 1/22).
