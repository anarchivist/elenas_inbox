     Status of Appropriations and Other Legislation
     Affecting Women
     PRINTER FONT 12 - POINT- COURIER
     FY '97 Labor, Health and Human Services Appropriations

     Human Embryo Research
     ?       On June 25, 1996, during Committee mark
     o
     -up of the HHS/Labor
     Appropriations bill, Reps. Dickey (R
     o
     -AZ) and Wicker (R
     o
     -MS)
     offered an amendment to reinstate the ban on human embryo
     research. The amendment passed 25
     o
     -20.
     ?          Rep. Lowey (D
     o
     -NY) is expected to offer on the floor an
     amendment to strike the ban and codify the NIH guidelines
     which allowed research on extra embryos that were created
     for in vitro fertilization, but did not allow the creation
     of embryos solely for research. Rep. Lowey successfully
     offered this amendment in the subcommittee mark
     o
     -up.
     Abortion/Family Planning
     The week of July 8 Rep. Istook (R
     o
     -OK) is expected to offer on the
     floor the following amendments to the Labor/HHS appropriations
     bill:
     ?       An amendment allowing states to deny Medicaid coverage for
     abortions to low
     o
     -income women who are victims of rape or
     incest.
     ?       An amendment that would prohibit Title X funds from being
     used to provide services to teenagers without parental
     consent. Those services include providing contraceptives as
     well as testing for sexually transmitted diseases.  States
     would be allowed to opt out of the federal mandate but, in
     doing so, would be required to enact new laws allowing
     minors to consent to sensitive health services.   Currently,
     49 states have allows that allow minors to consent for
     screening and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases and
     23 states have laws allowing minors to consent for
     contraceptive services.


     FY '97 Treasury, Postal and General Government Operations
     Appropriations bill

     Abortion
     ?          The week of July 8 Rep. Hoyer (D


    o
    -MD) is expected to offer on
    the floor an amendment to strike the restrictive language
    written into law in last years' appropriations bill, that
    prevents federal employees form selecting a health care plan
    that provides abortion coverage. Rep. Hoyer offered this
    amendment during committee debate.  However, it failed
    16
    o
    -22.
    FY '97 Foreign Operations Appropriations bill
    Abortion/Family Planning
    During subcommittee consideration of this appropriations bill,
    Sen. Leahy (D
    o
    -VT) offered an amendment striking the Mexico City
    Policy language (Mexico City language denies all funding for
    overseas family planning organizations that perform abortions or
    speak out about reproductive choice, even with private money, a
    policy Pres. Clinton reversed when he came into office) and
    striking funding cuts to population assistance programs attached
    by the House. The Leahy amendment also restores a separate
    account for population assistance within the development
    assistance programs and increases population assistance to $410
    million. The Leahy amendment passed 8
    o
    -5. Senate floor action is
    expected after the July 4 recess.

    Welfare/Medicaid Legislation
    On June 26 in the Senate Finance Committee, Sen. Chafee offered
    an amendment to strike from the welfare/Medicaid legislation
    language that permits states to deny coverage for abortion
    services except in the cases of life, rape or incest. The Chafee
    amendment failed 10
    o
    -10.
    FDA and the Morning After pill
    After' holding a hearing on Friday June 28, the FDA decided to
    publish in the Federal Register a notice that says ordinary oral
    contraceptives can be safely and effectively used as "morning
    after pills." However, because of concerns over liability
    litigation and anti
    o
    -abortion protests, no manufacturer has filed
    an application to market the pills specifically as "morning after
    pills." Without an application, the FDA cannot formally approve
    the new use. Instead, the FDA will use the Federal Register
    announcement to inform people of this use of birth control pills,

    and will continue to hope a manufacturer applies.
