TEXT:
I had discussed with OMB last week the fact that we were not yet
prepared to submit the EOP plans, especially since I knew Alice
was testifying today.  I worked at OMB prior to coming to the
White House and keep in close contact with them on any and all
issues concerning the EOP.
I don't believe we will have a problem submitting our plans to the
Hill when final.  If the Treasury/Postal bill is ready for
signature soon, we hopefully will find a shutdown plan
unnecessary.  T/P met today and I'm expecting a call from the Hill
shortly letting me know if a deal was struck.
