USDA will put out a release late today saying the companies will buy 103
million pounds of the '97 crop. That means the quota for next year will
be a 17% decline from last year.  The majority (70%) will be bought by
Phillip Morris.  the companies will receive a 15% discount.  The companies
-- PM, RJR, and B & W -- will commit to purchase intentions of 475 million
a year for the next five years.  The 17% quota decline includes a 3%
discretionary decision by the Secretary.
