TEXT:
Good news is that a new GAO report validates SSA's regulations as being
consistent with the welfare reform law, and not overly strict.  So that's
something objective we can point to.

Bad news is that advocates are strongly critiquing a random sample study
of 80 children that SSA released and that Shaw touted today.  A reader of
SSA's report would certainly get the sense that SSA is making good
decisions. The advocates say it is sanitized, and raise questions about
whether it is truly random that don't sound wacky to me at first blush.
