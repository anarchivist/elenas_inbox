TEXT:
According to James Costello, he gave the AG a draft memo on the public
charge issue before she left for Peru.    He expects an answer from the AG
in a couple of weeks.

They propose a NPRM with a comment period however, OLC is still reviewing
the proposal to make the NPRM effective immediately by the AG's exercising
her statutory discretion to direct field officers that immigrants should
not be found public charge if they would not be considered a public charge
under the proposed rule.

Briefly, based on the NPRM an immigrant would be considered a public
charge if an immigrant is primarily dependent on cash assistance for
income maintenance or if the immigrant is institutionalized in a
long-term care facility at government expense.  This would clarify that
receipt of CHIP benefits and Medicaid (w/ the exception of
institutionalized long term care) would not make someone a public charge.
On the long-term care issue, INS has assured me that they will not begin
to go after immigrants living in nursing homes to deport them but we
should make sure that the disability community is informed of this
proposal and that they understand.

I spoke to Josh Bernstein of Nat'l Immigration Law Center (NILC) about
their expectations.    They would like guidance that will set forth
clearly and as quickly as possible the benefits for which receipt by an
immigrant may result in deportation or exclusion or denial of
adjustment.   He understands that an NPRM is necessary   and he did not
have strong feelings whether an interpretative rule or guidance should


accompany the NPRM provided it is effective immediately and clear. He did
note that this NPRM would probably need to be issued by both DOJ (INS and
EOIR= immigration judges) and the State Department since all these
components are responsible for determining public charge in various
contexts - admission (State), adjustment and deportation (INS and
EOIR).   There was a similar situation under IRCA of 1988.

Please let me know if you have any further questions.
