TANF

C               $350 million of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families
(TANF) funds deferred until FY 2002, which could force States to reduce
their own critical investments in their critical programs and reduce
services and benefits to poor families who are trying to make the
transition from welfare to work.

Tobacco

C               A provLsLon that would completely relinquish the Federal
taxpayersO, share of the Medicaid-related claims in the comprehensive
State tobacco settlement without any commitment whatsoever by the States
to use these funds to stop youth smoking.  Federal taxpayers paid a
significant share -- the majority in most cases      57 percent of
Medicaid smoking-related expenditures.  The Administration believes that
the States should retain these funds and make a commitment that the
Federal share of the settlementO,s proceeds will be spent on shared
national and State priorities:  to reduce youth smoking, protect tobacco
farmers, improve public health, and assist children. promote public


health and childrenD,s programs, and assist affected rural communities.

Subject: Need Clearance: Draft Senate Supplemental SAP

Please review the draft SAP for S. 544, the Senate Supplemental
Appropriations bill. The position is "senior advisors veto
recommendation." It is possible that the Senate will take up the bill
Wednesday evening or Thursday morning.  We aim to release the SAP tomorrow
(Wed. 3/17) afternoon.  Please provide comments/clearance by noon
tomorrow.  Thank you.

S. 544 -- EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS ACT, FY 1999 (Sponsor:
Stevens (R), Alaska)

 This Statement of Administration Policy provides the AdministrationD,s
views on S. 544, a bill making FY 1999 emergency supplemental
appropriations for recovery from natural disasters and for foreign
assistance, as reported by the Senate Appropriations Committee. The bill
as reported by the Committee provides $1.89 billion in urgently needed
funding to assist in Central AmericaD,s recovery from recent natural
disasters, to provide resources to promote stability in Jordan, and to
fund the emergency needs of farmers and ranchers in the United States.

 The Administration appreciates the Senate CommitteeD,s prompt action to
ensure that urgently needed funding is provided quickly.  Providing
essential assistance to victims of natural disasters and helping our
farmers at home with vital financing clearly fall in the category of needs
that are urgent, unanticipated, and essential -- that is, emergency
requirements. Therefore, they clearly deserve to be funded quickly,
fully, and without requiring offsets that could force unacceptable
reductions in important programs.  In addition, it is essential that this
bill remain free of extraneous provisions that could slow its progress.


Unfortunately, the committee bill includes a number of such provisions.

 Were the bill to be presented to the President with the Senate
CommitteeO,s proposed offsets and several objectionable riders discussed
below, the PresidentO,s senior advisers would recommend that he veto the
bill. We urge you not to take actions that could result in gridlock and
delay, and that would be detrimental both to our allies abroad and our
citizens at home in their time of need.

Emergency Relief for Central America

 The bill provides $977 million for Central America, $21 million more than
the PresidentO,s request.  The PresidentO,s request for International
Assistance Programs, the Department of Defense, and the Department of
Justice would provide essential emergency disaster assistance in the wake
of Hurricane Mitch, which inflicted severe damage on several Central
American nations. The package also provides aid to the Caribbean nations
struck by Hurricane Georges, including Haiti and the Dominican Republic.
The Administration commends the Committee for its prompt action in
approving the PresidentO,s request.

 Regrettably, the Majority Leadership of the Senate has decided that these
funds must be offset. Hurricane Mitch, the worst natural disaster in the
history of the Western hemisphere, left more than 9,000 dead and drove
millions from their homes. Serious economic dislocation has resulted from
the destruction of schools, hospitals, businesses, farms, and roads.
Together, Hurricanes Mitch and Georges have caused $10 billion in
damages.  The PresidentO,s Central America package is urgent,
unanticipated, and essential and should be funded as an emergency request.

 Funds must be provided swiftly to prevent the spread of disease and to
buy seed and plant crops in the fast-approaching Spring planting season,
thereby providing food and jobs to many communities, and to demonstrate to
Central Americans that they can find jobs and security in their own
recovering economies. Much of the rural road system farmers and small
merchants depend on for their livelihoods was destroyed. Water and
sanitation systems have been disrupted, which can result in disease.
Economic destruction and dislocation threaten to undermine the regionO,s
achievements of the past decade, as these nations have made tremendous
strides toward settling conflicts, strengthening democracy, promoting
human rights, opening economies and alleviating poverty. Emergency
assistance for reconstruction aid will ensure that their transformation
continues and will deter illegal migration by assuring that Central
Americans have cause to view their own futures in the region with hope.

Jordan

 The Administration appreciates the CommitteeO,s providing the full $100
million for Jordan, fully funding the FY 1999 request.  These funds will
provide financial support to help promote stability in Jordan and the
region during the period of transition subsequent to King HusseinO,s
death. While the Administration appreciates the full funding of the FY
1999 request, we are disappointed that the $200 million requested in
advance appropriations for FYs 2000 and 2001 has not been provided.   In
the context of promoting peace in the Middle East, the Administration will
continue to pre'ss for these advance appropriations.

Department of Agriculture

 The Committee bill provides $308 million in emergency funds for the


Department of Agriculture (USDA), $156 million above the PresidentO,s
request.  The Administration appreciates the CommitteeO,s support for the
PresidentO,s request for emergency farm loans and administrative costs.
This additional loan authority would provide vitally needed financing for
the NationO,s farmers in light of the significant increase in demand for
USDA loans, due to projected continuing low commodity and livestock
prices.  The Administration is reviewing the other farm-sector funds
included in the Committee bill.

Offsets

 The President has proposed that this package of essential emergency
disaster assistance be funded consistent with the budget rules that apply
to emergency spending.  Regrettably, the Majority Leadership has decided
that the funds for Central American disaster aid must be offset. The
proposed offsets would result in unacceptable reductions in funding in
areas of crucial importance to Americans, including': disaster relief
funds in response to Hurricane Georges and other domestic disasters; funds
for anti-terrorism to protect U.S. citizens at our embassies overseas;
funds to fight the war on drugs; and, with less than 300 days before
December 31, 1999, funds to solve the Y2K problem.

 Some examples of the reductions that would result from the CommitteeO,s
action include the following:

 C $75 million from anti-terrorism programs to protect our citizens at our
embassies and facilities abroad;

 C $65 million in disaster relief, which would deprive FEMA, SBA, and
other agencies of resources they need to continue their work in response
to domestic disasters in Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana,
Georgia, North and South Carolina, North and South Dakota, West Virginia,
Texas, California, Maryland, Virginia, Tennessee, Pennsylvania, Alaska and
most other States

 C $33 million in drug war programs of the Drug Enforcement Agency, the
Coast Guard, the Customs Service, and other agencies;

 C $113 million in Y2K funding for domestic Federal Government agencies,
which could harm systems needing further computer conversion adjustments;

 C $25 million in INS citizenship and immigration programs and $40 million
in enforcement and border affairs, which would have negative consequences
on INSD, immigration benefit programs, ongoing investigations, and land
border inspection operations;

 C $16 million from the Department of Energy to execute crucial
nonproliferation activities with the Russian Federation and private
Western companies to reduce the availability of weapons-grade uranium;

 C $43 million for International Organizations and Peacekeeping that would
increase U.N. arrears and would jeopardize the ability of the United
States to respond to increased or new requirements for international
peacekeeping operations;

 C $100 million from revised inflation assumptions for domestic,
non-defense programs, which could result in cuts in inflation-sensitive
programs such as WIC and other essential programs;

 C $60 million from the Global Environmental Facility and $10 million from


the EPA climate change program that develops the technology needed for a
fuel efficient, less polluting vehicle;

 C $350 million of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) funds
deferred until FY 2002, which could force States to reduce their own
investments in their critical programs and reduce services and benefits to
poor families who are trying to make the transition from welfare to work.

Objectionable riders

 Unfortunately, the Committee bill includes a number of strongly
objectionable provisions, including the following:

 C A provision that would completely relinquish the Federal taxpayersO,
share of the Medicaid-related claims in the comprehensive State tobacco
settlement without any commitment whatsoever by the States to use these
funds to stop youth smoking.  Federal taxpayers paid a significant share
-- the majority in most cases     of Medicaid smoking-related
expenditures. The Administration believes that the States should retain
these funds and make a commitment that the Federal share of the
settlementO,s proceeds will be spent on shared national and State
priorities:  to reduce youth smoking, promote public health and
childrenO,s programs, and assist affected rural communities.

 C A provision that would extend the current moratorium on publishing a
final Interior Department rule revising the method by which crude oil from
Federal leases is valued for purposes of calculating Federal royalties.
The existing FY 1999 rider imposed an eight-month moratorium (until June
1, 1999) and was the outcome of negotiations with the Congress at the end
of the last session. This provision wouid cost the Treasury about $15
million in FY 1999.

 C A provision that would extend the current moratorium on publishing a
final Interior Department rule concerning surface management and
reclamation requirements at hardrock mine sites on Federal lands. The
existing FY 1999 rider imposed a moratorium on publishing the final rule
until September 30, 1999, and requires a National Academy of Sciences
(NAS) study by July 31, 1999, examining the need for the new rule.   The
provision in this bill would prohibit publishing the final rule until
after a minimum 120-day comment period following the completion of the NAS
study.  Therefore, the earliest the rule could be published would be
December 1999. The new rule is needed to update the existing 1980
regulation to take into account changes in mining practices and technology
since then.  Interior issued for comment and review a proposed hardrock
mining rule in February 1999. This rule-making process should not be
delayed further.

 C A provision that would prevent the Secretary of the Interior from
implementing a recent reorganization of Interior's Office of Special
Trustee for American Indians (OST) for the remainder of FY 1999. The
Secretary took the step of reorganizing this office to address
deficiencies in day-to-day management of OSTO,s field   operations.  In
order for the Administration's efforts to reform management of tribal and
individual Indian trust funds to succeed, this reorganization needs to
remain in effect.

Other Issues


 C On March 10, 1999,   the President transmitted a request for $15 million


in additional supplemental funding for the Department of the Interior to
support the requirements of the Cobell v. Babbitt class-action lawsuit
alleging mismanagement of individual Indian money accounts. These
additional funds would allow the Department to conduct critical
activities, including court-ordered document production and statistical
sampling needed this year in defense of the suit.  This request is fully
offset from other Interior appropriation accounts.

C The Administration objects to a provision that would transfer $100
million from the Department of AgricultureO,s Wildfire Management
Operations -- primarily firefighting funding -- to its Knutson-Vandenberg
Fund (K-V Fund), which funds reforestation and timber stand management and
improvement on national forest lands. A transfer of this magnitude is
unnecessary and inappropriate.   Transferring the funds from the
appropriated fire operations account would likely require that available
Forest Service emergency contingency funds be used to fight fires in FY
1999, even if FY 1999 is a normal fire year. Should a significant fire
season occur and the contingency funds be exhausted, the Forest Service
would have to transfer funds back from the K-V Fund.

C The Administration would like to work with the committee to respond to
their concerns about the implementation of the Community   Development
Block Grant disaster relief program.
