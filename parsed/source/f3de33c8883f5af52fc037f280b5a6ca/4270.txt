TEXT:
Tanner's staff is suggesting we meet Monday with Tanner, Stenholm, Carper,
and Chiles staff to talk to them about our views and coordinate strategy
to the extent possible.  If we choose not to fight this, we may be able to
get something in return, he says. He expects -- and remember, we're not
supposed to know this -- that Shaw will hold a press conference Thursday
and have a committee hearing the following week.

We of course need to decide what we think of this proposal first.
Treasury, DOL, and HHS are examining the language now.

I also got a voice mail from Ron Haskins late today              tried him back but
got no answer.  I'll try him again in the morning.

I assume you don't need to see the language itself. what are you hearing
from Govs on this?

     fyi; we're faxing to you in case you don't have it.             If you have seen it,
     do you have a take on it yet?

     We now have legislative language from Haskins on his proposed "compromise"
     on FLSA. DOL is looking at it.   It appears to say what we expected --
     workfare only has to be as many hours as the state can afford, and the
     balance of the hours can be filled with job search and education;
     FICA/FUTA don't apply to workfare; checks can still come from the welfare
     office. The key unknown is whether they have weakened labor protections
     at all, and it's hard to tell.  I'm faxing it to you in case you want to
     look at it personally.
