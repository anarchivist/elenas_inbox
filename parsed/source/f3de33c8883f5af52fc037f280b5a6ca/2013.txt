 TODA Y, AS HE PREPARES TO LEAVE FOR PHILADELPHIA, PRESIDENT CLINTON WILL
 ANNOUNCE THAT HE IS SENDING LEGISLATION TO CONGRESS THAT EMBODIES THE SPIRIT
 OF THE PRESIDENTS' SUMMIT FOR AMERICA'S FUTURE -- THE AMERICA READS CHALLENGE
 ACT. The America Reads Challenge Act will help mobilize AmeriCorps members, skilled reading specialists, and
 an army of trained volunteer reading tutors to ensure that every student can read independently and well by the end
 of 3rd grade. The Act sets forth the first comprehensive, nationwide effort to create after-school, summer, and
 weekend tutoring in reading. The America Reads Challenge Act is a five-year, $2.75 billion commitment to local
 communities and organizations, as well as national and regional efforts. It includes:

        America's Reading Corps. The Act would fund 25,000 reading specialists and tutor coordinators, including
        11,000 AmeriCorps members, to mobilize one million volunteer reading tutors.
        ·      Coordinating with the in-school reading program, tutors will provide individualized after-school,
               weekend, and summer reading tutoring for approximately three million children in grades K-3 who
               need the extra help.
        ·      AmeriCorps members and others will work to recruit these tutors, and reading specialists will provide
               their training and supervision.

        Parents as First Teachers Challenge Grants. The legislation also recognizes that, as their children's first
        teachers, parents can give their children the firm foundation they need to do well in school. These Challenge
        Grants would provide more than $300 million over five years to foster effective programs to provide
        assistance for interested parents to help their children become successful readers by the end of 3rd grade.
        ·       Head Start and Title IJEven Start. These grants will build on other commitments to early learning
                in the President's balanced budget plan. This includes an expansion of the Head Start program
                reaching one million 3- and 4-year olds and additional investments in Title VEven Start to strengthen
                reading instruction during the regular school day as well as family literacy efforts.

  THE PRESIDENT'S LEGISLATION ADDRESSES CHILDREN'S READING NEEDS. Research shows that
. children who cannot read well and independently by the end of third grade are less likely to succeed in school and
  more likely to drop out. While American students today generally read as well as ever, 40% of our fourth graders
  scored below the basic level on the 1994 National Assessment of Educational Progress. According to studies,
  however, well-designed tutoring programs result in student gains in reading.

 PRESIDENT CLINTON IS ISSUING THE AMERICA READS CHALLENGE TO ALL AMERICANS --
 AND THEY ARE RESPONDING. The America Reads Challenge asks every American to help in this effort,
 building on the work being done by classroom teachers, librarians, tutors, and reading specialists.
 ·      Encouraging Involvement. The America Reads Challenge is pursuing several essential strategies to help
        our children learn to read: creating more learning opportunities to supplement classroom reading instruction;
        encouraging parent involvement to help children develop readiness skills for reading beginning at birth, as
        well as involvement throughout the school years; and bringing best teaching practices into classrooms.
 ·      Federal Work Study Expansion. President Clinton has asked college presidents to allocate half of all their
        new work-study slots to college students who become America Reads tutors. The goal is to give 100,000
        federal work study students the opportunity to help children learn to read better. So far, 166 colleges have
        pledged thousands of students to tutor in elementary schools.
 ·      Service Summit Commitments. As part of the President's Service Summit in Philadelphia, major
        non-profits and corporations have committed to recruit tens of thousands of new tutors specifically for the
        America Reads effort, with tens of thousands of additional commitments to literacy activities.

READING ONE-TO-ONE, Richardson, Texas
George Farkas, University of Texas    972-883-2937

Reading One-to-One offers a one-an-one tutoring program to at-risk students in elementary schools, many of
whom are limited-English proficient. The tutors -- college students and community volunteers -- are trained
in the tutoring curriculum and supervised by on-site tutor coordinators, including AmeriCorps members.
The program stresses consistency: each student works with no more than two tutors three to four times a
week during the school year.
Reading One-to-One began at The University of Texas at Dallas in 1991 as a local tutoring effort. Since that
time, more than 5,000 children in more than 50 schools in Dallas, Richardson, and Brownsville, TX, and Salt
Lake City and Magna, UT, have been tutored using the Reading One-to-One program model. A statistical
analysis shows that 70 forty-minute sesions produce an average net gain (attributable to program intervention
alone) of approximately 0.5 grade equivalents. Additionally, survey results of teachers and parents showed
that 88 of the teachers and 95 of the parents thought reading skills had indeed increased.

Attending Radio Address: Juan Delgado, 22, is an AmeriCorps member working in a Reading One-to-One
program at Longoria Elementary Schoo!. in Brownsville, Texas. George Farkas, Director of the Center for
Education and Social Policy at the University of Texas at Dallas, is the founder of Reading One-to-One.



HIPPYCorps INITIATIVE AT STANLEY ISAACS NEIGHBORHOOD CENTER, NY, NY
HIPPY USA (Home Instruction Program for Preschool Youngsters)
Alice Smothers, HIPPY USA, 212-678-3500

Stanley Isaacs Neighborhood Center is one of ten HIPPY sites that participate in the HIPPYCorps Initiative
in New York, where 65 AmeriCorps members provide services to approximately 700 families. HIPPY is a
home-based program for parents of children 4- and 5-years old that provides parents with a two-year
curriculum, lesson plans, and materials to help them teach school readiness skills to their children. According
to evidence from a five-year study of the program, teachers rated children who had been in HIPPY as better
adapted to the classroom and more likely to do well in school than children who had not been in the
program.

There are 103 local HIPPY programs operating in 26 states and the District of Columbia, serving over 13,000
families. The core HIPPY Program consists of home visits every other week in which a paraprofessional
role plays the coming week's curriculum with the parent, who then engages in the activities with their children
on a daily basis. Parents tell stories to their children, teach them to recognize shapes and colors, follow
directions, solve logical problems other school readiness skills.        Alternate weeks, home visits are
supplemented by group meetings. Parents meet together for discussions of lesson topics and parenting
Issues.

Attending Radio Address:    Margaret Mary Daly enrolled in the HIPPY program in May 1996 with her 4-year

HANDS ON ATLANTA, Atlanta, Georgia
Michelle Nunn, Executive Director     404-872-2252

Hands On Atlanta's Americorps members serve as recruiters, coordinators and project supervisors currently
assisting 15 K-12 public schools in the Atlanta area. AmeriCorps members recruit and train high school
volunteers as tutors for younger students in afterschool programs. They also mobilize community volunteers
-- 5,000 of them by the end of this school year -- to serve schools in a variety of ways, including after-school
programs that incorporate academic enrichment.

In 1996, 720 Hands on Atlanta volunteers participated each week in Saturday tutorial programs contributing
over 30,000 hours of enrichment to Atlantal school children. In addition, AmeriCorps members organized a
total 90,000 hours of daily tutorial assistance provided to over 2,790 children. In the first three years of
Americorps involvement, the schools have seen an 11 percent increase in performance on national standardized
tests in math and reading, and an average 25 percent decrease in incidents of discipline.

Attending Radio Address: Kimberly Albriton, 22, serves as an AmeriCorps member on the Crim High School
Team. Alexandra Bowen, 23, serves as an AmeriCorps member at College Park Elementary School.
Among other activities, Alex serves as a reading coach for her third grade class. Don Duran is the principal
of Benteen Elementary School, which has benefited from the Hands on Atlanta effort.



OREGON CHILDREN'S FOUNDATION
START MAKING A READER TODAY (SMART) AMERICORPS*VISTA PROGRAM
Janice Hurst, Program Director    503-721-7175

The goal of SMART is to ensure that all Oregon children leave elementary school reading at or above their
grade level. AmeriCorps*VISTA members have recruited 3,900 local volunteers to work with children
through one-to-one tutoring assistance in 78 schools across the state. More than 309,000 hours of service
have been donated, and money has been raised to purchase over 150,000 books which have been given to the
children in the program. Private sector support comes from over 350 companies including Nike, Intel
Corporation, Smith Barney and Wal-Mart. SMART has been recognized as an outstanding literacy
partnership program by the U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services and by the National Alliance of
Business.

SMART programs are mainly in schools where the student population is from low-income households.
During the Summer months, this SMART serves more than 1,500 children statewide.. AmeriCorps*VISTA
members drive "Story Vans" to parks and recreation centers to read aloud to children. To reach the most
underserved populations in the state, the project coordinates with the Oregon free lunch summer program for
children, engaging in literacy tutoring for children at sites where the lunches are being served.

Attending Radio Address:    Susan Dognaux, 27, is in her first year as an AmeriCorps*VISTA member.

Research has found that well-designed tutoring programs result in student gains in reading

·     A major British study of tutoring -- conducted by Topping and Whitley -- examined the
      progress of more than 2,300 elementary and junior high students who were tutored for an
      average of8.6 weeks by a mixture of parent volunteers, peers, and older students.
      Learners improved at 4.4 times the normal rate for the tutoring period in comprehension
      and 3.3 times the normal rate in work recognition. For months after the end of tutoring,
      the average student was still improving at twice the normal rate in both comprehension
      and work recognition. [Topping, K., & Whitley, M (1990). Participant evaluation a/parent-tutored
       and peer-tutored projects in reaching. Educational Research, 32(1), 14-32.}

·     An analysis -- conducted by Cohen, Kulik and Kulik -- of approximately 60 published
      studies found positive effects of specific tutoring programs on targeted students: The
      analysis relied on measurable results, and did not take into account anecdotal reports
      [Cohen, P.A., Kulik, J.A., & Kulik, C.L.C. (1982). Educational outcomes a/tutoring: A meta-analysis 0/
      findings. American Educational Research Journal, 19, 237-248.}

·     An after school tutoring program in which low-achieving second and third graders were
      tutored one hour, twice each week, by university students, retirees, and suburban mothers
      also generated strong improvements in the tutees' reading skills. Two reading specialists
      selected the children for tutoring, recruited and trained the tutors, anq monitored the
      tutoring sessions. In each of two years, the tutored group outperformed a closely
      matched comparison group on word recognition, passage reading accuracy, and spelling.
       Fifty percent of the tutored children made a full year's gain reading while only 20% of
      the comparison group children did. [Morris, D., Shaw., B., & Perney, J. (1990, November).
      Helping low readers in Grades 2 and 3: An after-school volunteer tutoring program. Elementary School
      Journal. 91. 133-150.}

Characteristics of successful tutoring programs have also been identified through research

·     According to a synthesis of research on tutoring involving college students and younger
      children, successful programs are structure to provide sufficient time for consistent,
      regular contact; systematic screening of prospective tutors; thorough training and
      monitoring; and close communication and cooperation between the sponsoring agency
      and participating schools. [Policy Studies Associates (1990). A review a/programs involving
      college students as tutors or mentors in grades K-12.   Prepared/or the   u.s. Department 0/ Education,
      Planning and Evaluation Service}

·     A recent study of tutoring for 30 first grade children at risk in reading -- conducted by
      Juel -- reported that successful tutor-tutee relationships were characterized by strong
      reinforcement of progress; a high number of reading and writing experiences in which the
      student moved from being fully supported to working independently; and explicit
      demonstration of appropriate rea?ing and writing processes. [Juel, C. (1996). What makes

Responding to President Clinton's call to help every American child read independently and well by
the end of third grade, organizations and corporations from across the country have stepped forward
to commit tens of thousands of caring volunteers in conjunction with the Philadelphia Summit.
While the hard work of identifying, training, and connecting these volunteers to schools lies ahead,
these commitments demonstrate the strong nationwide interest in promoting reading and working with
local schools to support our young people.

OVER 200,000 COMMITMENTS SPECIFICALLY CONNECTED TO AMERICA READS.
Several organizations, representing commitments to recruit over 200,000 reading tutors, have
expressly linked their commitments with the President's America Reads Challenge:

Organization                                          New Reading Tutors Committed

American Booksellers                                             50,000
B'Nai B'Rith Youth Organization                                    5,000
Glaxo Wellcome                                                     1,000
Houston Reads                                                   20,000
National Partnership for Jewish Social Justice                 100,000

OASIS and May Department Stores                                 25,000
Seventh-Day Adventists                                             3,000

These commitments are cumulative over three years, except for Houston Reads, which commits to
reach a level of20,000 participating tutors by the year 2000. In addition, Scholastic Books will
donate one million books to the America Reads effort.

ADDITIONAL COMMITMENTS FOR MANY THOUSAND AMERICANS TO BE
INVOL VED IN LITERACY EFFORTS. Several additional organizations, including some with a
long history in promoting literacy, have made reading-related summit commitments as well. These
organizations include the National Center for Family Literacy, the Reading Recovery Council of
America, Time Warner "Time to Read," City Cares of America, Hewlett Packard, USWest, and
Reading is Fundamental.

STUDENT VOLUNTEER AND WORK STUDY COMMITMENTS TO AMERICA READS.
Through the leadership of the President of San Francisco State University, 21 university presidents
have each not only committed work-study funds to reading tutors as a part of the America Reads
effort, but have also committed to recruit five other university presidents, as well. Overall, 166
college and university presidents have committed thousands of work study and non-work study
students as tutors for America Reads.

FEDERAL AGENCY ADOPT-A-SCHOOL COMMITMENT. Federal agencies are making
over 40 commitments to the Presidents' Summit for America's Future. One of these is that
federal agencies will increase their commitment to adopt or establish partnerships with schools
in their communities.       The number of agency-school partnerships will increase from
approximately 1,500 to 2,000 by the year 2000. Working through partnerships established by
their agencies with schools across the country, Federal employees work closely .with schools in a
variety of ways --volunteering as mcntors and tutors, purchasing needed equipment for schools,
and holding career days.

                   AFTER MAJOR PUSH BY PRESIDENT CLINTON,
               SENATE RATIFIES CHEMICAL WEAPONS CONVENTION

        The Chemical Weapons Convention is good for America's security:

    ·   Because oflast night's vote, our troops will be less likely to face poison gas in the field,
        our hand will be strengthened against rogue states and terrorists, and we will help to
        eliminate the horror of chemical weapons.


        The vote for the Chemical Weapons Convention is an important example of
        bipartisan cooperation:

    ·   The Chemical Weapons Convention has been a model of bipartisan cooperation. First
        negotiated under President Reagan, completed under President Bush and submitted to the
        Senate by President Clinton, it received the support of prominent Republicans and
        Democrats -- including Senator Dole, General Powell, Brent Scowcroft and military
        leaders past and present.

    ·   Virtually all concerns that had been raised were met through bipartisan negotiations
        initiated by President Clinton and Majority Leader Lott, and a willingness to put aside
        politics and work together to make America more secure.

    ·   And now let's move forward. This vote once again shows that we are stronger as a
        nation when we work together. This is true for American leadership in the world, and it
        is also how we must meet our major challenges at home: finishing the job of reforming
        welfare, strengthening our education system, fighting crime and defending our
        environment, and balancing the budget in a way that protects our priorities for the future.
