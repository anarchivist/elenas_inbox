 TEXT:
 Attached is a memo from Erskine to the strategy team.   The purpose of this
 e-mail is to do the following:

 further explain Erskine's request for a separate memo on prioritizing the
 pillars;
 try to frame this mOdifying-your-pillars process;
 inform you of deadlines and drop-offs;
 provide the modified table of contents (or "table of pillars" which is
 attached); and
 provide the memo, in case you have not seen it yet (attached).

 First off, apologies for the lousy timing of this whole project.  The
 first round with the 48-hour deadline was difficult, and this round, while
 not as time sensitive, is just as vexing with so many people on vacation.
 However, this round should afford some time for groups to work together.

Separate Memo on Prioritizing the Pillars
The third paragraph of EBB's memo requests that each member of the
strategy team individually rank the pillars in order of perceived
importance and briefly describe the reasoning behind their
prioritization. This request is for the core members of the strategy team
to spend some time individually thinking about their recommended vision
for the next three and one half years.   It should stimulate some creative
and thoughtful ideas for moving forward.   These memos will go directly to


Sylvia and Erskine.  I do not think that these memos will be circulated
among the group, but I will follow up on this point later.

Modifying Your Pillars
In modifying your pillars, please pay attention to the third paragraph
regarding timing, prioritizing and costs. While this process may seem not
exactly clear (understatement), I think it is useful keep in mind the
goal: On September 2, we must provide paper to the President which clearly
and succinctly provides the pillars and the choices within them and among
them. Therefore, in modifying your pillar ask yourself 'How do I
accomplish this with my pillar?' That is, can the President see that my
pillar is prioritized? Is the time for initiating and/or completing a
particular building block clear? Can he see that the cost is already in
the budget or that it requires new spending or reprioritization of budget
funding? etc.

Deadlines & Details
As the memo states, the deadline for pillars and memos is Tuesday, August
26. Please forward 25 copies of your pillar to me in room 164 OEOB.
Please make the deadline, as it will greatly help the Wednesday's meeting
generally (and your pillar specifically) if the participants have the
afternoon and evening to review the materials. Due to the tight deadlines
of last meeting, we were not able to distribute the pillars before the
first meeting and some of the meeting time was eaten up by the group
reading and deciphering pillars. With vacation schedules, I realize this
will be difficult too.

Modified Table of Contents
The table of contents (attached) was modified by adding campaign finance
reform and merging "Renewal of Families" and "Children."

Thank you.
