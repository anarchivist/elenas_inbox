             1. Apparently the press have been given access to the picnic tables and
             deck area on West Executive.  If you are going to have conversations in
             that area, please use discretion.

             2. We have set up a new phone system for 6-2216. The number has a menu
             which allows outside callers to choose which policy team they want to be
             transferred to.  The call is then answered by either Essence, Allison, or
             Linda depending on which policy team is choosen.  People can also press
             zero and the interns in room 468 OEOB will answer the call.

         !   3. with the exceptiori of the welfare intern and one of health care
             interns, all interns will be sitting up in room 468. The intern desk and
     J       computer in room 224 will be removed to create more space in that area.
