                            Campaign Finance Reform Q&A
                                   April 14, 1999


Q:   Why do you believe the current campaign finance reform system should be
     changed?

A:   The rules governing our system of financing federal election campaigns are sorely out of
     date. Enacted more than two decades ago when election campaigns were'much less
     expensive, they have been overtaken by events -- particularly, by dramatic changes in the
     nature and cost of political campaigns. Spending in congressional campaigns has risen
     sixfold in the last two decades -- more than three times the rate of inflation -- and
     spending on television is the primary reason. Money is raised and spent in ways that
     simply were not contemplated when Congress last overhauled our campaign finance laws.
      We must bring the rules up to date to reflect the changes in elections and campaigning
     that have overtaken our political system.
                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion

                                       April 14, 1999


Q:     Does gun control really work to reduce gun-related crime and violence?

A:     Yes, my Administration has taken some of the boldest, most comprehensive steps
       ever to keep guns off the streets and out of the hands of juveniles and criminals, and
       we are seeing the results. These steps, along with the comprehensive efforts of
       communities across the country to combat gun violence have contributed to a 27
       percent decline in the number of violent crimes committed with guns since 1992.
       Some of our accomplishments in this area include:

              Passing the Brady Law. We stood up to the gun lobby and secured passage
              of the Brady Law, which has helped to prevent over a quarter of a million
              felons, fugitives, and stalkers from getting handguns nationwide.

              Creating the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. Last
              November, we put into place the National Instant Criminal Background
              Check System, which has already conducted over 2.6 million background
              checks on gun purchasers, and stopped over 27,000 prohibited buyers from
              getting firearms.

              Banning dangerous assault weapons. I fought for the 1994 assault weapons
              ban to bar the manufacture and importation of 19 of the deadliest assault
              weapons. Last year, we took executive action to ban the importation of over
              50 models of deadly modified assault weapons. A recent Justice Department
              study found that the 1994 assault weapon ban contributed to a decrease in
              criminal use of the banned guns and a reduction in the overall gun murder
              rate.

              IncreasiD!! crime gun tracing and combating illegal gun trafficking. My
              Youth Crime Gun Interdiction Initiative (YCGII) is working in 37 cities to
              crack down on the illegal gun markets that supply firearms to juveniles and
              criminals. As a result of YCGII, crime gun tracing by ATF has increased
              from about 50,000 traces to 200,000 traces annually. In FY 98, ATF
              initiated over 300 ATF investigations in the YCGII cities, involving over
              3,300 illegally trafficked firearms.

Combined with our overall crime strategy to put 100,000 additional police officers on our
streets, tougher punishment for hardened criminals, and smarter prevention for our young
people to avoid crime in the first place, these efforts have led to crime coming down across
the country -- in all categories and in all regions -- and the violent crime rate plummeting to
its lowest point in a quarter century.

                                       Education Q&A
                                        April 14, 1999


Q:   What is the role of federal government in education?

A:   States and localities must have primary responsibility for education and must have the
     flexibility to decide what to teach and how to teach it. But as we enter the 21 st century,
     leadership at the national level is essential to provide the quality education that our people
     need to succeed.

     That means first that the federal government must make targeted investments to improve
     access to, and the quality of, education. Federal investment in education has a proud
     history: for example, in the nineteenth century the federal government provided land for
     educational institutions, and in the 1950's, Sputnik led us to invest in math and science
     education. Now we are trying to make targeted investments to help communities and
     schools improve education quality by reducing class size, providing after-school
     programs, modernizing school facilities, and expanding parental choice in public
     education. The federal government also must provide extra resources to help children,
     schools, and communities in greatest need through programs like Title I and extra funding
     for high-poverty communities in all of the initiatives I just mentioned.

     Second, and just as important, the federal government has a critical role to play in. holding
      states and schools that receive federal funding accountable for results. That is why my
     education accountability act will ensure that states and school districts adopt proven and
     effective accountability measures that will help to lift student achievement in every public
     school and close the opportunity gap by giving special attention to disadvantaged
     students. We need to take the education reforms that some states and cities are showing
     produce the best results -- turning around failing schools, phasing out the use of
     unqualified teachers, ending social promotion while providing extra support to help
     students achieve -- and spread those reforms throughout the nation.
                                                                       Hex-Dump Conversion
                                       Tobacco Q&A
                                       April 14, 1999


Q:   Why is tobacco regulation necessary? Are you just trying to put a legal industry
     out of business?

A:   My efforts are not intended to go after tobacco companies; they are intended to protect
     children. Cigarette companies have the right to market their products to adults. But I
     draw the line on children because many of them do not yet have the maturity to
     understand the dangers of tobacco products and withstand the industry's marketing
     efforts. Studies show that ifkids don't start smoking by age 19, they're not likely to start
     at all. And the data also indicates that children start smoking in part because of
     advertisements; for example, data released this week show that 88 percent of smokers in
     12th grade smoke one of the three most heavily advertised cigarette brands. That's why
     the FDA rule we put forward in 1995 proposed to limit advertising that appeals to
     children in places where they are likely to see it. We need Congress to take this rule out
     of the courts and to take the range of other measures that will have a significant,
     long-term effect on youth smoking rates.
