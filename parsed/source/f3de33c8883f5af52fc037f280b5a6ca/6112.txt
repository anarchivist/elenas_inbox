            Subject: COPS Indian Funding

             We have received the Department's Congressional Justification for review
            and approval.   COPS continues to argue that they cannot use innovative
            funding for Indians, we disagree.    We will engage them in a discussion on
            this point and I wanted to alert you because DOJ may call you when we
            return the following language as unacceptable:

            Under the terms of the Department of Justice Appropriations Act, 1997,
            except to the extent that limited carryover is utilized for innovative
            programs pursuant to reprogramming provisions, no funding may be directed
            toward innovative programs. A reprogramming request was approved during
            FY 1997 to fund Problem Solving Partnership applications submitted in FY
            1996 and to support solicitations for proposals under an Advancing
            Community Policing initiative.  The COPS Office plans to continue funding
            Problem-Solving Partnership grants and Advancing Community Policing grants
            during FY 1999 with available carryover funds.

             The prohibition cited is only in Report language, which is non-binding.
            I suggest that we drop the reference to FY 1997 and instead state our
            intention to use innovative funds for the Indian Initiative as follows:

            Under the terms of the Department of Justice Appropriations Act, 1997,
            except to the extent that limited carryover is utilized for innovative
            programs pursuant to reprogramming provisions, no funding may be directed
            toward innovative programs. A reprogramming request was approved during
            FY 1997 to fund Problem Solving Partnership applications submitted in FY
            1996 and to support solicitations for proposals under an Advancing
            Community Policing initiative.  The COPS Office plans to continue funding


  problem-Solving partnership grants and Advancing Community Policing grants
  during FY 1999 with available carryover funds.   In addition, the COPS
  Office anticipates using up to $54 million in innovative program funding
  to promote community policing and to improve the law enforcement
  capability on Indian lands.  The Administration is well aware of
  Congressional concerns regarding the use of COPS funding for non-hiring
  purposes.  However, improving the law enforcement capability on Indian
  lands presents unique challenges and must include the provision of basic
  law enforcement needs that cannot be addressed by the hiring programs or
  other available grant programs alone.

   Please let me know what you think.
