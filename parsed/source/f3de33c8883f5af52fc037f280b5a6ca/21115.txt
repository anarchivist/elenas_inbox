MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:          Bruce Reed
               Elena Kagan

RE:            DPC Weekly Report

        Education -- Back to School Event: We are planning an education event for Monday,
August 31 at an elementary school in Virginia. We expect that you will make brief remarks and
participate in a roundtable discussion with the school principal, teachers and parents, before an
audience of teachers and parents from the school. Students will not return to the school until the
following week. The purpose of the event is to allow you to frame the education agenda for
Congress as it returns, and to challenge Congress to enact legislation for your education priorities
(school modernization and class size reduction, charter schools, early literacy, and the Higher
Education Act, including your proposal to recruit and prepare 35,000 teachers for high poverty
communities and your High Hopes mentoring initiative) and to appropriate the funds you have
requested. The Senate appropriations subcommittee will mark-up the Labor-HHS-Education
bill on Tuesday, which is expected to restore many of the cuts made in the House. Therefore, it
will be particularly timely for you to challenge the Senate on Monday to restore these cuts.

        Health Care -- Vice President's Children's Health Care Event: On Tuesday, the
Vice President is scheduled to participate in a children's health insurance outreach event with
Irwin Redlener's Children's Health Fund to announce two to three new states that are receiving
Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) approvals. The states include Iowa and possibly
Georgia, Delaware, Montana or Kansas. At this event, the Children's Health Fund will be
focusing attention on its new medical caravan, which is touring through several states over the
next week in an effort to sign up uninsured children who are eligible but not enrolled in health
insurance programs. In addition, the Vice President will also highlight some of the initiatives
that Federal government is taking in response to the Executive Memorandum you issued in June
at the Family Conference in Nashville directing eight Federal agencies to enroll and cover
uninsured children, including over 150,000 children's health pamphlets that are being sent
Treasury Department workers, administering the EITC and other low-income assistance
programs.

        Immigration -- H-IB Visas: In the face of growing pressure from the Republic
leadership to reach a compromise, Rep. Smith and Sen. Abraham developed a proposal that
increases the H-IB cap and includes limited and weak reforms to the H-IB program and a small
application fee to fund training. Since releasing our list of proposed changes to the
Abraham/Smith proposal, we have been engaged in serious discussions with members of
Congress (including Sen. Abraham and Rep. Lofgren), and representatives from the business

substantial training provision and stronger protections for u.s. workers. We are hopeful that a
compromise can be reached before the end of the Congressional session.

        Immigration -- H-2A guestworkers: As you know, in July the Senate passed an
amendment to the CJS appropriations bill (sponsored by Sens. Wyden and Graham) that would
create a new agricultural guestworker program. Secretary Herman sent a letter to Sen. Wyden
strongly opposing his amendment because it would weaken the labor protections for migrant
farm workers. However, in an attempt to address the real concerns with the H-2A program
raised by growers while, at the same time, protecting the interests of farmworkers, the
Department of Labor has initiated contacts with various members of Congress to establish a
bi-partisan working group on this issue. This group will likely include Sens. Wyden, Graham,
Kennedy, Feinstein, Abraham and Coverdell and Representatives Lamar Smith, Bishop, Becerra,
Watt and Berman. Our goal is to examine various policy proposals related to the guestworker
program and determine whether and where consensus can be reached.
