TEXT:
Right now we are proposing that Eli Segal and Shalala brief at the top of
Mike's briefing after the event.  Herman is not available" because of a
roundtable already scheduled at Labor.

I understand Bruce is not available, what do people think of having Elena
brief to round out the briefing and be able to talk about the DOL grants?

I think Segal, Shalala, and Kagan works best.   Agreed?
