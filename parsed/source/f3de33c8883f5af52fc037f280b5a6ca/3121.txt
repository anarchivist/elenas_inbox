TEXT:
A Dodd amendment to ensure that kids losing SSI due to new tigher
eligibility rules could keep Medicaid failed, 49-51.   Domenici said that
the Finance Committee believes that the $16 billion child health block
grant will take care of these kids (there would be no guarantee, however
-- they would be covered .only if states chose to, I believe).
