 TEXT:
 I have been talking with Karl Alexander of Johns Hopkins University who
 has conducted research on social promotion/retention in Baltimore. He was
 quoted in the recent NYT article on social promotion. Attached is a piece
 he has written on social promotion for a point/counterpoint for
 Scripps-Howard (Lorrie Sheppard is the counterpoint).  It is a helpful
 piece. He also is writing for the Newshour Online in response to Newshour
 segments about social promotion. He. is interested in writing an op-ed on
 social promotion.

Scripps-Howard Point/Counterpoint



       President Clinton's call to end social promotion in his State of the Union

address has made retention policy a front burner-issue. This is a healthy

development in my view, but only if it encourages serious discussion of how best

to meet the needs of children who are not achieving at acceptable levels. That

requires getting beyond the stale "to retain or not" debate-- it's too confining.

       With colleagues Doris Entwisle and Susan Dauber, in 1994 I published a

book on the effects of grade retention ("On the Success of Failure," Cambridge

University Press) that monitors the school progress of some 800 Baltimore

children from first grade thorough middle school. More than 40% of the children

we studied were held back during that time, many twice. Such numbers signal a

problem of immense proportions, for the young people involved, who lose

precious time, and for the schools, which must bear the cost of educating

repeaters for an extra year or two. But what of the impact of retention, is it

helpful, as intended, or harmful, as critics of the practice claim? We looked,

carefully, at school performance (achievement test scores and marks) and

attitudes (toward self and school) after children were held back in relation to the

same criteria from before they were held back and in relation to promoted

children's school performance and attitudes over the same time frame (some of

these comparisons spanned eight years). Contrary to the critics, retention was

not positively harmful; more than that, it helped. Children held back in the early

elementary years (our focus) made up ground academically and suffered no

emotional scars. These youngsters-- who were far behind academically before

being retained- did not catch up altogether, but they were better off than before.

On that basis, we deemed retention a qualified success.

      That conclusion seems to· have cast us in the role of "friends of retention,"

but that misreads our position. Retention "works" only in a narrow sense-- when

the later situation of repeaters is compared against other poor performing

students who were promoted (or, equivalently, against all promoted children,

using statistical means to adjust for achievement differences that predate

retention). This approach attempts to compare like against like. It is the frame of

reference used in all evaluations of grade retention, and by this standard our

evidence is sound. But if we believe that all children can, and should, realize

success at school, then simply seeing repeaters keep up with other low

achievers is small comfort.

       At this point I part company with the critics. Many seem so preoccupied

with the practice that they lose sight of why these children are candidates for

retention in the first place. Most are far behind academically, and social

promotion-- simply moving them ahead unprepared for what awaits them- won't

fix anything. The time bought by repeating a grade can help, but the decision to

promote or not should be made case by case, based on firm understanding of a

child's difficulties and needs. For most poor performing children under most

circumstances, this should be the option of last choice, not first choice. For

them, we need a "third way," one that shores up their skills before problems

mount. Partial promotion, summer programs, ungraded classes, looping,

cooperative learning, and supplemental services (e.g, tutoring) are promising

avenues, but social promotion has no place on the list.
       I applaud President Clinton's call for an end to social promotion if it is a
mandate to find this "third way." My fear is that many instead will take it simply
as license to hold back more children.
