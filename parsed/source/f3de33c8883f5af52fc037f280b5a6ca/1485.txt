                         MEDICARE FRAUD ANNOUNCEMENT

                             DATE:          March 26, 1997
                             LOCATION:      Roosevelt Room
                             BRIEFING TIME: 11:45 am - 12:15 pm
                             EVENT TIME:    12:15 pm - 12:45 pm
                             FROM:          Bruce Reed
                                            Chris Jennings


I.    PURPOSE

      You will be introducing new legislative initiatives to fight waste, fraud, and abuse in our
      health care system. These initiatives establish tough new requirements for individuals
      and companies that wish to participate in Medicare or Medicaid, and build on your strong
      record in this area. This event will also highlight the success of Operation Restore Trust
      in Florida -- one of the five states participating in your comprehensive anti-fraud initiative
      -- and your efforts to bring the Federal and state governments together to fight fraud and
      abuse.

II.   BACKGROUND

      In poll after poll, Americans report their belief that fraud and abuse is one of the biggest
      cost problems in our health care system. A recent study by the American Association of
      Retired Persons found that Americans believe that fraud and abuse is an enormous
      problem in our health care system.

      Your strong efforts to fight fraud and abuse over the last four years have helped save
      more than $20 billion in health care claims through policy changes, penalties, recoveries,
      and claim denials. Your 1993 budget closed loopholes in Medicare and Medicaid that
      allowed waste and fraud and abuse. Two years ago, the Administration launched
      Operation Restore Trust, a comprehensive anti-fraud initiative in five key states that has
      produced returns of $1 0 for every $1 invested. The Kassebaum-Kennedy legislation you
      signed last year expanded Operation Restore Trust nationwide for the first time, creating a
      stable source of funding for fraud control. Your 1998 budget also contains a number of
      anti-fraud and abuse proposals intended to root fraud out the home health agencies and
      skilled nursing facilities.
                                                                       Hex-Dump Conversion

       The legislation you are proposing today will build on these past successes by focusing on
       three areas: (1) preventing fraudulent providers from getting in the system in the first
       place. Evidence from Florida and elsewhere has revealed that the most effective way to
       fight fraud and abuse is to prevent potential fraud from ever entering the system; (2)
       improving more traditional enforcement, such as civil monetary penalties; and (3)
       minimizing abuses for providers in the system, such as assuring appropriate benefits for
       mental health benefits and linking hospice payments to the geographic location of the
       service.
