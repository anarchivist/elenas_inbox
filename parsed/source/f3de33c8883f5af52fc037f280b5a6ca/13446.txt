Hi!
I am the writer that took over Lori Anderson's issues when she moved to the
Press Office.   I am trying to finalize the campaign reform letter.  It follows
'(with your suggested changes) .  Please let me know if there is anything more
that needs to be done.   Thanks.
******************************************************************************
Thank you for sharing your ideas about political reform.   I
appreciate your perspective on this important issue.
For the past three years, my Administration has worked with
Congress to stop the federal government from doing business-aa-
usual. We have sought to curb the power of narrow interests and
make politicians more accountable to the people they serve.
Last year I asked Congress to take major steps toward political
reform. And Congress agreed. They applied to themselves the
laws that they pass governing the rest of America. They gave up
gifts, meals, and trips from lobbyists, and last December they
enacted strong lobbying disclosure provisions bringing lobbying
into the sunlight of public scrutiny.
And now, for the first time in a generation, we are striving to
reduce the influence of money on elections. With the McCain-
Feingold bipartisan campaign finance reform bill, we are working
hard to curb special interest influence in politics by limiting
spending, curbing the campaign power of PACs and lobbyists, and
providing free television time for candidates who abide by
voluntary spending limits.
I am proud of the progress we have made so far, and I am
confident that with these political reforms we can make our
government more efficient and more responsive to the American
people. Hy Administration remains committed to giving the
American people a government that does more, costs less, and most
important, is worthy of their trust. Working together, we can
put the people first.
