TEXT:
There will be a briefing on Mon. at 11:45 in 211 by David Sweanor from
Canada's Non-Smokers' Rights Association on Canada's experience with
cigarette smuggling.  Canada was forced to roll back its tax increase
because of problems with smuggling.  Sweanor testified before 'Hatch today
and will be testifying before Conrad on Monday afternoon.  He will: reveal
the facts and myths about cigarette smuggling, discuss what works and what
doesn't work to combat smuggling, and he will tell us about the tobacco
industry's role in smuggling cigarettes in Canada.

The following is an excerpt from an 8/25/97 NYTs story on smuggling:

Assault on Canada
Higher Taxes Set Off A Lucrative Trade

   It was a rainy day at a salmon-fishing resort in British Columbia in
September 1995. Les Thompson, an R. J. Reynolds salesman, was sitting
around a
fireplace with some of his customers.



   Unbeknownst to Mr. Thompson, one man was an American informant. And
according
to court records unsealed in Syracuse on Aug. 13, he later described to a
grand
jury how the conversation took an intriguing turn    right into a
discussion
about smuggling cigarettes into Canada.

   One document -- an affidavit from a Federal law enforcement officer --
quoted
the informant as saying it was clear Mr. Thompson knew the dealers were
selling
the cigarettes to American Indians who smuggled them across the St.
Lawrence
River.

   The informant said Mr. Thompson chided the dealers   that if they did not
keep
better sales records, he would start selling directly   to the Indians. And
on
another day when one guest fell ilIon a fishing boat,   Mr. Thompson joked
that
the man "should be used to the water from hauling the   cigarettes,"
theaffidavit said.

   As raw as it might seem, industry critics and law enforcement officials
say
this episode was just the latest in a chain of evidence that the tobacco
industry fueled a smuggling assault on Canada in the early 1990's.

   The smuggling took off after Canada raised taxes several times
largely to
discourage cigarette consumption, one of the first countries to try this
approach. Beginning in 1982, its taxes became increasingly stiffer. By
1992 a
pack cost about $4.50 (United States) in Canada, compared with slightly
less
than $2 in the United States, making the situation ripe for smuggling.

   Canadian health researchers think consumption did fall because of the
taxes.
And Canada's top three tobacco companies -- each affiliated with either
Philip
Morris, Reynolds or B.A.T.    lobbied to repeal them.

   The taxes did not apply to exports, and the companies started shipping
large
amounts of Canadian brands, like Players and Export A, to the United
States even
though few Americans smoke them.

   Where once only a tiny portion of the cigarettes made in Canada had been
exported, that total jumped to a third by 1993, with the bulk going to
upstate
New York and other border locales. Reynolds also began making Canadian
brands in
the United States and shipping them to dealers in border states. Most
quickly
found their way back into Canada through smugglers.



   None of this was any secret in Canada. The industry "absolutely" knew
that
most of the exports were being smuggled back, Michel Descoteaux, a
spokesman for
Imperial Tobacco Ltd., which is partly owned by B.A.T., said in an
interview.

    But Mr. Descoteaux said this was not the industry's fault. "We had
 warned the
 Government for years that when the taxes were increased, there would be
  smuggling. " He also said Imperial was simply "shipping cigarettes in
 response
.to orders" by American dealers. "What would you have us do?"

   Still, by February 1994, the smuggling had become so intense that
Prime
Minister Jean Chretien was forced to start rolling back the taxes. "The
fact
is," he said then, "that the Canadian tobacco manufacturers have
benefited
directly from this illegal trade." He said they had "known perfectly well"
what
was happening and added, "I believe they have not acted responsibly."

   Since then, two criminal cases have reinforced what he said. Federal
undercover agents in New Orleans recorded talks with two Brown &
Williamson sales managers in 1994 as they arranged shipments of Imperial
products that were supposed to go to fishing vessels but were really
smuggled
back into Canada. Both men have since pleaded guilty to Federal charges of
aiding smugglers.

   Court documents show that one of them, Michael I. Bernstein, told an
undercover agent that a sales official at Imperial had agreed to supply
cigarettes for the smuggling as long as each order was kept small.

           The documents quote Mr. Bernstein as saying the Imperial official would
 II   go
  along with that.".But, Mr. Bernstein cautioned, "he assured me that if and
  when
  we get snagged with the packet of stuff anywhere in Canada, they're going
  to cut
. me off."

   Mr. Bernstein also told investigators that selling to smugglers was
part of
Brown & Williamson's marketing strategy. Brown & Williamson and Imperial
officials have denied this, and Federal prosecutors recently closed the
case
without bringing additional charges.

   The second investigation, centered in Syracuse and in Canada, is now
raising
similar questions about Reynolds.

  The grand jury in Syracuse indicted 21people in June on charges that they
were involved in smuggling $700 million worth of cigarettes and alcohol
through the St. Regis Indian Reservation in upstate New York from 1992
through


1996. Court documents state that some dealers regularly bought cigarettes
from
Reynolds and resold them -- usually for cash -- to members of an Indian
tribe,
who slipped them into Canada.

   Affidavits by investigators in both countries show that Reynolds
routinely
entertained the dealers at the Sonora Island Resort in British Columbia,
where
the company sponsored an annual fishing tournament. One dealer told an
informant
last summer that he was about to take 12 to 14 associates to the
tournament and
that Reynolds was going to pay a $10,000 entry fee for each of them.

    Reynolds says it does not condone smuggling and would not comment on
the
investigation. Mr. Thompson did not return calls for comment.

   But David T. Sweanor, an antismoking advocate in Canada, said the
industry
"basically played Canada for a banana republic and got rewarded for it."
