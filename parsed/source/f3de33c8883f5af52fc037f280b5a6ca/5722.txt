Subject:         Meeting with Foundation Executives Thursday, December 18, 1997
1-4pm
in the NEOB room 10103




Attached is an agenda and a list of Foundation executives who will be
meeting with White House and PIR staff to discuss how we can work
together. These Foundations have funded new and innovative race relations
initiatives nationwide, particularly in the area of national conversations
around race and the identification of leaders in various sectors who have
developed promising practices.
The suggested agenda will guide the discussion.   Please let me know if
you have questions.

We will inform Foundation representatives that   some individuals are


unable to stay throughout the duration of the meeting.     Thanks.   Audrey
Hutchinson

                                               AGENDA

l.    Introductions

              (foundation representatives and Initiative staff describe framework of mutual interest)

2.    Update from the President's Initiative: recent developments

              In particular, how is the President's Initiative defining its mission and its
      projected actions and outcomes?

3.    Explore possible links between foundation activities and Initiative work. In the areas of public
      policy, conversation around race, and promising pr~ctices, we might discuss the following
      questions:

               -What is being done?
               -How do we measure success?
             . -How do we make the connection between dialogue and promising practices?
      -What else needs to be done?
               -How do we develop a large pool of promising practices to highlight in this next
       year?
               -How do we create a process to identify, evaluate, and replicate the strongest
       promising practices?
               -How can the foundations and the Initiative work together to highlight the work
                being undertaken this year?

4.    Leadership

            What can foundations do to effectively support leadership around race in
      communities? How could we further support our grantees?

5.    Research

              What type of research do the foundations currently support and what are the
      plans for the future?

6.    Next steps

              What can foundations do to advance the work after this year?
