health issues left to be resolved in our appropriations discussions on the Hill. High visibility
issues related to Medicare include, potential responses to reimbursement issues for home health
care and skilled nursing facilities, as well as Pennsylvania disproportionate share hospital
payments. On these issues, we are viewed by supporters as being helpful. Outstanding
Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) issues include a controversial
Medicaid cost savings proposal and CHIP fixes for Washington, Puerto Rico and Wisconsin.
Public health issues of interest include organ allocation, needle exchange, assisted suicide, and
your race and health initiative. We will keep you apprised of final outcomes of these issues
when they are resolved.
