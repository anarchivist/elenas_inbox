           The attached draft incorporates changes suggested by DOJ and HHS after the
           original was circulated by OMB.    The re-draft does not satisfy all DOJ
           and HHS concerns but it does accomodate some.   (DOJ, in particular, would
           like to add at the end of the fourth paragraph the> line: "The Department
           also has some practical enforcement concerns that it would be pleased to
           detail for the members and staff."    HHS would like to eliminate the
           suggestion that we would want to work to fix the legislation.)

           please send comments ASAP but no later than 11:00 Am on Friday.       Thanks.

         Dear

                 The Administration appreciates the concerns of the sponsors of S. 1645 about fostering
         parental and family involvement in a minor's decision to obtain an abortion and their concerns
         about overbearing and sometimes predatory adults who improperly influence minors' abortion
         decisions. The Administration believes, however, that changes must be made to ensure that S..
         1645 is appropriately tailored to achieve these important goals. The Administration would
         support properly crafted legislation that would make it illegal to transport minors across state
         lines for the purposes of avoiding parental involvement requirements, but strongly opposes
         S.1645 unless these changes are made.

                  First, S. 1645 must be amended to exclude close family members from criminal and civil
         liability. Under the legislation, grandmothers, aunts, and adult siblings could face criminal
         prosecution for coming to the aid of a relative in distress. Even a mother or father could be
         exposed to criminal penalty if she or he resides in a state that has a two parent notice or consent
         law. Imposing criminal and civil sanctions on family members for helping their relatives,
         however, would not further the interests of healthy family communications. Subjecting family
         members to criminal or civil sanction, moreover, would also further isolate the minor by
         discouraging her from seeking advice and counsel from those closest to her. Finally, creating a
         civil action that permits family members to sue each other when a minor within that family has
         an abortion would not serve the goal of fostering strong families.

                  Second, S. 1645 must be amended to ensure that persons who only provide information,
         counseling, referral, or medical services to the minor cannot be subject to liability. The bill as
         written, for example, could potentially subject a telephone receptionist, physician, or counselor to
         civil or criminal liability merely for informing an unnamed caller or patient about the availability
         of abortion services. Exposing such persons to criminal or civil liability, however, would not
         further the interests in promoting family communication, would not deter those who would
         inappropriately transport minors across state lines to obtain abortions, and might provide an
         unintended basis for vexatious litigation against individuals and organizations.

                  Finally, S. 1645 must be amended to address constitutional concerns that the Department·
         of Justice has identified in particular provisions of the legislation. The Department will
         forward their concerns subsequently and would be pleased to work with the sponsors in crafting
         legislation that remedies those defects and the other matters noted above.

                 The Administration is concerned that S. 1645, as written, raises novel and important
         federalism issues including the rights of states to regulate matters within their own boundaries.
         The Administration believes, however, that legislation that addresses the concerns noted above,
         and that is carefully targeted towards punishing non-relatives who transport minors across state
         lines for the purposes of avoiding parental involvement requirements, would minimize the
         federalism concerns.                                                                 .
                                                                                      Sf
