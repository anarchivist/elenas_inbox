MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:                  Bruce Reed

SUBJECT:               DPC Weekly Report


        1. Welfare Caseload Dropped 20% in First Term: We haven't released them yet,
but the final caseload reductions are in for the first term. Welfare caseloads dropped a record
2.8 million from January 1993 to January 1997 -- a 20% decline. There were 860,000 fewer
families on welfare at the end of your first term than when you took office. Caseloads dropped
in 47 states (Hawaii, Alaska, California, and D.C. are the exceptions). The greatest declines
were in Wisconsin (49%), Oregon (43%), West Virginia (43%), Indiana (42%), and Oklahoma
(40%); a total of 18 states had case load declines of 30% or more. To put this in perspective, the
caseload decreased as much in the last four years as it increased in the first 25 years of the
AFDC program. (The welfare rolls did not reach 3 million until 1960.)

         We can release these numbers in conjunction with Thursday'S Cabinet meeting, when
agencies and the White House will present their plans to hire people off welfare. We will follow
up shortly with a Council of Economic Advisers white paper that attributes 42% of the caseload
decline to economic growth, 32% to our welfare waivers, and 26% to other unexplained factors
(e.g., increased child support collections, expansion of the EITC, heightened awareness of
pending welfare reforms, and any unknown variables).

       2. Welfare-to-Work Foundation: Eli Segal is ready to incorporate and announce his
foundation, which will be headed by United Airlines CEO Gerald Greenwald. The CEOs of
UPS, Burger King, Sprint, Monsanto, and probably Marriott will also be founding board
members. Eli hopes to line up 15-25 other companies for a White House announcement in late
April. His long-term goal is to sign up at least 2,500 businesses, and to help establish a national
network of intermediaries like America Works to provide the job-readiness, job placement, and
support many recipients need and most employers don't know how to provide. He plans to
launch challenges in several major cities, and would like to kick off that effort with a major
Presidential event with a few hundred businesses in Milwaukee in Mayor June.

       3. AIDS Developments: Your idea to pick Sandy Thurman as AIDS Director is going
over well in the community, and should be well-received at"Monday's announcement. I have
                                                         Hex·Dilmp Conversion

met with her several times, and think she's terrific. Your Presidential Advisory Council on
HIV/AIDS will meet in Washington this week and make two major recommendations: I) that
you should call for increased investment in research to enable the development of an AIDS
vaccine by a date certain (probably within a decade); and 2) that Secretary Shalala should certify
that needle exchange programs reduce the spread of HIV and do not increase drug use. The first
recommendation is good news, and may help us overcome NIH's steadfast resistance to letting us
earmark more resources for vaccine research or specify a target date. On needle exchange, we'll
have to proceed more carefully.

        4. Seat Belts and NEXTEA: The Transportation Department has completed a report
on measures to increase seat belt use toward a new national goal of 85% by the year 2000, but we
need your sign-off on a key proposal. In most states, seat belt laws are enforced only when a
driver is stopped for some other reason. But 11 states and D.C. have adopted primary seat belt
laws, which allow for ticketing solely for failure to use a seat belt. Belt use in these states is
15% higher than in states with secondary enforcement laws. NHTSA estimates that enactment
of primary belt laws by the remaining 39 states would save 1,800 lives a year.

         The NEXTEA bill you announced March 12 includes financial incentives (grants) for
states to adopt primary belt laws. Secretary Slater would like to send Congress a new safety title
for NEXTEA to strengthen states' incentive by adding a "soft sanction": States that do not pass
primary laws or achieve 85% belt use by October 2002 would have to transfer 1.5% of their
federal highway funds into their highway safety programs.

        The NGA opposes this proposal, as do the National Motorists Association, individual
liberties groups, and some conservative and western members of Congress. A broad coalition of
automakers, insurance companies, safety advocates, and law enforcement will support it. DOT
believes the proposal has a good chance of congressional approval, in the wake of increased
public outcry over airbags and attention to the importance of seat belts. Gene and I both
recommend that you support Secretary Slater's proposal.

         5. Tobacco: Federal Judge William Osteen in North Carolina has indicated he will not
issue a decision on FDA's tobacco rule before April 14, but we expect him to issue his decision
that day or shortly thereafter. Three general outcomes are possible: I) the court upholds the
rule; 2) the court rules that FDA has jurisdiction, but that portions or all of the rule are invalid; or
3) the court rules against FDA jurisdiction and the rule. We have worked with HHS, Justice,
and other White House offices to prepare statements for each of these scenarios so you and others
will be able to respond quickly to the decision. The Justice Department will review the decision
immediately. If the decision is not completely favorable, we expect to be prepared to announce
later that same day the Administration's intent to appeal. We are also working with the
departments to prepare new policies you could announce within days or weeks after the decision
to ensure further progress on tobacco as the FDA rule moves through the appeals process.

       6. California Testing Feud: A few days after Delaine Eastin and 240 business leaders
endorsed our testing initiative, the head of the California Board of Education (a Wilson
appointee) wrote Secretary Riley contending that the state legislature would have to pass a new
                                                             Hex-Dump Conversion

law before the Board could consider proceeding with our tests. Eastin strongly disagrees, and
has fired back publicly at the Board, pointing out that California already administers the NAEP
test on a sample basis and that the Board has long sought a national means of assessment to
compare California's performance with other states. It's too early to tell whether this is a
short-term political feud or will heat up into a long-term problem.

        7. COPS Program: The Justice Department has informed us that large-city demand
for additional COPS grants is seriously lagging this year. Joe Brann wants our sign-off on
administrative changes that will help avoid unspent COPS funding.

         The Crime Bill requires half the grants to go to jurisdictions with populations of 150,000
or more. Currently, the program requires a 25% local match, three-year grants, and a cap of
$75,000 per officer over the life of the grant. Because large cities have much higher costs per
officer, the cap forces them to pay a match of up to 40%. To generate further demand in large
cities, Brann wants to use his discretionary authority to eliminate the cap, extend the grant period
to 4 years, extend current grants for 1 year if they agree to add new officers (so that existing
grants do not have less favorable terms), and require these cities to deploy the new officers to
targeted "hot spot" crime areas. These changes could mean' that it will take another year to reach
100,000 officers (2001 instead of2000), but we don't have much choice if we're going to
stimulate the necessary demand for large city applications.

         8. Voting Rights and Education Reform: This week, the Justice Department decided
not to invoke the Voting Rights Act to block New York's school reorganization and reform
efforts. The Department had caused a panic in New York City last month by threatening to
delay reorganization on the grounds that it might disenfranchise school board voters, even though
only 5% of people currently vote in those elections and the city's school boards have been
notoriously unresponsive to public outcry for reform. This week's decision is a good precedent
if the issue comes up in other states.
