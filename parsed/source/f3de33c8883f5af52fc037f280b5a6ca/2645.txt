TEXT:
Elena:

Justice, in their preliminary conversations with Republicans, are trying
to get a prevention "carve out" in the inevitable Republican block grant
to be included in the Republican mark.  The notion then is that the R's,
if they agree to a prevention "carve out," will pretty much let us submit
our own language -- and that we will then be able to come up with language
that satisfies both Rahm and the Dems interested in prevention.
Ultimately, I think we need a bit more room to work with prevention
language than Rahm has indicated, and that's why I agreed with Kent.
However, we won't know for sure until DOJ drafts language for us, Rahm and
key Dems to review.

Also worth noting: Education called me Friday and today.   They're
concerned that our adding new after school language to the juvie bill will
only doom funding for their own effort. Could be ... The real test,
however, is whether or not we can get any of these efforts -- HHS, Ed or
DOJ -- funded in the current budget environment. We should start looking
at/analyzing appropriations realities.
