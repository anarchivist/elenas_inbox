TEXT:
A. Per my previous e-mail, Lowey will offer amendment in approps cmt
today prohibiting use of fed funds for tobacco crop insurance staff. USDA
is sending a letter -- w/our edits -- to Chairman Skeen opposing the
amendment.  Public health groups will support Lowey, but won't push.   I
don't think we need to flaunt the letter, but if asked our message should
be:

1)Crop insurance (including tobacco crop insurance) is an essential part
of the producer safety net envisioned by the Administration's Agricultural
policy. The amendment would have a detrimental effect on thousands of
small farmers and their communities in the event of a disaster.

2)      While it's a fair question to ask whether the government should
subsidize tobacco growing, we should consider any changes to policies
toward tobacco farmers in a broader context, not piecemeal. We're
considering farmers' concerns in our review of the proposed tobacco
settlement.

B.    Koop-Kessler recommends establishing a blue-ribbon panel to provide
both short- and long-term strategies for reducing the dependence of
certain states and communities on tobacco.  The panel would involve
farmers in the review and develop recommendations for, among other things,
the provision of economic development assistance.  We should ask the
farmers how they view this proposal. The Campaign's staffer on it
reports tobacco farmers are reacting favorably to the idea.
