The Honorable Cass Ballenger
Chairman
Subcommittee on Workforce Protections
Committee on Education and the Workforce
U.S. House of Representatives
Washington, D.C. 20515

Dear Chairman Ballenger:

I am wri ting to provide you wi th the views of the Department of Labor
on H.R. 1381, the "Rewarding Performance in Compensation Act." This
bill would amend the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) to exclude from
the definition of regular rate payments made to reward employees
for meeting or exceeding productivity, quality, efficiency, or sales
goals as specified in a gainsharing, incentive bonus, commission,
or performance contingent bonus plan.      The effect of this amendment
would be to diminish employees' entitlements for overtime premium
pay under the FLSA.    The Department of Labor strongly opposes this
bill.

This bill would substantially reverse the FLSA's long-standing
overtime policy and drastically weaken existing protections for
workers.  It represents an assault on the 40-hour workweek and an
employee's right to receive true time-and-a-half overtime premium
pay. Moreover, this bill does nothing to guarantee to workers that
they would ever share in their employers' gains that would corne from
their having to work excessive overtime hours.

The bill would allow an employer to pay artificially low hourly wages
and structure a compensation scheme with "excludable" bonus pay that
is based upon production or efficiency, enabling an employer to
effectively transfer much of its risk to the workers.  The bill would
not guarantee workers the right to receive any incentive
compensation, but it would guarantee employers the right to exclude
any such pay from overtime. Workers' only rights if this bill became
law would be overtime at time-and-a-halfat their artificially
decreased hourly wage, not their true regular rate.    This will have
the perverse effect of encouraging employers to work their employees
for longer hours with no guaranteed compensation for their extra
work, exactly the opposite of the original intent of the FLSA's
overtime standards.

     The Department strongly opposes this bill's attempt to undermine
workers' rights and the 40-hour workweek. These requirements, which
have been in place for over 60 years, provide vi tal worker protections
that discourage employers from working employees excessively long
                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion .

hours and ensure fair compensation to employees for the burdens of
working extended hours for their employer. Because it is contrary
to the best interests of the Nation's workers who would be affected
by it, if this bill were presented to the President, I would recommend
that he veto it.

The Office of Management and Budget has advised that there is no
objection to the presentation of this report from the standpoint
of the Administration's program.

                              Sincerely,



                              Alexis M. Herman
