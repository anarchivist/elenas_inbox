                                    !\'larch 26, 1998


Q:   Mr. President, some experts have commented that the Jonesboro shooting -- as well
     as the Pearl and Paducah shootings -- were at least in part the result of Southern .
     culture's close relationship with firearms, and that the time has come for the South
     -- and all of rural America -- to end its love affair with guns. Do you agree with
     this assessment?

A:   I don't know that I agree with that assessment. As a Southerner, I grew up around
     firearms and went hunting. I know what it's like to grow up in a community where
     school lets out the first day of the deer hunting season. Done responsibly, there's
     nothing necessarily wrong with that.

     I think if we're going to make any sense at all about these terrible tragedies, we must
     view the problem -- and any potential solutions -- in much broader terms. Sadly, too
     many of our young people today are less likely to spend time with responsible adults than
     they are to witness hundreds of murders on television -- or to play video games that
     reward brutal violence. That shouldn't be. We should be showing these kids how to
     resolve their conflicts peacefully. We should be setting an example for them -- teaching
     them right from wrong. And we should be filling their lives with opportunities to do
     good and get ahead. I think that's what most important.

     But government has a role, too. That is why I have asked the Attorney General and
     Secretary Riley to reach out to some of the experts and ask them if there's more that we
     can do to prevent these types of tragedies. We have already done much to promote
     responsibility and reduce crime and violence in America. We have passed tough gun
     laws, hired more police, and enforced zero tolerance policies in our schools. But we are
     prepared to do whatever else is necessary to keep our children safe.
