The Honorable William Goodling
Chairman
Committee on Education and the Workforce
U. S. House of Representatives
Washington, D.C. 20515

Dear Mr. Chairman:

       As you know, the Administration and the bipartisan congressional leadership
recently reached agreement on a historic plan to balance the budget by 2002 while
investing in the future. The plan is good for America, its people, and its future, and
we are committed to working with Congress to see it enacted.

       Your committee will shortly take up important components of that Agreement,
addressing welfare to work, student loans and the Smith-Hughes Act. We appreciate
your efforts to include many provisions consistent with the Agreement, which
represent valuable policy advances.

        Welfare to Work --We are pleased that the Committee is considering provisions
that meet many of the Administration's priorities for the program. Specifically, we
are pleased that the Committee provides funds for jobs where they are needed most to
help long-term recipients in high unemployment-high poverty areas; directs funds to
local communities with large numbers of poor people; provides for local
administration by chief local elected officials working with private industry councils;
gives communities appropriate flexibility to use the funds to create successful job
placement and job creation programs; and includes the non-displacement provisions of
H.R. 1385, the House-passed job training reform bill.

       Student Loans -- We are pleased the Committee draft includes $1.763 billion in
outlay savings, including $1 billion in Federal reserves recalled from guaranty
agencies, $160 million from eliminating a fee paid to institutions in the Direct Student
Loan program, and $603 million in reduced Federal student loan administrative costs.
All these savings are being achicved without increasing costs or rcducing benefits to
students and their families. We appreciate that the Committee has accepted the
Administration proposal for an enforcement provision to ensure that the $1 billion in
reserves is recovered by FY 2002. We understand that there are still details to work
out on the amounts to be recovered from each agency. We will continue to work with
the Committee on a satisfactory process.

       The Administration has the following serious concerns with other aspects of the

                                                              Automated Records Management System
                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion

        Welfare-to-Work Grants to Cities -- The challenge of welfare reform -- moving
welfare recipients into work -- will be greatest in our Nation's large urban centers. The
Administration strongly believes that a substantial amount of all welfare-to-work
funds should be managed by cities and other local areas. The welfare-to-work structure
crafted by the Ways and Means Committee accomplishes this goal through its division of
funds between formula (50 percent) and competitive (50 percent) grants; its formula grant
sub-State allocation factors and method of administration; and its reservation of 65 percent
of competitive grants for cities. The Education and Workforce Committee would reduce
the competitive funding share from 50 percent to 5 percent, thus severely restricting the
amount for which cities can apply directly. The Administration strongly prefers the Ways
and Means proposal.

        Welfare-to-Work Performance Fund -- The Committee's proposal does not
include a performance fund. It is essential that welfare to work funds generate
greater levels of placement in unsubsidized jobs than States will achieve with TANF
and other funds. We hope the Committee will be willing to consider a mechanism to
provide needed incentives and rewards for placing more of the hardest-to-serve in
lasting, unsubsidized jobs that promote self-sufficiency. We stand ready to provide
assistance in this effort.

       Minimum Wage and Workfare --The Administration strongly opposes the
Committee's proposal on the minimum wage and welfare work requirements. The
proposal is not part of the budget agreement {the underlined language was in the
Archer letter; DPC proposes to strike: and, had it been raised during negotiations,
we would have strongly opposed it.} These minimum wage and we~fare work
requirements proposals would undermine the fundamental goals of welfare reform.
The Administration believes strongly that everyone who can work must work, and
everyone who works should earn at least the minimum wage --whether they are
coming offwelfare.or not. These proposals do not meet this test. {the underlined
language was in the Archer letter, except for one phrase -- "safe work places" -- that is
covered by the Goodling Bill. DPC proposes to return to the Shaw letter formulation,
which only alluded to "work place protections". DOL prefers the Archer language:
In addition, under the proposal working welfare recipients will be deprived of the
protection of laws addressing employment discrimination, child labor, overtime, and
family and medical leave.}

       TANF and Vocational Education -- The Administration is concerned with the
Committee's proposal on vocational education in TANF. The agreement did not
address making changes in the T ANF work requirements regarding vocational
education and educational services for teen parents.

      Student Loans New Entitlement -- The Administration opposes the provision
regarding administrative cost allowances (A CAs) to guaranty agencies in the Federal




    Family Education Loan Program (FFELP). The provision would mandate ACAs to
    be paid at a rate of .85% of new loan volume.from mandatory funding authorized
    under Section 458 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HE A), up to a cap of $170
    million in FY 1998 and 1999 and $150 million in FY 2000-2002. It would represent a
    new entitlement to these agencies not included in the budget agreement. Moreover,
    any allowance to these agencies should bear some relationship to the costs these
    agencies incur and not be based on an arbitrary formula. This is an issue for the
    upcoming HEA Reauthorization.

          The Committee draft includes a provision that would reduce funds in Section
    458 now available to the Secretary to administer the FFEL Program. The
    Administration strongly opposes this language. Its enactment would mean the
    Secretary could not effectively administer the FFEL Program.

            Smith-Hughes -- We understand that the Chairman's mark would repeal the
    Smith-Hughes Act of 1917, consistent with the budget agreement. However, there may be
    an effort made to eliminate this repeal. In light of the $1.2 billion annual appropriation
    under the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act, there is no
    justification for mandatory spending of $7 million per year under Smith-Hughes. We urge
    the Committee to include a provision that is consistent with the budget agreement and
    achieves the required $29 million in savings.

           MEWAs and Association Health Plans -- We share the goal of expanding health
    insurance coverage for employees and their families. However, as discussed at greater
    length in a separate letter on the free-standing bill, we cannot support the inclusion in
    reconciliation of a proposal that would allow business members of multiple employer
    welfare associations (MEWAs) to form "association health plans," as provided for in
    H.R. 1515, the Expansion of Portability and Health Insurance Coverage Act of 1997.
    The Bipartisan Budget Agreement reflects a carefully balanced negotiation, and this
    provision was not part of the agreement. More important, we believe that the
    provision as currently drafted has inadequate consumer protections and has the
    potential to result in premium increases for small businesses and employees who may
    bear the burden of adverse selection.

    We believe that a great deal more work is needed before the provision is ready for
    consideration. Because we share a number of common goals, including a desire to
    promote small group purchasing in the small employer marketplace, we look forward
    to achieving mutually held objectives outside of the budget reconciliation process.

           The budget agreement reflects compromise on many important and
    controversial issues, and challenges the leaders on both sides of the aisle to achieve
    consensus under difficult circumstances. We must do so on a bipartisan basis.



                                                   3

     I look fonvard to working with you to implement the historic budget agreement.

                                       Sincerely,




                                       Franklin D. Raines
