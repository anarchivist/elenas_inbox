FYI:

        Mary Bourdette called me earlier this week to tell me HHS is about
to award grants to states to continue or enhance the evaluations of
waivers granted under the Clinton Administration. Apparently HHS
announced in November that $7.5 million would be available for this
purpose; applications were due January 15, and they are now ready to grant
the funds.  I see no news for us in this, but I have some paper if you
want to see it.
