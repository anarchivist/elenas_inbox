Subject:         FYI-Uniform Crime Reports for 1997

On Sunday, November 15 at 9:00 a.m., the FBI and DOJ will release the
Uniform Crime Reports for 1997. This is one of the two major data sources
for crime statistics. When we say that crime has been down for six years
in a row, we are citing this statistic.

According to DOJ, the preliminary reports for 1997, show crime is down for
another year. Violent crime, juvenile crime and crime in major cities is
down as well.
