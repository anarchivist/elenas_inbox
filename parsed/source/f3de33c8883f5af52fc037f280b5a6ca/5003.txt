Mental Health Parity Regulations. On Tuesday, The New York Times inaccurately reported
on the status of the Administration's interpretation of the "1 percent" exemption provision of the .
mental health parity statute. This provision allowsbusinesseslhealth plans to opt out of the
law's requirements if the costs of coming into compliance increase premiums by more than 1
percent. The Times reported that the White House was likely to make a decision to allow
companies to prospectively project that the costs associated with the new law would exceed the
threshold.
[The mental health community strongly opposes anything other than a fully retrospective
analysis, which would ensure that no business could obtain an exemption from the law until after
they had to pay premiums for the first full year of implementation (1998)]. After briefing the
mental health community on three implementation options, some advocates decided that the best
way to kill the options they liked least was to tell the Times' Robert Pear that we were likely to
interpret the law in an unfavorable "prospective" manner. The truth is that the Departments had
not even made a preliminary decision, let alone forwarded one to Sally Katzen's (OlRA) shop at
OMB. The unfortunate consequence of the pUblicity is that the business community, who want
a prospective interpretation, are now more engaged they ever would have been on this issue. It
is likely that the Departments will soon send up the regulation for OMB's review. Our
flexibility in interpreting the law is unclear, but if we have some leeway, we hope to opt for a
more retrospective approach.

Dr. Satcher Reported Out of Committee. On Wednesday, Dr. David Satcher was favorably
reported out of the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee with a 12-5 vote. Most of
the members were effusive in their praise for him and their optimism for his confirmation before
the whole Senate before Congress recesses for the winter. However, a few members, Senator
Coats in particular, made a major push against Dr. Satcher's nomination based on his stated
support for the Administration's position on the partial birth issue. The primary concern, of
course, is that the Republicans may use Dr. Satcher's confirmation vote as yet another vehicle for
their politicization of this issue. While we remain generally optimistic that Dr. Satcher will be
confirmed, we have notified communications and legislative affairs to be prepared for a strong
Administration defense.

Preliminary Quality Commission Report on Consumer Bill of Rights. This week the
Quality Commission released its preliminary recommendations that responded to your request for
them to develop a Consumer Bill of Rights. They recommended consensus recommendations of
every member of this diverse commission (insurers, consumers, providers, etc.)They were
generally well received, although advocates on both sides of the issue thought they went too far
or not far enough. Because of the successful perception of their recommendations, there is an
interest in the White House for holding an event to highlight the final recommendations in
mid-November. At that event we could consider the possibility of your announcing a position
that at least some aspects of the Consumer Bill of Rights should be enforced through Federal
legislation.
