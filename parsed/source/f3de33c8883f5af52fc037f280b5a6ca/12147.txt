         What does everyone think about this.  I thought we had decided this would
         be a better radio address, but do you think we could do an event?

         I think folks want to do this as an event    -- maybe on April 15.   Let's
         talk about it in the am.

         I know that there are other contenders for this week's radio address, but
         DPC would like to push for the topic to be the release of the final
         welfare reform rule.  The rule is currently scheduled to be public on
         Monday, and therefore this would be great to do for the Saturday address.
         HOWEVER, if we do not use this for this week's address, but want to use it
         next week or very soon, we need to know by NOON ON THURSDAY to hold the
         Federal Register from publishing the rule.   If this can not be the radio
         address topic this week, we would like to firm up another date in the near
         term schedule.

        Please let us know as soon as possible, and let me know if you have any
        questions. Thank you.

        If we DO NOT want the TANF rule on display on Friday and published on
        Monday, we MUST tell the Federal Register NO LATER THAN NOON THURSDAY.
        This is a hard deadline.

        If we want to postpone publication, the head of the Federal Register has
        personally committed that we can postpone it to whatever date we prefer.
