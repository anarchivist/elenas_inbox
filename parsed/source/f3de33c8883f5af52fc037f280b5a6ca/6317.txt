TEXT:
Senators Ford, Hollings, Robb and Cleland have just sent a letter to the
VP saying that the President called for "comprehensive, bipartisan
legislation," and that they too want a bipartisan solution. They want the
VP to use tomorrow's event to "detail the steps the Administration is
willing to take, and to enter into direct negotiations with Republican
leaders by a date certain to achieve a bipartisan solution." They end
with another call for the Administration to take "concrete steps to
initiate negotiations as soon as possible."
