Elena,

FYI.  Ben Johnson has asked that we fax talking points on budget increases
(including dollar amounts) for civil rights enforcement to Mary Frances
Berry (Chair of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights) to assist her in
writing an Op-Ed piece for Black newspapers.  I thought I would send the
one-pager + the chart that outlines the budget numbers (FY97 actual; FY 98
enacted and FY 99 proposed) for each of the agencies.  O.k?

Julie
