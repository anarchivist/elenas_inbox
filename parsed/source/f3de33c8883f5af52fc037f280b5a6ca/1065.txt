TEXT:
Good morning,

I got an early morning call from Chris asking me to edit the goals
document a bit (see attached).  He thought that you might want more in the
goals section and he changed the objective about the business community
relations. Not a big deal, but if there is still time to change it , here
it is.

Thanks.

                                                                       Hex-Dump Conversion

GOAL: Health Care. Work toward achieving bipartisan consensus on and enactment of
Medicare, Medicaid, health coverage expansion, and quality reforms. For Medicare, we aim
toward strengthening the Medicare Trust Fund and enacting structural reform that will prepare
for and / or address its long-term financing challenges. For Medicaid, our goal is to constrain
costs while increasing flexibility to enable states to provide more cost-effective and responsive
health benefits. In the area of health coverage expansion, we hope to cover an additional 5
million children and another 2 million adults through our health initiatives. And, for quality, we
seek to find the balance of appropriate standards for quality that does not undermine our ability to
constrain costs.

       Objectives:
              Continue close coordination of policy development and strategy with HHS,
              Treasury, Labor and all relevant divisions within the White House (DPC, NEC,
              OMB, CEA, Legislative Affairs, Intergovernmental Affairs, Public Liaison, and
              Communications).

               Work toward enhancing bipartisan working relationship with the Congress,
               particularly with Members and staffs of the Budget, Finance, Ways and Means
               and Commerce Committees who have primary oversight over health care.

               Develop collaborative working relationships with governors on issues like
               coverage expansions, insurance reform, Medicaid reform in the budget, and 1115
               waivers (usually used for coverage expansion) consistent with our overall health
               care agenda.

               Work with representatives of consumers, providers, insurers / health plans, and
               business and labor as well as academics, health economists and foundations to
               disseminate and validate the President's positions on health care.

               Work toward developing better relationships with the business community to find
               common ground in health care priorities.

               Identify opportunities for executive actions independent of legislation that further
               the President's health care agenda, particularly in relation to the quality and
               coverage initiatives.

               Continue refining and implementing communications strategy to highlight the
               President's accomplishments, educate the public on current proposals, and
               generate support for legislative and nonlegislative initiatives.
