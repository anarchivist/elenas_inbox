     Disregard previous reminder

     This is a reminder that your comments on the Labor testimony on LRM OGG28
     - - LRM OGG28 - - LABOR Report on HR1381 Rewarding Performance in
     Compensation Act were due at one today. If you've already responded,
     please disregard this message.   If you have not, please provide any
     comments to me ASAP.  Due to the fact that this letter carries a veto
     threat, more steps are required in the clearance process, and I must
     therefore move forward as quickly as possible.   If I don't hear from you
     within the hour, I'll have to assume you have no objections to the
     testimony in its current form.
