TEXT:
FYI -- background and follow-up information from last week's immigration
meeting.

On October 9, the Department of Justice's ability to waive the mandatory
detention requirements to IIRIRA (the 1996 Immigration Act) expire.    INS
is seeking a two-year extent ion of the waiver for two reasons:  first, b/c
congress has not appropriated enough money to the INS for them to build
adequate bed-space to accomdate the detention of all criminal and
deportable aliens; second, even if they had the space, they believe that
the mandatory detention of all criminal and deportable aliens (regardless
of their assessment of the likelihood of flight; regardless of how old the
offense it) is bad policy.   The Administration strongly opposed this
provision when it became part of the 1996 Act.

INS has drafted language that would provide for a two year extent ion of
the waiver. At first, INS wanted to send a formal transmittal letter that
said that they want an extension of the waiver b/c: (1) the INS does not
have the bed-space (2) and we need more time to convice the Congress that
there are better ways of achieving their ends.  NOW, they have agreed to
informally transmit the amendment (through Kennedy's staff) and make our
position clear in testimony that was delivered last Friday on the subject.
