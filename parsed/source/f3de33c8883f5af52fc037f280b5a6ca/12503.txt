     TEXT:
     Revised per a discussion with Mike Cohen (who thinks we ought not
     reference the national test directly) :

     I applaud the news of this partnership between states, governorors,
     business, educators and others to help improve middle school math and help
     students reach world class standards.  The Third International Math and
     Science Study (TIMMS) showed us that while the performance of our 4th
     graders ranked near the top , by eighth grade our student are only
     performing at the international average. We must do everything we can to
     help our children master the basics.This effort by Acheive will respond to
     the TIMMS results and help our students to meet world class standards.   I
     welcome this effort by Achieve to improve curriculum, strenghten teacher
     training and provide tools to measure whether kids are meeting world class
     standards.

     Subject:         Statement on governors testing compact


      Statement on Achieve I s announcement that a group of governors and
      corporate leaders
       will create a new 8th grade math test - - and teacher training and lesson
     'materials - - to help U. S. students perform as well as their peers in other.
      countries.   {Note: Education is being careful not to describe the
      assessments as "high-quality", but is framing their comments as
      "supportive of the goal of high-quality curriculum and assessments."}



    I applaud the news of this partnership with the goal of promoting
    high-quality curriculum, instruction and tests to improve student
    performance in math. We must do everything we can to help our children
    master the basics. And in this increasingly interdependent economy, we
    need to provide parents, teachers and stud~nts with common measures of
    student achievement. This step by Achieve reaffirms my long-standing
    belief that states want -- and will take advantage of -- voluntary tests
    that allow them to compare their students' achievement to common rigorous
    standards. I welcome the efforts of Achieve and others ,who are
    undertaking efforts to improve education.
