          "We have to remember that on the things that really count, whether it's cancer research, or saving Social Security, or
educating our children, this country needs to be united. This country needs to be reconciled to one another -- all of us -- across all
the lines that divide us. "
                                                                                  -- President Bill Clinton

AN AGENDA THAT SUPPORTS AND HONORS AMERICA'S FAMILIES,. Yesterday, President Clinton signed a budget bill
that reflects the priorities of our nation and helps ensure that we continue to prosper. The President fought for and won
key agreements on education, the environment, aid to farmers, and full funding for the IMF. In addition, as we close the
books on the first budget surplus in a generation, the budget agreement honors the President's commitment to save the
budget surplus until Social Security is reformed for the 21 st Century, allowing the President and Congress to start making
important decisions on how to ensure the solvency of Social Security for years to come.

AN EDUCATION AGENDA FOR THE 21ST CENTURY. The President fought for legislation that will ensure that our
children receive a first-class education in safe classrooms with well-prepared teachers:

·       Encouraging States To Open More Charter Schools. Today, the President signed legislation keeping us on
        track to 3,000 charter schools by the turn of the century. These schools allow for innovation while demanding
        accountability and can serve as a model of how we can best strengthen our public schools;
·       More High-Quality Teachers With Smaller Classes. The President fought for and won funding to begin hiring
        100,000 new, well-prepared teachers to help reduce class size in grades 1-3 to a national average of 18;
·       Expanding Educational Technology. This year's budget includes a 20 percent increase for educational
        technology to ensure that every child has access to computers, the Internet, high-quality educational software, and
        teachers that can use technology effectively in the classroom.

PROTECTING OUR ENVIRONMENT AND PUBLIC HEALTH. President Clinton won significant new investments to protect
our environment and defeated anti-environmental "riders" that would have rolled back protections already in 'place:

·        Clean, Safe Water For America. A 16 percent increase in funding for the President's Clean Water Action Plan to
         help clean-up the 40 percent of surveyed waterways that are still too polluted for swimming and fishing;
·      . Preserving Precious Lands. Additional funding to acquire dozens of natural and historic sites around the
         country;
·        Leading The Fight Against Global Warming. Increased funding to support research investments that will
         reduce greenhouse gas emissions, oil consumption, and energy costs for consumers and businesses by promoting
         increased energy efficiency and clean energy technology;
·        Defending Our Environment Against Stealth Attacks. The President forced Congress to drop special-interest
         riders that would have: forced overcutting of timber in national forests, blocked common-sense actions to reduce
         greenhouse gas emissions, hindered salmon restoration in the Pacific Northwest, denied municipalities the funds
         they need to undertake clean-up efforts at brownfield sites, and carved the first road ever through designated
         wilderness.

RESPONDING To THE FARM CRISIS AT HOME, MEETING OUR RESPONSIBILITIES ABROAD. The President fought for
additional funding to help America's farmers and the final budget includes a significant increase in total emergency
assistance to farmers and ranchers, including additional funds for crop and economic loss compensation. Although
America's fiscal house is in order, some nations around the world are experiencing economic upheaval, hurting our
exports, farmers, and ranchers. The President fought for and won full funding for the International Monetary Fund, a
critical part of his strategy to help address the global financial crisis and keep our economy strong.

THE NEXT CONGRESS MUST PUT PROGRESS AHEAD OF PARTISANSHIP. On too many issues, Congress' failure to act
has affected our families. President Clinton is calling on the next Congress to work with him to pass: (1) targeted, fully
paid for, tax cuts to build or modernize 5,000 schools; (2) a Patients' Bill of Rights, to extend important medical
protections; (3) legislation to crack down on teen smoking; (4) an increase in the minimum wage; (5) campaign finance
