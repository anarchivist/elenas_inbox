TEXT:
immediate
-do we care how many folks from agencies come to meeting? Usually I guess
we stick to one or two but it seems in this case we may want to make
exception. ie:

- HHS wants to bring four people to today's meeting - they are four folks
who need to be there (Head Start Director, Child Care Bureau Director,
NICHD Director & Ann Rosewater) so your call

-   HUD -   2

-Education - 2

long range - for the 1:30
-how is the agenda? anything to add?
-when do you have time to talk b-4 mtg? I'm waiting on Pauline for a
time. as you know Nicole is busy.
