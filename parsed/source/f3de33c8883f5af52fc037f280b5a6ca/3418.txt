                               GENETIC SCREENING EVENT

                                    DATE:July 14, 1997
                                    TIME:        2:30 pm - 3:40 pm
                                    LOCATION: The East Room
                                    FROM:        Bruce Reed
                                                 Maria Echaveste


I.    PURPOSE:

      (1) To highlight your commitment to enacting bipartisan legislation to prohibit health
      plans from inappropriately using genetic screening information to deny coverage, set
      premiums, or distribute confidential information; (2) To receive a new report from HHS
      on the promise and perils of genetic screening; and (3) To announce that the Republican
      Chair of the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, Senator Jim Jeffords, and
      the Public Health and Safety Subcommittee Chair, Senator and Doctor Bill Frist, have
      indicated their support for passing a bipartisan bill consistent with the goals and
      recommendations of the HHS Report.

II.   BACKGROUND:

      Genetic testing has the potential to identify hidden genetic disorders and spur early
      treatment. Tests for genetic predisposition to certain diseases and conditions -- such as
      Huntington's disease and certain types of breast cancer -- are already available and more
      genetic tests are on the horizon.

      While progress in genetics can help millions of Americans, we know that genetic testing
      can be used by insurance companies and others to discriminate and stigmatize groups of
      people. Genetic information has been used to discriminate against people in the past.
      Studies have shown that 85 percent of Americans are still extremely concerned with the
      possibility that their genetic makeup will be used to discriminate against them or a
      member of their family. Twenty-two percent of people in families where someone has a
      genetic disorder report that they have been discriminated against by an insurance plan.

      Nineteen states have already enacted laws to restrict the use of genetic information in
                                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion
       health insurance and many others have introduced legislation. However, state legislation
       is insufficient to solve this problem for three reasons: (1) private sector employer
       sponsored health plans, which covers half of all Americans, are exempt from state
       insurance laws due to ERISA preemption; (2) current state laws generally focus on
       genetic tests rather than a broader definition of genetic information such as family history,
       medical records, and physical exams; and (3) the variability among state bills will lead to a
       lack of uniformity across the nation as to whether and how genetic information may be
       used by health plans.

       Kassebaum-Kennedy took steps to prohibit genetic discrimination by preventing insurers
       from using genetic information as a "pre-existing condition" and denying or limiting
       coverage in group markets. However, HIPAA falls short in three areas. It does not
       (1) prevent insurers in the individual market from denying coverage on the basis of
       genetic information; (2) assure that premiums settings are in no way based on genetic
       infonnation both in the group and individual market; and (3) prevent insurance
       companies from disclosing genetic information to other insurers, to plan sponsors, and
       other entities regulated by state insurance laws, such as life, disability, and long-term care
       msurers.




III.   PARTICIPANTS:

       The Vice President
       Secretary Shalala
       Congresswoman Louise Slaughter
       Mary Jo Ellis Kahn, breast cancer survivor.
               [Mary Jo's mother was diagnosed with breast cancer. She was the mother of 5
               children and died at the age of 47. Her four daughters knew they were at
               increased risk of breast cancer because of their mother's history. Mary Jo was
               diagnosed with breast cancer at age 39 and her older sister was diagnosed at age
              42. The two younger sisters then decided to both undergo preventive
               mastedomies. This was before the development of the breast cancer gene
               BRCAl was discovered in 1994, however, Mary Jo feels that the option of seeking
               genetic testing before considering the option of preventive mastedomies will only
               be realistic if there is no chance of insurance discrimination.]

       Audience
       The audience consists of Members of Congress and 150 representatives of organizations
       endorsing Congresswoman's Slaughter'S legislation, including breast cancer and consumer
       groups. Members of the working groups of the Human Genome Research Institute and
       the National Action Plan on Breast Cancer will also be in attendance.
                                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion

      - Mary Jo Ellis Kahn and family.
      - Dana Glover, a fellow Arkansan, who at the age of 28 developed third stage breast
          cancer. She had a mastectomy, and it was discovered that she had genetic mutated
      gene. She wrote to the White House several times and received no response, but when
      you saw her letter you asked that she be invited to the White House for an event.
