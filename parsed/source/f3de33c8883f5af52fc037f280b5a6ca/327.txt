TEXT:
A voice mail I just got has alarmed me that we should try to
quickly get out something to the states on interim verification.
Hope I'm not overreacting.
Bruce Goldstein of the Farmworker Justice Fund called.   I think I
had sent you all a letter from him arguing that Social Security's
records would be incomplete for most farm workers.
He says that the state of Illinois is taking the position that
only the Social Security Administration can verify the 40 quarters
count and that no other evidence counts.  The state is blaming
this on the failure of USDA to tell them otherwise.
I know we are a long way from resolving this issue, but:
Couldn't we quickly draft something to states saying that there
are many questions we must answer on verification, but that in the
interim they can use their judgment or choose from a variety of
options to verify eligibility? This would include considering the
use of things like attestations by the client, and the other types
of things that SSA has said they are already using· (knowledgeable
people swearing that the person was working) .
Perhaps doing this would be just as hard as giving definitive
guidance; and perhaps it would sow confusion and risk making us
look like we don't have our act together.
But our silence may allow states to blame us.
I think we should meet on this tomorrow.
