TEXT:
Just received a call from AFL-CIO.   They may like us to do some more
patients' bill of rights events with them. Jerry Shea suggested that we
do an out-of-town event or two.  I told him I thought we would need to
have an angle that had a chance of receiving some coverage.   He said he
would start to think creatively and get back to us.   He did say, however,
that we have to remember that, outside the beltway, this issue seems to
continue to be the only issue that sells.   I don't know, perhaps that is
worth considering. Up to you ...   (As you know, I write this in hopes that
I can get to do yet another patients' bill of rights event to help us
prove that it was us who really, really cared about this issue -- and not
those evil Republicans) .
