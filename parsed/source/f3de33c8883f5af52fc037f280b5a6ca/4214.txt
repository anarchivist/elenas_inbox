Subject:         Re: New lookback scenerios

Here are the new scenarios you asked for.  All the scenarios assume that
the BBA excise tax credit is repealed.  For each of the three teen
surcharge variants, I have run one version where teen consumption responds
only to the deal's price increases, and a second version where the deal's
nonprice provisions cause a 30% reduction in teen smoking on top of the
price effect.

Note that with tier 1 of the surcharge specified as nondeductible, there
is now an increase in corporate income taxes in all the scenarios. The
assumption is that in addition to passing through the surcharge, the
companies tack on a further price increase that allows them to pay taxes
on the surcharge payments and preserve the same profits as they would
otherwise have booked.

I have not done any modeling of the "brand by brand" concept for the
surcharge. Without more data on differential marketing to teens across
firms, I have no way to model this right now.

Because the excise tax increases in tier 2 of the youth surcharge are
buried in the spreadsheet files, I'm showing them in the table below.
With a 30% nonprice effect, tier 2 of the surcharge doesn't kick in until
year 10. Otherwise, you get fairly hefty excise taxes starting in year 5.

                                                 Year 5    Year 7   Year 10

Noncumulative excise tax above 5/10/15
       Price effects only                         21       31       35
       30% nonprice effect                             o        o
5



Cumulative excise tax above 5/10/15
        Price effects only                       21       52       83
        30% nonprice effect                           o        o
5

Noncumulative excise tax above 10/10/10
       Price effects only                        16       32       40
       30% nonprice effect                            o        o   10

Here are the files for the noncumulative excise tax above 5/10/15
percentage points.  The first file (tobac13.wk4) is price effects only;
the second file (tobac13n.wk4) has the 30% nonprice effect.



Here are the files for the cumulative excise tax above 5/10/15 percentage
points.



Here are the files for the noncumulative excise tax above 10/10/10
percentage points.
