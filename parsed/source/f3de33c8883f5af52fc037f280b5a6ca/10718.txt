TEXT:
There will be a trip meeting this afternoon regarding the President, Vice
President, and First Lady's travel to Buffalo, NY and Montgomery County,
PA the day after the State of the Union.  The scheduling desk for the trip
called me to inquire about potential messages for the events at these
stops. Do we have specific recommendations I can talk about at the
meeting today for what policies we would like to have highlighted at these
events?
