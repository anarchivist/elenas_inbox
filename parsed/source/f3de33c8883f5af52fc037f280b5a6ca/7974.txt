TALKING POINTS ON AIDS
June 4, 1998

Q:                Is it true that President Clinton has lied to and betrayed people with
AIDS?

A:      The President continues to make the fight against HIV/AIDS a top
priority. Since he .took office:

funding for care and treatment for people living with HIV/AIDS has more
than tripled and funding for research has increased by 50%    .

drug assistance programs that provide promising new therapies to people
with HIV/AIDS have increased by more than 450%

a new vaccine research center is being built at the National Institutes of
Health to focus on the PresidentD,s goal of finding·an AIDS vaccine within
10 years

drug approval at the Food and Drug Administration has been accelerated to
record times


Q:      Is it true that the The PresidentD,s own Advisory Council on HIV!AIDS
is prepared to resign as a result of his decision not to fund needle
exchange programs?

A:       While some members of the Council have expressed frustration from time
.to time, we are        not aware of any plans for resignations.   On the
contrary, the Council members realize that       their participation


gives them a unique opportunity to develop policies that best meet the
        needs of people living with AIDS.


Q:      What is your reaction to the criticisms of the AdministrationD,s
position on needle exchange?

A:      The Administration is committed to reducing the transmission of HIV and
reducing drug use. We believe that the recent· decision was the best way
to advance these two goals.  The Secretary of Health and Human Services
made clear that appropriate needle excahnge programs can cut HIV
transmission without increasing illegal drug use. At the same time, the
Administration tried to prevent the politicization of needle exchange by
keeping decision making at the local level. We understand that this
decision raises strong feelings on both sides, but we think that HHSD,s
release of the scientific findings relating to needle exchange was
critically important.
