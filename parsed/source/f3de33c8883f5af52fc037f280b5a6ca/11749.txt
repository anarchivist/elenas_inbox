                       Food Council Releases Report

                       By Janelle Carter
                       AP Farm Writer
                       Tuesday, March 16, 1999; 5:05 a.m. EST

                       WASHINGTON (AP)   -- A White House food safety task force
will
                  continue to study structural changes to "strengthen the
federal food safety
                  system"  but stopped short of endorsing a recommendation
for a single
                  food safety chief.

                       The President's council on Food Safety, in a report
released Monday,
                  made clear that establishing a single voice on food
safety issues posed
                  challenges in some areas.

                       "Foodborne disease problems may also be waterborne
disease
                       problems, "   said the council, which is made up of
officials from the
                       departments of Agriculture, Commerce and Health and
Human Services.
                       "Other programs, particularly research and education
programs for food
                  safety, often do not operate as separate activities
within the agencies but
                  rather draw on the strength from one another."

                  The National Academy of Sciences in August issued a
report, saying that
                  "Congress should establish a unified, central framework
for managing
                  food safety programs, headed by one official with
control of resources for
                  all federal food safety activities."

                  President Clinton created the council to review the
report's findings and


                       develop a national strategy.

                  The NAS report gave examples such as a food safety
council with a chair
                  appointed by the president with control of all
resources; a lead agency for                      .
                  food safety and an independent food safety agency at c
abinet level.

                       Critics, including some lawmakers and consumer groups,
have complained
                       about the current fragmented system of 12 agencies with
various food
                       safety issues.

                       Most food safety responsibilities are handled by the
Agriculture
                       Department, which is in charge of meat and poultry and
certain fresh
                       produce issues, and the Food and Drug Administration,
which oversees
                  other foods. But agencies like the Environmental
Protection Agency and
                  Commerce Department also have a role.

                  The council said development of a national strategy to
address food safety
                  is already underway.

                  --The council is confident that its comprehensive
strategic plan will be a
                  major step toward creating a seamless food safety
system, " the report
                  said.

                       While U.S. food is considered the world's safest, up to
9,000 Americans
                       die every year from food poisoning, and millions are
sickened.
