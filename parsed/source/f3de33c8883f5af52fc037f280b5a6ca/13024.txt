TEXT:
NEC/Brian Kennedy and ED staff approached us about re-starting the regular
education meetings we used to have with larger group of staff from ED,
OMB, NEC and DPC to discuss some of the on-going issues that aren't part
of your wekly strategy meeting -- and to generally keep up to date on
department activities.   We are planning to meet this afternoon and will
send you a summary of any noteworthy discussions.
