Sarah,
Is this OK as a response to the many letters regarding children's health
insurance? Let me know if you have any changes.   Thanks.

Thank you for your letter regarding health insurance for uninsured
children.

As you know, the balanced budget I signed on August 6, 1997, included
the largest investment in health care for children since the passage
of Medicaid in 1965. An unprecedented $24 billion will go toward
children's health care, guaranteeing meaningful health coverage for as
many as five million uninsured children.

As we work to create a healthier nation for our children, I appreciate
your support and I hope you will remain involved.
