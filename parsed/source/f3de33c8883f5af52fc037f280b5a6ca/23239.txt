MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY
                 THE ATTORNEY GENERAL

SUBJECT:                      Deterring and Reducing Gun Crime


Since the start of our Administration, we have developed and implemented a number of effective
national strategies to reduce crime: we have provided funds to over 11,000 communities to hire
and redeploy more than 92,000 local law enforcement officers; we have prevented more than a
quarter of a million illegal handgun sales through Brady background checks; and we have
developed a coordinated attack on the illegal sources of guns used in crime. Additionally,
through the leadership and dedicated efforts of state and local police and prosecutors, mayors,
U.S. Attorneys, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF), and community leaders,
dozens of other smart, tough, crime-fighting strategies have been put in place throughout the
country.

During this period, the nation's crime rate has dropped by more than 20 percent, and crime
committed with guns has dropped 27 percent. In certain communities, where federal, state, and
local law enforcement have worked with other community leaders, violent crime rates have gone
down even more dramatically. In Boston, Massachusetts, for example, when law enforcement
and community leaders worked together to reduce violence by youth gangs, they reduced the
number of homicides among youth by 70 percent in just two years. In Minneapolis, Minnesota,
effective law enforcement and prevention efforts conducted by public-private partnerships have
reduced homicides by 30 percent and summertime homicides by 75 percent. And in Richmond,
Virginia, effective and coordinated law enforcement, including stepped up enforcement of gun
crimes through the program known as Project Exile, has reduced the homicide rate significantly.

Still, the number of people killed with firearms remains unacceptably high: more than 14,000
people were murdered with guns in our nation in 1997 .. We must redouble our efforts to deter
and further reduce gun crime -- and work to make every neighborhood and community free of
serious gun violence.

I therefore request that you develop an integrated firearms violence reduction strategy that draws
on the proven measures and innovative approaches that are working in communities throughout
the country. We know that gun violence issues in each community differ, and that no single
program or strategy will be right for every community. Therefore in developing the strategy you
should consult closely with U.S. Attorneys and ATF Special Agents in Charge, as well as state
and local law enforcement, elected officials, and other leaders. It should consider the special
needs oflocal communities and strike an appropriate balance between federal and state law
enforcement. I ask that the strategy specifically include elements to:

       (1) Increase intensive investigation and prosecution of significant firearms violations,
                                      Hex-Dump Conversion

       including illegal possession, use, and trafficking of guns, through innovative programs
       such as Project Exile;

       (2) Expand comprehensive crime gun tracing, analysis and mapping; increase use of
       ballistics identification technology; and coordinate use of crime gun information to
       identify illegal gun markets, gun "hot spots," and illegal gun traffickers;

       (3) Strengthen coordinated law enforcement and regulatory enforcement efforts to ensure
       compliance with all applicable laws by federally-licensed gun dealers and prospective gun
       purchasers;

       (4) Implement targeted deterrence of violent offenders through improved coordination
       with probation and parole officials supervising such offenders and swift and certain
       punishment for those found to have violated the conditions of their parole or probation;
       and

       (5) Promote problem-solving analysis and innovative strategies, such as the Boston Gun
       Project, to work closely with community members to identify gun criminals, remove
       weapons in the hands of juveniles, search for and seize crime guns, and increase the
       public's knowledge of their community's gun-related crime and violence problem.

Finally, I ask that you make recommendations on how best to allocate federal resources to
support the goals of the strategy you develop. I further ask that you provide me with your first
report on this integrated firearms violence reduction strategy within 90 days.
