TEXT:
The front page New York Times story today ("Teachers Who Fail to Teach")
addresses an issue about which there is vast consensus of Americans, and
some important symbolic movement by the unions. By 90-10 Americans
believe there should make higher standards for poor teachers.  Should we
put together a small group to write up options for the President to speak
out on this topic, extending the generic support he has already given for
the concept?
