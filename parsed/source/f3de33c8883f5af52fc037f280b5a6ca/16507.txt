TEXT:
Here is the list of DPC scheduling requests that could come up at today's
meeting:

Tobacco E.O. - the date now has to move again blc the budget signing is
now on 8/5.  Shalala is not available on 8/7 which was the next obvious
date, so this will have to get worked out at this meeting.  Shalala does
not know it's been cancelled yet.

Tobacco Meeting w/ POTUS - 8/4-8/8

Tobacco Announcement - post vacation

Diabetes Event - pending for 9/8.    This is the time to raise the political
concerns Chris has.

1st Back to School Event on Higher Education - Scheduled as a Radio
Address on 8/16.
        *If you want to push this for an event, Mike has suggested a round
table at a middle school on preparing students for college.  Middle school
and High School students and parents, teachers, college guidance
counsellors, College Admissions reps, and financial aid reps could
participate.  POTUS could focus on the tax credits in the budget and the
DOE booklet for parents which talks about taking tough classes and setting
high standards, as well as financial planning.
