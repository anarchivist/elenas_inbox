TEXT:
Lyn and I had discussed the idea of releasing a "Clinton Administration
Accomplishments for Children" or "Children's Inititatives in the
President's Budget" to reporters before the Children's Defense Fund meets
in D.C. this week to help spawn positive media coverage.  The annual
conference theme is "Standing Strong Together for Children: Leave No Child
Behind" and they are meeting at the Jefferson Hotel.  If you like the
general idea, we should get on it righ away to release it either Tuesday
or Wednesday.
