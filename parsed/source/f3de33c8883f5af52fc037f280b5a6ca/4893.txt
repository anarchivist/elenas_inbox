TEXT:
I received a call from GSA.  They are testifying this Thursday afternoon
before a subcommittee of House Transportation on the EO on workplace
smoking. They called to run a Q&A by me.    The Cmte asked: who
coordinated development of the EO with the unions.   GSA's proposed answer
is: DPC. Any reaction?

Also, are any of you reviewing GSA's testimony? GSA told me OMB has it.
I haven't received it. Should I get a copy and review it, or would one of
you like to do it?
