TEXT:
As I am sure you know, the Treas-Postal appropriators dropped the FEHBP
contraceptive coverage provision from the bill. The pro-choice groups are
pleading that we insist on reinserting the language in the omnibus bill.
(FYI. )

On the Title X front -- Just in case you don't know, the Rules committee
is meeting later today and is likely to approve a rule that will allow
Labor H to go to the House floor just for a vote on parental consent (the
CATs are insisting on it, even though their language is already in the
bill). Greenwood will offer his substitute amendment (emphasizing
abstinence and encouraging parental involvement in teens' decisions re
family planning), but then Istook will offer his second degree amendment
which adds back in his parental consent language.  The groups are begging
us to insist that this language be dropped in omnibus negotiations as
well.
