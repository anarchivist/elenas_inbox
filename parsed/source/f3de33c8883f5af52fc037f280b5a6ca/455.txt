TEXT:
Dorothy will be calling people's offices to set up a meeting late
Friday (or maybe early Monday) for us to discuss the technical
corrections package for welfare reform.  Dorothy will be
circulating an updated package to you today, that we got at a
meeting with Tarplin and an assortment of agencies.
The goal of the meeting is to just quickly highlight among
ourselves what issues are embedded in the package. OMB has many,
many concerns, especially in trying to coordinate this thing, but
this meeting would be more to focus on any genuine policy issues.
Jeremy and I will take a shot at highlighting them at the meeting
in case you don't get time to look at the package, but we can't
promise we won't miss something.
HHS wants this to go to the Hill Fri. the 22nd, so they want to
wrap this up on Wednesday.
Tarplin wants to consult w/Hill staff in advance on a few delicate


items, to make sure we don't walk into anything unexpected, but
Keith asked that they hold up on that until OMB has had more time
to look at it.  So we need to get back to them.
For those who care, the Medicaid bucket issue is embedded in here.
So if we include it, we are giving up on our other avenue.  So
that has to get settled.
