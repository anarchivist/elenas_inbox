TEXT:
With respect to your April 10 memo to the President on free time/PIAC,
last week I discussed with Jim Kohlenberger Phil's and my wish to include
with the memo a draft of the VP letter to which the memo refers.   Jim has
told me that such a letter is being drafted; I am holding the memo until
we receive the letter.  While we'd prefer·to send the memo with a draft
letter attached, please let me know if further delay will cause a problem
(Jim mentioned Sen. Leiberman's forthcoming bill as a driving factor).
Thanks.

'- -David
