TEXT:
Primarily because of timing, and also because of the length of Gene's
memo, I'm sending your and Gene's memo separately packaged up with Edley's
original memo with a very short note from me.

P will see Edley today on the way to NY and I think he'll be more inclined
to look at it quickly that way.

If I had gotten everything earlier in the week, I think I would have made
everything one memo.

So you win ... sort of. ;)
(it's very hip to, use these little symbols, you know.)
