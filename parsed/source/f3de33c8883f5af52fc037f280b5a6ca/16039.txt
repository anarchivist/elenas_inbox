Draft Statement -- RFRA Case --       Boerne v. Flores


         Today the United States Supreme Court held that state and local governments are not
bound by the protections of religious liberty afforded by the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.
This Administration sought passage of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) to ensure
that religious liberty could not be restricted by federal, state, and local governments without
compelling reason. While we are disappointed with the Court's conclusion that RFRA does not
apply to state and local governments, we are gratified that RFRA will continue to prevent
federal agencies, entities, and institutions from unduly burdening religious exercise.


        Religious freedom is central to the American system ofliberty. In the First Amendment
of the United States Constitution, our nation's founders erected the twin pillars of this freedom,
guaranteeing the free exercise of religion and prohibiting the establishment of religion by the
state. Throughout our history, men and women have come to this nation to secure this precious
liberty. We have built a nation in which religious practices and institutions have thrived because
each individual has been able to choose for himself or herself whether and how to worship.

         In the four years I have served as President, nothing has given me greater joy than the
efforts of this Administration to support freedom of religion. We have worked in tandem with
an unprecedented coalition of people with diverse backgrounds and beliefs in support of religious
liberty. Our work with this coalition led not only to the passage ofRFRA, but also to the issuance
of guidance to public school districts on the extent of permissible prayer and other speech of
religious character.     We will continue to work to protect religious liberty to the fullest extent
the Constitution allows.
