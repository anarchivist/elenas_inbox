TEXT:
Here are a couple things that should -be added to our list:
1. Agriculture.   A new crop insurance program. The President called for
this in radio press conference and it will cost about $1-$1.5 billion.
This will be a very big deal in rural areas and USDA will make it their
top priority.

2.   Alcohol and Binge Drinking. The Safe and Drugfree Schools program
has requested about $8 million for best practices and a study on alcohol
use on college campuses. We are still working with them to get more
details, and to see if we could add on to this.
