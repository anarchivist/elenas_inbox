TEXT:
There will be a White House staff picnic. Saturday June 20 from 12 to 4.
All staff are invited to atend with a guest.  The Social Office does not
need clearance information and the guests will not need to be cleared
through WAVES for this event.  Staff will be required to accompany their
guest.  Please e-mail me the name of your guest by COB tomorrow so that I
can submit a list to the Social Office.



I sent the invitations to
Donna Geisbert
Essence Washington
Todd Summers, and
Michael O'Mary
so expect to recieve the invitation from one of these people if you do not
already have it.

Call me with questions.
