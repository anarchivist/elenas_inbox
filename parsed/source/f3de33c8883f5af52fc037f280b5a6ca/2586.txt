TEXT:
BR/EK:

Delirious and tired from working late last night, Leanne and I had a great
idea for some "20% policy" on race.    How about the Omnibus Race Initiative
and Technical Amendments Act? The bill would include three key
components: (1) dramatically rolling back sentences on crack cocaine; (2)
putting 100,000 cops and federal law enforcement officers in Indian
Country; and (3) granting amnesty to several hundred thousand Central
Americans facing deportation. While the Omnibus Initiative would have no
real political support, the "elites" would love it -- and we'd be sure to
get some great editorials on the East and West Coast.    Perhaps we could
get the VP to do an event ... maybe in St. Louis?

See ya tomorrow, we're tired ...
