TEXT:
Vaccination Levels for Minority Children Reach an All Time High. This
week HHS announced that vaccination levels for minority children have
reached record highs and have met or exceeded the 1996 national
immunization goals. vaccination levels are now nearly the same for
preschool children of all racial and ethnic groups, narrowing a gap that
was estimated to be as wide as 26 percentage points a generation ago.
These new rates provide evidence that adequate resources and focused
initiatives, such as your 1993 Childhood Immunization Initiative, can help
reduce some of the existing health disparities among racial and ethnic
groups.
