TEXT:
Looks like HHS is going to give you a call regarding the Justice antitrust
letter (specifically regarding the paragraph that we talked about earlier) .

Either Jim O'Hara (Dep. Asst. Sec. for Health). Andy Heiman (Special Asst.
to the GC). or Harriet Rabb (GC) will give you a call to discuss the
paragraph.

Keep me posted and I will get a copy of the redrafted letter to you as
soon as Justice sends it over.
