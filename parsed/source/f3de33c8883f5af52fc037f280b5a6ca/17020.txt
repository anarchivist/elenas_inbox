TEXT:
As we discussed, here are the three "reports" that I would expect on
Monday:

(1)   DPC -- improvement of FDA inspections, more funding, etc.

(2)  John Windski -- USDA (690-4653) -- Agriculture's possible
contributions   (including country of origin labeling).  John also
has information from FDA.

(3)  Peter Sher -- USTR (395-9636) -- Language for fast-track bill that
would toughen negotiating instructions and add as an objective to raise
standards in other countries.

I've spoken to both John and Peter to expect a call from you.

Just let me know when on Monday.

Thanks,
V.
