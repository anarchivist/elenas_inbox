TEXT:
Marion Burros at the New York Times -- 862-0347 -- is doing a story on the
food safety appropriations and whether the administration will fight for
this money.  She wants a defense of the Adminstration policy, including
our request to impose user fees which has been a non-starter in Congress.
She'd like to talk to someone by tomorrow.  She's especially interested in
talking to the VP -- I'll tell Morely.                           .
