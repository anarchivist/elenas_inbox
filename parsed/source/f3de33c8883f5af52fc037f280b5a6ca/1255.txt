TEXT:
Didn't the President make this point in his speech to the Maryland
legislature --among many other points ,to be sure. I think this is much
on his mind when he says he wants to talk to legislatures about education
and welfare. But given that the emphasis and news from such appearances
will always be eduation, do you think this should be done as a stand
alone piece ?
