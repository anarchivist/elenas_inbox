    Dear Chairman Kennard and Commissioners:

            Last night in the State of the Union Address I called upon the Federal Communications
    Commission (FCC) to act to require media outlets to provide candidates with free and discounted
    airtime for campaign advertising. Free and discounted time will reduce the need for more
    campaign money, and will allow candidates to spend less time fundraising and more time
    addressing the concerns of our country.

            Spending in congressional campaigns has risen sixfold in the last two decades, more than
    three times the rate of inflation, and spending on television is the primary reason. In 1972,
    candidates spent $25 million for political ads; in 1996, they spent $400 million. The evidence at
    the beginning of this election year is that the cost of media spending by candidates for public office
    will continue to spiral upwards. The time has come to free our democracy from the grip of big
    money.

            The dawning of the digital age of broadcasting makes now the right time to update
    broadcasters' public interest obligation. Broadcasters have been loaned an additional channel
    worth tens of billions of dollars for free. The FCC must ensure that broadcasters, given the
    opportunity to benefit from their use of a valuable public resource, use this public resource to
    strengthen our democracy.

            Free and discounted television time can make our most powerfully effective medium a
    powerful force for expanding democracy in the information age. I call upon the Commission to
    develop policies, as soon as possible, which ensure that broadcasters provide free and discounted
    airtime for candidates to educate voters.

                                                  Sincerely,



                                                  William Jefferson Clinton
