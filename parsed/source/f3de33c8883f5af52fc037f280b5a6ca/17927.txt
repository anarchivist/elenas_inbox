PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
RADIO ADDRESS ON AMERICORPS REAUTHORIZATION
November 28, 1997

         Good morning.  This week, millions of Americans have gathered with
 family and friends to share in our traditional feast of Thanksgiving.
'Much has changed for America since George Washington first proclaimed a
 day of Thanksgiving for our new nation in 1789, but the Thanksgiving
 spirit -- sharing our good fortune with others, and coming together to
 meet our common challenges -- is as strong as ever.  Today, I want to talk


about what we must do to keep that spirit alive throughout the year,
through citizen service.

         Service is at the heart of what it means to be American, and it
must be at the heart of our efforts to prepare America for the 21st
Century.   It reflects our fundamental belief that everyone who works for
it deserves an equal opportunity to succeed in life -- but that each of us
must do our part -- in government, in business, in our communities, our
schools, and our houses of worship -- to create the conditions that make
that success possible.

        Of all the things we have done to meet that challenge, I am
proudest of AmeriCorps, our national service program that has already
helped more than 70,000 young Americans earn money for college by serving
our country.  In community after community, AmeriCorps members have proved
that service can help us meet our most pressing social needs.  In Simpson
County, Kentucky, AmeriCorps members helped second graders jump three
grade levels in reading.  In Kansas City, AmeriCorps members started
after-school programs for at-risk youths that local police say have helped
turn around troubled neighborhoods. And in communities beset by floods,
tornadoes and hurricanes, AmeriCorps members have helped to rebuild homes
and restore hope.

        National service should bring people together -- and after years
of partisan division, I am pleased that Congress seems ready to give its
full support to AmeriCorps. Today, I am proposing legislation that will
strengthen all of our national service programs, including AmeriCorps, and
extend them for five more years. And I hope and expect that this year,
Congress will give AmeriCorps the bipartisan support it deserves, and give
more Americans the chance to serve.

        This legislation reflects the spirit of the Presidento,s Summit on
Service, where thousands of Americans pledged to give our children the
support they need to make the most of their lives. We have made a lot of
progress since the summit, with more AmeriCorps scholarships, more reading
tutors for our children through our America Reads program, more mentoring
programs for young people at our federal agencies, and more partnerships
with private business and community groups.  And at Thanksgiving, I am
especially proud of our efforts to encourage citizens and businesses to
ensure that our nationo,s surplus food helps to feed the hungry, not to
fill up dumpsters.

        This Thanksgiving weekend, many Americans are giving thanks for
the yearo,s blessings by giving something back to their communities.   But
we must create more opportunities for people to serve.   In honor of Martin
Luther King Jr.o,s great commitment to service, Congress has designated
Martin Luther King Day in January 19th as a day of service -- a day to
come together across all the lines that divide us to strengthen our
communities. And I am pleased to announce that the Corporation for
National Service has awarded $225,000 million dollars in community grants
to help make this day of· service a reality.

        Dr. King once said that o&anyone can be great, because anyone can
serve.  You only need a heart full of grace, and a soul generated by
love.oB   As we look forward to a joyous holiday season, let us pledge to
live up to his words by making service a part of our lives every day.
Thanks for listening.
