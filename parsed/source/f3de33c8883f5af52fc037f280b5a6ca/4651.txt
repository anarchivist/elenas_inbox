 Michelle, et. al.:

 Per Rahm's request this morning.  Maybe too long -- and perhaps the
 closing line is too much.  But let me know what you think.

 Page me if I'm not at my desk.

                                   STATEMENT OF THE PRESIDENT

            Today, the Federal Bureau of Investigation released its final crime statistics
     for 1996, and the results should be good news for all Americans. Overall crime
     is down for the fifth year in a row, with the biggest reductions coming in violent
     crime (7%) -- and especially murders (9%).               '

             But the best news is not in the numbers, but in the fact that communities
     across the country are making steady gains -- in almost every category -- in the
     fight against crime. Both the number and the rate of crimes are at their lowest
     levels in a decade. And reported rapes, robberies, assaults, murders and all
     types of property crimes are down from the previous year.         Even the arrest rate
     for juveniles, which has skyrocketed since the mid 1980s, has now gone down for
     two years in a row.

             Since being elected President, my Administration has worked with Police,
     Prosecutors, Mayors and other community leaders on a tough, smart crime
     strategy to drive down the crime rates. Together, we have fought for more
     police in our communities, fewer guns on our streets, tougher punishment for
     violent offenders and better opportunities for our kids. Today's crime statistics
     show that, armed with these tools, we are moving in the right direction. Law
     abiding Americans are finally -- and decisively -- tipping the scales of justice in
     their favor.
