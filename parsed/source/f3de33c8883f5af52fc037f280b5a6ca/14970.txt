TEXT:
When are you planning the deputies meeting? Thursday would be a good day;
Friday is Good Friday, and I'll be out; Commerce's deputy on this issue is
in China with the Vice President through Wed.  I would be eager to do it
soon if there is a plan to try to release it around the 17th so that we
can avoid a crunch. Thanks.
