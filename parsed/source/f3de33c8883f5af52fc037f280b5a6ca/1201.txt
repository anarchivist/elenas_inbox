TEXT:
There will be a trip meeting to go over the North Carolina and Florida
trips today at 3pm.  I will go, and I will let you all know what takes
place.  I don't think it's going to be very detailed today, and the
subject of the radio address will definitely not come up.  Don is going to
have a meeting on this trip on Monday.  Right now they are scheduling an
education clutch before the speech to State Legislators in N.C., and a
school construction event in FL.
