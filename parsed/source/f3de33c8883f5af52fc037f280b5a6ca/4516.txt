IMMIGRATION

U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform -- On Tuesday, September 30, the
U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform will release its final report to
Congress. The report reiterates many of the recommendations made in
interim reports during the Commission's six-year tenure. The final report
contains two new recommendations: first, a proposal to restructure the
Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS); and second, an
"Americanization" proposal to help new immigrants integrate and
participate in our national community. The DPC has already begun a
process to review the Commission's proposal on restructuring the INS.
DPC staff will work with the staff of the Race Commission to review the
"Americanization" proposal.

CRIME

FBI Crime Statistics -- The final 1996 Uniform Crime Report will be
released next Saturday by the FBI. The final figures confirm preliminary
data released earlier this year-- that serious crime dropped three percent
in 1996, the fifth annual decrease in a row. Violent crime declined seven
percent, with murder showing the greatest decline at 11 percent.
