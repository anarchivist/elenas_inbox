TEXT:
Below is the House Committee letter on the Transportation Appropriations
bill. Markup is tomorrow morning (7/22); therefore, we aim to send the
s~gned letter to the Hill this evening.  please provide comments/clearance
no later than 6pm today. Thanks.

The Honorable Robert Livingston
Chairman
Committee on Appropriations
U.S. House of Representatives
Washington, D.C.  20515

Dear Mr. Chairman:

        The purpose of this letter is to provide the AdministrationD,s
views on the Department of Transportation and Related Agencies
Appropriations Bill, FY 1999, as reported by the House Subcommittee. As
the Committee develops its version of the bill, your consideration of the
AdministrationD,s views would be appreciated.

        The Administration understands the budget constraints faced by the
Subcommittee, but is concerned that the Subcommittee bill could seriously
compromise ~he Coast GuardD,s and the Federal Aviation AdministrationD,s
(FAAD,s) operations and modernization projects, compromise highway safety,
and harm other important programs. The Committee could accommodate the
funding increases recommended below by adhering more closely to the
PresidentD,s request for the Airport Grants program, High Speed Rail,
Coast Guard Alteration of Bridges, and other programs. The Administration
is pleased that the Subcommittee has not included language limiting the
use of project labor agreements.  However, the bill does include a number
of objectionable language provisions. The AdministrationD,s concerns are
discussed below.

Essential Operations

        The Administration strongly urges the Committee to fully fund the
request for Coast Guard and FAA operations. We ask that the Committee
restore the $72 million reduction to Coast Guard Operating Expenses and to
eliminate the SubcommitteeD,s direction to reallocate funds among
programs. The Subcommittee mark would force the Coast Guard to lay up
certain cutters and aircraft and decommission one of the NationD,s three
polar icebreakers, which would, among other effects, compromise the
integrity of our Exclusive Economic Zone and leave critically depleted
fish stocks under-protected.

        Likewise, we ask the Committee to restore the $56 million
reduction to FAA Operations. These funds are necessary to ensure that the
FAA can hire the safety inspectors and security personnel needed to meet
the demands from increased air travel.

Coast Guard and FAA Modernization

        The Administration urges the Committee to fully fund the request
for Coast Guard and FAA modernization to ensure that the infrastructure
necessary to fulfill their missions in the future is available. The
Administration urges the Committee to restore the $54 million reduction to
the request for Coast Guard capital replacement funding.   This funding is
necessary to complete projects that will reduce the Coast GuardD,s future


operating costs, improve mission performance, and provide adequate
facilities and housing for Coast Guard personnel. We are particularly
concerned about large cuts to the seagoing buoy tender replacement, the
Deepwater Capability Replacement Analysis, and family housing.  These cuts
ultimately would adversely impact all Coast Guard activities, including
drug law enforcement.  In addition, we urge the Committee to fully fund
the PresidentD,s request for the Nationwide Differential Global
positioning System and for adding a second civil signal to the Global
Positioning System.

        The Administration urges the Committee to provide an additional
$130 million for.the FAA Facilities and Equipment account.  Funding at any
lower level could delay National Airspace System Modernization.   In
particular, full funding is required for the Host Computer replacement and
other Year 2000 conversion activities. The Administration objects to the
elimination of funding for the Flight 2000 program. This program is a key
element of the FAAO,s plans to make a transition to a more efficient, user
involved, satellite-based air traffic control system to meet the air
traffic needs of the next century.

Amtrak

        The Administration commends the Subcommittee for funding Amtrak at
$609 million, just $12 million below the PresidentD,s Request. We urge
the Committee to allow Amtrak to invest these capital funds flexibly, as
provided in the Senate bill and as presently done by Federal Transit
Administration grantees.  In addition, the requirement that the House and
Senate Appropriations Committees approve a Capital plan for Amtrak
constitutes a legislative veto. The Administration will interpret this
provision to require notification only, since any other interpretation
would contradict the Supreme Court ruling in INS vs. Chadha.

National Highway Traffic Safety Administration

        To protect the safety of automobile travelers adequately, the
Administration asks that the Committee work with the authorizing
committees and provide an additional $12 million for high-priority
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration programs. These vehicle
safety and consumer information activities are essential to provide
consumers with up-to-date safety information, to conduct critical research
on advanced air bag systems and the biomechanics of injury, and to develop
improved crash test dummies.

Access-to-Jobs

        The Administration requests that the Committee provide an
additional $50 million to fully fund the PresidentD,s request of $100
million for the Access-to-Jobs program. This program is a critical
component of the AdministrationD,s welfare reform effort. The additional
resources are essential to helping more individuals in communities around
the country make a successful transition from welfare to work.

Office of the Secretary

        The Administration urges the Committee to provide the PresidentD,s
requested $62 million for the Office of the Secretary and to delete the
SubcommitteeD,s recommended new account structure and limitation on
political appointees. These adjustments to the Subcommittee bill are
necessary to avoid a reduction-in-force and to allow the Secretary to
manage the department effectively.



    Earmarks

            The Subcommittee has earmarked almost 300 transit projects, as
    well as many airport, Intelligent Transportation System, and rail
    projects. Consistent with the AdministrationD,s objection to earmarks in
    TEA-2l, the Administration believes that funds should not be directed to
    projects that cannot meet established selection criteria.

    Language Provisions

            We understand that an amendment may be offered that would, like
    the Senate, limit the use of project labor agreements. The Secretary of
    Transportation has indicated that he would recommend that the President
    veto the bill if it were to contain such a provision.

            The Administration requests that the Committee delete the
    provisions in both the Coast Guard and FAA operating expenses language
    that would prohibit the Coast Guard and the FAA from evaluating options
    for collecting fees for their services. User fees may be a critical means
    in the future for ensuring that the Coast Guard and the FAA have adequate
    resources to meet their operating and capital needs without significantly
    reducing other vital transportation programs.

            The Administration strongly objects to the Subcommittee
    prohibition of any future changes to automobile fuel economy (CAFE)
    standards. This significant policy issue should be addressed analytically
    through the process in place under Federal law and not preemptively
    settled through the appropriations process.

             Finally, the Administration is pleased that the Subcommittee
     recognizes the need to review the Coast GuardD,s roles and missions but
    objects to the subcommitteeD,s proposed blue-ribbon panel. This proposal
    would add significant administrative and procedural requirements to the
    process, delay the Deepwater contract by at least a year, and be more
    costly that the AdministrationD,s proposed advisory council. The advisory
    council will provide an objective, third-party assessment of the Coast
    GuardD,s roles and missions in a time frame consistent with the planned
    'Deepwater procurement.

            We look forward to working with the Committee to address our
    mutual concerns.

                                                    Sincerely,




                                                    Jacob J. Lew
                                                    Acting Director




    Identical Letter Sent to The Honorable Robert Livingston,
    The Honorable David R. Obey, The Honorable Frank R. wolf,
    and The Honorable Martin O. Sabo
