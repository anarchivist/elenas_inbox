The Honorable Bob Livingston
Chainnan
Committee on Appropriations
U.S. House of Representatives
Washington, D.C. 20515

Dear Mr. Chainnan:

       The purpose of this letter is to provide the Administration's views on H.R. 4194, the
Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, and Independent
Agencies Appropriations Bill, FY 1999, as passed by the House and by the Senate. As the
conferees develop a final version of the bill, your consideration of the Administration's views
would be appreciated.

         The Administration appreciates efforts by the Congress to accommodate the President's
priorities within the 302(b) allocation. The President's FY 1999 Budget proposes levels of
discretionary spending for FY 1999 that confonn to the Bipartisan Budget Agreement by
providing savings through user fees and certain mandatory programs to help finance discretionary
spending. In the Transportation Equity Act, Congress -- on a broad, bipartisan basis -- took
similar action in approving funding for surface transportation programs paid for with mandatory
offsets. In addition, this year, as in the past, such mandatory offsets have been approved by the
House and Senate in other appropriations bills. We want to work with the Congress on
mutually-agreeable mandatory and other offsets that could be used to increase funding for
high-priority discretionary programs such as National Service, environmental protection, and safe
and affordable housing for low-income households.

         Both the House- and the Senate-passed versions of the bill include requested funding for
many of the Administration's priorities, and we appreciate the efforts ofthe House and Senate in
this regard. Regrettably, there are a number of Presidential priorities that remain underfunded.
In particular, the Administration is deeply concerned that the House-passed bill provides no
funding for National Service and that both the House- and Senate-passed versions include
significant cuts to the President's request for the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's)
Hazardous Substance Superfund and significantly underfund the President's request for the
Department of Housing and Urban Development's Welfare-to-Work and other incremental
housing vouchers. The Administration is also very concerned about problematic language in the
House and Senate versions of the bill regarding the Kyoto Protocol and strongly objects to the
House's addition of significant portions ofH.R. 2, the Housing Opportunity and Responsibility
Act of 1997, which includes unacceptable provisions such as those relaxing income targeting. If
the bill were to be presented to the President without responding to these concerns, the
President's senior advisers would recommend that he veto the bill.
                                                                         Hex-Dump Conversion

         Below is a discussion of the Administration's specific concerns with the bill, as passed by
the House and by the Senate. We look forward to working with you to resolve these concerns as
the bill moves forward.

Comoration for National and Community Service

        The Administration strongly objects to the House's termination of the Corporation for
National and Community Service, one of the Administration's top priorities, and is deeply
concerned that the Senate-passed bill would freeze funding for the Corporation at the FY 1998
level, $74 million below the President's request and continue restrictive appropriation language.
Eliminating funding for the Corporation would deny more than 49,000 Americans the
opportunity to serve as AmeriCorps members in projects such as America Reads, the
Administration's effort to raise student literacy through the use of tutors to supplement the school
day activities. In addition, over one million students of all ages would forego the chance to
participate in service learning activities in their schools and neighborhoods. The Administration
urges the Congress to fully fund the Corporation for National and Community Service at the
requested level of $502 million and adopt the requested appropriations language.

Department of Housing and Urban Development

        The Administration strongly opposes the inclusion ofH.R. 2, the Public Housing Reform
and Responsibility Act of 1997, in the House-passed bill. By changing the income targeting at
admission for public and Section 8 assisted housing, H.R. 2 would shift subsidies from the
poorest families, many of whom are working, to families with incomes sufficient to have greater
housing choices. Such provisions would increase homelessness and hardship at a time when
many low income Americans cannot afford even basic housing and are unacceptable. The
Administration supports reasonable measures to encourage a range of incomes in public housing
and thereby reduce concentrations of poverty. The Administration can find no rationale, however,
for relaxing the income targeting of Section 8 subsidies that can be used throughout a
community. We must not allow those with the most desperate housing needs to be left out in the
name of housing reform.

        The overall level of funding provided by both the House and the Senate bills for the
Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is generally consistent with the
Administration's request, including the funding provided to renew all expiring Section 8
contracts. The Administration also appreciates the Senate's decision to end the ninety-day delay
in reissuing of Section 8 certificates/vouchers on turnover and encourages the conferees to strike
the House's ninety-day delay provision.




                                                 2·
                                                                        Hex-Dump Con\'~rsion

        Despite the House's decision to fund 17,000 incremental welfare-to-work housing
vouchers, the Administration is disappointed that both the House and the Senate have failed to
provide adequate funding for the President's request for 103,000 incremental vouchers, including
50,000 vouchers to assist families moving from welfare to work and 34,000 vouchers to assist
homeless individuals and families in their efforts to secure permanent housing. With millions of
families needing to make the transition from welfare to work, and many low income Americans
with unmet housing needs, the Administration believes it is critical for the Congress to fund'the
entire requested number of welfare-to-work housing vouchers.

        The Administration also encourages the conferees to fund fully the President's request for
$400 million for an Economic Development Initiative (ED!) Community Empowerment Fund to
generate 280,000 job opportunities in distressed communities. The House has cut the request by
$350 million, providing only $50 million, and the Senate has provided $85 million, with over 75
percent earmarked for specific projects. The Administration objects to the list of specific,
earmarked projects in the Senate-passed bill for the ED! program. We look forward to working
with the conferees to maximize the level of funds awarded to projects based on a consideration of
merits and need. The Administration also urges the conferees to approve the proposed request
for Brownfields redevelopment.

        The Administration strongly opposes the House's $21 million reduction for Housing
Opportunities for Persons with AIDS (HOPW A) and urges the conferees to restore funding to the
requested level, $225 million. We believe a reduction to this critical program at a time of
significant medical advances for the treatment of AIDS is shortsighted and will result in a
significant number ofthe qualified caseload being denied essential housing and other related
assistance.

        The Administration appreciates the House and Senate's decision to increase funding for
Homeless Assistance Grants above FY 1998 levels and urges the conferees to approve the Senate
level. However, we strongly urge the conferees to strike the Senate's rigid set-aside for
permanent housing, which would reduce the ability of each local entity to adopt the most
effective response to the homeless challenge unique to that area identified in it's Continuum of
Care Plan. Further, the Administration is encouraged by the funding level provided by the
House for Regional Opportunity Counseling, a voluntary effort to expand housing and
employment opportunities available to low-income families.

         The Administration is pleased with the support the House has expressed for an
audit-based enforcement initiative for the Fair Housing Initiatives program, which would reduce
the level of housing discrimination. We urge the conferees to adopt the House recommendation
for this critical fair housing initiative and to provide the Administration's full request for Fair
Housing. The Administration also supports the House funding level for the Partnership for
Advancing Technologies in Housing and urges that funding also be included to support Regional
Connections as requested in the President's budget.



                                                 3
                                                                        Hex-Dump COflv.;rsion

         The Administration appreciates the Congress' decision to raise the limit on FHA
single-family loans to 87 percent of the GSE "conforming limit." The Administration urges the
conferees to provide even greater homeownership opportunities by adopting its original request
to raise FHA's loan limit to 100 percent of the GSE "conforming limit." This would yield
another $700 million in savings over five years.

        The Administration is disappointed that the House and the Senate have failed to adopt the
Administration's proposal to reform HUD's single-family property disposition program, which
would produce substantial savings. The proposal would streamline and transform FHA's now
lengthy, labor-intensive disposition process into one that would take advantage of private sector
efficiencies, while maintaining HUD's long-standing mission of revitalizing distressed
neighborhoods. Enactment of this proposal would yield over $500 million in net present value
savings in fiscal year 1999.

       The Administration objects to the Senate's reduction in resources for the Office of
Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO). OFHEO provides crucial taxpayer protection
through its financial supervision of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

Environmental Protection Agency

       The Administration has several major concerns with the House and Senate marks for the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). In particular, the Administration strongly objects to
the $593 million, or 28-percent, reduction made by both the House and the Senate to the
President's request for Superfund, which would delay cleanups at sites nationwide and needlessly
jeopardize public health. In addition, the Administration opposes the Senate's restrictive bill
language that would hamper achievement of brownfield cleanups by preventing their use for
revolving loan funds. The Administration urges the conferees to restore Superfund to the
requested level and to delete the restrictive brownfields language.

       The Administration strongly opposes the House's $106 million reduction and the
Senate's $91 million reduction in the EPA request for the Climate Change Technology Initiative.
 This high-priority program should be funded fully to cut energy usage, save consumers money,
and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We will work with the Congress to restore funding to the
requested level.

         The Administration strongly opposes House bill and report language related to the Kyoto
Protocol. While the Administration could not and would not implement the Protocol until it is
ratified, the bill language (and Senate report language) could be interpreted broadly to prevent
EP A activities that limit greenhouse gases -- for example, through enhancing energy
efficiency -- even though they are authorized under current law. In addition, the Administration
objects to Senate report language requiring a detailed Government Performance and Results Act
(GPRA) plan concerning climate change activities. Such a plan would be premature and would
appear to require the Administration to set goals for implementing the Kyoto Protocol before it


                                               4
                                                                          lIcx·Dmnp Cor,version

has been ratified by the Senate. The Administration opposes this and other such riders because
they abuse the legislative process by denying the public and Members of Congress the
opportunity to examine and debate these proposals openly.

       The Administration urges the conferees to provide the full $50 million request to help
improve water quality in Boston Harbor and prevent beach closings. The Administration
appreciates House action to provide full funding for EPA's part of the President's Clean Water
Action Plan, which is designed to prevent pollution run-off and protect public health. We urge
the conferees to maintain the House funding level in the final bill.

        The Administration is concerned with the large number of unrequested, earmarked
projects in both the House- and Senate-passed versions of the bill. This is especially
troublesome when the House and the Senate have reduced funding for several high-priority
Administration initiatives, including right-to-know programs, Montreal Protocol, GLOBE, and
Mexican border wastewater treatment funding.

Council on Environmental Quality

         The Administration appreciates the modest increases over the FY 1998 level provided by
the House and Senate for the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ). However, we strongly
believe that in order to allow CEQ to carry out its environmental mission and reinvention efforts,
the full requested level should be provided, and language prohibiting use of detailees should be
deleted.

Department of Veterans Affairs

        The.Administration appreciates the responsiveness of the House and the Senate to several
of the President's key initiatives for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Still, three key
areas of concern remain:

·      Earmarked Funding for New YorklNew Jersey Health Care Network. The Administration
       appreciates the Senate's strong support of the Veterans Equitable Resource Allocation
       (VERA) formula, which bases network resource allocations on workload and local cost
       factors. The Administration urges the conferees to strike House report language that
       directs VA to provide an additional $20 million to the New YorklNew Jersey VA health
       care network. The VERA formula has begun to shift resources from the Northeast to
       the underfunded South and Southwest. Allocating additional funding to the New
       YorklNew Jersey network would mean less for these other under-funded networks.

·      New National Cemetery in Eastern Kentucky. The Administration objects to House
       report language urging.that a new cemetery be established and that VA use whatever
       advance planning funds may be necessary to initiate the planning phase and to prepare a
       progress report. The eastern Kentucky area was not identified in the 1987 or 1994


                                                5
                                                                           :!::x-Dl4T.p Cor,vmion


       reports to Congress as an area of the country most in need of a national cemetery. Other
       areas of the country have larger concentrations of veterans, and most veterans residing in
       the eastern half of Kentucky are already served by three open national cemeteries in
       Kentucky (Camp Nelson, Lebanon, and Mill Springs) and one in Tennessee (Mountain
       Home).

·      Changes to the funding mechanism for adjudication office. The Administration prefers
       the language of the Senate bill with regard to the funding mechanism for VA's
       newly-created Office of Resolution Management and Office of Employment
       Discrimination Complaint Adjudication. The House-passed bill includes language that
       would change the funding mechanism for these two offices from reimbursable, as
       requested in the President's budget and included in the Senate bill, to specific transfers of
       estimated amounts. The House provision would reduce the incentive for VA managers
       to control the costs associated with the processing ofEEO complaints, and it would
       lessen the coordinated arrangements that reimbursable services foster.

Community Development Financial Institutions Fund

          We strongly urge the conferees to fund the Community Development Financial
Insti tutions Fund at the requested level, $125 million. The reductions to the President's request of
$45 million and $70 million in the House and Senate versions of the bill, respectively, would
severely reduce the Fund's ability to leverage investments, loans, and financial services in the
country's most distressed communities.

National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)

        The Administration is deeply concerned with reductions made by the House to the
requests for the International Space Station, Space Shuttle, and Earth Science programs and
strongly urges the conferees to support full funding for these activities. We also are concerned
about the increased number of appropriation accounts for the International Space Station and
other activities included in the Senate-passed bill. The redirection of key resources to
implement this change could threaten NASA's Year 2000 conversion effort and pose an audit
risk.

        The Administration is prepared to work with the Congress to control development costs
of the Space Station while also providing the resource flexibility within the Human Space Flight
account to deal with unanticipated requirements, particularly additional contingency steps that
may be called for in light of continuing resource problems of the Russian government. In
addition, we are concerned with House language prohibiting the use of funds for the Triana
project and urge the conferees to strike this provision. Finally, the Administration is troubled
that both the House- and Senate-passed versions of the bill contain a very large number of
unrequested, site-specific earmarks, which would have the effect of circumventing the
competitive, peer review process.


                                                 6
                                                                            Hcx-Du;r.p Conversion




Federal Emergency Management Agency

         The Administration appreciates the level of funding provided by the House and Senate
for the Federal Emergency Management Agency. However, we believe that the reductions ($20
million in the House and $25 million in the Senate) to the President's request for pre-disaster
mitigation grants are shortsighted. These grants would help reduce the costs of future disasters
by leveraging local and private-sector support for enhanced mitigation efforts at the State and
community level. We urge the Congress to fund fully the President's request for this important
initiative. In addition, the Administration is pleased that the Senate-passed bill includes $8
million in response to the President's June 8th request for funding to help States and communities
prepare for potential terrorist incidents involving chemical and/or biological weapons. We urge
the Congress to approve requested emergency funding for FEMA Disaster Relief.

National Science Foundation

         Given the budget constraints faced by the House and Senate, the Administration
appreciates the strong support shown for the National Science Foundation (NSF). The
Administration is firmly convinced that support for the Foundation's research and education
programs is a critically important investment in the future well-being of the Nation. Therefore,
the Administration urges the conferees to fund fully the President's request for all of NSF's
activities. Additionally, the Administration remains concerned about the number and specificity
of funding earmarks, which in some cases come dangerously close to infringing on an open,
merit-based review and decision-making process. Finally, the Administration strongly supports
both the Polar Cap Observatory and the GLOBE program and urges the conferees to provide the
budget request for each of these activities.

Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation

         The Administration is pleased that the House-passed version of the bill would provide
the President's full request for the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation (NRC), and we urge
the conferees to adopt the House position. The NRC has a proven, successful record of
leveraging private sector resources to promote homeowners hip and helping strengthen America's
communities. This funding would provide an additional $25 million for a homeownership
initiative that seeks to create 10,000 new homeowners through FY 2000.

Other Issues

·      San Francisco Restriction. The Administration strongly objects to the amendment which
       requires the City of San Francisco not to use any Federal funds to implement a local
       ordinance. This is an unfunded mandate. Legislating through the use of Federal funds


                                                7
                                                                          Hex-Dump Conversion


        against a single ordinance in a single city would be contrary to the most basic principles
        of Federalism underlying our system of Government. The amendment would impose a
        burdensome administrative requirement on the City, requiring it to set up a system to
        separately track expenditures to ensure that no Federal funds were used to implement one
        particular City ordinance.

·       Consumer Product Safety Commission. The Administration opposes bill language in the
        House-passed bill that would block the Consumer Product Safety Commission's
        (CPSC's) ability to promulgate rules to reduce the flammability of upholstered furniture.
        This language intrudes upon CPSC's ability, as well the ability of other agencies, to carry
        out their responsibilities. Furthermore, these efforts to block the development of a new
        safety standard represent a threat to public health.

    ·   American Battle Monuments Commission. The Administration is concerned that the
        Senate-passed bill includes an earmark of $2.5 million for restoration of the Liberty
        Memorial in Kansas City, Missouri. (The Liberty Memorial has been estimated to need
        $60 million to $75 million in restoration funding.) This earmark would set an
        undesirable precedent. Currently, ABMC's program maintains memorials to American
        Armed Forces where they served overseas, not in local communities around the country.
        The Smithsonian's Save Outdoor Sculpture program has identified the Liberty Memorial
        as one of 43 domestic World War I and II outdoor monuments and memorials in need of
        immediate repair. The ABMC program is not the appropriate place to fund this kind of
        domestic public works program. We recommend that the conferees remove this earmark
        from ABMC's language.

·       Section 41, Open Season for Certain Alaska Native Veterans for Allotments. The
        Administration supports suitable legislation that would renew the opportunity for an
        allotment for Alaska Na'tive veterans who missed the opportunity because of Vietnam
        War service in 1970 and 1971. However, section 41 of the Senate-passed bill would
        extend benefits beyond those who missed an opportunity due to service; would
        unreasonably delay adjudication and conveyance of pending Native or State applications
        under existing entitlements and claims; would unreasonably open special Conservation
        System Units set aside by Congress (such as parks, scenic rivers, refuges, and national
        wilderness areas) to private inholdings and development; and, would raise inequities
        among Alaska Natives. The Administration strongly objects to this provision, as written.

·       Ship Scrapping. The Administration supports the Senate Appropriations Committee's
        goal of ensuring a safe and environmentally sound ship scrapping policy. The specific
        requirements in the Senate version of the bill, however, raise implementation issues such
        as EPA's certification of the enforcement of other countries' laws. The Administration
        believes that a starting point to develop a more workable approach to achieve these
        protection aims would be to build on the recommendations of the Interagency Ship
        Scrapping Review Panel. The Administration is committed to working with Congress to
        resolve these concerns and to finding mutually acceptable solutions that achieve these
        important objectives.
