    bFOP President to Join Secret Service Uniform Division in Collective

        WASHINGTON, June 15 /U.S. Newswire/ -- Gilbert G. Gallegos,
    national president of the Grand Lodge, Fraternal Order of Police,
    will demonstrate in favor of collective bargaining in a June 17
    event hosted by the Labor Committee of the U.S. Secret Service
    Uniform Division's Labor Committee and the Jerrard F. Young
    District of Columbia Lodge No.1.
        --We obtained a promise from President Clinton in September
    1996, " reported Gallegos, --that he would work with the FOP in
    securing collective bargaining rights for these and other federal
    officers. Despite meetings and promises, the administration has
    done nothing to address the concerns of federal officers and done
    nothing to deliver on the president's promise.
        --The Grand Lodge is doing everything we can to support the


    officers of the Secret Service Uniformed Division, " said Gallegos.
    --I hope the support that the FOP can demostrate next week will
    underscore how unfairly these officers are being treated by the
    Secret Service."
        The Grand Lodge has pledged financial assistance for USSSUD
    Labor Committee, which is engaged in a lawsuit against the
    Department of the Treasury. In April 1996, Deputy Chief Steve
    Johnson ordered USSSUD officers not to make arrests for violation
    of District of Columbia law, and threatened to put officers who
    made such arrests --on a bus back to the White House. " The remarks
    were videotaped and since, the Secret Service has actively harassed
    the men and women of the Uniformed Division with terminations and
    other relativity acts.
        --With a collective bargaining system in place, " Gallegos
    noted, --labor-management relations would not have deteriorated to
    this level."
        The rally will take place on Wednesday, June 17, at East
    Executive and Pennsylvania avenues, from noon to 4 p.m.

        The Fraternal Order of Police is the nation's largest
    organization of law enforcement professionals, with more than
    272,000 members.
