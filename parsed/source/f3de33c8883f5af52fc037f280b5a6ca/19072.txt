Jose:   I edited Jon's draft to tighten it up.


 Q: If these findings show that many of our schools are unsafe, why
shouldn't vouchers be given to children in these unsafe schools to go to
the private school of their choice?

A: The most important thing to keep in mind is that we know how to make
all of our schools safer--clear discipline policies that are fairly and
firmly enforced, parental and community involvement, strong partnerships
between schools and police. The proper response when there are schools
that are unsafe is to implement the practices that work so that all
students can be safe.  Simply sending a few students to other schools and
leaving the rest in an unsafe school is simply no answer.

        You can end the answer there or continue with the longer version
below
We must continue to invest and strengthen our nation's public schools.
This means reducing class size, raising academic standards, modenizing our
schools, creating after-school programs, and connecting schools to the
internet so that all of our children can get the education they need and
deserve. Vouchers would drain resources from our nation's public schools
-- schools that are attended by 90% of our children -- to subsidize
private schools.  The right way to help children in failing or unsafe
schools isn't to drain those schools of resources -- it is to take drastic
actions to fix and turn around the entire school for the benefit of all of
the children in the school.   We owe it to our children to preserve this
nation's time-honored commitment to public education and our commitment to
provide a good education to all of our children.
