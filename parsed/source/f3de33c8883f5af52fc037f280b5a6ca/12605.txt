TEXT:
In yesterday's messge meeting the group started to talk about event
options for the beginning of June. 'One thing the group mentioned was the
possibility of doing the Medicare event.  Below Chris indicates that we
would not be ready by then with the President's plan, but that we might be
able to do a drug benefit event.  Is this something you would like to do
if we can get it on the schedule?

The President's plan probably will not be available in early June.   We are
still pulling together pieces.

I did hear, however, that the House Oem Caucus is quite interested in
doing a prescription drug event during the Memorial Day recess.  Frank
Pallone advised us about this yesterday.

Although we will not have a plan by then, we could perhaps have an event
where we could document the need for such coverage.  To do this right,
however, we need to quickly review available report options to see if we
have a vehicle to help highlight this issue.

Let's talk ...
