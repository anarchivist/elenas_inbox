TEXT:
I asked Mary to look into the bad meat issue. She says USDA said that
Glickman's COS was talking to Erskine and is sending a briefing and Q and
A's to Erskine about this that is going to be passed on to the
President. We'll get a copy of that to look at, but if erskine is happy
with that, that would suit us fine.
