                           Questions and Answers on School Vouchers
                                       October 27, 1997


    Q:   Democrats are filibustering the DC voucher bill in the Senate, and today they are
         scheduled to debate the CoverdeU K-12 education savings accounts. Republicans
         are also considering adding a voucher provision to bipartisan charter schools
         legislation that you have endorsed. And tomorrow you are scheduled to meet with
         a number of House and Senate leaders and a family who support vouchers. Do
         you continue to oppose school vouchers, and if so, why?

    A:   I strongly oppose any legislation allowing the use of federal taxpayer funds for vouchers.

         We need to focus on strengthening the public schools that serve nearly 90% of students
         and expanding choice within the public education system, such as through charter
         schools.

         Vouchers would siphon critical dollars from neighborhood public schools that are already
         short on resources in order to send a few selected students to private schools, and would
         distract attention from the hard work of reform needed to change failing schools into
         good schools and good schools into outstanding schools.

         As I made clear in Chicago yesterday, no child deserves to get a second class education.
         Where schools are failing, local and state education officials must step in and redesign
         them, or close them down and reopen them it with new, more effective leadership and
         staff who will raise standards, put into place effective reforms, and create safe,
         disciplined leaming environments where students can succeed.

    Q:   SOIile argue that vouchers are vital to help children escape ineffective, dangerous
         schools., What is your response to that?

    A:   My opposition to vouchers is based more on what happens to students who do not
         participate in a voucher program than on what may happen to the few who do. The fact
         is that 90% of our students attend public schools, and our primary responsibility,
         especially with limited federal resources, is to make sure that the public schools they
         attend are among the best in the world. This means concentrating our time and money
         on raising academic standards, improving teaching, providing schools with technology
         and other up-to-date learning tools, and creating charter schools and other forms of choice
         within the public school system. Vouchers only drain financial resources and energy
         away from our most important task -- improving our public schools.
