TEXT:
FYI -- tomorrow, the full Ways and Means human resources committee will
mark up the child support incentives bill which flew through the human
resources committee last week. The committee is taking up the
Administration proposal, which was developed last winter as a result of a
requirement in the welfare legislation. Currently states are paid
financial child support incentives based only on their performance on one
measure -- cost effectiveness. This proposal provides financial
incentives based on state performance in five areas --

           1)   establishment of paternities
           2)   establishment of child support orders
           3)   collections on current child support due
           4)   collection on past child support due; and
           5)   cost effectiveness

It also requires states, for the first time, to spend their incentive
funds in the child support program.
