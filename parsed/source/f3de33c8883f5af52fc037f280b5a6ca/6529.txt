      What do you think our next step should be?   (You have to love these
      groups--they always seem to find a way to lay fault at the White House and
      focus solely on the dc game and not in building public support out there
      in the country.) Audrey--who all did you meet with?

      Subject:         Child Care


      Yesterday we had our internal meeting with the key "thinkers and movers"
      on the child care initiative.  Following is the summary:

      1. Clearly Children's Defense Fund is the lead organization and they don't
      believe any other coalition/campaign is needed ..... they are the
      coalition/campaign.

      2.  When asked how we could assist with outreach, the only group they
      don't feel is connected is business.

      3.  They want the White House to use events/opportunities to continue and
      keep child care on the front of the agenda.

      4.  The bottom line for them is "what is our legislative strategy?" They
      had some thoughts,but really said the most confusion on this issue from
      WH is within the absence of a legislative strategy, with or without a bill
      although they much prefer a bill.

      Suggestion:   We need to convene an internal meeting with DPC and leg


affairs and whoever else to discuss legislative strategy . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

As an FYI, Maureen and Doris were at the meeting as well .... if either of
you have something to add, feel free!
