 Cordelia, this seems to make some sense in terms of providing a viable
 screening process that could be used by the EEOC without expenditure
 of significant new funds. The .concerns may be two fold: the age of the
 census data given the dynamism of the 90's economy and the need of
 EECO to have firm level data rather than individual data.   The firm data
 would then provide a metric for evaluating individual complaints with
 regard to the specific firm.   An aggregation of firm data by industry could
 then provide aggregate data that would show any substantial deviations


 by the firm to industrial standards_
