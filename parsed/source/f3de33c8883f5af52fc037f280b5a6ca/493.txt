TEXT:
Following is my final top ten list:
Most are now resolved, in the budget discussion, or near
completion.

The two that are hanging out there are Means Tested Benefits --
which is only awaiting DOL lawyers signoff before going to Justice
and the Disability Reg which is taking a lot longer than we had
hoped.
We have an implementation meeting at 3 today and we will be going
over some systems issues as well as outstanding implementation
issues.
