TEXT:
In another October 1991 interview, Clinton explained why he found both
                  Hill and Thomas credible in their testimony·.

                   " I believed them both a little bit," he said. "My
feeling after listening to
                   the whole thing was that the truth was something that
will never come out,
                   that in their own way they both felt they were telling
the truth."
