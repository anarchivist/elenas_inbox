I have told them I'd check with you. We probably want to keep this
meeting rather small and if we let them bring folks, education will want
to add people.

hey there Cath!   hope all is well today.    . .. I am SO exhausted.

regarding these meetings, Ken does plan on attending and wanted to note
that he
will probably bring Barry White or Bob Shireman with him as well.  Please
let me
know if it's a problem.

thanks!
