Q:   There are so many promising new developments in cancer. Shouldn't your
     Administration do more to help advance the progress against this disease?

A:   I am very encouraged about the promising new breakthroughs in cancer research. I am
     proud of what this Administrtation is doing to advance this progress through three
     proposals that represent some of the highest priorities of the cancer community.

     ·      Historic Investment in Cancer Research. My balanced budget includes an
            unprecedented multi-year investment in cancer research, with a 65 percent
            increase in the NCI budget over the next five years.

     ·      Cancer Clinical Trials. My budget also includes a new demonstration to cover
            the patient care costs for Medicare beneficiaries who participate in certain clinical
            trials. The recent promising cancer therapies all have to go through clinical trials.
             Scientists have said that expanding access to these trials will increase their
            participation rates, which is critical to ensuring that these promising new therapies
            go from the experimental phase to the market where they can potentially help
            millions of Americans.

     ·      Genetic Discrimination. Finally, I have asked Congress to pass legislation that
            prevents employers and health insurers from discriminating on the basis of genetic
            information. Studies show that a leading reason women do not get new
            genetic testing for susceptibility to breast cancer is because they worry about
            this kind of discrimination.

     I urge Congress to pass all of these proposals into law this year.


Q:   Should insurance companies be required to cover Viagra?

A:   If the drug is medically necessary, it should be covered. Most policies today cover
     prescription drugs that have been determined by physicians to be medically necessary.

     Some health plans are now suggesting that this drug is being prescribed and dispensed for
     conditions that may not meet a traditional definition of medical necessity; in response,
     they are contemplating new coverage rules. We will follow this closely to determine if
     medically necessary medications are covered. But as a general matter, I believe there
     should be very careful deliberation before the government takes any action to require
     coverage for a particular prescription drug.




Q:   But isn't it inconsistent to cover Viagra, in light of the fact that many policies do not
                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion
     now cover birth control pills?

A:   The decision to require coverage for any particular drug should be carefully considered.
     The question is whether the denial of coverage creates problems of real access to
     medically necessary prescription drugs. Before we proceed in this area we should make
     sure that the need justifies governmental intervention.
