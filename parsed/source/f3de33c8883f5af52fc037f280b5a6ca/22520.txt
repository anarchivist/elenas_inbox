TEXT:
[I would have cc'd Bruce, but don't have his email address]

Lots of good input. Thanks. I take to heart Bruce's comment about how close
we are and the "sea change" implicit in the ESEA ideas. Indeed, things
really are in such a better .place than they seemed in October.

I see two central options as of now. First is to, in essence, make the ESEA
approach the mountain top, and talk about how it advances the vision of
accountability and gap-closing as a non-trivial first step. [Like the space
station as a step towards Mars.] The second option is to do option one PLUS
a discrete program within ESEA that provides a supercharger for districts
that, with state support, want to move on a faster, bolder track, with
higher risks and rewards, etc.

I'd like to flesh out these possibilities further, but don't quite know how
given time constraints, etc. I've asked Scott and Felicia Wong to try to
arrange for us (me by speaker phone from Cambridge) to pursue this with
Mike Cohen, or whomever, as early as possible next week. Or we could do it
tomorrow (Friday).

Part of the background we need is to resolve what seems to us a disconnect
between the WH description of the ESEA revolution and the Department's take
on things. And second, where you are on Ed Flex these days, especially in
relation to the Frist bill in the Senate.



Ciao
