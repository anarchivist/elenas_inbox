     PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
     RADIO ADDRESS ON CAMPAIGN REFORM
     ROOSEVELT ROOM
     September 13, 1997
     [taped September 12, 1997]

             Good morning. America has had a summer of significant
     achievement, as we are working to protect our values and prepare America
     for the 21st Century.  The balanced budget shows what we can do when we
     put aside partisanship and work for the public interest. But America
     canO,t rest. And one of the most important steps we can take next is to
     pass long-overdue campaign finance reform.

             The campaign finance laws have been overwhelmed by a rising flood
     of campaign cash. The amount of money raised by both political parties
     now doubles every four years. Candidates are caught up in a fundraising
     arms race, spending more and more time raising more and more money 0)
     money that raises more and more questions in the public mind. The campaign
     finance
     system is broken. And every one of us must take responsibility for fixing
     it.

             When possible, I have acted to promote reform. i have asked the
     FCC to provide candidates free TV airtime.  I have asked the Federal
     Election Commission to ban large "soft money" contributions to political
     parties from corporations, unions and wealthy individuals. And the Justice
     Department has indicated it will go to court, when appropriate, to defend
     the
     constitutionality of spending l·imits.

             But there is no substitute for strong, bipartisan campaign finance
     reform legislation.  I proposed reform when I ran for President.  I have
     backed reform legislation every year since then. And every single year,
     reform has been blocked in the Congress through the filibuster.  The
     excuses keep changing. This year, opponents claim that unlimited campaign
     spending is just free speeCh. Well; when money talks in our democracy,
     thatO,s not the solution 0) thatO,s the problem.

             Now, the special interests and their allies in Congress are poised
     to strike again, waiting to quietly smother reform in the dead of night
     one more time. But this year, they wonO,t get away with it.

             Sens. John McCain, a Republican, and Russ Feingold, a Democrat,
     have pledged to bring their reform legislation to a vote this month. On
     Thursday, 45 Democratic Senators 0) every single one 0) wrote to the
     Senate leadership in support. Citizen groups, spurred by business
     executives and civic leaders, have gathered one million signatures on a
     petition to Congress.  Presidents Ford, Carter, and Bush have called for
     reform. They are being joined by dozens of former lawmakers, now free to
     speak their mind. And the American people overwhelmingly want action.
     There is a critical mass for action.

             This is a time of testing.  Ignore the rationalizations: A vote
     to filibuster campaign reform is a vote for unlimited soft money and
     backdoor campaign contributions ... a vote to increase the power of big


money in our democracy. Nothing more, nothing less. A vote against a
filibuster -- a vote for reform -- is a vote to give ordinary citizens the
loudest voice in the halls of power.

        This year, despite all the odds, we have the best chance in a
generation for reform. Throughout our history, the American people have
overcome the resistance of entrenched interests to expand our democracy
and keep it strong in changing times.   LetO,s make this autumn a season
of reform. Thanks for listening.
