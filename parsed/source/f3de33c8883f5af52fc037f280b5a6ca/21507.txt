This is Barry from Barbara's computer.



Attached are revised versions of the two "report" options.  Revisions
reflect Delia Pompa's edits for technical accuracy and sensitivities.
Also attached is language for demonstrations of various techniques for LEP
children.  This is a further fallback option if needed.

Delia has reviewed all these and is comfortable with them, should they
have to be used.==================== ATTACHMENT   1 ====================
