Subject:         Schumer FACE Amendment Letter

Attached is a draft of the letter to Schumer regarding his FACE
amendment.  This version has been cleared by Sarah, Jenny, and myself.

Justice -- please take a close look at this. Although I do not think it's
inconsistent with your position as outlined by Ken, I want to make sure
you're·okay with this.

OMB -- If you could put this in "quick clearance" that would be quite
helpful. As noted above, it's already been seen and edited by many folks.

Sarah -- You wanted me to remind you to tell Gene that we were sending
this up.

Everyone -- we still haven't decided who would sign.

Thanks, Joel

Dear Senator Schumer,

The Administration is deeply concerned by the incidents of violence, vandalism, and harassment
committed against family planning clinics. Some of these acts have resulted in the deaths and
maiming of innocent people. The Administration believes that these unlawful activities must not
be tolerated, and that when they are committed, those found liable should be held accountable
under the law.

The Administration has a strong record of supporting efforts to end clinic violence. The Freedom
of Access to Clinic Entrances (FACE) Act of which you were the principal House sponsor, and
which the President signed into law, provides federal protection against unlawful and violent
actions while it protects the right to engage in peaceful picketing and protest unaccompanied by
force or physical obstruction. Violators of FACE are subject to criminal penalties of
imprisonment, a fine or both. In addition, the court may also assess civil penalties for a
particularly egregious offense or against a repeat offender. State clinic access laws and state and
federal anti-racketeering laws are additional tools used to prosecute clinic violence. Yet, if
offenders are able to escape the damages assessed under these laws, then they will gradually lose
their effectiveness.

Unfortunately, some defendants found liable for clinic violence are abusing the bankruptcy
system in an effort to shield themselves from civil monetary penalties assessed under these laws.
More specifically, these defendants are filing for Chapter 7 to discharge their obligations to the
victims of their clinic violence and to escape responsibility for their actions. In order to stem the
tide of clinic-related violence by ensuring that penalties for these acts are strictly enforced, we
support your amendment that would make court-ordered fines and debts resulting from clinic
violence nondischargeable.

The Administration's general position has been to oppose the expansion of non dischargeable
debt unless there is an overriding public policy objective to be protected and no other way to
achieve that objective. Consistent with this position, we view your amendment as a necessary
tool in our current efforts to end clinic violence.

Certainly, one could argue that damages awarded for all intentional torts should be
nondischargeable. Indeed, this is largely the case under the "willful and malicious injury"
exception contained in Section 536(a)(6) of the Bankruptcy Code. Some damages resulting from
clinic-related violence, however, are not protected under this exception. This was made clear in
the Supreme Court's recent decision in Geiger v. Kawaauhau, 523 U.S. 57 (1998). In Geiger the
Court held that the word "willful" "modifies the word 'injury' indicating that nondischargeability
takes a deliberate or intentional injury, not merely a deliberate or intentional act that leads to
injury ... " Although some clinic-related violence is committed with the direct intention to
inflict injury, some such violence indirectly results in injury. Take for example a family planning
clinic which is bombed at night. The perpetrator may not know that some of the clinic's
employees are working late and still in the building. The bomb, nonetheless, still injures these
employees. Should damages awarded to victims such as these be any less protected simply
because the bomber did not intentionally intend to injure them with his or her bomb?
                                                                                   Hex-Oump Conversion

In addition, there is another compelling reason to create a specific nondischargeability carve-out
for clinic-related violence damages. There are reports of those who have been found liable for
such acts blatantly - even enthusiastically - announcing how they are going to escape
responsibility for their actions by filing for Chapter 7. Indeed, such abuse of the bankruptcy
system appears to be part of a concerted plan on the part of these individuals to perpetuate their
acts of violence and intimidation.

Parties on both sides of the issue of abortion agree that violence against clinics should not be
tolerated. This is why we have laws in place designed to deter such activity. We must not permit
those who have committed odious acts of violence to escape responsibility for their actions. Your
amendment goes a long way toward achieving this goal.
