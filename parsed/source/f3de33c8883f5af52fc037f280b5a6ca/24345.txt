DRAFT MEMORANDUM FOR EOP PRINCIPALS MEETING

FROM:           ???

SUBJECT:        BENCHMARKING THE NRC-BASED INCOME AND POVERTY
                MEASURES

As discussed at the last EOP Principals meeting, in early 1999 the Census Bureau will publish an
analysis of alternative measures of poverty based on the proposals contained in the 1995 National
Research Council (NRC) report, Measuring Poverty: A New Approach. Because OMB is the
statutory arbiter of the "official" poverty measurement methodology, the Census Bureau has
asked for advice on the proposed alternative measures to be highlighted (among many that will
be published as part ofthe analysis). Currently, the Census Bureau plans to benchmark all of its
highlighted poverty estimates to a recent (likely 1997) poverty rate. (Note, however, that
non-benchmarked estimates will appear in the analysis portion of the report.)

The purpose of this meeting is to decide whether we want to advise Census to highlight a few
series that are not benchmarked, to advise that only benchmarked estimates be highlighted, or
simply to remain silent on the issue (which will likely result in only benchmarked estimates
being highlighted). This decision does not settle the issue of whether we should not benchmark
the official poverty measure, but it would make selecting a non-benchmarked alternative more
difficult.

In order to develop fully the issues involved, this memo has two parts. The first part explains
the concept and presents the pros and cons of benchmarking. Much of this information was
contained in the background memo for the last Principals meeting, however we include it here
for ease of access. The second part outlines the potential implications of advising the Census
Bureau to highlight some series that are not benchmarked.

Part I: Background on Benchmarking

Poverty measurement involves two concepts: (1) a definition of family resources, and (2) a
"threshold" against which resources are compared to determine if a family is poor. The NRC
panel recommends basing the threshold on expenditures on "necessities" (food, shelter, and
clothing) plus a little more. However, the NRC panel cautioned that setting the level below
which a family is considered poor is more of an art than a science. The panel therefore
suggested a range of alternatives and left it to policymakers to determine the most appropriate
levels. Specifically, the NRC panel recommends selecting the 30th to 35th percentile in the
distribution of annual expenditures on food, shelter, and clothing among families of four (two
adults and two children), and then multiplying this expenditure level by between 1.15 and 1.25.
Thresholds for other family sizes and types would be determined by an equivalency scale
calculation.
                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion
                                                                                                   2

Because there is some discretion in the setting of the poverty threshold, Table 1 shows poverty
rates between 1991 and 1996 using the current methodology (column 1) and using three
alternative ways to determine the threshold for the NRC experimental measure -- one
benchmarked and two not benchmarked:

·      The "Benchmarked" measure is the NRC measure benchmarked to the 1996 poverty rate;
       in this case the thresholds are "backed out" by first setting the new aggregate poverty rate
       to the current rate and then setting the thresholds at the level that achieves this rate given
       the new resource definitions. In this case, the threshold falls to approximately the 25th
       percentile in the distribution of expenditures.
·      The "NRC Experimental (midpoint)" (column 3) is based on selecting approximately the
       32.5 percentile in the distribution of annual expenditures and then multiplying this
       expenditure .by approximately 1.2 -- the midpoints of the NRC recommendations;
·      The "NRC Experimental (lower bound)" (column 4) is based on selecting the 30th
       percentile in the distribution of annual expenditures and then multiplying this expenditure
       by 1.15 -- the lower bound of the NRC recommendations;

Both the NRC Experimental "midpoint" and "lower bound" estimates would not match the
current overall poverty rate and thus would be considered "not benchmarked."

It is important to understand that benchmarking only assures that the aggregate poverty rate is
identical for the official and the alternative measure in the benchmarked year. However, the
distribution of poverty among subgroups will change whether or not the estimates are
benchmarked (see Table 2). In general, working families and families with large out-of-pocket
medical expenses would more likely be measured as poor, and nonworking families with
substantial in-kind benefits would less likely be measured as poor with the NRC experimental·
series. This would have geographic as well as subgroup poverty rate implications. For
example, even though the relative proportion of poor who are Black declines under both
alternatives (not shown in Table 2), the estimated Black poverty rate falls with benchmarking but
rises or stays constant with a non-benchmarked measure. Similarly, both historical and future
trends would differ. For instance, the benchmarked measure would be identical to the current
rate in 1996 but higher in 1991. (The faster fall using the alternative measure is largely due to
the expansion in the EITC.)

Pros and Cons of Benchmarking and Not Benchmarking

Pros of benchmarking:
·      May provide an easier transition to the new official measure of poverty because there will
       not be a change in the overall level of poverty. (Critics, of course, will still charge that
       this level is arbitrary.) In addition, with a benchmarked measure it may be easier to
       implement changes in the poverty guidelines issued by HHS for program purposes.

·      Focuses the arguments on the relative distribution of who is poor rather than on how
                                                            Hex-Dump Conversion
                                                                                                   3

       many people are poor; experts would say that the results on the distribution of who is
       poor are more objective and scientific than those on the total number of poor.

Cons of benchmarking:
·     Violates the NRC recommendation that the threshold should be based on the 30th-35th
      percentile in the expenditure distribution. In order to benchmark, the threshold falls to
      about the 25th percentile of expenditures on food, shelter, and clothing. This may cost
      us the political cover of following a nonpartisan expert panel, and may raise questions of
      motive.

·      Will highlight the distributional consequences of moving to an NRC-based alternative
       more clearly than under the non-benchmarked alternatives (although they have the same
       distributional consequences); for instance the poverty rate for some groups would fall in
       absolute terms with benchmarking.

·      There is a perceived illogic in using an overall poverty rate from a method we say is
       flawed to determine a key part of a methodology we say is better.

Pros of not benchmarking:
·      Incorporates the recommendations of the NRC panel, based on their professional
      judgement from the best available evidence (though, as noted, this judgement is
       subjective), and therefore provides some limited political cover.

Cons of not benchmarking:
·     Results in a higher poverty rate (although the trends over time are similar.)


Part II:      Key Decision for this Meeting

There are basically three options: (1) Advise the Census Bureau to highlight some
non-benchmarked estimates along with benchmarked estimates; (2) Actively advise the Census
Bureau to highlight only benchmarked estimates; (3) Remain silent on the issue (with the likely
result that Census will only highlight benchmarked estimates).

Pros ofadvising the Census Bureau to highlight some non-benchmarked estimates
·      Keeps the option of non-benchmarked estimates in the public dialog, which may preserve
       the option of not benchmarking when and if we decide to move to a new official measure
       of poverty.

·      Narrowing the range of options in any dimension may be perceived as moving us closer
       to a final decision, and might limit our flexibility.

·      The Census report may appear more credible if it includes a non-benchmarked
                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion
                                                                                                   4

       alternative, given that the NRC's recommendation did not involve benchmarking.
·      If we decide to chang<;: to an NRC-based measure as the official measure of poverty and if
       we decide to benchmark the official measure, it may make the change look small
       compared to selecting the non-benchmarked alternative. It gives us an ability to look
       "reasonable" by adopting a less extreme change.

Cons ofadvising the Census Bureau to highlight some non-benchmarked estimates
·     Even if we're not certain that we want to change the official measure of poverty, we may
      be held accountable for estimates that poverty is really higher than the current rate.

·      Even if the non-benchmarked estimates are simply among those highlighted, people could
       focus on them and create an "uproar." Alternatively, some of our traditional allies may
       like the non-benchmarked estimates and feel abandoned should we ultimately choose to
       benchmark.


Pros ofadvising the Census Bureau to highlight only benchmarked estimates
·      It may raise less of a political "uproar." This would be particularly valuable if we
       believe we are likely to benchmark any new official measure anyway.

Cons ofadvising the Census Bureau to highlight only benchmarked estimates
·     It may make it more difficult not to benchmark in the future.

·      If Census does not closely follow the NRC recommendation, it may appear that they had
       been inappropriately influenced by political considerations, particularly since
       non-benchmarked estimates are already in the public domain.


Pros of remaining silent on the issue of benchmarking
·      Given that, at this point, Census plans to only highlight benchmarked estimates this
       contains all of the advantages of advising Census to only present benchmarked estimates
       outlined above.

·      In addition, it may give us political cover by allowing another, independent statistical,
       agency to make the judgement about how the level of poverty should be determined.

Cons of remaining silent on the issue of benchmarking
·     Likely (because Census currently plans to only highlight benchmarked estimates) contains
      all of the cons of advising Census to present only benchmarked estimates.

·      We may not want Census to make the decision that non-benchmarked estimates will not
       be highlighted without our input.
