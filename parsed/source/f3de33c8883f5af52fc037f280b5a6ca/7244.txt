TEXT:
Good news -- we have new data on advertising we could announce, either at
an LA event or elsewhere. Dr. John Pierce, the UC San Diego professor
whose February study in the Journal of the American Medical Association
found that 34 percent of teen smoking could be attributed to tobacco
promotional activities, says he could do an estimate showing how much of
that smoking can be attributed to Joe Camel and the Marlboro Man -- and,
how many deaths would happen as a result.  These estimates would involve
using a subset of the data from the JAMA study (teens were asked to name
their favorite ad) .

We could do a roundtable event with a tobacco researcher (Dr. Pierce), a
state health official (Pierce recommends Judy Cook, the chair of the
state's tobacco oversight committee which has operated the state's
counteradvertising campaign), and a teenager or two.  We could show some
of the state's ads and Pierce could release his new data.

There are several dangers, however.  First, Stan Glantz of UC San
Francisco -- a tobacco critic who thinks we don't,go far enough -- will
likely invite himself, or make negative statements to the press if he is
not invited.   Second, there's a draft evaluation of California's tobacco
control program which shows mixed results -- an event like this could
bring it to light.  Third, the controversy over the state banning of
smoking in bars could resurrect itself (apparently the Assembly has voted
to restore smoking to bars but the Senate has not).  And finally, the
state is about to launch a new ad campaign encouraging young people to
avoid cigars.

Thus, I would recommend that we try to use the Joe Camel/Marlboro Man
data, but at a different venue.
