Education Weekly

National Testing: We have sent you a detailed memo reviewing the current status of the testing
initiative and our strategy for the next several weeks. Since that memo was written, there have
been a number of additional staff-level meetings involving the appropriations conferees in which
possible compromises have been raised. Porter is floating a compromise that would enable test
development to proceed under NAGB's control, but would delay implementation until a fixed
percentage of states had signed up for the tests. Bill Bennett and Checker Finn have floated a
proposal that also allows test development to proceed under NAGB's control, requires NAGB to
make the test specifications public by a fixed deadline, and enables implementation to proceed in
FY 99 either through specific authorization or simply by appropriating the funds necessary for
implementation. We believe the BennettlFinn proposal is the more favorable for us, though it is
not yet clear which, if either, will gain sufficient Republican support to be adopted in conference.

Charter Schools: Frank Riggs and Tim Romer are developing a bill, to be marked up next week,
that would amend the existing charter schools statute. The primary intent is to provide
incentives for states to enact stronger charter schools laws -- laws which place few or no limits
on the number of charter schools that can be established, which provide for strong accountability
as well as maximum flexibility, and which treat charter schools as separate local school districts.
The draft legislation would also enable charter schools to receive start-up funds for five years,
instead of three as under current law. The Education Department has been supportive of the
purposes of the bill in meetings with Riggs and Romer, and has also expressed significant
reservations about specific provisions in the preliminary drafts. The Department is concerned
that several of the proposed changes could increase the administrative burdens on charter
schools, reduce the targeting of Title 1 funds in large districts with charter schools, and reduce
the funds available for new charter schools by allowing those already in existence to keep their
funding for five rather than three years. We expect this legislation will move through
committee relatively quickly. While the current program is working well and does not need to
be amended, we believe we should support this bill if the Education Department's reservations
are addressed.
