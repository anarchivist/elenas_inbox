TEXT:
I talked to Josh about possible language for our letters back to members
that would commit us to help farmers in regards to the negative effects of
the lawsuit. Below is what we came up with.  I propose we put something
like this in our letters back to Robb, Etheridge, McIntyre, etc.  I think
I should check with Robb and Etheridge's guy, and farmer representatives,
and see if this does move the ball a bit in our direction.


Per our discussion:

The President recognizes that tobacco farmers and their communities must
be protected from the effects of any and all tobacco litigation. As was
done in the settlement with the state attorneys general, we believe that
in connection with any judgment or settlement of Federal claims there
should be established a fund to protect them from the unintended
consequences of that lawsuit.  The Administration commits that, as the
Federal litigation proceeds to judgment or settlement, that the
Administration will make sure that adequate funds are set aside by
legislation to ensure the financial security of tobacco farmers and their
communities.  We would of course develop this legislation in close
consultation with you and other members of Congress, and with represent
atives of tobacco farmers, their families, and communities.
