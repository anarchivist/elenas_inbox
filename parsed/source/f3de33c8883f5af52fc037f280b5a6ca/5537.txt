TEXT:
This went to Depts. last night for review by lpm today so it has yet to
reflect their comments.  Given that they all have been making alot, if you
want to see those, we can get you a draft by 2ish.  I don't know if you
spoke with Chris after about 9pm last night, but apparently Sperling
thinks that all of the health memos should go in simultaneously by COB
today.

On another topic, per Chris's instructions, I wrote a note to Josh and his
staff person saying that you / Chris and I might want to set up a meeting
late this morning to go over tables for tobacco meeting later. Chris
wasn't quite sure how you wanted to deal with this but he thought if
nothing else we should put people on notice that we want to see the tables
earlier than just being shown them at the meeting. Let me know what to do.

Thanks, Jeanne
