Tobacco firms preparing
                  growers compensation plan

                    Wednesday, November 18, 1998

                    BY PETER HARDIN
                    Times-Dispatch Washington Correspondent

                    WASHINGTON -- The tobacco companies are
                    nearing completion of a plan to compensate growers
                    in the event a $206 billion national tobacco
                    settlement is approved, a leading tobacco
                    representative said yesterday.

                    "The companies are meeting every day to come up with the
right numbers,"
                    said lawyer J. Phil Carlton of North Carolina.

                  "We are in the process of working up a concrete plan
that we will take to
                  the [tobacco-state] governors," he said.

                  "I would anticipate we'll be meeting with those
governors around the first
                  week of December and be prepared to roll [a plan] out in
a very specific
                  way," 'Carlton said.

                  On Monday, Carlton talked with tobacco-grower
representatives in a
                  conference call, outlining some of the companies' ideas.

                  "We want to be certain that for the next eight, 10, or
12 years, whatever is
                  ultimately decided, that the grower community does not
have to suffer
                  financially as a result" of the proposed settlement, Ca
rlton explained during a
                  phone interview yesterday.


                  Although Carlton would not discuss any dollar amounts
being considered, he
                  said the compensation plan would be "substantial" and
would "not [be]
                  subject to the legislative process~ It's private money. N
ot a grant to the
                  government."

                     The tobacco companies are considering a plan to have
each affected

                  governor form a committee or board to handle
distributing the grower
                  payments.

                     Carlton, a retired North Carolina Supreme Court justice
representing the
                  companies, also has been in touch with tobacco-state
governors, including
                  Virginia's Jim Gilmore.

                     The multi-state settlement announced Monday would not
make payments to
                  growers. But it requires that the industry and the
leaf-producing state officials
                  meet within 30 days to discuss how to compensate farmers
for declining
                  tobacco demand.

                     Andrew Q. Shepherd, a Lunenburg County, Va.,   tobacco
grower who
                  listened to the conference call, said he thought the
tobacco companies were
                  heading in the right direction.

                     But he'd like growers to know a lot more before Virginia
decides whether to
                     sign on to the accord,   said Shepherd, a vice president
of the Flue-Cured
                     Tobacco Cooperative Stabilization Corp., based in 'Ral
eigh.

                     States face a deadline Friday for deciding whether to
join the proposed
                     pact, and the tobacco companies are expected to indicate
by Monday
                    whether enough states are aboarq to seal the 25-year
deal.

                  Virginia, a leading tobacco-growing state, produces leaf
with annual sales of
                  nearly $200 million.

                  Not including any side agreement that is crafted to
protect growers, the state
                  would receive about $4 billion over 25 years from the
tobacco companies if
                  it signs.
