TEXT:
BR:

Spoke to Rahm about juvie and crime meetings.   He spoke to Joel about not
appointing conferees on the juvie-related bill.   Also, he thought it was a
good idea for us starting to convene our own smaller crime meeting.   Is
there any day that works particularly well for you? Also, it's hard not
have at least 10 people there.  Do you think this is too big, and maybe we
should just focus on one very senior staffer?

possible attendees could include:

           DOJ -- Ann Harkins, Nick Gess, Ricki, Grace
           Treasury -- Mike Froman, Liz Bresee, David Medina, Beth Weaver
           ONDCP -- Chuck Blanchard
           OMB -- David Haun
