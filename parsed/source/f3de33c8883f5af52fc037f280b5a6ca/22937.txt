     TEXT:
     ... and send the President a Daily Brief while he's traveling
     domestically. That's right, today (2/26) we'll send the President a memo
     overviewing the "hot" issues we're tracking here at the White House.
     (Note: these issues should be time sensitive topics, less presing items
     can be put in your weekly reports.)   All bullets must be in to me by 4pm
     this afternoon.

     (If you were wondering why the W.A.C. reference in the subject header,
     it's to honor the President's delivery of his foreign policy speech at the
     World Affairs Council. To satisfy your never ending data desires, I've
     included additional WAC information below.)



     Located in downtown San Francisco, the World Affairs Council is actively
     involved in informing the public about international issues. WAC of
     Northern California was established in 1947 as a non-profit organization.
     It does not "take positions on issues," but instead promotes knowledge of
     and encourages discussion of foreign affairs.  Each year, WAC hosts
     hundreds of forums, seminars, study groups, and conferences. In
     cooperation with Stanford University, the Council supports the Bay Area
     Global Education Program, which provides about 3,000 educators with
     "intensive" training on foreign affairs.


WAC offers publications, services, and access to its 6,500-volume library
for members. Memberships range from $55-$10,000, depending on the level
of involvement desired. Students may join at a reduced rate of $25;
educators pay $35.  Students members get in all regular programs free of
charge (regular programs are served without food). Discounted rates are
provided for all other programs and conferences. Full-time students are
eligible for scholarships to attend most of WAC's lectures, programs, and
conferences free of charge.
