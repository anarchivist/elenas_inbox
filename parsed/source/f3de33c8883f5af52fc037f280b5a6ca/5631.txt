 1997 IMPORTANT YEAR IN EQUAL RIGHTS BATTLE

 Task Force Releases "Capital Gains & Losses: A State by State
 Review of Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender, and HIV/AIDS
 Related Legislation in 1997"

 Washington, DC---December 10, 1997 -- Today the National Gay and
 Lesbian Task Force released its annual survey of state legislation.
 Capital Gains and Losses: A.State by State Review of Gay, Lesbian~
 Bisexual, Transgender, and HIV/AIDS Related Legislation in 1997
 is a telling picture of the prominence of states in the national
 struggle occurring over the rights of gay, lesbian, bisexual, and
 transgender  (GLBT) .people.

 Since the Task Force began tracking activity in state legislatures


in 1995, the number of GLBT related measures has increased each
year. The intensity of these activities also remains high.

"1997 was an unequivocal step forward on our march to justice,"
 stated Kerry Lobel, Task Force executive director.   "We've long
known that the states and local communities are not only the
barometer for the state of gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender
rights in America; they are the eye of the storm," 9-dded Lobel.

New Hampshire and Maine's passage of comprehensive civil rights
laws for gays, lesbians, and bisexuals, Washington State's statewide
ballot initiative to ban employment discrimination based on sexual
orientation - the first such measure ever in the country - were
some of the year's highlights. (Washington's initiative was defeated,
and Maine's law will be put to a vote on February 10th.)

Also, the passage in 1997 of major domestic partnership initiatives
in the state of Hawaii and the cities of San Francisco and Chicago,
coupled with a record number of favorable domestic partner bills
introduced, reflects the growing importance of family issues in
the GLBT community.  The continued push forward for the freedom to
marry during the past year was also a critical component in the
effort for full recognition of GLBT families.

In the meantime, the right wing's rallying around a homophobic state
adoption worker in Texas is indicative of the attacks on GLBT
families that occurred in state legislatures in 1997 and foretells
a likely increase in such attacks during the 1998 state legislative
session.

1997 Summary Findings

The Task Force Tracked 248 pieces of legislation (compared with
160 in 1996) :

?   128 pieces of legislation classified as favorable appeared
in 38 states (compared with 61 in 25 states in 1996) .

?   120 pieces of legislation classified as unfavorable appeared
in 44 states (compared with 99 in 40 states in 1996) .

?   When marriage bills are removed, the figures show 124 favorable
measures and 74 unfavorable measures (compared with 56 and 50,
respectively, in 1996) .

?   The 46 anti-marriage bills represented 38% of the unfavorable
bills introduced, and 53% of all the unfavorable that were passed
into law.

?   HIV/AIDS measures represented the largest percentage (23%)
of the favorable measures introduced as well as passed (38%).
