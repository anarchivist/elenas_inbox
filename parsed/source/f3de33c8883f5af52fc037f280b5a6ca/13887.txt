 TEXT:
 I have one more draft that is slightly more comprehensive than the previous
 versions. This draft was prepared by Todd Stern for the President's signature.
 Is this OK?

 ******************************************************************
 Thank you for sharing your thoughts on securities litigation
 reform.
 The enactment into law of H.R. 1058, the securities litigation
 reform act, creates both opportunities and potential pitfalls for
 United States securities markets. While some of the act's
 provisions are likely to increase the amount of information
 available to investors, and thus enhance market efficiency, a
 number of other sections may reduce the ability of investors to
 seek redress for damages resulting from arguably fraudulent
 activities.
 I believe it is important that the Securities and Exchange
 Commission, as the government agency directly charged with
 implementing securities laws and protecting investors, monitors
 the execution and impact of this legislation carefully -- and
 increases enforcement and rulemaking activities if necessary.
 The budget plan I have submitted to Congress authorizes and
 expands fees assessed upon transactions in the securities and
 bond markets. Combined with future appropriations, these fees
 will improve the Commission's ability to carry out its duties.
 I also believe it will be useful for the Commission to advise me
 and the Congress within a year about the impact of the Act on the
 effectiveness of the securities laws and on investor protection,
 as well as on the extent and nature of any litigation under the
 Act. In the event there are indications that portions of the act
 are having a negative impact on the integrity of our markets, I
 hope that the Commission will recommend amendments.
 It is my sincere hope that the benefits of the Act will far
 outweigh any problems. As we seek to develop thoughtful,
 balanced reforms to our nation's securities laws, I appreciate
 your involvement.
