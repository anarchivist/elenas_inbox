            Senate Kills Education Accounts

            By Robert Greene
            AP Education Writer
            Wednesday, November 5, 1997; 3:29 p.m. EST


            WASHINGTON (AP) -- Standardized reading and math tests will be given
            to American schoolchildren under a tentative agreement reached
            Wednesday by President Clinton and congressional Republicans. But the
            tests may not be the ones Clinton wanted.

            Clinton agreed with House Republican leaders on a compromise that
            would delay test availability until 2000. But he cautioned that more
            work would be needed to make the deal final. And the chief House
            negotiator, Rep. Bill Goodling, R-Pa., said a number of details
            remained to be worked out.

            Clinton said the agreement should accomplish his goal of ensuring
     that
            fourth-graders are tested in reading and eighth-graders in math using
            identifiable national standards.

            "My concern was to have some sort of clearly accepted standard of
            excellence that all our children would be expected to meet in reading
            and math, I I Clinton told reporters after meeting at the White House
            with Goodling, chairman of the House Education and Workforce
            Committee.


            Under the agreement, the government may continue limited development
            of the voluntary national tests it wanted to give starting in 1999.
            However, no field trials of the new tests would be allowed.

            Instead, the independent National Academy of Sciences would conduct a
            study to determine whether existing state tests and widely used
            commercial tests can be adapted and compared for the ·same purpose.

            Clinton said that should ease Goodling's concern    that the tests would
            needlessly duplicate existing measures that have    identified which
            students and schools have troubles·. The millions   of dollars spent on
            testing should be spent on training teachers and    other activities, he
            says.

            "We've basically gotten all the information we need,"     Goodling
    said.
            "We know that we have problems, and we know where the problems are.
            Ours has to be an effort to try to solve those problems."

            The administration says there are no assurances that state standards
            are as rigorous as the proposed national ones. Also, many of the
            existing commercial tests rate students against a moving average
    score
            instead of a fixed standard.

            The study should take six months. It would have to be complete before
            the administration could implement its tests if existing ones cannot
            be adapted. But no congressional authority would be needed.

            The testing proposal, the lead item on Clinton's education agenda,
    met
            fierce opposition in the House and had a growing core of opponents in
            the Senate.

            Conservatives fear the tests will lead to more federal control of
            education, and the black and Hispanic caucuses in the House contend
            they will be used to discriminate against minorities.

            Part of the agreement puts control of the test development in the
            National Assessment Governing Board, a bipartisan group created by
            Congress.

            Senate Democrats were cautious but supportive. Many of the elements
            were proposed by Sen. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., an administration ally
    on
            testing. Bingaman said the deal should satisfy everyone as long as
    the
            study is not used to delay or obstruct the voluntary tests.

            "If all sides stick to this compromise, it will be a tremendous
            victory for parents, teachers, students and all those who care about
            the quality of education in this country," he said.

            An agreement, if accepted on the Hill, removes the only obstacle to
            passing an $80.2 pillion spending bill for the Education, Labor and
            Health and Human Services departments.

            More than a month late, the bill includes spending increases for
            medical research, education aid, including Pell Grants for college
            students and Head Start.
                                                                            Page 3 of3



     Clinton was eager to deal, Republican aides said, as he tried to get
     support for legislation that would enhance his power to negotiate
     free-trade agreements.
