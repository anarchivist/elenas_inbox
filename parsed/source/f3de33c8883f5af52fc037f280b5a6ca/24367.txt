DRAFT -- NOT FOR RELEASE
August 5, 1998
(House)

H.R. 3736 - Workforce Improvement and Protection Act of 1998
(Smith (R) Texas and 3 cosponsors)

The Administration strongly opposes House passage H.R. 3736, the
D&Workforce Improvement and Protection Act of 1998,08 as amended.  If this
bill is presented to the President, his senior advisors will recommend
that he veto it.

This bill is intended to respond to a skills shortage in the information
technology industry by increasing the annual cap on the number of
temporary visas for foreign 0&specia1ty08 workers under the H-1B program.
Regrettably, H.R. 3736, as amended, emphasizes providing opportunities for
foreign workers rather than providing opportunities for and protecting
u.S. workers.

The Administration supports sound and balanced legislative efforts to
address shortages of skilled workers within certain sectors of our
economy.  The most important way to increase the availability of skilled
workers must be to improve the skills of u.S. workers and ensure that
employers seek u.s. workers first. While it may be necessary in the
short-term to increase the number of visas for temporary foreign workers,
this must only be done in conjunction with additional efforts to increase
the skill level of u.S. workers and meaningful reforms to the H-1B program.

Although this bill provides for certain employers to attest to recruitment
and lay-off provisions, the attestations are too weak to adequately
protect u.S. workers and far too many employers are exempt from their
obligations. Moreover, the bill, as structured, will not generate
sufficient funds for increased training opportunities for u.S. workers.
Finally, rather than strengthening enforcement to prevent employer abuses
of the H-1B program, H.R. 3736, as amended, undermines some of the
programO,s important enforcement provisions.

The Administration wants to work with the Congress to develop a bill that
addresses the growing demand for highly skilled workers, while effectively
protecting and promoting the interests of u.S. workers and enhancing the
international competitiveness of important U~S. industries.
