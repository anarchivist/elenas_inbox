TEXT:
I asked John Monahan for HHS's info on how often they have granted
subminimum wage in the past. He gave me the same general, non-quantified
response we have gotten in the past: all CWEP workfare had to meet
minimum wage; some AWEP workfare did not; and some waivers were mushy on
the topic.   I assume you want me to follow up and ask them to quantify
this?   (Stacy, have you asked HHS for this as well?)
