We (Dallas Smith, B. Wooley and I) met with the SC farmers group.  They
had just come from a meeting with Hollings.  They were a pro-buyout
group. Some grew tobacco, some didn't. They said Hollings kept his cards
close to his chest and just said he was pro-farmer. We'll·tell Minyon we
did the meeting.

TEXT:
Mangus (Ford) called back saying he would be fine i f we can pull off the
compromise from the last e-mail. Robb's staffer is meeting with his
farmers today.  He is pretty adament about needing a cut in the price of
tobacco.  He will report back tomorrow on whether Robb .can move a bit
more. Mangus feels that if we can get a compromise we would have a strong
shot at the 4 D tobacco Senators signing on and getting some of the
crucial D congressmen (Baesler etc.).

The mood is somewhat more pessimistic on Faircloth arid Helms. Staffers
think Helms and Faircloth either: (1) believe there will not be a tobacco
bill and would rather not deal with the issue until they have to; and (2)
they are not pro-tax and don't want to be in a position of supporting a
tax. They feel McCain has been muddled in dealing with these senators --
not indicating what he is willing to do.  McCain has indicated to Ford
previously that he will continue to use the LEAF act in his bill, or
perhaps the $2 billion Conrad pot of money.   Senator Ford feels that
means the issue will get resolved on the floor because there will not be a
consensus before then.

Finally, NC farmer representatives are gravitating towards a buyout for
farmers who choose it and a system where remaining farmers can still
sell/rent their quota -- a position currently not represented at the table
(Robb doesn't want quota to be sold). Lugar has not had luck in moving
his·bill in the Ag. committee with the tobacco senators. McConnell is
actually a free marketer but can't say it for political reasons, Helms and
Lugar of course don't get along.  I don't know where Coverdall is.

I've continued to press Robb to come in on a joint bill. Another step
might be for you to call Governor Hunt -- the NC farm bureau is important
in this all. Since the NC Senators aren't negotiating perhaps we can get
Hunt to represent their interests and ultimately deliver their commitment.
