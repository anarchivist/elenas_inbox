                               Q&As on Tobacco -- AI Hunt Interview
                                         April 28, 1998

     Q:   Do you really think you'll get a tobacco bill this year?

     A:   I believe we have an historic opportunity to pass bipartisan legislation this year which
          both contains the elements necessary to reduce teen smoking. And I'm going to do
          everything I can to put politics aside and pass legislation that will achieve that objective.
          Senator McCain's legislation, which passed the Commerce Committee by a 19-1 vote, is
          a strong step in the right direction on the road to passing comprehensive tobacco
          legislation. It shows real momentum in both parties to pass effective,
          comprehensive tobacco legislation this year.

     Q:   Isn't the McCain bill a big government, big tax proposal?

     A:   No. What this bill does is to attack the problem of youth smoking comprehensively, as
          all experts say we need to do, by combining strong provisions on price, penalties, .
          advertising and access, and FDA jurisdiction. Although we have some differences with
          Senator McCain, he also recognizes the need to move forward on all these fronts to
          reduce youth smoking. That's not about big government. It's about sensible, bipartisan
          steps to dramatically reduce youth smoking.

     Q.   But won't the McCain bill create 17 new federal bureaucracies?

     A.   No -- this isn't about big government. What the bill does is to ensure that the federal
          government has the authority to regulate tobacco products in order to reduce youth
          smoking, as well as the ability to target tobacco revenues to strong public health and
          research efforts. The so-called "bureaucracies" that the industry is now complaining
          about are nothing more than what's necessary to protect the public health in this way -- to
          ensure that cigarettes are not sold to minors, to promote effective education, and to
          encourage smoking cessation. The proof that this is an industry con job is clear: almost
          all these provisions were in the June 1997 proposed settlement put forward by 41 state
          attorneys general, which the industry agreed to. The industry is criticizing these
          provisions now only because the political tide has turned against it, and certain other
          aspects of the legislation have gotten stronger.

     Q:   Are you worried about the bill creating a black market?

     A:   We think we can minimize black market activity through a system similar to the one
          that's been in place for alcoholic beverages for over sixty years by: 1) creating a "closed"
          distribution system for" tobacco products so that only licensed entities can sell or buy
          products; 2) clearly branding packages for export, to prevent them from being diverted;
          and 3) establishing and enforcing penalties and other actions for violators. Senator
          McCain's bill largely addresses these issues, and we are working with him on technical
          changes.

Q:   Wouldn't this big government scheme extend the reach of the federal government to
     every mom-and-pop grocery store or 7-II?

A:   No. We are comfortable with a system that places primary responsibility for licensing
     retailers on state governments, as the McCain bill does. The important thing is to work
     with Congress to devise a scheme that will facilitate the effort to prevent smuggling,
     while not burdening retailers. The Administration will work with Congress, and the
     retailers themselves, on this issue.

Q:   Won't the McCain bill bankrupt the companies? Lots of WaU Street analysts say it
     will.

A:   We don't want to put the tobacco companies out of business. We just want to put them
     out of the business of selling cigarettes to kids. A central feature of comprehensive
     tobacco legislation is to ensure that most of the payments made by the tobacco companies
     are passed on to price, in order to reduce youth smoking. As a result, there will be at
     most a modest impact on the profitability of the tobacco companies. This is also an
     industry with significant cash flow and net assets that will allow it to easily absorb this
     modest profit decline. The operating earnings ofRJR, Philip Morris, and Loews last
     year were $18 billion. Even RJR, the most highly leveraged firm in this industry, had a
     $1.5 billion operating profit for its domestic tobacco business, and has over $4 billion in
     net assets from its Nabisco stock holdings. The only real risk of bankruptcy comes from
     losing a rash of lawsuits in court.
