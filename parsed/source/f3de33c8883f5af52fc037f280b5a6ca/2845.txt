 TEXT:
 Barry will be emailing a revised version of the Ed and Workforce letter
 which may still have FLSA language we consider objectionable (see below) ,
 in which case we will have to work directly with Lew or his assistant to
 change it.

 There will also be revised language complaining about the committee's
 proposal to distribute 95% of funds by formula, which we will need to
 examine.

 For how long will you be around tonight?

 Subject: Screw-up on Archer SAP

 We just learned that a very bad sentence on minimum wage that was not in
 the Shaw letter was added to the Archer SAP at the last minute:

 "In addition, under this proposal, working welfare recipients will be
 deprived of the protection of laws addressing employment discrimination,
 unsafe workplaces,child labor, overtime, and family and medical leave."

 We had clearly told OMB what we wanted it to say -- the first draft of the
 Shaw letter had language like the above, and we complained.  Then both the
 Shaw letter and earlier drafts of the Archer letter reflected our wishes.
 According to Barry White, though, this was added at the last minute, he
 thinks between Jack Lew and Martha Foley.  I guess this means we have to
 insist on seeing these one last time before they go out the door.  You
 guys would have to make this point to Jack Lew for it to really stick.

 Barry is asking Jack Lew his opinion on whether this sentence should be
 dropped from all future versions.  I assume we would want it dropped,
 despite the awkwardness of having it appear and then disappear?
