Subject:         shalala Memo

A few weeks back we sent up a memo from Sec'y Shalala on HHS' response to
the president's July 1998 directive on the public availability of tobacco
documents.  Do you have a view about whether the president really needs to
see this? We're inclined not to send it in, but defer to you guys.
