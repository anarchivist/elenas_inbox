TEXT:
I just got a call from Kevin Moran in Don Baer's shop.   He said:

-- Baer has continued to ask for the paper that was discussed last week at
the meeting Bruce and I attended; Kevin has has told him that the two of
you are reviewing;

-- It is likely that there will be a follow-up on "the education meeting"
(seems like there are a lot of those) this afternoon

-- He thinks Baer is likely to be looking for paper in advance of that
meeting.

Please let me know what--if anything--you want me to do on this; if
necessary, I could go back to cutting out all of the "strategy" elements
of it and just include the various events.

Thanks.
