TEXT:
Attached is a new copy of the proposed OMB letter.  Its most significant
change is the inclusion of veto language.  Please return comments to me by
no later that 3pm today.  (The only change in the memo to the President is
to indicate that DOJ's letter will address only constitutional issues.
The previous version stated DOJ would reference constitutional and law
enforcement concerns)      .
