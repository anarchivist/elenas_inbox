Esteemed colleagues: for your review for tomorrow's quickie event on child
safety locks.  Yes, in case you didn't know, in addition to hosting Top
Cop honorees, 9 major gun manufacturers and the American Sport Shooting
Council will be attending.  They've grown tired of taking Rahm's calls and
agreed to provide child safety locks w/every handgun sold.

    President Clinton: Supporting Law Enforcement, Saving Lives
                          October 9, 1997

·   At today's "Top Cop" event to honor 18 outstanding law enforcement
    officials for their heroism and exemplary service, President Clinton
    announced two initiatives strongly supported by law enforcement:

    1)    Child Safety Locks. Embracing the President's proposal. 9 major
          gun manufacturers announced their support for providing child
          safety locks with every handgun sold; and
    2)    College Scholarships. Building on a legislation he signed at last·
          year's "Top Cop" event, the President announced his support for a
          bill -- proposed by the National Association of Police Organizations
          (NAPO) -- to make college scholarships available to the children of
          slain state and local public safety officers.

·   The Need for Child Safety Locks. A recent study by the Police Foundation
    estimated that Americans keep almost 31 million firearms loaded and
    unlocked in their homes. Other studies estimate that easy access to
    these weapons result in 1,500 children (ages 14 and under) being treated
    in hospital emergency rooms every year for unintentional firearms-related
    injuries. Child safety locks are a cheap and effective solution to this
    problem.

·   President Clinton: Leading by Example. By including child safety locks in
    his Anti-Gang and youth Violence Strategy, the President initiated a
    national debate on this issue. He proposed legislation to require federal
    gun dealers to provide these safety devices with every gun sold, and
    directed all federal agencies to provide them with all firearms issued to
    federal law enforcement officers. By October 15th, all federal law
    enforcement officers will have been issued child safety locks.

·   Firearms Industry: Following the President's Lead. At today's event, 9
    major gun manufacturers -- Glock, Beretta, Taurus, H&R, Heckler & Koch,
    Smith and Wesson, Mossberg & Sons, SigArms and the Eddie Mahie Co. --
    and the American Sport Shooting Council announced their support for
    providing child safety locks with all of their handguns.

·   Honoring Law Enforcement. Last year, President Clinton signed legislation
    to provide college scholarships of up to $4,848 per year for the children of
    slain federal law enforcement officers. Today, the President announced
    his support for NAPO's proposal to expand this benefit to include the
    children of state and local public safety officers who are killed in the line
of duty.
