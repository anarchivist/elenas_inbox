MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM           BRUCE REED

SUBJECT               Add On To The Micro Credit Awards Event

       On Thursday, January 30, 1997 you are scheduled to take part in the micro credit
ceremony in the East Room. The First Lady and Secretary Rubin, with you, will present the first
annual Presidential Awards in Excellence for domestic micro credit programs. You will be
honoring seven successful micro-entrepreneurs. A reception will follow.

        In addition, you will be able to make two related announcements -- a new
public-private partnership to pursue highly aggressive welfare to work efforts, and a commitment
to increase CDFI funding. The announcements will emphasize new private sector involvement
and funding for welfare to work efforts, including microenterprise. The public-private partnership
will give you the opportunity to highlight another corporation -- Chase Bank -- stepping up to
meet your welfare to work challenge to corporate America.

1.     Announce the Chase Manhattan Bank/Rockefeller Foundation/HUD Welfare-to- Work $9.0
       Million Dollar Partnership.

         Chase Manhattan Bank and the Rockefeller Foundation have teamed with HUD in a
three-way partnership to plan and fund long-term private sector welfare-to-work demonstrations
designed to raise employment rates by as much as 20-30 percent in small urban
neighborhoods. Chase and Rockefeller have committed a total of $7.5 million to the project
along with an initial $1.5 million commitment from HUD. The Rockefeller Foundation expects
to raise an additional $7.5 million from corporations, foundations, and government agencies.

        Organizations in 15 urban communities throughout the country will be selected to
participate in these demonstrations. Systematic research will monitor activities and community
outcomes to determine whether dramatic increases in employment can be achieved.

         Funding will go in part to community organizations committed to undertaking intensive
training and private sector job placement efforts with four common elements: work incentives;
state-of-the-art job placement and retention services; expanded access to capital for neighborhood
residents and business owners; and a creation of a community culture that supports work.
Funding will also go to Public Housing Authorities in 5-6 cities to train and place public
housing residents in jobs while simultaneously modifying welfare and housing polices to
encourage work.
                                                                         Hex-Dump Conversion


       Peter Goldmark, President of the Rockefeller Foundation, the Vice Chair of Chase Bank,
and a high level representative from HUD will be present.

2.     Reiterate commitment to increase the Community Development Financial
       Institutions (CDFI) Fund budget.

        Your new budget includes a $1 billion increase over five years for the CDFI Fund, which
coordinates the Administration's numerous microenterprise programs. The exact dollar amount
for our FY '98 budget has not yet become public.
