Bruce and Elena--

Mike asked me to check with you and see if you are comfortable with the
following lanaguage as an insert for Riley's reply to Wade Henderson with
respect to the Spanish language testing issue.  Does this look ok to you?
Thanks.

There are a number of high quality native language reading tests, and at
least one that, according to its publisher, is by design based on the NAEP
4th grade reading framework and achievement levels and yields individual
scores reported in terms of the NAEP achievement levels. Any district
that, at its option, wishes to test LEP students in reading comprehension
in terms that are consistent with NAEP, and to do so in coordination with
its administration and reporting of the national reading test, already can
do so.
