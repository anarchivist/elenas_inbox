TEXT:
Here are some outstanding issues on the Equal Pay Event for Wednesday:

(1) we should touch base with Karen Tramantano to make sure she is fine
with a woman highlighting the comparable worth problem, but not the
solution;

 (2) decide whether we want a business on the panel. Ann Lewis didn't
think that a business would emphasize a call to action enough. However,
I think I might be able to get the business with whom I spoke to support
the Daschle legislation.    I just have to double check with them. If we
don't use a business, we could use the African American basketball coach
at Howard University who the VP mentioned at the event last year;

(3) let me know whether I can extend an invitation to the professor at
MIT.
