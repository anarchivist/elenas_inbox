        PRINTER FONT 12 - POINT- COURIER
        3/27/96
        From: Chuck Konigsberg
        Following is a draft response to Sen. Byrd for a 3/21 item veto
        letter to POTUS.    [WH/LA asked OMB to prepare a response from
        POTUS]  Byrd's letter to POTUS states that he is "unalterably
        opposed to giving any President" enhanced rescission authority;
        he also states that the delegation would do "great harm to the
        constitutional balance." Much of the letter pertains to Byrd's
        concern that the 1997 effective date is "blatantly partisan" .
        Let me know by Thursday Noon if you have any revisions to the
        attached draft.     Otherwise, I will pass along to WH/LA.  Thanks.
        [Paul-
        O
        -is the sentence referring to his time as Governor
        consistent w/ previous campaign statements?]

        DRAFT-
        o
        -NOT FOR RELEASE
        Dear Senator Byrd:
                I appreciated receiving your letter of March 21, 1996
        expressing concerns about the conference agreement on the
        line


    o
    -item veto.
            I am mindful of your strong, and deeply held convictions on
    this issue. However, as you know, the line
    o
    -item veto is
    something I have consistently supported over the years.  I had
    the authority as a Governor and found it to be a useful tool for
    controlling the budget.  I am pleased that House and Senate
    conferees on S. 4 have reported a conference agreement which
    delegates authority to cancel certain discretionary and direct
    spending, as well as limited tax benefits.
            I must respectfully disagree with your concerns about the
    effect of this legislation on the constitutional balance of
    powers. While the conference agreement delegates to the
    President a useful measure of cancellation authority, that
    delegation has been carefully limited by the very specific
    definitions of spending and tax benefits. Moreover, the Congress
    has retained the authority to consider disapproval legislation
    under expedited and highly privileged procedures.
            Regarding the effective date of the new authority, I would,
    of course, have preferred that the new authority be effective
    upon enactment. Nevertheless, I am pleased that the House and
    Senate have overcome their differences and produced a conference
    agreement which delegates effective cancellation authority.
            Thank you again for expressing your concerns to me about
    this important legislation.

                                                    Sincerely,

                                                    BC
