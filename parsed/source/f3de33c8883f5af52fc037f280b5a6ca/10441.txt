TEXT:
I spoke with the women's groups as we discussed, and, as we suspected,
they agreed that an extra $10 million in the Title X budget would make a
huge difference.   I reported to Dan Mendleson that we strongly recommend a
$10 million increase, and he said that he would do all he could to make it
happen.   Since the last time he and I spoke, it sounds as if the budget
contraints may have gotten worse, but Dan said he would do all he could to
meet that mark. He also said that if this recommendation were to emerge
on the DPC Initiatives list, it would be guaranteed the funding.    While I
told Dan I thought that would be difficult to do, I promised to raise it
with you.

On the Title X program uses (i.e. the male involvement and abstinence
programs), I think that .the problems may be quite entrenched, as it sounds
as if the women's groups and HHS have not seen eye to eye on grant awards
for some time.  I'll report further soon.

On FMLA, I understand that there was some concern raised at the New
Initiatives meeting about pushing for FMLA expansion in the context of the
SOTU or another venue.  Jen and I think it might be useful for you to call
a Deputies meeting soon on FMLAexpansion, bringing in a few relevant
agencies and WH Leg. Affairs to discuss strategy. Do you agree?
