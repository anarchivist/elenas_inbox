       The President will three commencement addresses, with a central theme of preparing
America for the 21st Century. Each address will focus on a separate subject vital to the
American people in the 21 st Century, but also return to a broader message: the need to take
advantage of the forces of change, so that they work for us, not against us.

·      Morgan State - Sunday, May 18 - Science and Technology. Will reflect on the new
       wonders of science and technology and the Information Age -- but also the ethical
       dilemmas they pose and the need to harness them so that they work for us, not against us
       (e.g. computers vs. freedom of speech, cloning vs. natural selection).

·      West Point -- Saturday, May 31- Foreign Policy VisionJNATO Enlargement. Will
       be one ofthe major foreign policy addresses of second term -- presenting the President's
       vision of the demands of American leadership in the 21 st Century, making a strong case
       for NATO enlargement.

       [Note: two days earlier in the Hague, the President will deliver a major address to the
       people of Europe on the future of American-European relations. West Point will be the
       President's major address to the American people on the same subject.]

·      DC San Diego - Saturday, June 14 -- Race and Reconciliation. Will focus on the
       need to remain strong as One America -- harnessing the increasing diversity of our nation
       as our greatest strength.
