TEXT:
The message of the May 2 event will be something like: we continue to
make encouraging though modest progress at reducing the problem of teenage
pregnancy (teen birth rates have gone down four years in a row and new
data will soon be released to show that teen sexual activity is
declining). However, this is still a daunting problem that needs are
continued support.

What we know now is that this problem has no single solution, but rather
many solutions which are being implemented in communities around the
country. Every community has its varied approach to teen pregnancy
prevention because every community has its own unique set of circumstances
and beliefs that drive that approach.   The key to really making a
difference in this problem is at the local level through individualized
community-based approaches.  Today, we are happy to recognize 12 such
community-based programs, each making a difference but doing it their own
way.

Re: releasing new data at or before the May 2 event

Melanne and I had a conversation with Melissa about whether or not to
release the HHS report and/or the grants. We decided to release neither.

--Because the new data in the report is underwhelming    though it does
show some progress -- Melanne and Melissa would not release the report at
the event but would say that a report will soon be released that shows
modest success toward the goal of reducing teen pregnancy.

--On the grants side, on May 1, Sec. Shalala will be at an out of town
event were she will talk about girls and the media and particularly focus
on teenage pregnancy and smoking as they relate to young girls.  There she
will announce the Secretary's girl power grants for 9-14 year olds, that
in part focus on teen pregnancy prevention. The only other grants we could
announce would be the abstinence grants, which are a little too


controversial for this event.  Instead, Melanne will have the First Lady
talk about Sec. Shalala's announcement and reiterate the importance of
building the self-esteem of young girls as a way to prevent early
pregnancy ..

Questions/commments?
