Court Rules on Welfare Benefits

                             By LAURIE ASSEO Associated Press Writer

                             WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today ruled
                             states cannot pay lower welfare benefits to new
residents than
                             to longtime residents.

                             The justices' 7-2 decision said California's
limit on benefits for
                             new residents violates the constitutional right
to travel.

                             "Citizens of the United States, whether rich or
poor, have the
                             right to choose to be citizens of the state
wherein they reside, ' ,
                             Justice John Paul Stevens wrote for the court.
"The states,
                             however, do not have any right to select their
citizens. ' ,

                             Stevens said,   "The state's legitimate interest
in saving money
                             provides no justification for its decision to
discriminate among
                             equally eligible citizens. ' ,

                             In other action today, the court:

                             --Agreed to judge the validity of a federal law
that closes state
                            motor vehicle records to the public. The
justices will use a
                            dispute from South Carolina to decide, sometime
in 2000,
                            whether Congress unlawfully usurped state
governments'
                            authority when it enacted the Driver's Privacy
protection Act of
                            1994.
,.

                                  --Made it harder for federal judges to strike
     down election
                                  districts as products of unlawful racial
     gerrymandering. The
                                  unanimous ruling in a North Carolina case could
     have great
                                  influence on redistricting disputes nationwide
     after the 2000
                                  census.

                                  --Left intact a million-dollar libel award
     against the tabloid
                                  newspaper Globe for repeating a book's claim
     that a California
                                  man, not Sirhan Sirhan, killed Robert F.
     Kennedy. The justices,
                                  without comment, let stand a ruling by
     California's highest court
                                  that the news media can be liable for repeating
     someone else's
                                  libelous statement about a private figure.

                                  --Said police do not need a warrant to seize
     someone's car
                                  from a public place under laws requiring
     forfeiture of property
                                  linked to crime. The 7-2 ruling reinstated a
     Florida man's drug
                                  conviction based on the crack cocaine police
     found in his car
                                  after seizing it without a warrant. Police said
     the man's car was
                                  subject to forfeiture because it had been used
     to deliver drugs
                                  several months earlier.

                                  California's welfare policy would have given
     people who lived
                                  in the state for less than a year only the
     amount of welfare they
                              would have received in their previous home
     state. Fourteen
                                  other states have similar laws.

                              A federal welfare overhaul enacted by Congress
     in 1996
                                  specifically allowed states to temporarily
     provide lower benefits
                                  for new residents. But the justices said today
     congress cannot
                              authorize states to enact policies that violate
     the Constitution.

                              California lawmakers enacted the lower benefit
     to save money
                              and eliminate an incentive people might have to
     move in-state to
                              get a higher welfare check.
'."


                                For example, a family of four in California
      ordinarily would get
                                $673 a month, while a family who moved into the
      state from
                                Mississippi within the past year would get only
      $144.

                                Welfare recipients challenged the law, saying
      the limit on
                                benefits -- coupled with California's high cost
      of living       could
                                deprive them of the basic necessities of life.
      Lower courts put
                                the law on hold, saying the state could not
      treat new and
                                longtime residents differently.

                                In 1969, the Supreme Court invoked the
      constitutional right to
                                travel as it struck down state laws that
      required one year of
                                residency in that state to receive any welfare
      benefits at all.

                                During arguments last January, California's
      lawyers told the
                                justices that reducing benefits for a year would
      not violate new
                                residents' right to travel. New residents would
      not be much
                                worse off because they still would be eligible
      for other welfare
                                programs such as job training and child care,
      the state's lawyers
                                said.

                                Those who challenged the California law said
      they moved into
                                the state to pursue employment, not welfare
      benefits. One
                                woman who moved from Oklahoma said she would not
      be able
                                to afford housing if her benefits were be
      limited to Oklahoma's
                                level of $307 for a family of three,   instead of
      $565 for
                                longer-term California residents.

                                A federal judge put the welfare limit on hold.
      The 9th U.S.
                                Circuit Court of Appeals agreed, deciding
      california could not
                                justify limiting new residents' welfare benefits
      by saying they
                                would have received the same amount in their
      previous state.

                                The 1996 federal welfare law allows the states
      to enact
                                dramatically different public-assistance


policies. Congress
                        decided to let states pay lower benefits to new
residents for
                        fear the new system otherwise might lead states
with higher
                        benefits to become magnets for welfare
recipients.

                        Congress also worried that other states might
  race to the
                        bottom"   by cutting benefits to push people
away. So far there is
                        little evidence that states with higher benefits
have attracted
                        large numbers of welfare migrants.

                        Stevens wrote that while it may be reasonable to
assume some
                        people might move to a state to receive higher
welfare benefits,
                        "the empirical evidence ... indicates that the
number of such
                        persons is quite small -- surely not large
enough to justify a
                        burden on those who had no such motive."

                        Stevens' opinion was joined by Justices Sandra
Day O'Connor,
                        Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy, David H.
Souter, Ruth
                        Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer.

                        Dissenting were Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist and Justice
                        Clarence Thomas.

                        Writing for the two, Rehnquist called the
California law a
                        "reasonable measure falling under the head of a
'good-faith
                        residency requirement.'"

                        Other states with different welfare benefits for
newcomers
                        include Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland,
Minnesota, New
                        Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Dakota,
                        Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington
and
                        Wisconsin. Several of those laws have been
challenged in court
                        and have been barred from taking effect.

                        The case is Saenz vs. Roe, 98-97.
