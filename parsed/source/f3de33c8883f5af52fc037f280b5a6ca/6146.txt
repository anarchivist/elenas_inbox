      BR/EK/Rahm:

      While Lynn Cutler in IGA is pushing for us to announce our "education
      summit" at the Friday Mayors meeting (I've asked Mike whether this was
      actively being considered or not), I'm assuming this is still a crime
      event. As such, my recommendation is that instead of just talking about
      community prosecutors, we should talk about the next steps in our fight
      against crime and drugs. A potential speech outline could go something
      like this.

      1. Unprecedented success in the war on crime.   Several weeks ago I was in
      New York City, where only a few short years ago crime was at intolerable
      levels, and hope was at an all-time low.  It seemed as if the fight
      against crime was over, and we had lost.  Nothing could be further from
      the truth today (murders down 62%, 1,600 more cops for NYC, the fight
      against crime is as spirited as ever) .

      2. No time to let up. We must redouble our efforts and drive down the
      crime rates to their lowest points ever.  Falling crime rates are no
      accident.  In 1994, we took a stand for tough punishment, more police and
      better prevention. We fought for the tools we needed to begin to tip the
      scales of justice in favor of those who work hard and play by the rules.
      We need to build on this success.

      3. Next steps.    To keep cutting crime, here are the 3 things we need to
      do this year:

      Finish the job of putting 100,000 more police on the street -- and bring
      prosecutors directly into the fight;
      Pass a tough, smart juvenile crime bill that let's every city crackdown on
      gangs, guns and drugs the way Boston has; and
      Attack the drug problem that fuels the majority of crime in our cities.

      4. Actions we're taking today.   Today, I'm pleased to announce that our
      FY 99 budget keeps up our unprecedented fight against crime -- and takes
      these crucial next steps. Specifically, our budget calls for:
 .#




-- Community prosecutors.  A new $50 million per year program to hire more
prosecutors and have them join the 70,000 community police officers we've
funded.

-- Youth Crime Gun Interdiction Initiative.  $28 million to help key
cities trace the source of illegal guns, and to hire more than 150 new ATF
agents to crackdown on the traffickers that are supply gangs with guns.
This is a key piece of Boston's successful youth violence strategy.

-- The toughest, largest drug budget ever.  In response to many of the
issues raised at your Drug Summit last year, our budget will fund the most
ambitious drug strategy ever -- nearly $17 billion.

Also, I think we should think about leaking the ATF budget piece to one of
the major papers -- or to one of the major cities that would be most
impacted (Chicago, NYC, Philadelphia, etc.)  In fact, Philly and Chicago
recently ran a series of stories on guns and federal gun policy, and they
may be particularly receptive.

Just some pre-event thoughts ....

Jose'
