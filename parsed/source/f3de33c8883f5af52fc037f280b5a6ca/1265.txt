TEXT:
Attached is my one page description of North Carolina's welfare program.
PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF YOU WOULD LIKE ANY REVISIONS BEFORE IT GOES IN THE
PRESIDENT'S TRIP BOOK (materials are due by 4:00).  I have sent a copy to
the speechwriter, Jordan Tamagni.

I've tried to highlight those things I think the President will like about
NC's program -- requires real responsibility, subsidizes private sector
jobs (at least in one county), involves business, church, and community
leaders, and reinvests welfare savings in working families (the USA Today
article cited is one Barry Toiv pointed out suggesting POTUS may wish to
urge states to spend welfare savings on the transition from welfare to
work) .

                       WELFARE REFORM IN NORTH CAROLINA



        North Carolina has one of the toughest welfare refonn programs in the nation. Governor
Hunt's Work First plan gives parents 12 weeks to get ajob and two years to move off welfare.
All welfare parents must sign personal responsibility contracts detailing their plans to become
self sufficient and pledging to keep their children in school and get them immunized and checked
by a doctor regularly. Families who don't live up to their Work First responsibilities have their
benefits cut. In a demonstration project in Cabarrus county, Work First subsidizes employment
by diverting cash assistance and Food Stamps dollars to private employers who hire welfare
recipients. The President may wish to urge the state to expand this demonstration. North
Carolina received waivers from the Clinton Administration to implement this plan in February
1996 and is continuing the plan under the new law. Since January 1993, North Carolina's
welfare caseloads declined by 76,041 people, or 23 percent, while U.S. case loads decreased 18
percent.

         Governor Hunt's new budget, proposed in January, reinvests welfare savings in working
families rather than spending it on roads or other state programs -- something that the President
may wish to praise. (An article in Monday's USA Today brought attention to the.fact that some
states are planning to spend savings from falling welfare caseloads for non-welfare programs.)
Hunt's budget directs $90 million savings from welfare refonn to expanding day care and Smart
Start, an early childhood education and health program. The Governor has also endorsed a state
legislative proposal made by Reps. Cherie Berry (R-Catawba) and David Redwine
(D-Brunswick) to hold North Carolina counties more accountable for Work First results while
allowing them more flexibility in implementation. Each county will be judged on perfonnance
standards including not only the decline in welfare rolls but how families are doing after they
leave welfare. Details of the plan will be submitted to the General Assembly in April.

        Enlisting the assistance of churches and employers has been central tothe Governor's
welfare-to-work effort. Last summer, Governor Hunt held six regional forums attended by more
than 1,200 business, church, and community leaders to get their help in moving families from
welfare to work -- an effort very similar to the one the President has begun. In Charlotte, the
Chamber of Commerce is leading an effort to get every business to hire just one welfare recipient
-- an effort that would cut the county welfare rolls in half.

        The Governor's "Crackdown for Children" child support enforcement plan is also one of
the toughest in the nation. The Crackdown's "get tough" penalties include suspending or
revoking driver's licenses and professional or business licenses and posting the names and faces
of "most wanted" deadbeat parents on posters. So far, more than 500 parents have been notified
that their licenses would be revoked; of those, 401 paid the child support owed and 115 refused.
Since 1992, child support collections in North Carolina have done up by 48 percent.

        North Carolina's program was highlighed in a February 20th Wall Street Journal article
(attached).
