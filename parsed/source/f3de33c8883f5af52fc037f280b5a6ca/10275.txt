TEXT:
As you know, NPR doesn't think its new aviation policy will be ready for
the radio address.   Tom and. I had favored an alternative proposal that
would have led to more disclosure of black box material even when there
was no accident.   I don't know what you thought of the idea, but Morely
had favored it, and pitched it to Ron Klain.    In any case, FAA released a
press release on the plan on Wednesday.    We had been clear with FAA that
they should hold it, even when they told us it was an old policy.     Morely
called Tom late last night to say he'd talked to Jane Garvey who
apologized and blamed it on staff confusion.     Morely thinks we should bag
the radio address.   Nonetheless, we ar·e working on trying to come up with
new ideas. FAA is working to come up with some new-generation
anti-terrorism equipment for airports.
