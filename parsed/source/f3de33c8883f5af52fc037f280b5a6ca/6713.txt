TEXT:
I've gone to two policy group meetings on revising the poverty measure
chaired by Becky Blank and wanted to let you know where things stand.
The first meeting just established the group and an agenda.   The second
provided an overview of the issue: why do we need a new measure, how might
it differ from the current measure, and what are the key decision points
in developing a new measure. The purpose of the group is to identify and
resolve policy issues that arise as Census works toward publishing alternat
ive measures of poverty.  This effort is based largely on the
recommendations from the Nt'l Academy report, although there are some
areas where the report did not make specific proposals.

policy issues are likely to surface around: benchmarking the poverty
threshold, geographic adjustments, adjusting the measure over time, and
treatment of medical expenditures and benefits. Anticipated
process/timeframes include: giving Census initial policy and technical
guidance by June so they can release several alternative measures on an
experimental basis, along with an analysis of their impacts, next Fall in
order to get both technical and policy feedback.  The policy group would
continue to stay involved to assess the reaction, review the broad
parameters of a revised measure, and consider policy and legislative
implications. This would then feed into development of a revised measure
to be implemented in the fall of 1999

The policy group includes CEA, NEC, OMB, DPC, and HHS.    It will meet
every two weeks through the end of May.    I'll plan to attend these
meetings and alert you as big issues arise.   Please let me know if there
are particular ·issues you are concerned about.  Meetings are Mondays from
3:30-5 in Room 324 on 3/30, 4/13, 4/27, 5/11 and 5/26 (Tuesday due to
holiday) if you want to attend.   In addition, a technical group comprised
of experts in the various agencies, chaired by Katherine wallman from OMB,
continues to work through a variety of issues.
