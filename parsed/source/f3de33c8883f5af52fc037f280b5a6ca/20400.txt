TEXT:
We are nearing completion of the Native American executive order. This
order would promote the goals of improving reading and math for Native
American students and trying to improve the high school graduation rate.
The order includes providing technical assistance to eight pilot sites in
order to achieve these goals; developing short-term and long-term policy
agendas with respect to Native American education; and holding regional
forums to provide technical assistance to states arid tribes.

We plan on announcing this order at the Native American economic
development conference on August 5. This order would be announced in
conjunction with some specific economic development proposals that Julie
is working on.  However, since getting a good education is the first step
toward economic self-sufficiency, it makes sense to sign this order at
that time.  It would be nice to have the President actually sign the order
at the conference because, with respect to almost all the other executive
orders relating to Native Americans, the President did not meet with the
tribes when he signed the orders.

I will get you both a copy of the order.  If you both are fine with it, we
would like to start the OMB vetting process for this order.  I will draft
a cover note to OMB as well. Thanks, Mary
