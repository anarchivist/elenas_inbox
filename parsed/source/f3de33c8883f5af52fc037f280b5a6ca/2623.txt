Subject:         Re: Displacement

The President told me Tues night that some states were strengthening
displacement language because the federal language wasn't strong enough.
He thought we should look into toughening the federal language if
necessary.  I told him the language was strong enough. just difficult to
enforce -- and in any case the best we could do with this Congress.
