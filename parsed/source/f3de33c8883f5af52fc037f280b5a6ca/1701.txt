Subject: Usable life of clips

Ammunition feeding devices -- magazines and clips -- are gun parts.
They are used to contain bullets; ammunition is separate. A clip can be
reloaded over and over again.  If the owner is careless in its handling or
doesn't maintain it, it can become useless.  Like any other gun part, if
it is
well maintained, it can last a lifetime.
