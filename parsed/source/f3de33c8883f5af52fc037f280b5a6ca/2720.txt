TEXT:
Defense sent this testimony to me late last night and I sent it around for
clearance under the subject LRM.   However, the issue really belongs to
Ingrid Schroeder (5~3883, FAX 5-3109), who will be handling the clearance
of the statement. Accordingly, please forward your comments on the
testimony to her.

Thanks, and sorry for the confusion.
