TEXT:
        As a follow-up to the Podesta meeting, I spoke w/ Gerry Shea he is
prepared to have a dialogue about this issue and will pull together a very
small group of labor policy people to engage on the issue and discuss
options/principles etc.  I informed Sec Herman we would be moving ahead
and she will send someone to the meeting.  I will try for next week.
