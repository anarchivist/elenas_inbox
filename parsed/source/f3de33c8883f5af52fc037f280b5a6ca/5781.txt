TEXT:
Below are estimates of the cost of expanding Head Start to 1 million
children by 2002 under the tentative agreement policies ($150 million for
both the quality set-aside and COLA in FY99 and out years) and HHS' request
(full COLA and quality set-aside every year).  The numbers below also
provide estimates for doubling the Early Head Start (EHS)   set-aside to 10
percent by 2003 (because set-aside is a percentage of the total, the
higher cost options increase the cost of the set-aside). All increments
are shown as deltas from the FY98 level of $4,355 million."
