Subject: House Republicans Deny Unmarieds/Gays/Lesbians right to adopt

New York Times News Service, August 7, 1998
House Would Ban Unmarrieds, Gays, and Lesbians from Adopting Children
By JUDY HOLLAND
     WASHINGTON -- In the latest of a series of measures that gay rights
advocates view as anti-homosexual, the House has passed a bill that would
forbid unmarried couples -- including gays and lesbians -- in the nation's
capital to adopt a child.
     The measure -- an amendment sponsored by Rep. Steve Largent, R-Okla.,
to
a $6.8 billion spending bill for the District of Columbia -- passed by a
227-192 vote shortly before the House adjourned early Friday for its August
recess.
     Prospects in the Senate are unclear. No corresponding adoption
provision
exists in that chamber's D.C. spending bill, but one could be added once
the
measure goes to the floor for a vote.
     President Clinton has threatened to veto the D.C. bill because of the
adoption provision and because it includes a pilot program that would give
up
to $3,200 in vouchers to some poor public school children so they could
attend
private nonsectarian and parochial schools.
     This is the fourth consecutive year that the House Appropriations
Committee has considered a measure to bar gays and lesbians from adopting,
but
the first time one has passed the House.
     Last week, Rep. Todd Tiahrt, R-Kan., tried to attach the measure to
the
D.C bill in the appropriations committee, but it was defeated, after
Chairman
Bob Livingston, R-La., voiced qualms. Largent then restored the provision


on
the floor Thursday night.
      His amendment says, "None of the funds contained in (the D.C. spending
bill) may be used to carry out any joint adoption of a child between
individuals who are not related by blood or by marriage."
      During the floor debate, Largent said his measure "does not single out
homosexuals . . . . This could be a heterosexual couple that does not have a
marriage contract that binds them together. ' ,
      He added: "Sure, it might give some gay rights advocates a warm
feeling
to see gay couples treated just as if they were married. But these are real
kids ... who have already had a rough start . . . . It is simply wrong to turn
them into trophies from the culture war, to exploit them in order to make
some
political point.' ,
      But Rep. Chet Edwards, D-Texas, said the amendment would deny
children in
need a loving home. It would "allow a philandering married husband who
abuses
his wife on a regular basis to be able to legally adopt a child, " Edwards
said. "But i f two nuns felt God's calling to adopt a disabled, blind child
from Romania, under this amendment they would be prohibited from doing so.
      Rep. Heather Wilson, R-N.M., also argued that adoptions should be
reviewed "on a case-by-case basis, " looking at "the best interests of each
and every child.' ,
      Passage of the adoption amendment followed the chamber's rejection
earlier this week of a measure by Rep. Joel Hefley, R-Colo., that would
have
blocked President Clinton's executive order issued in May banning job
discrimination against gays in the federal government.
      Two weeks ago, the House passed a measure by Rep. Frank Riggs,
R-Calif. ,
that would prevent San Francisco from using federal housing money to
implement
its requirement that contractors with the city must provide the same
benefits
to unmarried domestic partners as they provide to married couples.
      Before that, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., compared
homosexuality to kleptomania, and House Majority Leader Dick Armey,
R-Texas,
said homosexuality is a sin.
      Republicans have also blocked the nomination of San Francisco gay
rights
advocate James C. Hormel to become u.S. ambassador to Luxembourg.
      Asked about Largent's measure, Ann sullivan, adoption program director
for the Child Welfare League of America, a nonprofit group of agencies that
offer services for children and families, said it is clearly aimed at
preventing homosexuals from adopting.
      "There are very few straight unmarried couples who are seeking to
adopt, " Sullivan said.
      At least 35,000 foster children in this country are waiting for
families
to adopt them, Sullivan said. "Why would we want to arbitrarily rule out a
part of the population? The capacity to nurture a child, and sexual
orientation are two very different things."
     Numerous gays and lesbians in this country are already parents, she
added,
noting that many of them were previously in heterosexual marriages.
     Sullivan said if Largent's amendment becomes law, gays and lesbians who
want children will be driven to adopt them independently rather than


through
agencies, which can better prepare couples for the rigors of parenthood.
    Winnie Stachelberg, political director of the Human Rights Campaign,
the
nation's largest gay and lesbian organization, said Largent's measure "is a
discriminatory amendment that is really about (denying) gays and lesbians
whocan't get married the ability to provide loving and stable homes. Gays
and
lesbians can be good parents just as straight parents can."
