TEXT:
Today's Ways and Means technicals markup was a quiet, bipartisan affair
until Rep. Johnson of Texas went into a tirade about the Administration's
delay in responding to the Texas proposal. He had poster-sized copies of
the Shalala-Glickman-Reed memo to the President displayed behind him.   The
chair ruled his amendment out of order and the Administration
representatives there were not called upon to comment. This per Irene
Bueno of HHS.

The Committee did pass a sense of the Congress reo benefits for the Hmong.
