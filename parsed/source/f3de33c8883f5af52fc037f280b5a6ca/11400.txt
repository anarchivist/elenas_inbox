    PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
    RADIO ACTUALITY ON ED-FLEX AMENDMENT
    February 25, 1999

            This year we have an opportunity to work together, across party
    lines, to bring true progress to AmericaO,s public schools.  I welcome the
    idea of greater flexibility for states and school districts; and I urge
    the Senate to pass Ed-Flex legislation that provides for greater
    flexibility and accountability. But we must do more to give our children
    a world-class education.  That is why I strongly support the amendment
    proposed by Senators Kennedy and Murray.  We must further our national
    commitment to hiring more teachers and reducing the size of classrooms
    across America. Studies confirm what every parent already knows: smaller
    classes make a big difference, from improved test scores to improved
    discipline. The Senate should pass the Kennedy-Murray Amendment, and give
    our nationO,s children the individual attention they deserve in the
    classroom, and the better future that only a good education can bring.
