TEXT:
Steve Silverman is putting the finishing touches on our service summit 6
month update memo.  He will forward it to you for review.  I think his
draft will be to the President from himself, me, and Bibb Hubbard, via
Sylvia and you.  He is always pushing me to get my name on memos; I really
don't care, so if you aren't comfortable with that formulation it's fine
with me.

It's a short cover memo with 2 attachments, most of which you've seen:
                                   P6/(b)(6}
                            so I've sent him edits.       But not sure if he'll
reflect
