is requesting 15-20 minutes on the phone with the President for a.Monday
a.m. piece on the strategy session.    Bruce, I've also let him know you're
the guy in charge, so he'll be pursuing you for information -- I've
already told him about all I thought was prudent to tell him -- no names
yet -- but one thing I've·made clear to him was that this is not just
about Hollywood, nor, to the extent it is about Hollywood, is it about
beating them up.   (His original pitch was that the L.A. Times was a good
opportunity for POTUS to send his message to Hollywood, and I expect that
he will broaden his pitch a little as he moves around trying to get the
interview.) Anyway, let's put this on the list as something to consider.
We could do it as late as the weekend, although I don't now if the Pres.
would be ready for this even then.

TEXT;
Statement on Achieve's announcement that a group of governors and
corporate leaders
 will create a new 8th grade math test -- and teacher training and lesson
materials -- to help u.s. students perform as well as their peers in other
countries.  {Note;  Education is being careful not to describe the
assessments as "high-quality", but is framing their comments as
"supportive of the goal of high-quality curriculum and assessments."}

I applaud the news of this partnership with the goal of promoting
high-quality curriculum, instruction and tests to improve student
performance in math.  We must do everything we can to help our children
master the basics. And in this increasingly interdependent economy, we
need to provide parents, teachers and students with common measures of
student achievement.  This step by Achieve reaffirms my long-standing
belief that states want -- and will take advantage of -- voluntary tests
that allow them to compare their students' achievement to common rigorous
standards.  I welcome the efforts of Achieve and others who are
undertaking efforts to improve education.
