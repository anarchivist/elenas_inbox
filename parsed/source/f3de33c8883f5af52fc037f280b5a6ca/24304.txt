DRAFT --- NOT FOR RELEASE
May 19, 1998

H.R. 3150 - Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1998
(Gekas (R) Pennsylvania and 75 cosponsors)

The Administration supports bankruptcy reform that requires responsibility
of debtors who have the ability to repay a portion of their debts and
prevents abuse of the bankruptcy system.  However, the Administration
[strongly?] opposes H.R. 3150 One provision of the bill would establish a
rigid and arbitrary means test to determine whether a debtor could file
for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 or would be required to file under Chapter
13 rules.  Bankruptcy courts should have greater discretion to consider
the specific circumstances that brought a debtor to bankruptcy.

H.R. 3150 also would make nondischargeable certain credit card debt.   The
Bankruptcy Code generally makes nondischargeable debts only where there is
an overriding public purpose, as with debts for child support and alimony
payments, educational loans, tax obligations, or debts incurred by fraud.
These credit card debts do not rise to that level of public priority, nor
has there been sufficient finding that current protections against fraud
and debt incurred prior to bankruptcy are ineffective. Moreover, by
making these credit card debts nondischargeable, the bill puts them in
competition with payments to a former spouse or custodial parent after the
debtor leaves bankruptcy, which would diminish the ability of debtors to
fulfill their family obligations. Amendments made during the Judiciary
Committee mark-up do not effectively eliminate this problem.

The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress on a
balanced package of reforms that addresses these concerns and requires
responsibility on the part of both debtors and creditors.
I,
