TEXT:
Just FYI: Although the child violence initiative story did run in: the LA
Times this morning, it did not make it into the clips because the LA Times
wire did not carry the story and we do not receive the hard copy of the
newspaper until after our clips distribution deadline.  The story has been
cut for inclusion in tomorrow's clip packet.   It will be marked with
today's date.  Thanks.  bb
