     Esteemed Colleagues:

     Attached is a draft one-pager for the proposed school safety event on
     Thursday.  Please note, Education has pulled back one of the studies, and
     key event logistics have not been finalized yet.  Specifically ...

     Paper/Overall Outline -- Elena, does this one pager accurately reflect
     report and announcements? Do you still want to circulate this to others
     before we nail down the rest of the event detail? See also existing
     accomplishments doc from 12/97 that we will update for re-distribution.

     Event Program -- Rahm, do we need a "real person" (principal) to speak?
     Scheduling recommended that we find one; Education and I don't. think we
     need one and favor a shorter program w/just the AG (Riley and Deputy are
     both out of town) .

     Audience    We still don't know which room we're doing this in.
     Scheduling initially talked about Roosevelt Room, which would allow us
     about 6 members, key staff and a handful of constituency types.   However,
     there has been some talk of East Room.  I don't think we want to do
     something this big -- do we?

     Briefing -- Key Education staff are prepared to brief afterwards in the
     press room.  I assume this is fine, and that we won't need extensive Q&A.

     Remarks -- Education/Mike Cohen have two concerns     about the speech: (1)
     that the crime stuff not be too inflamatory; and     (2) that key overall
     education planks -- e.g., school construction         be mentioned.  Rahm, are
     you fine with this -- what are you priorities for     the speech?

     Finally, I've asked the folks from Education to attend the lOam crime
     meeting tomorrow (Room 211), so that we can get these things finalized.
     Jordan, if you haven't touched based with Rahm, you may want to visit


w/him -- as well as Education -- there.

Missing Christa,
Jose'

                          Keeping Our Schools Safe and Drug-Free
                                     March 19, 1998            .


Announcement: Today, the President announced: (1) the findings of the first ever national
estimate of crime and violence in U.S. schools; (2) the availability of $17.5 million in new
funding from the President's 100,000 more police program for school safety; and (3) a series of
recommendations by the Attorney General and Secretary of Education for an Annual Report on
School Safety.

"Violence and Discipline Problems in U.S. Schools: 1996-97". The National Center on
Education Statistics released a national survey of principals from more than 1,200 public schools
in the 50 states and Washington, D.C., on crime and violence in schools last year. Key findings
of the survey include:

       A Majority of schools -- or 57% -- reported crimes to law enforcement. This
       includes an estimated 190,000 physical attacks or fights without a weapon, 116,000
       incidents of thefts or larceny, and 98,000 incidents of vandalism.

       Few schools -- only 10% -- reported serious violent crimes. This includes an
       estimated 11,000 physical attacks or fights in which a weapon was used, 7,000 robberies,
       and 4,000 rapes or other types of sexual assault.

       Nearly half of all schools -- or 43% -- reported!!2 incidents of crime.       And most
       schools -- or 80% -- reported 5 or fewer crimes.

       Schools with serious discipline problems were more likely to experience crime or
       violence. Principals rate absenteeism, tardiness and fights as the 3 most common
       discipline problems among students.

Community Policing and School Safety. The Justice Department's COPS Office will make
$17.5 million available for a new community policing program to address school safety. This
initiative will fund partnerships between law enforcement, schools, and community groups to
develop innovative approaches to reduce crime on or near school grounds.

Annual Report on School Safety In his December 6, 1997 radio address, President Clinton
called on the Attorney General and Secretary of Education to issue an annual report that
principals, parents, and local officials could use to address their school crime problems. Today,
Attorney General Reno and Secretary Riley presented the President with a framework for this
report, which will be released at the beginning of every school year. This new report will
include: an analysis of all existing national school crime data and an overview of state and local
crime reporting; examples of schools and strategies that are successfully reducing school
violence, drug use, and class disruption; actions that parents can take locally to combat school
crime, including a local safety checklist; and resources available to schools and communities to
help create safe, disciplined, and drug-free schools.
