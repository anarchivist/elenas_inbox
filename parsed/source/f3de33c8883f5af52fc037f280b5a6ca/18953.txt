 Summary of Discussion

        The meeting began with a discussion of the PIR proposed agenda for the meeting. The
 order of speakers was decided.

          There was some discussion of what areas Franklin Raines, Gene Sperling, and Bruce
  Reed would address. There was consensus that Franklin Raines should discuss the budget more
  generally, perhaps basing his remarks on remarks he made to the Congressional Black Caucus
  and Hispanic Caucus. Gene Sperling should discuss the High Hopes program and the School
  Construction program. Bruce Reed or Elena Kagan should discuss other policy initiatives. Ted
  Wartell, Emil Parker, Julie Fernandes, and Bob Shireman agreed to meet and discuss their
  principals' roles and what materials we should hand out to LCCR on policy issues. They also
. agreed to determine how the 15 minutes should be allocated among the three speakers.

         We discussed Chris Edley's role in the meeting. There was consensus that PIR staff
 would ask Chris Edley to give a broad overview on the President's report, describe the process
 for creating the report, and ask LCCR for input and what key elements they would like to see
 included in the report to address LCCR's concern about the Advisory Board's role with the final
 report.

         We discussed the proposed agenda faxed to PIR from Wade Henderson which raised
 topics LCCR would like to discuss. There was a consensus that discussion of their "pressing
 issues" (e.g., census, African American farme~s, Japanese Latin American internees, etc.) would
 not be appropriate for this meeting and that they could request another meeting to discuss those
 issues. We agreed to suggest that they schedule a follow-up meeting with Erskine Bowles
 through Maria Echaveste if they would like to discuss these particular issues. In the section of
 the proposed agenda entitled "One America Initiative," LCCR brought up the topic of urban
 poverty and its link to race. It was decided that Gene Sperling or Bruce Reed could address the
 issue in his remarks.

          There was consensus that we should conclude the meeting with specific request for action
 to support the President and the PIR. We agreed to ask LCCR to assist and support the budget
 priorities that the President has set forth, identify additional promising practices, and recruit
 leaders to sustain the work of the PIR.

        There was also some discussion about whether the meeting should be open to the press.


                                                 1
possible to share information about the meeting with a selected reporter or newspaper. Lydia
Sermons will consult with White House Communications on whether this strategy is appropriate.

       The revised draft agenda is attached.

Next Steps:

Judy will call Wade and ask if we should show the youth-oriented PSA that we worked with
LCEF to produce. She will also provide him some background on the President's Report and
discuss why the pressing issues that they suggested should be on the agenda is not appropriate for
this meeting.

Judy will check with Maria to determine who should inform Wade about the purpose of the
meeting with leaders of the higher education community.

Anyone who has briefing materials for Erskine Bowles related to the LCCR meeting should
deliver them to Jacinta Ma, (Room 3236 NEOB, 5-1023) by COB Wednesday.
