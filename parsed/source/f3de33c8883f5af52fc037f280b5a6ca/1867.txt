TEXT:
Just to reiterate -- my resistance to moving on this issue this week has
had nothing to do with the substance of the issue -- just the timing given
that I've staffed 3 announcements in the last four days and have to finish
food safety by next Friday. Just don't want to make commitments I can't
deliver on.
