Subject:         Immigration Discussions

Jana Sidley with Bonnie Campbell's office just called and said that as you
are negotiating the Immigration provisions, there is an exemption in 245i
for immigrant women who are victims of domestic violence which allows them
to stay in the country while they are applying for citizenship ........ they
want to make sure these provisions will continue, if not it will gut the
immigrant portion of the VAWA. I have the name of the attorney at Justice
that knows most about this if you need more information.
