TEXT:
Congressman Gutierrez has sent the President another letter reo
Hondurans.  Unlike his previous letter (in which he asked for "parity" for
Hondurans), in this letter he asks for DED for Hondurans who have been in
the U.S. since prior to December 1995.

As you recall, during the last session of Congress, we attempted to get
Hondurans who applied for asylum prior to December 31, 1992 (approximately
2,000 Hondurans) relief equivalent to that received by Salvadorans and
Guatemalans in NACARA (essentially, to have the pre-1996 suspension of
deportation rules apply). We have not pushed for amnesty for any of these
groups, though the President indicated in his meeting with the Hispanic
Caucus last August that he would consider legislation that provided
amnesty for these groups (because it would bring parity between these
groups and the Nicaraguans and Cubans given amnesty in the legislation).
On the question of DED, our position has been that though we agree that
Hondurans similarly situated to Salvadorans and Guatemalans covered by
NACARA should be treated the same, we have not endorsed DED for
Hondurans.  According to Scott Busby, the number of Hondurans likely
affected by our proposed legislative fix is too small and the foreign
policy rationale is not present.

Jim Dobbins at NSC (who covers Latin America) wants us to consider interim
measures for Hondurans who might be covered by our proposed legislative
fix.   These options include: DED; TPS (temporary protective status); and
the AG's prosecutorial discretion. There may be others.   According to the
NSC, the lack of equal treatment for Hondurans is the number one issue in
our bilateral relationship with Hondurans.

Scott is going to pull together a staff-level meeting this week for us to
consider the options.
