TEXT:
FYI.  A few weeks ago, Eric Schwartz was invited to give a briefing hosted
by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace on Hurricane Mitch and
the migration reponse.   That briefing is scheduled for this Wednesday at
8:30 a.m. at the Carnegie Endowment (on Mass Ave.).   I will be preparing
points for Eric consistent with where we are at present on this issue and
will share those around.   Let me know if you have any thoughts/concerns.
