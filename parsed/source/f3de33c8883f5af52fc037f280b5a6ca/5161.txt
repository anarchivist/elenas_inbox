TEXT:
POTUS meeting with Goodling tomorrow at lOam.

POTUS meeting with Coverdell is changed to Friday evening, although Lott
and Coverdell just announced on C-Span that the meeting is tomorrow
night. Also, they attacked the President for sticking with the status quo
and not supporting something with overwhelming public support.  It was
pretty harsh' criticism, fyi.

We'll see what the nightly news picks up, but it seems to me that with
Coverdell, vouchers, and charter schools votes taking place, the President
needs to at least make a brief statement on education to keep his profile
up. We have a great Denver mom who started a charter school and
emphatically supports the national tests and a LA Charter School Principal
who is on board on all our pOlicies who will show up on a minutes notice.
