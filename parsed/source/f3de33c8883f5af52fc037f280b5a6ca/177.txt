H.R. 3760 - Campaign Finance Reform Act of 1996
(Rep. Thomas (R) WYand 8 cosponsors)

The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 3760. This legislation
drives campaign financing in the wrong direction by encouraging a
dramatic increase in campaign spending and enhancing the role of
wealthy individuals and special interests in federal elections.
Increased campaign contribution limits for individuals and
political action committees when they give to State and national
parties will result in increased influence for a special few at
the expense of the vast majority of the American public.
Additionally, the bill does not address the real problems with
the Nation?s campaign finance system, such as the rising cost of
campaigns, the influence of special interests, the costs of
television and radio broadcast time, or ending the ?soft money?
system. To the contrary, H.R. 3760 would increase the cost of
elections, give special interests an even greater voice in the
political process, discourage real competition in races across
the Nation, and tip the scales further in favor of incumbents.
