TEXT:
We are getting out the paper with one-year figures right now. Also, you
are right -- these 7-year figures will definitely help make the case for
this bill, notwithstanding OMB's concerns and later event needs.

Because these out-year figures were not in the FY 2000 budget, Barbara is
somewhat uncomfortable putting out the seven-year figures.   She is
planning to call me back shortly.   But I have an idea for how to address
her concern and strengthen the case for this bill.
We could include in the amendment's authorizing language specific
authorizing levels for each of the next six years.    If we do this, I
think it would likely address Barbara's concerns (because it would provide
a credible basis for the estimates we release).   It would also help us
make an even stronger argument for the bill -- i.e., last year, congress
made a downpayment on the president's proposal by providing funding for
30,000 teachers, and this bill will help finish the job by authorizing
funding over the next six years to help hire 100,000 teachers, including
 [7-YEAR STATE ALLOCATION] in [STATE.]

This will help us make the case that enacting this bill will help achieve
totals included in our seven-year estimates.   If you think this is a good
idea, Tanya and I can check with Barbara, Mike Cohen, Brod to make sure
they have no objections.
