  Elena -- Just to keep you updated

  1.
    Attached is the one-pager that Richard drafted that we would like to
  give to the press people today. Let us know what changes or edits you
  have. Also after you have reviewed this document, we would like to put
  this up on the White House website.

  2.      Accomplishments document.Neera Tanden is drafting the accomplishments
  document, which she will have for us tomorrow. We would like to give the
  accomplishments document to the press people by COB tomorrow, TUesday,
  November 4,

  3.      Pre-Briefing memorandum for the President. We are meeting with DOJ and
  Education today at 6:30 p.m. to finalize what the deliverables for the
  Conference will be.  Please come to the meeting if you would like.  In any
  event, once we have solidified what initiatives are ready for announcement
  and in what form, I will have the pre-brief memo to you by tomorrow
  afternoon so that we can give it to the Staff Secretary tomorrow night,
  Tuesday, November 4.
  Michael Deich has requested to see a copy of this memo, so that he can
  review the policy announcements portion of the memo.

  4.      President's Panel. We thought that, in addition to the other seven
  people you have seen for the President's panel discussion, we needed a
  local prosecutor. We thought we might add Dick Devine from the Cook
  county State Attorney's Office in Chicago. This would make 8 people for
  the panel. What do you think?

  5.      Briefing Book. We will have the briefing book to you by Wednesday
  evening. It needs to be reviewed by Thursday afternoon at the latest,
  because there is printing involved. The Cabinet Secretaries will be
  briefed on Friday.

  Let me know if you need anything else.     Mary

                    THE CLINTON/GORE ADMINISTRATION:
                      GETTING TOUGH ON HATE CRIMES

President to Announce Significant New Law Enforcement and Prevention Initiatives


          "Hate crimes ... leave deep scars not only on the victims, but on our larger community.
  They weaken the sense that we are one people with common values and a common future.
 They tear us apart when we should be moving closer together. They are acts of violence
 against America itself. And even a small number of Americans who harbor and act upon
 hatred and intolerance can do enormous damage to our efforts to bind together our increasingly
 diverse society into one nation realizing its full promise."
           "As part of our preparation for the new century, it is time for us to mount an all-out
 assault on hate crimes, to punish them swiftly and severely, and to do more to prevent them
 from happening in the first place. We must begin with a deeper understanding of the problem
 itself."
                                    President Clinton, Radio Address to the Nation, June 7, 1997


              THE WHITE HOUSE CONFERENCE ON HATE CRIMES
                            November 10, 1997

         On November 10, 1997, the President will convene the first ever White House
Conference on Hate Crimes, a day long event to be held at The George Washington University.
At the Conference, the President will announce significant law enforcement and prevention
initiatives which the Administration will be taking to get tough on hate crimes and hate crime
perpetrators. The Conference will also examine the positive actions some communities are
already taking and which we all can take to do more to prevent hate crimes from happening in the
first place and to make certain they are treated seriously when they do occur.

        A hate crime is the embodiment of intolerance -- an act of violence against a person or
property. Perpetrators of hate crimes pick their targets for no reason other than a victim's race,
color, gender, national origin, religion, sexual orientation or disability (although various federal,
state and local laws define hate crimes somewhat differently). The crime is a manifestation of
the perpetrator's hate.

        Every year, tens of thousands of Americans are victims of hate crimes -- and it is
suspected that many more go unreported. Teenagers and young adults account for a significant
proportion of the country's hate crimes -- both as perpetrators and victims. Each one of these
crimes tears at the fabric of our communities and our democratic society, creating fear and
inter-group tensions, ultimately affecting all of us.

        The Conference is an important element of the President's Initiative on Race, although it
will also examine hate crimes motivated by characteristics other than race.
                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion


                              CONFERENCE PARTICIPANTS:

        The President, Vice President, Attorney General and Secretary of Education will be
joined by other members of the Cabinet, selected state and local officials and approximately 350
leaders from the law enforcement, civil rights, anti-violence, youth, education and religious
communities.

        Hate crimes survivors will also attend. Participants will include representatives from all
50 states. Thousands more will participate at satellite-linked events across the country.
Members of the President's Advisory Board on Race will participate at various satellite
locations.


                                CONFERENCE SCHEDULE:

       The President will host a breakfast for Conference participants at the White House and
then will officially open the Conference at George Washington University with a major policy
address. After his remarks, the President will chair a panel discussion in which the Vice
President, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Education and seven other distinguished
Americans will join.

        In the afternoon, Members of the Cabinet and other senior Administration officials will
chair ten separate, concurrent working sessions which will examine various aspects of the issue.
Thereafter, the Attorney General will make remarks at a closing plenary session and she will
chair a closing panel during which ideas and themes from the ten working sessions will be
explored. Participants will then attend a closing reception at the United States Holocaust
Museum.


                     CONFERENCE LOCATION; OTHER DETAILS:

       The Conference will be held at the Cloyd Heck Marvin Center at the George Washington
University, 800 21st Street, NW, Washington, DC. It is by invitation only and invitations are
non-transferable. The President's remarks will begin at approximately 11 :30am (Eastern
Standard Time) and will be followed by the panel discussion he will chair. The closing panel
and remarks by the Attorney General will commence at approximately 4: 15pm. The event is
open press, except for the working sessions beginning at 2:30pm, which are closed press. Press
inquires should be directed to (202) 456-7150.
