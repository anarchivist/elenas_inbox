TEXT:
I am reviewing the race book sections and have concerns about the
race-profiling section.

The draft book indicates that the President will issue an executive order
and that there will be exceptions made for agencies like the INS to use
race profiling provided they demonstrate necessity for using race.

At the race profiling meeting two weeks ago, I recalled that we decided
that we would recommend that the President issue either a directive or EO
that indicates his concern about the use of race in law enforcement and
will direct the agencies to collect data to determine the extent of the
problem and to develop some proposed solutions.    I also recalled that we
discussed but rejected the idea of a carve out or exceptions for certain
agencies at this time and decided to go with the data collection strategy.

My concern is that providing a carve out for the border patrol and using
particular example of the Southwest border in the book sends the message
that it's okay to use race along the Southwest Border.    While I
understand that courts have supported the use of race by the border
patrol and that the Administration's ultimate conclusion after gathering
data and discussing various options may be that the border patrol should
use race, I don't think we should come out now and say it's okay and use
the Southwest border as an example.  Using this example would likely
outrage the Hispanic and civil rights communities and invite other
questions that are not addressed in the book - what is INS doing at the
Canadian border, airports, etc.

I recommend that the directive or EO not include a carve out/exemption for
certain federal law enforcement at this time; that we do not put the
example of the Southwest border in the book; and we stick to our


original recommendation.

The editorial note at the end of the section indicates that there· is an
understanding that we need to clarify our policy with regard to the border
patrol but I wanted to make that this issue is addressed and to know the
status of the race profiling issue.    I recall there was some other
conversations about this issue after our meeting.   Has anything changed
since we last discussed this issue?    Please let me know or if you have
any further questions or comments.   I will submit all my comments in one
comprehensive note but I wanted to run this one by you.

Thanks.
