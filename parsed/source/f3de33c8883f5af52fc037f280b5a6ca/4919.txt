TEXT:
For those of you who have not kept up with Bill Galston's post-WH career,
take a look at the article on Floyd Flake and vouchers in New York
magazine:

"Three of the most prominent black journalists in America -- Brent Staples
of the New York Times, William Raspberry of the Washington Post, and Jack
White of Time -- have written favorably about vouchers.  So has Bill
Galston, a black professor who earlier served as a domestic-policy adviser
to President Clinton."
