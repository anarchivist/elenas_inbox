TEXT:
    Interior called me again so that they could follow up with Monyihan's
office on our position on the Gorton amendment. The agencies had prepared
a q&a on the Gorton amendment, which answers most of the questions.
Attached is a copy. The Administration has most recently taken a position
against this type of legislation in DOJ hearing testimony on March 11,
1998.  Please let me know if Interior can get back to Monyihan's office.
Thanks, Mary

Subject:         Administration position on Gorton amendment

Senator Monyihan's office has called the Department of Interior asking
what the Administration's position is with respect to the Gorton
amendment, which requires Indian tribes to collect state taxes on the sale
of tobacco products to non Indians.    There doesn't seem to be any debate
over our position-- the Department of Justice recently testified in March
of this year that we don't favor this type of legislation because it
interferes with tribal sovereignty. Let me know if it is alright if
Interior calls Monyihan's office back.

                             THE GORTON AMENDMENT

Q:   What does the Gorton Amendment do?

A:   The Gorton Amendment modifies Section 604 of the McCain bill to require Indian tribes
     and tribal corporations to collect state taxes on sales of tobacco products to non-members
     of the tribe or corporation and then remit those taxes to the federal government, which
     then'must return those fWlds to thc states.

Q:   Can the states tax sales of tobacco products on Indian lands?

A:   Since the formation of the Union, the United State has recognized Indian tribes as
     "domestic dependent nations" that exercise governmental authority over their members
     and their territory. The Constitution vests the federal government with authority over
     relations with Indian tribes. Because Indian tribes and Indians are governed by tribal and
     federal law, states have no authority to tax Indian tribes, Indians, or Indian property on
     Indian lands in the absence of express congressional authorization. States may tax
     non-Indians who buy pre-packaged goods that have been brought onto Indian lands for
     resale, but may not tax sales to non~Indians when the value of the goods are generated on
     the reservation.

Q:   How does the Gorton Amendment interfere with tribal sovereignty?

A:   Where Indians manufacture tobacco products on their own lands, state taxes on
     reservation-generated tobacco products would normally be pre-empted under the tribal
     self-determination doctrine; the Gorton Amendment interferes with this fundamental
     principle. Even with respect to state taxes collected on sales of pre-packaged goods to
     non-Indians, the Gorton Amendment violates traditional principles of comity and
     federalism, which demand that state-tribal relations be developed based on dialogue and
     cooperation between states and tribes. The Gorton Amendment, by imposing a federally
     mandated tax collection scheme to replace the cooperative agreements currently used by
     states and Indian tribes, violates these principles. Some of these state-tribal agreements
     are authorized pursuant to state statute.

Q:   Why is the Gorton Amendment burdensome?

A:   The Gorton amendment establishes a complex scheme to address a problem that states
     and Indian tribes have already resolved. Dual tribal and state taxation of prepackaged
     goods sold to non-Indians is possible, but many states have agreed that it is not
     preferable. To that end, eighteen states have entered into state-tribal tax agreement with
     numerous Indian tribes. These agreements ensure that a single tax is imposed, provide a
     stable tax framework, and ease tax administration significantly. There appear to be over
     200 existing state-tribal tax agreements in these 18 states.

                                                                                   Automated Records Management System
                                                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion


                       By unilaterally requiring Indian tribes to collect the state taxes and also adding the federal
                       government as an intermediary, the Gorton Amendment enormously increases the burden
                       of collecting taxes, without any benefit to the states or the Indian tribes. Federal
                       accounting, oversight, and administrative costs will increase to implement this new
                       legislative scheme. However, nothing more than anecdotal evidence has been presented
                       to support this overreaching legislative mandate.

                  Q:   Has the administration taken this position previously?

                  A:   Yes, most recently before the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs in a hearing on tribal
                       sovereign immunity on March 11, 1998. In the administration's view, agreements are the
                       best mechanisms for mutually satisfactory resolution of tax collection issues between
                       states and tribes. Even if states and tribes are unable to reach agreement, however, states
                       may impose their taxes at the wholesale level to collect taxes on goods that are destined
                       for sale to non-Indians. Moreover, reliance on agreements preserves tribal governmental
                       authority and sovereignty.

                  Q:   What should the McCain bill do about Indian tribes and state taxes?

                  A:   As originally drafted, the McCain bill did not disturb the current system, which has
                       worked for both the tribes and the states. It permitted the states and the tribes to work
                       together to collect the state's revenues and to share revenues if they so desire. Moreover,
                       it vindicated the federal government's trust responsibility to Indian tribes and recognized
                       their status as domestic dependent nations.
