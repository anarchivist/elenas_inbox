TEXT:
Rahm, Bruce, Elena:

I've heard that Senators Hatch, Feinstein, Torreceli, the FOP and perhaps
some other R's, will be doing a press event tomorrow at 2pm to announce
their support for a slightly modified version of S. 10 -- Hatch's juvie
bill. None of us have seen the language, but DOJ seems to think it's
still along way from where we need to be on some of the more controversial
issues (records, separation, etc.), though it should include more money
for our courts and prosecutors proposals and some prevention funds.  We'll
have to wait and see what the bill looks like.

  Biden's folks think this is generally bad for our   negotiating position on
  juvie in the Senate -- losing FOP, two key dems.    However, they also think
  that, unless the new draft addresses the concerns   of the hard-right,
. pro-gun R's, its prospects are no better than the   current version of S. 10.

Jose'
