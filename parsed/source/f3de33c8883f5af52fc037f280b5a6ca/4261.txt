TEXT:
The letter from Baesler and the members about growers emphasizes points
that we essentially agree with:  that companies should buy an agreed upon
level of tobacco. The only question on this score is foreign purchases.
If companies agree to buy a set level for 25 years (say the 1996 level)
the grower members will be happy. They fear the companies will want a
backdoor that allows them to decrease purchases if domestic demand falls.
Hence, the members letter has a provision that includes foreign sales in th
e quota.  I talked to Baesler and he emphasized this point.

The other elements of the letter, economic assistance money, is much less
essential if there is a guaranteed purchase agreement.    If there such a
program, the costs in the House bill would likely be similar to the
Senate, Baesler said $250-300 million a year is what they'd ask. Again,
less is needed if there is continuation of the program.

Baesler says they may have a low cost buy down proposal next week.

Regards, Tom
