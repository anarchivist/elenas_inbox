TEXT:
Etheridge of NC has called USDA about allowing the government to help
promote leaf exports while maintaining a ban on helping finished tobacco.
He was thinking of using the approps. process.  USDA will say we can't
support that.

In the anti-trust case, the US attny has issued subpoenas in SC, NC, GA
and the companies have now resumed buying large shares of tobacco (they
are buying 98% of the market up from 73%) .
