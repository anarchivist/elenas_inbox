TEXT:
Elena,

Would the Jesse Jackson event on the 15th (on Wall Street) be a good time
to announce either the Community Empowerment Fund or the Employment
Discrimination Enforcement policies? I need to check on whether the focus
of the three day conference is on access to corporate boards and high
level positions by minorities (which sounds like the latter) or business
investment in minority communities (the former).  Thanks.

Julie
