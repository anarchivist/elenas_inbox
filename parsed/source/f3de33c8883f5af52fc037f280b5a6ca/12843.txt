TEXT:
First, I apologize if this e-mail is long but this is a complicated issue
and I wanted to give you a heads up.

I have been invited to attend a meeting on Wed. 6/2 convened by Mary Beth
Cahill and attended.by Chuck Ruff, Interior, Solicitor General Waxman,
etc. to find a solution to. an issue that has raised as to how Native
Hawaiians are treated in the Asian American and Pacific Islander Executive
Order (EO).  The EO is scheduled to be signed next Monday, 6/7.     The EO
seeks to increase participation of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders
in federal programs where they are underrepresented particulary in health,
housing, education,  labor, community development programs.

Senators Inoyue, Akaka, former Governor Waihnee, Rep. Underwood, Chairman
of the Congressional Asian Pacific Caucus, have weighed in on this issue
to specifically name Native Hawaiians in the EO.  There is an OMB
Directive 15 in which Native Hawaiians are specifically designated and
these members are asking that the EO somehow recognize that Native
Hawaiians are a different categories which is consistent with the OMB
Directive.

This is a new issue to me but my understanding is that the reason the
Hawaiian Congressional members and former Governor feel so strongly is
related to case that is pending before the Supreme Court in which the
petitioner challenges to have a right to vote in the election for the


Office of Hawaiian Affairs (OHA) that was established by delegation of
Congressional authority to the State of Hawaii to address the conditions
of Native Hawaiians.   Native Hawaiians are only allowed to vote in OHA
elections.    Petitioner alleges that Native Hawaiians are not a
aboriginal, indigenous, native people of the US but rather an ethnic
minority and therefore is discriminatory to prohibit non-Native Hawaiians
from voting in OHA elections. The 9th Circuit found upheld the OHA
practice finding that Native Hawaiians are part of a special aborginal
group.

The Congressional members from Hawaii and former Governor are concerned
that if the EO omits any reference to Native Hawaiians as a separate
category that this may affect the outcome of the case because it could be
evidence in support of petitioner's claim (i.e. the Federal Government
does not recognize Native Hawaiians as a special indigenous category but
rather an ethnic minority and therefore only allowing Native Hawaiians to
vote in the OHA elections is unconstitutional) .

The Congressional members make proposals that I think will address this
issue without delaying the signing ceremony.  For example, clarifying that
Pacific Islanders include native people of Hawaii and other Pacific
Islands. This solution would be consistent with OMB Directive 15 in which
Native Hawaiians are specifically designated.

I will let you know how this is resolved or let me know if you need more
info.

Thanks.
