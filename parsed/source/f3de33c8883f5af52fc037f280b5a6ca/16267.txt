Subject:         No Extra Funds in Senate Committee Markup for Treasury Law
Enforcement

Based on a quick review of the Senate committee markup for
Treasury/Postal, Treasury's optimism about extra funds for law enforcement
appears to have been unwarranted. Treasury enforcement is down $61M from
President's request in the markup ($70M excluding an earmark for ONDCP).
Most of the damage is to ATF, which is down by $41M from request.  The
markup means that the Senate committee has given us little room to look to
FY 1998 to find funding for the Youth Gun initiative.

Most of the damage to ATF is that the $26M request for site expenses for
the new HQ building is not funded.  (Not critical, if ATF is moving to
Federal Center SE.)  Other items left unfunded, include:

$5.5M for increased explosives inspections (at manufacturing & storage
locations);
$6.6M for base restoration (lab, telecom, and computer equipment); and
$4.0M for expansion of the canine explosives detection training program.
