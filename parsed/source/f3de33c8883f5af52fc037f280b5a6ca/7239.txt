TEXT:
Moody's apparently did not realize that the industry payments for the
first five years include an implicit volume adjustment -- thus, they think
the $1.10 is really much higher. Gruber's called to explain, but this
re-inforced his views that we may want to include a volume adjustment at a
some point.

He is also asking whether tying some of all of the assessments to the
youth lookback penalties would help us in the pr war -- by giving us a
better argument against the "you're taxing adults" angle.  I don't see it,
do you?
