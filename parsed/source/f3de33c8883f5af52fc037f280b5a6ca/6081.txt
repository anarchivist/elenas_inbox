          Folks--what do you think? Is there any chance we can find the resources
          for this little project--it would make a huge, huge difference to this
          community (as well keeping us true to the President's word).

          Subject:         HHS Budget Proposal for CASA Demo Project

          Attached is a statement the White House released after a Sept 10 meeting
          with the President and leaders of the disability meeting.   We have been
          told that HHS, at the last minute, requested $2 million for a personal
          assistant demo project in order to meet the President's commitment made at
          the meeting, but that OMB rejected the request. We are trying to
          determine if this true. Richard reports there was no request on the
          discretionary side.

          Regardless of the above, how do we demonstrate that we are following-up
          the President's commitment.


          THE WHITE HOUSE

          OFFICE OF SPECIALTY PRESS

          FOR IMMEDIATE PUBLICATION                                 September 10,
          1997

          PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT MEET WITH
          LEADERS FROM THE DISABILITY COMMUNITY

          Washington, D.C. -- On Wednesday, September 10, 1997, President Clinton
          and


 Vice President Gore met with national leaders from the disability
 community in the Cabinet Room at the White House to discuss issues
 important to people with disabilities.

 The discussion focussed-on the enforcement of the Americans Disabilities
 Act (ADA), employment of people with disabilities, Supplemental Security
 Income (SSI) eligibility for children, personal assistant services, the
 Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and telecommunication
 issues.

 During the meeting, President Clinton restated his commitment to ensuring
 equal access to the American dream for every person by integrating
 disability issues into all policies and programs during his
 Administration. The President said he would again ask Congress for a
 significant increase in ADA enforcement funding ·in his FY 1999 budget, and
 urged the community to make it a priority for Congress. On the subject of
 SSI eligibility, President Clinton said he was instructing the Social
 Security Administration to submit a report to him on the SSI reevaluation
 process within thirty days.

 The President and HCFA Administrator Bruce Vladeck discussed the
 Administration's establishment of a task force at HHS on personal
 assistant services, a plan to conduct demonstration projects in targeted
 area, and commitment to study states with successful programs.
 Additionally, President Clinton noted that funding for IDEA has increased
 by 36% during his Administration and reiterated his commitment to special
 education funding.

 The two hour meeting resulted in a lively and productive.session and both
 the President and Vice President look forward to hearing more from this
 important community.
