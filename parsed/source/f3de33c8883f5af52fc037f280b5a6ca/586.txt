TEXT:
States were into getting waivers so that they could take the money
that would have been spent on a person's food· stamps, and instead
give it to employers to supplement the person's wages.   They used
to need waivers to do this, and now they don't under the new law.
USDA never has liked this, because they think of food stamps as a
pure nutrition/food program, but it got in the bill anyway.
I THINK the President has always been a fan of this approach.
