     Elena -

     I spoke with Gerry re: his request for a meeting on immigration/labor
     issues and he mentioned that he spoke briefly with you about this last
     week.  He specifically would like to discuss H1B - given that we are
     nearing the cap and H2A.

     Gerry thinks having a meeting on this issue sooner rather than letter
     makes sense and I agree.   Prior to the meeting, I will give you full
     report on these two issues but below is quick update on these two issues.

                                      Irene



     Update on H1B and H2A

     H1B - INS is working on a notice that will inform H1B applicants that INS
     will assume a starting date of 10/1/99 (after the fiscal year 99 ends)   to
     avoid the cap problem.  It is hoped this would relieve any pressure to
     increase the caps.   Earlier this year, Abraham'S staff indicated they
     would like to work with us to figure out a way to address this issue
     without further legislation. Most recently, Abraham, Bob Graham and
     others sent a letter expressing their concerns that the DOL proposed reg
     on H1Bs is overly burdensome.  OMB and DOL are meeting on Thursday to
     discuss these and other comments on the reg.

     H2A - Abraham has been rumored to be planning to hold a hearing on this
     matter later this month.   In addition, National Latino Summit Against
     Guestwoker Legislation is being held in DC on 5/3/-5/6. The participants
     are planning to a number of congressional visits and a press conference to
     oppose any attempts to enact guestworker legislation.  I have met with
     some of the organizers and they expressed their appreciation for the
     Administration's opposition to guestworker legislation last year and have
     asked that the Administration renew its opposition to guestworker
     legislation at the outset of discussions about possible legislation.   Rick
     Swartz - who represents some of the growers but is very sensitive to
     immigration issues - has written a memo that seeks to find common group on
     the guestworkers issues.  Rick's memo - set forth a few areas of common
     ground. For example, Rick suggests that another legalization program
     should be considered as part of a commong ground guestworker legislative
     package.    From my discussions with the groups, they do not want any
  <,                                                                     Page 2 of 3


guestworker legislation at all this year.   They believe that if
legislation is enacted, any protections for workers and immigrants (ie
legalization) will not be included in the final legislation or even if
included, the provisions would not help guestworkers because they would be
difficult to enforce.   I tend to agree with the groups.   While some
reforms may be needed to the H2A program, the purpose of any legislation
is not to reform but to create a new guestworker program that make it
easier for growers to get low wage workers.    A temporary worker program
already exists with worker protections - ie. H2A program.

I think I should calll Gerry to get a sense of what issues they would like
to discuss before confirming a meeting and to introduce myself to him.  Do
you have his number? I suggest holding the time and I will get back to
you after I talk with him.

Also, I would Maria to the list.

Thanks.

  I suggest - Barbara Chow, and someone from NEC (I'm not sure who that is -
  it may be either Sally Katzen or Brian Kennedy), and Paul Tuchman from
  the VP's of ice is very interested in this as well.   That time works for
  me. Thanks

  Gerry Shea's office called today and wants to bring about 6 people from
  AFL-CIO to come discuss immigration issues. We tentatively set up next
  Wednesday May 12 at 10:00 AM, but I want to make sure this is ok and who
  else should come (I assume Karen Tramontano). They are going to send a
  list of participants and we are going to confirm later this week or next.
