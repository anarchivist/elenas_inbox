I won't tell them ... but someday they'll find out .when these
e-mails become public record ...  (Speaking of, I wonder how many
times the word "oy" appears in the records of White House e-mails
historically! )
By the way, I wanted to tell you that I saw someone I know this
weekend who is a first-year at u. of Chicago Law School.    He asked
about you and whether or not I knew when you'd be going back
there.  He has heard from "everybody" that you are THE BEST
professor there.
Heard something nice, so I thought I'd pass it on.
