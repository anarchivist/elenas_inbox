TEXT:
Diana researched Scholastic's donation of 1 million books and I talked
about it with Carol Rasco again today. According to both the Corporation
for National Service and Carol, Scholastic has donated the books for
America Reads, but nothing more specific. CNS secured the pledge from
Scholastic and Carol clearly does not yet have plans for the books.

Therefore, I propose that we use these 1 million books to fulfill the
First Lady's goal of having doctors prescribe reading to infants and
children and give books to those children who are unlikely to have books
at home when they visit the doctor.  HRC would like the President to be
able to announce a national effort to do this at the Brain Conference, and
we have the Academy of Pediatrics, Children's Hospitals, and Community
Health Centers signing up to do it, but we need books.  When HRC met
before she left with these groups and the Assoc. of American Publishers
about this, the Publishers' President also asked whether Scholastic's
million books could be directed to this end.

Carol thinks of America Reads very broadly -- any effort to respond to the
President's challenge to help children read -- and America Reads has
always had a Parents as First Teachers component to it, so the books would
still be part of America Reads and the volunteerism summit.
If you are agreeable to this use for the books, I could call Carol for her
blessing, but I think it would be better if you called her as the
coordinator of the Brain Conference.  Then one of us would need to call
Scholastic.

What do you think?
