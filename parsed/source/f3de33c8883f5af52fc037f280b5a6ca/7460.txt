Elena:
FYI.   Sally has asked INS to put off issuing a notice of reaching the cap
until they are very close (within a couple thousand) to reaching it.   As
of April 15th, the State Dept. had issued 57,093 H-1B visas this year
 (including approximately 5,000 rolled over from last year). As of this
morning, INS estimated that they were above 60,000, though Doris told
Sally this afternoon that she was told they had reached 65,000. Bob Bach
is going to get back to me on the exact number as soon as he can
 (hopefully as of the am) .
INS wants to release the notice as a way of providing better "customer
service." Sally is reluctant to issue a notice (and a statement that no
more applications will be accepted OR that new applications will be
denied) until we are sure that the new legislation will not meet the need
in time.

Julie
