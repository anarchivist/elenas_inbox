      August 21:Release of new school enrollment figures (Baby Boom Echo
II)

      Sec. Riley will release another report on the baby-boom echo
      indicating that the total number of young people going to school
      (K-12)), both public and private, has increased from 51.7 million to
      52.2 million, another new national record. This report is a follow-up
      to last year's report which received significant national press
      attention and led to a host of state and local stories about over
      crowding in schools. This year we will give special attention to the
      fact that (1) the majority of students who make up the "baby boom
      echo" are in high school and what that means (2) and that school
      construction issue still remains a local crisis in many states.

      August 28th: Long Term 1996 NAEP Trend Report

      Mike Smith and Pat Forgione, Commissioner of the
      National Center of Education Statistics will release the long term
      1996 NAEP Trend report in four subjects (math, science, reading and
      writing. The math and science trends are positive and confirm the
      recent TIMSS data. There is no significant change in reading scores
      but there is a decline in the writing scores. The report essentially
      states that there is no real significant change since the last long
      term repoet.

      The report will note significant progress in science for blacks, that
      many more females are taking tougher math courses, that TV watching
is
".

              down and more young people are reading. There is some possibliity
       that
              we may try to move this August 25th and have the Secretary release
       the
              data but at this moment Mike and Pat get the lead.
