TEXT:
I gather there were a lot of discussions about the Lowey amendment
recently. As the person who is handling all appropriations issues for
WH/LA and in particular, the Treasury Postal bill, I need to be included
in such discussions.  I would also like to see the paper that is being
developed before it goes because I have had discussions on this with
Pelosi and the chairman's people (Livingston).
