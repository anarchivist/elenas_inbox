 TEXT:
 Elena:



 1. My understanding is that you and Maria have spoken again about DPC

 engagement on ideas for the workplan chapter. Mike Cohen is fully engaged,

 and I'm really pleased at how that effort is moving along thus far.



 2. CRIME: I've suggested that Scott Palmer contact Jose Cerda directly to

 get the crimial justice piece moving, because we are running out of time.

 Scott has drafted something to help get the juices flowing.



 3. HEALTH: On Health, it seems to me we have to do something, but the

 question in my mind is whether there anything to be said in the workplan

 chapter beyond recapitulation of the Health Disparities initiative

 announced a couple of months ago. I've suggested that David Campt of PIR

 raise this with Chris Jennings before reaching out to HHS and outside

 experts for their thoughts. Unless people feel there are substantial

 possibilities on this front, it doesn't seem like it deserves a workgroup

 effort comparable to education, economic development,    crime, or even civil

 rights.



            The particular wrinkle I suggested to David Campt, as he studies

 the

 documents and chats with Jennings, is whether the Health Disparities

     initiative contains a comprehensive set of non-federal elements. It

     probably does. Just a question to explore.



               PLEASE SAY SOMETHING TO JENNINGS SO HE HAS CONTEXT FOR THIS.

     Thanks.



     4. SOCIAL SERVICES: I haven't given much thought to this general

     programmatic area.   [I assume that we will handle job training stuff either

     in the economic oppotunity working group or the education working group --

     which ever makes sense to you and Sperling.] Unless you have feel

     otherwise, let's not attempt any serious work on this front for now. Child

     care can be handled as an adjunct of job strategies . .



     5. DEADLINE: Maria has, I hope, said something about the 9/10 deadline for

     my memorandum to POTUS. Getting that written, vetted, cleared and submitted

     by 9/10 will be tough.



               So, tell me honestly: Are you on board, or are you "actively

     skeptical"?



     ciao
