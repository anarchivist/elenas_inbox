TEXT:
We are ready to put the DOL reg to bed.  I have followed up on all the
issues we've discussed, and see nothing to hold it up any further.   It
will be sent to the Federal Register late Friday or early Monday,
available for public viewing on the 17th, and published on the 18th.

Call me if you have any questions.
