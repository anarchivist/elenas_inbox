Hi Elena,
Following is language in response to Reddy's incoming reo Uniformed Div of
Secret Service for your edits/approval. The language is from the F.O.P
questionnaire. Thanks for all your help!

                                *****
Thank you for writing to me.  I appreciate knowing your views on
this issue, and I have shared your letter with the Office of the
Counsel for their review.
As you may know, the Department of Treasury has raised several
concerns about the modification of Executive Order 12171 in such
a way as to allow the Uniformed Division of the Secret Service to
unionize.  I have only recently been informed of where this
situation stands and so have an open mind on the issue. My
counsel, Jack Quinn, is currently reviewing both sides of this
issue and will present a recommendation to me on whether and, if
so how the Executive Order should be modified.
