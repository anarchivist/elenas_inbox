TEXT:
We hope to have you attend the meeting referenced below which will provide
an opportunity for us to hear from our primary constituency groups at one
time ---meaning one meeting rather than a bunch. I should have a proposed
date by the end of the week.

Subject:         SOU/Budget Meeting

I spoke with Bill Pound today. He liked the idea of pulling the Big Seven
executive directors and principals together for a SOU and Budget (FY 2000)
Roosevelt Room meeting with Gene, Bruce, Jack and Maria. He will be back
in touch this week for a suggested date. He understands we want to do this
as early in November as possible.
