TEXT:
        Good afternoon.  The Vice President and I have just concluded a
productive discussion with Sen. D'aschle and Rep. Gephardt. We talked
about many issues, but our central focus, and the focus of the Congress
this week, is on two issues that affect our children greatly: tobacco and
education.

        On the issue of tobacco, we discussed our continuing efforts to
work with men and women of good faith from both political parties, as well
as leaders of the public health community, to pass tough but fair
legislation to reduce teen smoking.  It's seems like each day brings
further proof of the long and tragic campaign by Big Tobacco to market
cigarettes to vulnerable and insecure teenagers.  One document referred to
"replacement smokers" -- a remarkably cynical euphemism for our children.
And we are all now familiar with the research that showed that children
found Joe Camel as recognizable as Mickey Mouse.

        There should be no partisan divide on the question of stopping
tobacco companies from targeting our children. I am impressed by the
bipartisan progress the Senate is making under the leadership of Senator
John McCain and others.   And yet I am deeply concerned when national
leaders are quoted as saying Joe Camel has nothing to do with teen
smoking. There is ample room for honest disagreement.   But when I hear
important national figures making outrageous statements like that, I
realize how far we still have to go in reducing not only big tobacco's
influence over our children, but also its influence over political
debate.
