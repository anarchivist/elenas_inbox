     C.     MEDICARE COVERAGE OF CANCER CLINICAL TRIALS

             Medicare has not traditionally covered patient care costs associated with clinical
     trials. Scientists and advocates believe that we are not making sufficient progress in
     treating cancer, in part because of low participation in these trials that sterns from lack of
     Medicare's coverage. HHS and DPC have been working on an approach that covers
     patient care for a limited number of these trials. Because of concerns about its cost
     potential, OMB and Treasury strongly oppose this option.

            Nearly half of all cancer patients are covered by Medicare, yet Medicare does not
     cover patient care costs associated with these trials. This care can often be prohibitively
     expensive for cancer patients and their families, perhaps explaining why only 3 percent of
     all cancer patients participate in trials. Expanding Medicare coverage could increase
     access to trials for the many Medicare beneficiaries with cancer. Historically most
     insurers have covered clinical trials for children. As a consequence, nearly 70 percent of
     children with cancer participate in clinical trials. Scientists agree that this fact has helped
     improve cancer treatments for children, and some argue that this is one reason for the
     dramatically higher survival rates for children cancer patients.

              This problem has significant implications for research in all cancer areas,
     particularly for those cancers like prostate cancer where scientists still have no good
     answers and where clinical trials are particularly undersubscribed. According to a former
     National Cancer Institute director, if 10 percent of all cancer patients participated in such
     trials, then trials that currently take three to five years w01l:ld only take one year.
     Additionally, as the nation's largest insurer, Medicare plays a significant role in setting the
     standard for the insurance companies. A commitment from Medicare to cover clinical
     trials would go a long way in encouraging private insurance companies to agree to cover
     these trials.

     Proposal

              We have developed a proposal to expand Medicare to cover cancer clinical trials
     conducted at the NCI and trials with comparable peer review. In addition, we would
     require the National Cancer Policy Board to make further coverage recommendations, and
     HHS to assess the incremental costs of such trials compared to conventional
     Medicare-covered therapies. Assuming the true incremental costs are substantially less
     than the actuaries project, as we believe, additional trial coverage as recommended by the
     Board could occur. The initial coverage would cost $1.7 billion over five years. Senators
     Mack and Rockefeller have developed a more expansive and expensive proposal
     (co-sponsored by 26 Senators), which covers all FDA trials, many of which the experts
     believe do not meet a scientifically-meritorious standard. While they would prefer a
     broader approach, the Senators have indicated that they would consider this an important
     first step. However, we do believe that there may be some trials above the $1.7 billion
     proposal that could be justified on policy grounds.
·                                                                          Automated Records Management System
                                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion

             A possible alternative way to cover clinical cancer trial's patient care costs is to
     directly dedicate resources from any significant increases that NIH / NCI receive in the'
     upcoming budget. NCI could use these increase to simplify and centralize their clinical
     trials system, which has the potential to increase patient access. Although this may be a
     viable option, the cancer community has clearly stated their preference that extending
     Medicare coverage is their top priority in this area, as they believe that patients need better
     access to these cutting edge treatments.

     Discussion

            HHS is supportive ofthis policy and believes that it would not only give Medicare
     beneficiaries, who represent a significant portion of cancer patients, much-needed choices
     but would encourage the private industry to cover clinical trials as well. There is no
     question that this proposal is the highest priority for most of the cancer community as well
     as many in the women's community who believe it is an essential step to improve breast
     cancer treatment. However, the advocates have made it clear that they would strongly
     prefer the more expansive and expensive RockefellerlMack approach. We are working to
     determine whether we can modify our more limited proposal in a way that they would
     support.

             OMB and Treasury oppose the Medicare coverage option strongly. They note that
     it would involve very substantial costs ($1 to 3 billion per year) to provide medical services
     that are experimental, and therefore are unlikely to help the majority of beneficiaries.
     Once an exception has been made for experimental cancer drugs and therapies, they argue
     there is no reason that similar support won't be demanded for experimentation with
     Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and other maladies. As a result, these costs will grow as other
     therapies are included. They also believe that Congress would likely expand the proposal
     beyond coverage of only NCI trials - given the fact that prime Hill sponsors favor broader
     coverage - and such expanded coverage will be very costly (up to $3 billion over five
     years). OMB also does not believe that Medicare should lead the way on clinical trials, but
     rather drug companies should be the first to contribute to improving access for Medicare
     beneficiaries.

             The DPCINEC believes that OMB and Treasury raise some valid concerns.
     However, we would support this proposal if we can develop an affordable option that both
     Senator Rockefeller and Senator Mack and the cancer community would strongly support.
      If we cannot obtain such support in short order, we would recommend not including it in
     the budget. We would be in a very good position to argue our likely support for a
     significant increase in biomedical research will also pay large dividends in cancer
     breakthroughs and are more than sufficient in this budget year. However, if we decide to.
     not fully double the NIH budget, as described in a separate memo, this policy might be
     more important to reenforcing your commitment to research. Finally, if it becomes clear
     that our fmal cost estimates for the Medicare buy-in are low enough to be fmanced by the
     available $2 billion in traditional (anti-fraud) Medicare savings, the DPC and NEC would
     recommend giving serious consideration to use these limited dollars to support the
                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion

Medicare buy-in proposal. Bowever, BBS prefers that these offsets be used only for the
clinical cancer trial proposal.
