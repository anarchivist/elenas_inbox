TEXT:
HOUSE RULES COMMITTEE IS SCHEDULED TO MEET TODAY AT 4PM ON THE MILITARY
CONSTRUCTION APPROPRIATIONS FY99 BILL. ATTACHED IS A DRAFT SAP FOR YOUR
REVIEW.  PLEASE PROVIDE COMMENTS BY 3PM.

H.R. 4059 -- MILITARY CONSTRUCTION APPROPRIATIONS BILL, FY 1999
(Sponsors:  Livingston (R), Louisiana; Packard (R), California)


        This Statement of Administration Policy provides the
Administration's views on H.R. 4059, the Military Construction
Appropriations Bill, FY 1999, as reported by the House Appropriations
Committee.  Your consideration of the AdministrationO,s views would be


appreciated.

        The Administration is disappointed that the Committee has chosen
to increase funding above the level requested for the Military
Construction Appropriations Bill, while reducing the PresidentO,s request
for national defense programs funded by the Department of Defense
Appropriations Bill and the Energy and Water Development Appropriations
Bill.

        The Committee has added $580 million to the President's request
for over 90 specific, unrequested projects and other programs, partially
offset by $130 million in reductions to requested items. The
Administration urges that the unrequested funding be deleted, and funding
for requested programs be restored.

Other Objectionable Features

        The Administration objects to the Committee's:

         Refusal to provide advance appropriations of $568.6 million for a
number of large construction projects, especially ammunition
demilitarization facilities.  Advance appropriations would ensure that
full funding is available to complete projects before construction
begins. Without full funding, it is difficult to optimize planning,
scheduling, and cost control.  The Administration opposes incremental
funding of these projects and urges the House to provide the advance
appropriations as requested.

         Failure to include requested authority that would enable the
Secretary of Defense to transfer appropriations within the appropriation
accounts in the Military Construction Appropriations Act.  Similar
transfer authority in Defense Appropriations Acts has been used with great
success to meet unplanned requirements, without reducing the opportunity
for congressional oversight.
