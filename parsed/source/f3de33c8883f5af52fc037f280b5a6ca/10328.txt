 TEXT:
,Scott Busby tells me that NSC wants the President to include as part of
 his December 10th Human Rights Day statement that the Department of
 Justice will explore legislative options for addressing the problem of
 illegal aliens who are victims of smuggling or trafficking ventures.

Un,der the INS 'sS visa program, illegal aliens are eligible for temporary
stays of deportation (including work authorization) or permanent status if
they are material witnesses in a criminal case. NSC would like the DOJ/INS
to explore expanding'the use of the S visa to cover those illegal aliens
who provide information to DOJ and/or DOL, but whose cases are not
criminally prosec~ted.   The theory is that lots of enforcement is done
outside the criminal context and that these aliens, if they come forward,
could be very helpful. NSC would envision a low annual cap on the number
of available S visas.

According to Scott, DOJ and INS are in favor of exploring such a
legislative expansion" though there is not agreement on the specifics.
NSC strongly favors pursuing a legislative expansion;   however, they have
not yet explored what the reaction to such a proposal would be on the
Hill. My concerns are: (1) congressional reaction; and (2) making sure
that the legislative proposal is crafted very narrowly, so as not to
induce people to come to this country under adverse conditions with the
hope of getting work authorization (even if temporary).   However, I think
that the language suggested by NSC ("DOJ to explore legislative options
for addressing the problem of illegal aliens who are victims of smuggling
or trafficking ventures, in which aliens suffer extreme abuse") may be o.k.

What do you think?
