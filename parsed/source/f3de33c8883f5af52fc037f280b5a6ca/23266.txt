                                 Questions and Answers
                                     March 20, 1999


Q:   Yesterday, Senate Hatch and other Republicans unveiled an omnibus crime bill, the
     21st Century Justice Act, and accused the Administration of cutting funds to law
     enforcement. What is your reaction to it?

A:   While we have not had a chance to review Senator Hatch's bill, I understand we have
     seen a press release summarizing its major provisions. Most of the bill is not new. It
     reauthorizes a series of state and local crime programs -- some of which we support -- and
     includes Republican legislation on juvenile crime and drugs that have been making the
     rounds in Congress for some time now. These are priority issues for the Administration,
     and we welcome the opportunity to debate and discuss their merits.

     But we have a serious and fundamental concern with Senator Hatch's bill-- and for that
     matter, with the Republican budget resolution: they both propose cutting the President's
     community policing program (COPS) by about $1 billion. As you know, COPS has
     provided funds to over 11,000 communities to hire more than 92,000 police officers. It
     has helped spread community policing methods to thousands of police departments across
     the country, and it has been credited by countless law enforcement officials as one of the
     key reasons for the significant reduction in the crime rate over the past 6 years. Thus, we
     simply don't -- and won't -- agree with Senator Hatch and other Congressional
     Republicans that they way to fight crime in the 21 st Century is by dismantling the
     successful COPS program.

     By contrast, the President's budget and soon-to-be-introduced crime bill call for a $1.3
     billion 21 st Century Policing Initiative that strengthens the current COPS program by:
     putting up to 50,000 more police on the street; funding new crime fighting technologies
     for police departments; hiring more local prosecutors to work with police; and helping to
     engage the entire community -- including principals, pastors, and parents -- in the fight
     against crime.

     As for the recent criticisms by Senator Hatch and other Republicans on the President's
     law enforcement budget, we will let the record speak for itself. Since 1993, the Justice
     Department's budget has essentially doubled, and funding for state and local law
     enforcement has increased by more than 500%. There can be no question that this
     Administration has provided unprecedented support for law enforcement at all levels --
     state, local and federal.
