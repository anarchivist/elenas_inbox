                                       Possible Q's & A's

Question:

Why have you issued a directive prohibiting the use of Federal funds for cloning of human
beings?

Answer:

I believe we need to make it absolutely clear that Federal funds will not be used in this manner,
and the current prohibitions left room for other interpretations.

In 1994, I directed NIH not to support the creation of human embryos for research purposes, and
Congression extended this ban to cover other forms of human embryo research. However,
neither of these prohibitions would clearly cover the creation of human embryos, using cloning
technology, that are intended to be actually implanted in a womb and carried to term.

My directive today will make it clear that federal funds are not to be used for cloning humans.


Question:

Would you support legislation to ban the cloning of humans?

Answer:

I think that legislation is premature at this time. Frankly, I believe that the broader
Congressional prohibition on human embryo research risked cutting off sound research that has
great medical importance. I think that we need a serious, public discussion-- which I have asked
NBAC to lead -- rather than hasty legislation.


Question:

What are the next steps?

Answer:

I have asked the National Bioethics Advisory Commission (NBAC) to report back to me in 90
days with recommendations for possible federal action. They will review the ethical and legal
implications as the basis for their deliberations, which will take place in open, public meetings.
Each meeting will provide an opportunity for public input and education, which are crucial for
reaching agreement on what we should do next. I will take NBAC's recommendations and
develop proposals that will also require public comment before they become final.
                                                                          H~l)Ulnl'l Conversion
Question:

What impact does the directive have on the private sector?

Answer:

The directive only covers work done by government scientists or in a federally funded
laboratory. Therefore, I am also asking the scientific and medical communities to also refrain
from cloning human beings at this time, until NBAC has had time for its deliberations. But, let
me be clear, the majority of scientific experts believe that any prospect of successfully applying
this cloning method to human beings in the near future if extremely remote.


Question:

Is animal research like the sheep experiment affected by the directive?

Answer:

No. The directive refers to the cloning of humans. The legislative ban also covers only human
research. There is no ban, nor should there be any ban on animal cloning. There is very
important scientific work that can be accomplished using animals. This work will have
significant benefits for agriculture, medicine and veterinary medicine. It could also lead to
improvements in organ transplantation and bett<::r treatments for bum victims or cancer patients.
Also, by creating genetically identical animals, scientists testing drugs could use far fewer
animals than they now need.
