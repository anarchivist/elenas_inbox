TEXT:
The attached languishing sex offender letter (which came out of the
languishing sex offender directive) may actually be released soon.
Contrary to the number on the document, it may be the tenth version!   I
think Jose' sent you this last draft a while back, but just in case he
didn't, here it is.   Rahm and Justice are ok with this version.

                                                DRAFT
    Dear Governor ______ '

            I write to you again to seek your assistance and cooperation on one of our most important
    responsibilities -- protecting our children from violent, sexual predators, Nothing is more
    threatening to our families and communities than criminals who move from neighborhood to
    neighborhood looking for children to prey on. That is why we must do everything we can to track
    these offenders and keep them away from our children.

            With your support we have already enacted critical legislation -- such as the Jacob
    Wetterling Act, the Pam Lychner Act and_Megan's Law -- to help our communities guard against
    repeat sex offenders. These laws now serve as the foundation for many state sex offender
    registration systems and for notifying communities of released sex offenders. Congress is now
    considering -- and I strongly support -- additional legislation to help states implement these
    registration systems and to make sure that sex offenders convicted in federal or military courts
    are covered by these laws.

            Equally important, my administration has worked hard to defend the constitutionality of
    state sex offender registration systems and community notification laws. And I am pleased to
    report that three federal courts of appeal have now upheld sex offender statutes in New Jersey,
    New York, Connecticut and Washington against constitutional challenges. My Administration
    will continue to fight to uphold these laws in the courts, including -- if necessary -- the United
    States Supreme Court.

            Last year, I directed the Attorney General to create a national sexual offender registry to
    join together the efforts being made in all fifty states to track sex offenders. Our national
    registry will only be effective if every state participates and shares its data on sex offenders with
    other states. Although our interim registry became operational this spring, only 11 states are
    currently participating. With an incomplete registry, the law is unable to follow dangerous sex
    predators wherever they go -- state by state, neighborhood by neighborhood. I urge you to move
    expeditiously to participate in our national registry for the safety of the public and our children.

            I can not emphasize enough how important your continued support and personal
    involvement is to the success of these initiatives. Through our combined efforts, we can be
    confident that we will have taken decisive steps to help families across the country protect their
    children.
