TEXT:
Riley is meeting with Harkin tomorrow on a range of education issues.
Scott Fleming in ED reports that Harkin--or Harkin's staff, at least--is
pushing some idea that would put tobacco $ for .class size and other
initiatives on the discretionary side.

I assume that this is simply the appropriators trying to gain control of
anything they can.

I've told Riley's staff that we're opposed to putting tobacco $ on the
discretionary side. However, I hought I ought to double check just to be
sure, and to see if anything is going on that would lead you to want Riley
to take a more nuanced position when he meets with Harkin.
