TEXT:
We propose (as we, Senator Kohl, and the House Democrats did last year) to
provide a tax credit to businesses that provide child care services for
their employees by building or expanding child care facilities, operating
existing facilities, training child care workers, or providing child care
resource and referral services to employees.  The credit covers 25% of
qualified costs, but may not exceed $150,000 per year. Cost:   $500
million over 5 years.  To further build on this concept, we also propose
to provide tax credits to businesses that provide on site schools, as
described in the education section.
