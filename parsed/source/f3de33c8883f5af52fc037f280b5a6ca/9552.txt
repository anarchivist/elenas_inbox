TEXT:
my pal, tina exarhos from MTV (212-258-8727), called to run thru some
issues related to the youth violence summit here at the white house on
october 15. apparently we are planning a partnership announcement in
which MTV will have some role and tina is trying to figure out how we are
pitching the deal.  i'm not sure who has the ball on this, but i suggested
she reach out to all of you (rahm, bruce, elena, ann) to fill you in on
what they are planning to do.   from experience, i know they do a pretty
good job working the press and they will help sell this event and make it
into something.
