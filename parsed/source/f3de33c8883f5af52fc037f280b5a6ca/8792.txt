TEXT:
the charter schools bill passed the Senate Comittee·this morning
unanimously on a voice vote.

There are a couple of issues still to be resolved on this before the floor
vote. The biggest one has to do with the requirement in existing law,
that charter schools must use a lottery to select kids if they have more
applicants than spaces. Meshing this requirement with a range of
circumstances--from letting siblings attend schools together,   making sure
the kids of the founders of the school get in, to dealing with schools
with a special focus that may involve admissions criteria--e.g., a
math/science school, schools for drop outs, kids at risk, etc -- is
complicated. We are trying to have the Education Department issue
guidance on this requirement, rather than having to deal with a
potentially very controvertial amendment.

I'll keep you posted on this.

Ed-Flex was also taken up at the same session, but they ran out of time
long before the Democrats got done offering amendments. They may try to
take meet again tomorrow or Friday before the Senate goes out.  Its not
clear yet if this one will ever get out of committee, and, if it doesn't,
how Frist and Wyden will try to move it.
