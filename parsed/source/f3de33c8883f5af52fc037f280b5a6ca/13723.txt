TEXT:
I need your help this week on two things:
1. Child support: Todd Stern wants to make sure we draw up
Presidential directives or MOUs for the paternity and child
support enforcement initiatives we discussed at that mtg in Ken's
office the other day. We talked about 2 or 3:   1) directing HHS
to strengthen the cooperation requirements for establishing
paternity; 2) directing HHS & Labor to develop the deadbeat data
bank (new-hire matching); and possibly 3) directing HHS & Treasury
to carry out the new authority under the debt collection bill to
run matches against federal benefits. Todd says Steve Neuwirth
did a one-page directive when we required minor mothers to stay in
school that could serve as a model for these. Give me a call or
send me a note and we'll figure out how best to get this done
(perhaps HHS & OMB can do most of the work) .
2. Waivers: I've now read the Wisconsin waiver, and Ken and I are
meeting with Mary Jo tomorrow to get her read on what the tough
issues will be. I don't want to drag you into this any earlier
than necessary, but at some point I will need your constitutional
and legal wisdom on a couple of questions about what's waivable
and what's not.  Let's talk it over.
Thanks! Sorry to trap you in our broken welfare system.
