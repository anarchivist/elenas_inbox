TEXT:
SSA thinks there may be stories in tomorrow's NY Times or through AP on
the cutoff of children from SSI. THey don't seem to know much more about
it. We had assumed that the new law would cut off 135,000 children.   The
data I've seen to date suggests that was a pretty good guess.   Some of
the advocates have charged that SSA is not doing everything it could
administratively to make it easier for these families to stay on the
rolls. A surprisingly low percentage are appealing, and the advocates
think SSA may be discouraging -- or at least not encouraging -- appeals.
