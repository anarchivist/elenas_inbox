       ~==========================H=~=~~~~~~
                Today, CBO clearly certified that the President's FY 1998 budget balances in 5
                years. (See Table 6 of the CBO document) This is only the second time in 18 years
                that a budget submitted by a President reaches balance based on both
                Administration and Congressional estimates. (The first was President Clinton's FY 97
                budget)




The bottom line is that CBO certifies that the President's budget reaches balance in 2002. So now both
the Administration and CBO have concluded that our budget balances in 2002. The only remaining
difference is whether or not we must undertake special measures -- such as a trigger mechanism to cut
mandatory (except Social Security) and discretionary spending -- to achieve that goal.

No special measures will be necessary if our conservative economic assumptions prove to be accurate.
We have a strong record on this front. For four years in a row, the deficit has been lower and growth
has been higher than we had predicted. Since we took office, the actual deficit has on average been
about $50 billion lower than we had projected the year before. CBO has been less accurate: they have
overestimated the deficit by $59 billion on average. Furthermore, our current assumptions are
equally prudent and conservative. Our estimates of GDP growth and inflation over the next 5 years are
precisely the same as the Blue Chip private-sector consensus.

Even CBO Concedes "Slight Differences" Account for Almost Entire Gap Between Administration and
CBO Baselines. To quote CBO: "Although the Administration's economic projections are similar to CEO's
projections that incorporate the effects 0/ balancing the budget, slight differences in economic outlook
essentially account/or the entire $60 billion difference in the baseline projections o/the deficit in 2002. "
[CBO, 3/3/97]

Today, the CBO certified that special measures we have identified would indeed bring the deficit down
to zero. If our assumptions do not prove correct, we will pursue an expedited process with Congress to
agree on how to close any budget gap. If that process breaks down, we have identified contingency
measures to reach balance by 2002. Those measures include the sunsetting of most of our tax
provisions in 2001 and an across-the-board reduction in spending (except Social Security). The
discretionary spending reductions would start in 2001 and the reductions in mandatory programs
would begin in 2002. Today's CBO study shows that these measures -- which we believe will be
unnecessary -- will work to bring the deficit down to zero.

Look How Far We Have Already Come. Two years ago, the President and Congress were embroiled in a
budget battle that lasted straight into the next year. Last year, it took until mid April for CBO to certify
that the President's plan reached balance. This year, the President proposed a balanced budget plan
that for the first time since 1981, has been declared "alive on arrival." Now, CBO has certified that this
plan reaches balance by 2002. The President's 1993 plan made the task of balancing the budget easier.
That year, President Clinton inherited a record $290 billion deficit. Four years later, the deficit has been
cut 63% and is a smaller share of GDP than any other major economy in the world. Now, it's time to
finish the job.

We Have Put a Real, Credible Plan on the Table. The President has submitted a balanced budget plan
this year that even CBO certifies as being in balance by 2002. If some in Congress want to criticize that
plan, they have an obligation to layout a specific alternative. They should show how they would pay for
they would cut Medicare and Medicaid.
