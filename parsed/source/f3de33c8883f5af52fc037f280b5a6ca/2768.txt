Message Creation Date was at    5-JUN-1997 01:31:00

TO:   DIRECTOR FRANK RAINES
  DEPUTY DIRECTOR JACK LEW
  DEPUTY DIRECTOR JOHN KOSKINEN

FROM: OMB LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS

DATE: JUNE 4, 1997

SUBJECT:   LEGISLATIVE REPORT


BUDGET RESOLUTION
The Rules Committee met late Wednesday night, and the House will consider the
conference report on the floor Thursday afternoon. As of COB on Wednesday, two
issues -- Amtrack reserve language and the Dodd tax instruction -- had not been
completely resolved.

DISASTER/BOSNIA SUPPLEMENTAL
The conferees finally completed action on the Disaster/Bosnia Supplemental


today. Objectionable language was approved including the automatic continuing
resolution, census samplilng restrictions, and revised federal land rights of
way language.  Floor action in both the House and Senate is expected Thursday.

When Senate Democrats expressed their intent to talk through the night
criticizing the Republican leadership for delaying disaster assistance, Senator
Lott made a motion to adjourn (at about 4:30 pm), which the Senate approved by
a vote of 53 to 44.

RECONCILIATION
On Wednesday, the House Ways and Means Health Subcommittee favorably reported
(13-0) Chairman ThomasO, Medicare mark to the full committee.  Democratic
Amendments wer offered to support three of the AdministrationO,s "top four
priorities": limiting the MSA demo to 100,000 beneficiaries (Stark), adopting
the AdminsitrationO,s home health reallocation legislation to extend the HI
Trust Fund an additional two years (Stark), and carving IME/GME/DSH payments
from HMO payments (Cardin).   All failed by a vote of 5 to 8.  Kleczka offered
an amendment to strike the malpractice provisions, which also failed by a vote
of 5 to 8.   Chairman Thomas has proposed a reallocation policy that phases the
transfer of home health outlays from Part A to Part B over a number of years,
but sets the Part B premium at 25 percent of Part B costs in every year.

On Thursday, the House Government Reform Postal Subcommittee will markup the
Postal provisions, the House Commerce Telecommunications Subcommittee will
markup the Spectrum provisions, and, the House Commerce Energy Subcommittee
will markup provisions regarding SPR, NRC Fees, and Asset Sales. The House
Ways and Means Human Resources Committee will markup the Welfare to work
provision either late Thursday afternoon or early Friday.

The AdministrationO,s proposed immigration legislation was transmitted to the
Hill on Wednesday night.   We expect to send up our draft bill on Food Stamps
tomorrow.

CONGRESS TODAY (6/4):

SENATE
The Senate failed to invoke cloture on S. 4, the Family Friendly Workplace Act,
by a vote
of 51-47 (60 votes being required to invoke cloture).
  [SAP sent, 5/9: President will veto]

Passed Senator LottO,s Motion to Adjourn by a vote of 53 to 44

HOUSE
The House considered but did not complete action on H.R. 1757, the Foreign
Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1998-1999. Consideration of the bill
will continue tomorrow.
 [SAP sent, 6/4: Senior Advisors Veto Threat]

CONGRESS TOMORROW (6/5):

SENATE
The Senate will convene at 12 noon.  The Senate will take up the Budget
Resolution Conference Report as soon as it is available from the House
(possibly Thursday evening) (10 hours debate)

The Senate also will turn to the Bosnia/Disaster Supplemental Conference Report
as soon as it is ready for action.
