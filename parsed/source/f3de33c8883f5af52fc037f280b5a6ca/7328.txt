                         PRESIDENT WILLIAM J_ CLINTON
                    REMARKS FOR SURGEON GENERAL'S REPORT
                              THE WHITE HOUSE
                                 APRIL 27,1998

       Anyone who has ever been a parent knows the absolute joy -- and the awesome
responsibility -- that comes with raising a child. We have an instinctive urge to protect
our young people from danger.. We do everything we can to keep them safe -- from
strapping on their seat belts in the car, to bundling them up against the winter cold, to
walking them to school each day.' We should wrap the same protective arm around them
when it comes to resisting smoking and the advertising and marketing of cigarettes. Our
children face no greater danger.

          Today, one-third of America's teenagers smoke -- one out of three.     And the report
issued by Dr. Satcher today shows that more and more teenagers are becoming hooked on
cigarettes. Smoking rates are up among teens of all backgrounds -- up among whites, Asians,
Hispanics, Native Americans, and up most dramatically among Mrican-Americans. These are
children, just starting out in life, for whom we should clear the way and assure the brightest
possible future. Instead, they are becoming hooked on a habit that may kill them, all because
they are the target of a sophisticated and decades-long marketing campaign. It is a strategy that
must come to an end.

         The cold hard facts are adding up. The call to action is getting louder. And time is
running out. Congress has an important opportunity to pass a comprehensive bipartisan tobacco
bill that can help save the lives of millions of our children -- that will cut teen smoking by raising
the price of cigarettes, putting into place tough restrictions on advertising and access, imposing
strong penalties on the industry if it continues to sell cigarettes to children, and ensuring that the
FDA has authority to regulate tobacco products -- all while protecting farmers and farming
communities.

        Senator McCain's bipartisan bill is a strong step in this direction. Make no mistake
about it: The legislation explicitly changes the rules of the game so that the tobacco industry can
no longer do what it has done for years -- profit at the expense of our children's health. I want to
thank Senator Frist for working so hard to make sure the bill provides the FDA full authority
over tobacco products.

        It is time to end the delay. It seems as if we're in a situation where we know what the
danger is -- too many children lured to smoking by multi-million dollar advertising campaigns
that have targeted our youth for decades. We know what the remedy is -- tough, comprehensive
bipartisan legislation to end these practices and cut teen smoking. No parent who knows how to
protect a child from a known danger would stand by and do nothing. For our children's sake,
we must not walk away from this session of Congress without a comprehensive tobacco bill.

       I call upon all Democrats and Republicans to put politics aside and put our children first.
This Spring, we have a tremendous and unprecedented opportunity to open a new, hopeful
                                                            Hex-Dump Conversion

chapter in America's efforts to protect the health of our children.    We must not let this
opportunity slip away.
