    This is an important turning point in American education_ We have an historic
    opportunity to work together to make the targeted investments needed to improve our
    schools and help prepare all of our children for the 21st century.

    I welcome the idea of greater flexibility in education for states and school districts; and the
    Senate should approve ed-flex legislation this week that provides for greater flexibility and
    accountability in education, and it should approve an amendment to strengthen
    accountability in this program. But we must do more to give our children a world-class
    education.

    Senators Kennedy and Murray and others will offer an amendment to the ed-flex bill to
    build on our bipartisan efforts begun last year to reduce class size and finish the job by
    authorizing the class size reduction initiative for the next six years. Last year, I proposed this
    initiative to reduce class size in the early grades -- when children learn to read and get a solid
    foundation in the basics --by hiring 100,000 well-prepared teachers over seven years. Congress
    enacted a down payment on this request with bipartisan support, providing a one-time $1.2
    billion appropriation to help communities hire approximately 30,000 teachers nationwide.

    Under the initiative enacted into law last year, school districts will begin to receive funding this
    July 1 in order to hire teachers to begin reducing class sizes this fall. While last year's one-year
    appropriation provided an important start on our initiative, The measure to be offered by
    Senators Kennedy and Murray would authorize a total of $12.6 billion over seven years to help
    communities across the nation support 100,000 well-prepared teachers.

    For the sake of our children and our schools, I am asking you to support this effort to
    reduce class sizes across this nation for years to come.

    This measure will give local school districts full confidence in our resolve to fund this initiative in
    the coming years. It will support effective local planning by signalling our bipartisan
    commitment just when school districts are beginning to make decisions about how to implement
    this new initiative. Most importantly, it will help reduce class size and improve performance in
    reading and basic skills in schools across the nation.

    As parents and teachers across America understand, smaller classes can make a profound
    difference for our children.    Studies show that smaller classes help teachers provide more
    personal attention to students and spend less time on discipline; as a result students learn more
    and get a stronger foundation in the basic skills. Students from smaller classes outperform their
    peers in larger classes, and reduced class size can make the greatest difference for minority and
    disadvantaged students.

    There is no better way to prepare for the 21 st century than investing in quality education for all of
    our children. I look forward to working with you to seize this opportunity to improve education
    by approving this important measure and, as the year progresses, on a broad agenda to strengthen
    the quality of our public schools.
