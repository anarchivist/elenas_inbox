TEXT:
A few weeks ago, a "subcommittee" of our minority issues group drafted a
memo to Sylvia recommending that we convene the civil rights enforcement
officers at the agencies to discuss what could be done to ramp up civil
rights enforcement efforts government-wide.   (This was the same group that
Chris E. and Deval convened when reviewing government affirmative
action). Sylvia agreed and told us to go ahead and asked Chuck to
oversee. But, Susan Liss just let me know that, unbeknownst to us,    you
had already taken the bull by the horns and convened this group.

It probably makes more sense for it to be run from DPC, but, can I find
out what came out of your meeting, since I know Chuck is interested in our
office being involved as this effort goes forward?

Thanks, Elena!
