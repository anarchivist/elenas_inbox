Rahm/Elena:

Here's where we are on the school crime report:

1.  I've drafted a Presidential statement for embargoed release Sunday at
6:30pm.   It's too long, but let me know your thoughts, and I'll tweek it
tomorrow.   Rahm:  I know you asked for a 5: 30 pm embargo, but since .the
President's not doing the event DOJ and Ed prefer to stick to their
standard Sunday night release time. We will revisit tomorrow if need be.

2. Leanne is working on 2 or 3 Q/As that she will circulate later tonight
or first thing tomorrow.  I don't think we need more than the basics.
Substantive Q/As on the report should be bucked to DOJ and Ed.

3.  DOJ and Ed will deliver copies of the report and press packages to
lower press before COB tomorrow.

4. Leanne has a draft of the Reno/Riley letter to the President and will
circulate for comment tomorrow morning.

Let me know if I'm missing anything ... jc3

                         Statement by the President on School Crime

Today, the Attorney General and Secretary of Education forwarded to me an important, but
troubling, study on school crime. Although the study shows that the overall crime rate in our
schools did not change significantly between 1989 and 1995, it confirms that some of our schools
continue to have serious crime problems involving gangs, guns and drugs. Most disturbing, the
study found that the number of students reporting the presence of gangs in their schools has
nearly doubled. This is unacceptable. Students at schools with gang problems are much more
likely to be victimized by violence, have access to drugs or come across guns in their schools.
That is why we must do everything we can to crack down on gangs, and stop guns and drugs
from getting passed the schoolhouse door.

Last year, I sent to Congress a comprehensive anti-gang and youth violence strategy that is based
on what we know works -- tough, targeted deterrence and better prevention. Through this
approach, police and prosecutors in Boston literally disarmed the gangs and brought juvenile gun
murders to a halt for a 2 Y2 year period. Congress should pass this strategy as soon as it returns.
It should also consider the other youth-focused initiatives in my budget: additional ATF agents to
crack down on illegal gun traffickers that supply firearms to our youth; more afterschool
initiatives to make sure kids are safe and supervised; new resources for the Safe and Drug-Free
Schools program; and continued support for a national anti-drug youth media campaign.
Through such a combination of tough enforcement and better prevention, we can help prevent
youth crime and violence before it happens.
