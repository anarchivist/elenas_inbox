TEXT:
The Great American Smokeout, the American Cancer Society's 22nd annual
"commit to quit" day is Thursday November 19th. The President is out of
the country, but perhaps the VP could do an event? Announcement options
include:

1)       New PSAs aimed at parents to urge them to protect their kids,
and smoke outside
         (sponsored by EPA, the American Medical Assoc, Consumer Federation
of Amer)
         Print, radio, and tv ads -- I have the transcript, am getting the
tape.

2)      New ACHPR guidelines for health professionals about how to
promote cessation (I'm
        getting more information ... I think these new guidelines now
include all 5 cessation
        treatments, the previous ones just had 3) .

3)      Direct the Federal Employees Health Plan to enhance coverage
for cessation services

4)      Direct DOL to expand its drug-free workplace initiative to
provide information to
        employers on steps they can take to reduce tobacco use among
employees and OPM
        could disseminate a model workplace cessation program for all
federal agencies.
        (Cost: about $100,000)

5)      Possibly some research related announcement -- this summer at a
National Institute of
Drug Abuse meeting, the VP announced that NCI would devote $38 million
towards
tobacco research. There is apparently a meeting next Thursday and Friday
(11/12&13)
of NCI's scientific advisory board to review proposed tobacco control


research funding
-- thus, the VP could announce the decision on the 19th.
