      IN THE WHITE HOUSE AND AROUND TOWN:


o     Nickles seeks to enforce five
o
-year limit on welfare benefits.
      Senate Majority Whip Don Nickles reportedly plans to push a measure
      aimed at keeping states from exceeding a five
o
-year lifetime limit on
      welfare benefits -- a component of the new welfare law.    After a
      fast
o
-track waiver was approved by the Clinton Administration --
      allowing the District of Columbia to extend benefits past the five-
      year limit -- Nickles drafted legislation to codify the time limit,
      and the GOP leadership made plans to bring it to the floor before
      the close of the l04th Congress. However, before floor action
      occurred, the DC waiver was rescinded. According to a Senate GOP
      leadership source, "HHS had a technical reason for doing that.   But
      basically, they got caught trying to have their cake and eat it,
      too. II
      Although the DC waiver has already been revoked, Nickles still
      wants to pass a bill to set in stone the five
o
-year limit, an aide
      said.   "We want to clarify that the Secretary ofHHS does not have
      waiver authority on time limit provisions," the aide said, adding:
      "Generally, the time limits on welfare benefits were a non-
      controversial idea, accepted as being necessary· for reforming the
      welfare system." The aide said that out of 8 fast track waivers
      approved by the Administration between the time the bill was passed
      and the time it was signed by Clinton, "only the waiver sought by DC
      had virtually no limits.   The way it was constructed and the loose
      definitions that were given for work requirements, et cetera --
      really, there were no time limits in the DC waiver. The waiver
      provided at least a ten
o
-year exemption from the time limits in the
      welfare reform bill. We felt that, because it was a provision
      everyone felt was important and necessary, it should not be
      something that should be subject to change."
      The aide said Nickles and other GOP leaders are still deciding
      whether to move the time
o
-limit provision before the close of the
      l04th Congress.  "We're not sure what form i t ' l l take and what
      vehicle will be used," the aide said, "But Senator Nickles does
      intend to move that ... bill. "
