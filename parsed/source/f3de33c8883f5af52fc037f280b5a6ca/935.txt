TEXT:
Susan Golonka of NGA called to ask about FLSA.   She was hoping that we
would take the opportunity to talk to states about the impact on them
before rushing to make a decision here.  And that they were hoping we
would let them count Medicaid as well as food stamps toward the min.
wage.  She said she's been getting panicked calls from a few states.    (I
obviously kept to our talking points.)
