TEXT:
I have an idea I would like to pursue.  I'm still obsessed by the fact
that the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) has millions to lend or
grant to Latin American countries to improve the safety of their exports
right now, and the money for our efforts won't be available for at least
another year, and even then will be much less than IDB has right now.   I
propose the following: we immediately convene a WH meeting of HHS (FDA &
CDC), USDA, state experts, industry, and other appropriate parties, and
develop a plan, beginning with Latin America, that maps out for the next 5
to 10 years, which countries we are most interested in. We then take that
plan to IDB and learn which of the countries we are interested in·
currently are receiving money that could be used for food safety and which
countries might be eligible for aid but haven't applied. Next we send
U.S. teams to the designated countries and encourage them to either apply
for aid, or to use existing aid to implement food safety programs.  If
this is a success, and I am confident it will be, we can enlist the World
Bank's help next year.
