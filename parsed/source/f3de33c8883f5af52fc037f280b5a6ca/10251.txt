TEXT:
Would you guys be free on Dec. 15 at 2 (other times also work) to meet
with Melody Barnes from Kennedy's office, Laurie Rubner from Chafee's
office, and maybe some House staff?   (Jenny and Broderick -- what do you
think about House staff?). We'd like to talk about the coming year and
the lovely prospect of a return of CCPA and other old favorites.
