              This is a moving target, but here's a draft for the POTUS ( Sunday?) press
              conference similar to what we agreed to last Thursday.  Also, should we
              modify for use by agencies as well (put in Administration's, not
              President's voice).

                                            June 18, 1997
                                             --DRAFT--
o        My staff are closely monitoring the settlement talks among the tobacco industry, state
         attorneys general, public health groups, and private lawyers. Any agreement would have
         to be passed by the Congress.

o        My Administration will carefully review any settlement that emerges from the
         discussions, and we will seek the advice of the public health community. As I have said
         previously, in reviewing any settlement proposal, our focus will stay squarely on
         protecting kids and the public health. The hard, investigative work of the Food and Drug
         Administration and the tough regulations we've begun to put in place have helped bring
         the industry to the table. We're going to proceed with the same intense focus on the
         public health.                                                      .

Q.       Is the Administration trying to help close the deal?

A.       Absolutely not. As I said, my staff are monitoring the talks closely so that we will be in
         a position to evaluate and respond to any possible settlement. But we have not yet
         reached a judgment on the kind of settlement the parties appear to be discussing and are
         not trying to encourage or close the deal.

Q.       Have you started to review the deal?

A.       We have begun a process for reviewing the issues that have been under discussion.
         White House and Agency staff expect to spend the next couple of weeks analyzing the
         details of a possible settlement as they emerge, and consulting with the public health
         community and others.

Q.       How will the review work and how long will it take?

A.       A number of the Federal agencies have a role in tobacco, so the review will be
         coordinated out of the White House. The review will take as long as necessary to
         conduct a careful analysis, but we will seek to work promptly and expeditiously.

Q.       Dr. Kessler and Dr. Koop have asked in a letter to you that you give them 30 days to
         complete their own review before signing off on anything. Are you going to wait?

A.       I intend to very closely consider the views of the public health community prior to
         rendering any judgment on a settlement, and my staff have been in contact with members
         ofthe community during the whole course of these discussions. I am not going to judge
         a deal before I know the views of the public health community, including Dr. Koop and
         Dr. Kessler, but I have not decided on any particular timetable.
