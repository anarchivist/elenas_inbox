TEXT:
Our friends at the Dept. of Labor have worked with Sen. Harkin's staff to
prepare a letter from Sect. Herman to Sen. Harkin to help assure him that
community based organizations will be able to participate in the $3
billion program (so he'll agree to help with the program's appropriations).

It's a good letter.  The meat of it says that they understand the
requirement that private entities must apply "in conjunction with" to mean
that a community based organization may submit an application directly to
the Secretary if the application includes a certification by the entity
that it has consulted with the PIC or political subdivision and the
application is consistent with the welfare-to-work effort of the PIC or
political subdivision.  I think this if fine.

I am less sure about a section of the letter which says it is the
Secretary's expectation to provide for a review process targeting
approximately 60 percent of the competitive grant funding to the cities,
30 percent for rural areas, and 10 percent for private entitites including
community based organizations.    Do we want to put this out there?   It
(the 10%) will make Harkin happy and it does probably reflect what we'll
do, but I wanted to make sure you're comfortable.
