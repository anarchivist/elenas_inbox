New Partnership to Prescribe Reading and Ensure That Children Who Come to the Doctor Have ~
Access to Books. The First Lady is pleased to announce that a new national partnership has been createil
to prescribe reading to infants and toddlers. Pediatricians, hospitals, health centers, book publishers,
libraries and others are coming together to make sure that infants and toddlers who come to the doctor
have access to books and are read to regularly. The American Academy of Pediatrics is recommending
that pediatricians prescribe reading to infants and toddlers as part of standard pediatric care.

The New Partnership Has Already Secured:
- More than 250,000 books to be distributed through health clinics and centers around the country;
- Commitments to train 10,000 pediatricians and 950 community health centers to prescribe reading
   and provide books to hundreds of thousands of children by the year 2000.

The Partnership, Led by Scholastic Inc., First Book, and Reach Out and Read, includes the
American Academy of Pediatrics, National Association of Community Health Centers, National
Association of Children's Hospitals and Related Institutions, American Library Association, Random
House, Irving Harris and the Harris Foundation, Annie E. Casey Foundation, American Booksellers
Association, Association of American Publishers, Mellon Trust, Dreyfus Corporation, ABC Television,
Reading Is Fundamental, National Association of Chain Drug Stores, and the National Community
Pharmacists Association, and seeks additional partners.

Under the Reach Out and Read program, volunteers read to children in waiting rooms, health care
providers prescribe reading, use books in well-visits, and give books to children at the end of a visit.
This model program is already being used in more than 80 health centers and hospitals around the country.

Call to Ensure That by the Year 2000 Every Child Under Age Five Is Read to Regularly. The First
Lady is calling for every community to come together using its local library in partnership with local
health providers to help encourage reading to young children and ensure that every child under age five is
read to regularly by the year 2000. Today, only 39% of parents with children under three read to their
children daily [Commonwealth Fund, 1996]. Research shows that when doctors prescribe reading and give books
to low-income parents and their children, these parents arefour times more likely to read to their children
[AMA, AlDC, 8/91].


Response to the President's America Reads Challenge and the First Lady's Call for a National
Effort to Prescribe Reading to Infants and Toddlers. Today's announcement is in direct response to
the First Lady's call in January for a national effort to build on the existing efforts to prescribe reading--
by programs such as Reach Out and Read and the American Library Association's Born to Read -- and to
the President's America Reads Challenge to help parents be their children's first teachers and ensure that
every child can read well by the end of third grade.

The White House Conference on Early Childhood Development and Learning Will Underscore the
Importance of Reading to Infants and Toddlers. The White House Conference on Early Childhood
Development and Learning: What New Research on the Brain Tells Us About Our Youngest Children will
explore new research that shows that reading to children in their first few years actually helps their brain
to grow in addition to enhancing their emotional and social development and laying the groundwork for
vocabulary and later educational success.
