Subject:         ed strategy meeting stuff

At the meeting we need to:
1. Light a fire to get policy development process moving reo big SOTU
issues (teacher quality, standards, choice,)

2.   Consider key strategic choices:
  New ideas vs. status quo aproach to ESEA reauthorization --
Congressional dems may want to simply hold on to what weD,ve got; RO,s
will push block grants and vouchers;
 New ideas as legislative proposals vs. budget requests and executive
action/bully pUlpit -- No one thinks Congress will pass any El/Sec
legislation in its first session; how do we ensure some victories/progress
at the end of the year?
 How do we approach Class Size next year     seek authorization; mandatory
vs." discretionary; another appropriations fight?

possible directions for specific issues

1.  Standards/Assessment/Accountability
 Options for moving forward on national standards and tests:
 seek explicit authorization as part of NAEP/NAGB (or ESEA)
reauthorization;
 seek private funding for our testing proposal
 work with ACHIEVE or others to create standards and tests from the
D&bottom upD8--by developing measure of aligned to common content
standards across states or cities
 endorse existing standards (e.g., New Standards)
 require use of national tests (or assessments aligned to NAEP achievement
levels) as measure of effectiveness of Title 1

Talk to: Schwartz, Finn, Tucker, Ambach, Casserly, Ravitch, NEA, AFT,


Bingaman, Romer ...

 Advancing agenda for ending social promotions
 Keep as condition of Education Opportunity Zones II proposal
 Require states/districts to have requirement that kids meet standards at
key transition points in order to be promoted as part of Title 1
 Develop a series of bully pulpit activities, building on release of EDO,s
Guide to Ending Social Promotions

 Strengthening Accountability for Results
 Incentives for states to close achievement gaps
 Tie funding to results (as in Education Opportunity Zones -- districts
eligible if they show they have already achieved results; continued
funding dependent upon increased achievement)

2.  Public School Choice
 Make choice (more) universally available as condition of receiving some
federal education funds (Title l??? son of Goals 2000???)
 Provide support for specific choice models (magnet schools, interdistrict
choice, postsecondary enrollment options, work-site schools)

3. Teacher Quality
 Expand funding for Title II recruitment/preparation programs
 State teacher training academies (e.g., in reading, math, science, etc.)
using proven practices
 Incentives for Board-certified teachers to teach in Title 1 schools
 State and local teacher quality (block) grants to address:
State
         upgrading licensure/certification/testing
 mentoring/induction
 training/professional development
 performance-based teacher evaluation/quality standards
 teacher accountability: rewarding success and removing incompetence
 State accountability for specific performance measures (e.g., decrease
number of teachers with emergency certification and teaching out-of-field;
student achievement gains tied to quality measures


Local
         improved recruitment/hiring
 mentoring/induction
 training/professional development
 performance-based teacher evaluation/quality standards
 teacher accountability: rewarding success and removing incompetence
 Local accountability for specific performance measures (e.g., decrease
number of teachers with emergency certification and teaching out-of-field;
student achievement gains tied to quality measures




4.  National education summit???
 How do we mark the 10-yr. anniversary of the Charlottesville education
summit (9/99) and the 2000 timeline for the National Education Goals
 Should we continue to have national education goals and if so, what
should be the process for establishing them and for tracking progress
toward achieving them?
(Note: NGA and NEGP is wrestling with same issues; current plan is to
defer any decision until after new governors come on board. CarperO,s
theme for year as chariman is raising student achievement through


technology, standards/accountability, and extended learning time.    POTUS
will be invi''ted to NGA August meeting, which will be devoted entirely to
these topics; NGA possibly will add « day session after meeting to deal
with summit anniversary/goals
