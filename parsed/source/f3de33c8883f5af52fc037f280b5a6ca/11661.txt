TEXT:
Elena: Neal came away from this morning's senior staff meeting with the
impression that Podesta wants DPC, OSTP and other interested EOP offices
to discuss the possible Tiahrt amendment to the supplemental approps to
ban federal support for human embryonic stem cell research (we haven't
seen the language).   Subcommittee mark-up is set for 1:00 pm today.
Since I don't think we can do much at this point to influence the mark-up,
why don't we wait and see where we are at the end of the day.  We can
getting together tomorrow if needed. Cliff
