If same-sex marriage soon becomes legal in Hawai, as this writter
suggests, we will quickly have to deal with a whole serier of legal/policy
questions that I don't think we are really now prepared for.

SAME-SEX UNION COMING
Deb Price

From its perch atop Hawai'i's judicial branch, the state's farsighted
Supreme Court can, no doubt, see just how close same-sex marriage is to
becoming a reality.

That legal miracle is probably only months away.  It's absolutely critical
that it occur before November 1998, when Hawai'i's voters will be asked
whether to amend their constitution to let lawmakers block same-sex
marriage.

Dan Foley, attorney for the three same-sex couples suing for marriage
licenses, expects the Hawai'i Supreme Court to announce soon whether it
will hold oral arguments.  "Once we get (a court) order, we can expect a
(final) decision within a number of months," Foley predicts. "We're just
waiting.

"I don't think there's any question -- when the decision comes down --
what it will be," Foley adds with well-placed confidence.  "Everybody
knows there's really nothing to decide because the state abysmally failed
to meet its burden."

In a preliminary ruling, the Hawai'i Supreme Court declared in 1993 that
refusing to grant marriage licenses to same-sex couples is sex
discrimination, which Hawai'i's constitution prohibits.   The court's
conclusion rested on a simple fact.  No one, regardless of sexual
orientation, is allowed to marry someone of the same sex.


A three-member majority of Hawai'i's top court sent the case back to a
lower court, demanding the state prove a "compelling" reason for the
discrimination. The state's attempts have failed miserably. As a result,
Judge Kevin Chang ruled in favor of same-sex marriage last December, and
the case is now back before the Hawai'i Supreme Court.

After flailing about trying to concoct a believable "compelling" reason,
the state has switched its chief argument.  Gone almost entirely is the
"children would suffer" claim, which the state's own witnesses demolished
during an embarrassing two-week trial a year ago. The state has turned to
mainland hired guns for legal help.  But, having already had all its
arguments shot down, the state has been reduced to begging the Hawai'i
Supreme Court to say its ruling of "sex discrimination" was wrong in the
first place.

That's a sign of total desperation because all three justices who gave us
that decision are still on the court.' And three votes are all we need on
the five-member court to legalize same-sex marriage.

The historic 1993 decision was written by Justice Steven Levinson.   It was
supported by Ronald Moon, now chief justice, and Paula Nakayama. A more
recent appointee, Justice Mario Ramil, is an unknown on gay issues but is
considered a pro-consumer, pro-worker, progressive Democrat. Chief Justice
Moon will appoint someone to cast the fifth vote.  (Justice Robert Klein
won't participate because he heard the case as a lower court judge.)

If the court doesn't rule soon, the November 1998 vote on amending the
constitution could be devastating.

Polls show most Hawai'i voters oppose same-sex marriage but are evenly
split over amending the constitution. But if gay couples start legally
marrying before the election, voters will actually face a very different
issue: Should citizens lose rights they already have? That would make it
much more likely that same-sex marriage would win not only in the courts
but also at the ballot box.

In July, the Hawai'i Supreme Court rejected the state's plea for it to
intentionally delay its ruling until after the November 1998 vote.  It's a
positive sign that the court rebuffed the state's insulting suggestion
that, instead of protecting rights, it should wait to see if those rights
are amended out of existence.

Meanwhile, two Hawai'i federal cases bear watching. The first questions
whether the state's new "reciprocal beneficiaries" law -- giving many
marriage-like benefits to partners who can't legally marry -- covers
private employers' health plans. The other will decide whether Hawai'i
must vote again on whether to hold a constitutional convention, a
potential nightmare.

Marriage can be the union of a man and woman, a man and man or a woman and
woman. That's already the emotional reality. Count on the Hawai'i
Supreme Court to make it a legal reality as well.
