TEXT:
Elizabeth and I have been working with her law school intern on an options
memo.  I received a draft of the memo this afternoon.   Eliz and I will
need to discuss-- we can try to do this later this evening.   I am hopeful
that we could give you a draft to look at tomorrow afternoon.   Is this too
late?

Subject:         Distilled Spirits call

As I mentioned last week they've been holding off making calls to your
offices.   I've just received another call from Tim Dudgeon, head of
Federal Gov't Relations, Distilled Spirits Council, requesting an update.
They are almost to .the point of unleashing a public campaign on their
request for a WH meeting. We need an answer to their letter to POTUS.
I'm sure they will start calling you by end of week if I don't tell them
something.
·


    In addition, according to Dudgeon, Sen. Daschle is getting ready to call
    Erskine on this.

    We need to do something and I need to give them some kind of update today
    if at all possible.

    Please help.
