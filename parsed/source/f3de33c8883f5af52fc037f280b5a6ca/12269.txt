                                         A BILL
      To assist institutions of higher education help at-risk students stay in school and
complete their 4-year postsecondary academic programs.

       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
of America in Congress assembled, this Act may be cited as the "College Completion
Challenge Grant Program of 1999


                                 PROGRAM AUTHORIZED

        SEC. 101. Subpart 2, Chapter A of title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965

(20 U.S.C. 1132a et seq.) is amended by adding at the end thereof the following new

chapter:



               "CHAPTER 4--COLLEGE COMPLETION CHALLENGE GRANT

PROGRAM



                                         "FINDINGS

        "SEC.408A. Congress makes the following findings:

               "(1) Students from low-income families are significantly more likely to

leave a 4-year institution of higher education without a baccalaureate degree than are

students with higher incomes.

               "(2) Even among students with above average grades, low-income

students are still more likely to leave a 4-year institution of higher education without a

baccalaureate degree than are students with higher incomes, especially low-income

students enrolled at private institutions.

               "(3) This lack of persistence to completion of a baccalaureate degree

continues to contribute to the gap in educational attainment and ultimate income levels



                    1
                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion
between disadvantaged students and their more affluent classmates.

               "(4) While the focus of Federal student financial assistance and higher

education programs has traditionally been to ensure access to postsecondary

education, the Federal Government should expand its role in student financial

assistance programs for postsecondary education to address this lack of persistence to

baccalaureate degree completion.

               "(5) The amount of grant assistance provided to postsecondary students

is critical to their perSistence and degree attainment.

               "(6) In addition to economic disadvantage, the following factors

significantly contribute to a student dropping out of a 4-year institution of higher

education:

                       "(A) a delayed entry into postsecondary education after

graduating from high school.

                       "(8) a low grade point average.

                       "(C) working full-time while enrolled.

                       "(D) being a first-generation college student.

                       "(E) being less engaged with an academic program.

               "(7) Most students, particularly those at the greatest risk of leaving their

programs of study without a baccalaureate degree, leave during the first two years of

study.

               "(8) At-risk students that receive targeted support services persist to

degree completion at higher rates than at-risk students who do not receive such

services.

               "(9) Educators interested in student retention have long viewed intensive

summer programs for incoming first-year students as very important in helping students


                   2
                                                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion

from disadvantaged backgrounds become acclimated to college life and in improving

retention.

                           "PURPOSE AND PROGRAM AUTHORITY

        "SEC.408B. (a) PURPOSE.--The purpose of this program is to assist

degrees.

       "(b) PROGRAM AUTHORIZED.-- From funds appropriated pursuant to section

408G for each fiscal year, the Secretary shall, in accordance with the requirements of

               "(2) MULTIPLE GRANTS.--An institution that receives a grant under this

chapter may compete to receive a subsequent grant, but may only receive a maximum

a waiver of the matching requirement pursuant to section 395 or section 515.

       "(c) COORDINATION REQUIREMENT.--Each eligible institution shall ensure

that the activities provided under this chapter are, to the extent practicable, coordinated

with, complement, and enhance related serVices under other Federal and non-Federal

programs, and do not duplicate the services already provided at that institution.

           "(d) SUPPLEMENT, NOT SUPPLANT.--Funds under this chapter shall be used

    to supplement, and not supplant, non-Federal funds expended for existing programs.

           "Sec. 408E. AUTHORIZED ACTIVITIES.--(a) IN GENERAL.--An eligible

    institution that receives a grant under this chapter shall, except as provided in

    subsection (b), use the grant to provide services or assistance to students at risk of

    leaving their programs of study without baccalaureate degrees, particularly economically

    disadvantaged students, by carrying out one or more of the following:

                   "(1) Implementing an intensive summer program for incoming first-year

    students (or students entering their second or third year of postsecondary education if

    the institution can demonstrate that it is addressing the needs of first-year students and

    that a summer program could help retention of second- or third-year students at risk of

    dropping out), provided that the institution demonstrates in its application that it has a

    strong commitment to student retention through additional activities.

                   "(2) Developing a strong student support service program, targeted to

    students in their first two years of postsecondary education, that includes activities such

    as:

                           "(A) peer tutoring;

                           "(8) mentoring programs involving faculty or upper class

    students;

                           "(C) activities to assist students currently enrolled in a 2-year

    institution to secure admission and financial assistance in a 4-year program of

    postsecondary education;

                           "(D) activities to assist students in securing admission and


                       5
                                                                                          Hex-Dump Conversion

     financial assistance for enrollment in graduate and professional programs;

                                 "(E) assistance in course selection; and

                                 "(F) cultural events.

                     "(3) Providing grants to students in their first two years of postsecondary

     education, in an amount not less than required under subsection (c), except that a

     recipient that provides grants under this paragraph shall also provide services under

     paragraphs (1) or (2), or both.

             "(b) SPECIAL RULE.--A recipient of a grant under this chapter may serve

     students who have completed their first two years of college if it can demonstrate, on a

     case by case basis, that these students are at high risk of dropping out, and that it has

     already met the needs of its first- and second-year students.

             "(c) GRANT SIZE.--(1) IN GENERAL.--The Secretary may, by regulation,

     establish minimum student grant award levels for purposes of subsection (a)(3), taking

     into account such factors as the different costs of attendance associated with public and

     private institutions.

                     "(2) EXCEPTION.--If the Secretary does not establish minimum student

     grant award levels under paragraph (1), or if an institution wishes to provide grants

     under subsection (a)(3) in an amount less than the minimum set by the Secretary, the

     institution shall demonstrate in its application, to the satisfaction of the Secretary, that

     the size of the grants it will provide is appropriate and likely to have a significant effect

     on the persistence problem at that institution.

shall not be considered in determining that student's need for grant or work assistance

under this title, except that in no case shall the total amount of student financial

assistance awarded to a student under this title exceed that student's cost of

attendance, as defined by section 472.

(a) for any fiscal year, the Secretary may reserve up to 1 percent of such amount for

that fiscal year in order to carry out an evaluation of the program authorized by this

chapter.".

 \par
 \par I am pleased to submit for your consideration the "College Completion Chal
 lenge Grant Act of 1999", a legislative proposal that would assist institutions
  of higher education to expand their efforts}{\b\fs24     }{\fs24 to increase the
 rate at which low-income and other at-risk students complete baccalaureate degr
 ee programs.


\par
\par Students from low-income families are significantly more. likely to leave a
 4-year institution of higher education without a baccalaureate degree than are
 students from families} {\b\fs24 }{\fs24 with higher incomes.}{\fs24\cfl Only
 44 percent of students from low-income families who were enrolled full-time du
ring their first year of college complete a baccalaureate degree within five ye
ars. This completion rate is 24 percentage points lower than the 68 percent co
mpletion rate among students from upper-income families.
\par
\par In addition to economic disadvantage, a recent report by the National Cent
er for Education Statistics, }{\fs24\ul\cfl Stopouts or Stayouts? Undergraduat
es Who Leave College in Their First Year}{\fs24\cfl , concludes that there are
a number of factors significantly associated with students dropping out of a fo
ur-year college or university.   These factors include having a low- to failing-
 cumulative GPA (under 2.0); delaying entry into postsecondary education after
graduating from high school; being less engaged with their academic program; wo
rking full time while enrolled; and being a first-generation college student.
This legislative proposal would allow institutions of higher education to help
mitigate those factors most significantly associated with the failure to comple
te baccalaureate degree programs.
\par }{\fs24\cf6
\par }{\fs24\cfl Specifically, there are three different forms of services}{\b\
fs24\cfl   }{\fs24\cfl or assistance that an institution could provide under the
 proposed new College Completion Challenge Grant Program.    An institution could
 implement an intensive summer program, develop strong student support services
, provide direct grant aid to students, or a combination of these activities. I
ntensive summer programs could be provided only if}{\b\fs24\cfl }{\fs24\cfl th
e institution demonstrates in its application that it has a strong commitment t
o student retention}{\fs22\cfl through additional activities.}{\fs24\cfl Supp
ort services under the proposed new program could include} {\b\fs24\cfl }{\fs24
\cfl peer tutoring, mentor programs, actfvities to assil'lt students currently en
rolled in a 2-year institution to secure admission and financial assistance in
a 4-year program of postsecondary education, activities to assist students in s
ecuring admission and financial assistance for graduate and professional progra
ms, assistance in course selection, and cultural events.    If an institution cho
se to provide grants to students under the proposed new College Completion Chal
lenge Grant Program, it would be required to}{\b\fs24\cfl }{\fs24\cfl do so in
 combination with at least one of the other two authorized activities and those
 grants would have to meet certain minimum amounts and}{\b\fs24\cfl     }{\fS24\cf
1 would supplement other Federal grant assistance, such as Federal Pell Grants.

\par
\par
\par While each institution would determine which combination of services and a
ssistance to offer for its at risk students, the particular services and assist
ance that would be available under this proposal are designed to address the fa
ctors most significantly associated with the failure to complete baccalaureate
degree programs.   Support services and intensive summer programs would help to
address the factors of the low GPA, less engagement with the academic program a
nd first-generation college student status.   Intensive summer programs offered
for students entering their first year of postsecondary education would also he
lp prevent students from delaying their entry into college.    Finally, a subs tan
tial increase in grant aid would reduce some students' need to work full time w
hile enrolled, and address some of the concerns of a first generation college s
tudent regarding student loan debt burden and the availability of adequate fina
ncial aid.
\par
\par Since low-income and at-risk students are most likely to leave a program 0
f postsecondary education} {\b\fs24\cfl }{\fs24\cfl during. the first two years,
 an institution would generally be required to}{\b\fs24\cfl }{\fS24\cfl focus


services and assistance on students in their first two years of postsecondary e
ducation. Although this program would require institutions to target students i
n their first two years of postsecondary education, an institution could serve
students who have completed their first two years if it could demonstrate, on a
 case-by-case basis, that these students are at high risk of leaving without th
eir baccalaureate degrees, and that it has already met the needs of its first-
and second-year students.
\par
\par This legislative proposal would help to eliminate the discrepancy that cur
rently exists in baccalaureate degree attainment rates for students of low- and
 high-income families by supporting the specific activities that research has s
hown to improve student retention for students at-risk of leaving a 4-year inst
itution without a baccalaureate degree.}{\b\fs24\cf1    }{\fs24\cf1 It would bui
ld on the successes of TRIO's Student Support Services Program under section 40
2D of title IV of the Higher Education Act and student financial assistance pro
grams by combining selected elements of each and narrowly focusing that comb ina
tion of services and assistance on at-risk students in the early years of posts
econdary education>.   It would also build on the successes of the participating
 institutions,}{\b\fs24\cf1 }{\fs24\cf1 requiring institutions to demonstrate
a prior successful commitment to helping low-income and other at-risk students
stay in school until they complete their baccalaureate degrees.    I urge the sp
eedy enactment of the "College Completion Challenge Grant Act of 1999" by Congr
ess.   It would help to}{\b\fs24\cf1 }{\fs24\cf1 ensure that all Americans not
only have access to postsecondary education, but also the support}{\b\fs24\cf1
  }{\fs24\cf1 necessary to ensure that they complete that education and receive
their degrees.

the submission of this proposal to the congress and that its adoption would be
in accord with the program of the President.

                  THE COLLEGE COMPLETION ACT OF1999
                        Section-by-Section Analysis

        Section 101. Section 101 of the bill would amend subpart 2, Part A of title
IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1132a et seq., hereinafter
referred to as the Act) by adding a new chapter 4, authorizing the College
Completion Challenge Grant Program.

       Proposed new section 408A of the Act would set out the Congressional
findings for the new chapter. Students from low-income families are significantly
more likely to leave a 4-year institution of higher education without a
baccalaureate degree than are students with higher incomes. Specifically, the
baccalaureate degree attainment rate for full-time students from families from
the bottom income quartile was 23.9 percentage points less than the rate for full-
time students from families from the top income quartile (44.5% vs. 68.4%).

        Even among students with above average grades, low-income students
are still more likely to leave a 4-year institution of higher education without a
baccalaureate degree than are students with higher incomes, especially at
private institutions. Contributing to the gap in educational attainment between
disadvantaged students and their more affluent classmates is the fact that the
focus of Federal student financial assistance and higher education programs has
traditionally been to ensure access to postsecondary education, and not on the
lack of persistence to a baccalaureate degree. The amount of grant assistance
provided to postsecondary students is also critical to their persistence and
degree attainment. Through this bill, the Federal Government would expand its
role in student financial assistance programs for postsecondary education to
address this lack of persistence to baccalaureate degree completion.

        In addition to economic disadvantage, a number of other factors
contribute significantly to a student dropping out of a 4-year institution of higher
education. Those factors include: a delayed entry into postsecondary education
after graduating from high school; a low grade point average; working full-time
while enrolled; being a first-generation college student; and being less engaged
with an academic program. Grants to institutions under this program would
assist these institutions in providing services that could mitigate the effects of
these factors on a student's likelihood of dropping out of a 4-year institution of
higher education.

        Further, most students, particularly those at the greatest risk of leaving
their programs of study without a baccalaureate degree, leave during the first two
years of study. Nearly half of all low-income students will have dropped out of
                                                                          Hex-Dump (';onversion

their programs of study by the end of the second year, as compared to only 27
percent of higher income students.

       Additionally, at-risk students that receive targeted support services persist
to degree completion at higher rates than do at-risk students who do not receive
such services. The Department's on-going evaluation of the Student Support
Services program has shown that support services do make a significant
difference on three separate student outcomes - -grades, credits earned and
retention. The effects, although not large, usually persist over three years.
Students' grade point averages were increased by a mean of 0.15 in the first
year, 0.11 in the second year, and 0.11 in the first three years combined. The
number of credits earned was increased by a mean of 1.25 in first year, 0.79 in
the second year, 0.71 in the third year, and 2.25 in the first three years
combined. Retention at the same institution to the second year was increased by
7 percent, and by 9 percent for retention to the third year. Retention to the third
year at any institution of higher education was increased by 3 percent. These
results could be improved by combining these kinds of services with the other
services that would be offered by this program.

        Finally, educators interested in student retention have long viewed
intensive summer programs for incoming first-year students as very important in
helping students from disadvantaged backgrounds become acclimated to college
life and in improving retention. This program would provide, at the most valuable
time, the kinds of services most likely to achieve retention for those students
most at risk of leaving their programs of study without their baccalaureate
degrees.

         Proposed new section 40B8 of the Act would establish the program's
statement of purpose and program authority. Under proposed new section
4088(a), the purpose of this chapter would be to assist institutions of higher
education to help students who are at risk of ending their postsecondary
education prior to obtaining a baccalaureate degree, particularly those who are
economically disadvantaged, to stay in school until they complete their
baccalaureate degrees. Proposed new section 40B8(b) would authorize the
Secretary, from funds appropriated for each fiscal year and in accordance with
the requirements of this chapter, to award competitive grants to eligible
institutions to enable them to pay the Federal share of the costs of carrying out
programs designed to meet the purpose stated in proposed new section
4088(a).

         Proposed new section 40BC of the Act would establish the institutional
eligibility requirements for receiving a grant under this chapter. Section 40BC(a)
would provide that eligible applicants for grants under this chapter would be
institutions of higher education that meet the requirements of section 102 of the
Act, the definition of an institution of higher education used for purposes of title
IV, and that award baccalaureate or associate degrees. An institution that
                                                                         Hex-DiJmp Conversion

03/10/109:01 AM DRAFT--NOT CLEARED BY ED OR OMB
awards only associate degrees, however, could apply for a grant under this
chapter only if it applied as part of a consortium that included one or more
institutions of higher education that awarded baccalaureate degrees. Proposed
new section 408C would also establish the requirement that an institution that
receives a grant under this chapter may receive no more than two such grants.

         Proposed new section 4080 of the Act would establish the application
process requirements. Proposed new section 4080(a) would provide that an
applicant that desires a grant under this chapter must submit to the Secretary an
application at such time and containing such information as the Secretary may
prescribe. Proposed new section 4080 would also require that an applicant
demonstrate in its application, to the satisfaction of the Secretary, its prior
successful commitment to assisting institutions of higher education to help
students who are at risk of ending their postsecondary education prior to
obtaining a baccalaureate degree stay in school until they complete those
degrees. While students are primarily responsible for their own success,
institutions have a responsibility to assist them, particularly those students at-risk
of failing to complete their baccalaureate degrees. The new program is therefore
intended to assist institutions that have made efforts to increase the retention of
students.

        Proposed new section 4080(b) would describe the matching requirement
for institutions that receive a grant under this chapter. Proposed new section
4080(b)(1) provides that the Federal share of the cost of the program must be
not more than 50%, and the matching funds must be from non-Federal sources.
However, the Secretary intends to use his authority under section 395 of the Act
to waive this matching requirement for institutions eligible for assistance under
Part A or B of title III, and under section 515 of the Act to waive the matching
requirement for institutions eligible for assistance under title V-Historically Black
Colleges and Universities, Hispanic-serving institutions, and other institutions of
higher education that have relatively low educational and general expenditures
and serve low-income students. The Secretary also intends to regulate on the
matching requirement, as it would apply to a consortium of institutions in which
only some of the institutions would be eligible for the waiver of the matching
requirement.

       Proposed new section 4080(c) of the Act would require institutions
applying for a grant to ensure that the activities it would provide if it received a
grant under this chapter would be coordinated with, complement, and enhance
related services under other programs, and would not duplicate services already
provided at that institution. Proposed new section 4080(d) of the Act would
provide that funds under this chapter would have to be used to supplement, and
not supplant, non-Federal funds expended for existing programs.

       Proposed new section 408E of the Act details the authorized uses of
funds received under this chapter. Proposed new section 408E(a) would require
                                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion

  an institution, except as provided in subsection (b), to use a grant to provide
  services or assistance to students at risk of leaving their programs of study
. without baccalaureate degrees, particularly economically disadvantaged students
  to carry out one or more of three types of allowable activities. The three types of
  activities for which institutions could use funds received under this chapter would
  be: intensive summer programs, student support services, and grants for
  students. While summer intensive programs have been shown to be effective in
  increasing student persistence, they are only effective when the institution is
  committed to student retention. Therefore, institutions could implement an
  intensive summer program for incoming first-year students, (or students entering
  their second or third year of postsecondary education if the institution can
  demonstrate that it is addressing the needs of its first-year students and that a
  summer program could help retention of second- or third-year students at risk of
  dropping out), but could do so only if they could demonstrate a strong
  commitment to student retention through other activities.

        Under proposed new section 40BE(a)(2), an institution could also use
funds under this chapter to develop a strong student support service program,
targeted to students in their first two years of postsecondary education. This
could include activities such as peer tutoring; mentoring by faculty or upper class
students; activities to assist students currently enrolled in a 2-year institution
secure admission and financial assistance in a 4-year program of postsecondary
education; activities to assist students in securing admission and financial
assistance for enrollment in graduate and professional programs; course
selection assistance; and cultural events.

        Finally, proposed new section 40BE(a)(3) would provide that institutions
could use funds received under this chapter to provide grants to students in their
first two years of postsecondary education, but only if it also provided an
intensive summer program for incoming first-year students, or developed a
student support service program, targeted to students in their first two years of
postsecondary education, or both. The goal of the program is not simply to
create another Federal grant program. The grant aid provided under the new
program would be in the context of specific efforts to increase student success.

         Although this program would require institutions to target services to
students in their first two years of postsecondary education, proposed new
section 40BE(b) would allow an institution to serve students who have completed
their first two years only if it could demonstrate, on a case-by-case basis, that
these students are at high risk of leaving their programs of study without
baccalaureate degrees, and that it has already met the needs of its first- and
second-year students. While most students leave during the first two years of
study, some do leave during the subsequent years. For example, many students
fail to make the transition from a 2-year institution to a 4-year institution. This
                                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion
03/10/109:01 AM DRAFT--NOT CLEARED BY ED OR OMB
program could allow institutions to provide services to those students even after
completing two years of postsecondary education_

       Proposed new section 408E(c)(1) of the Act would provide the Secretary
with the authority to set, by regulation, a minimum student grant award level for
those institutions that provide grants to students_ In setting a minimum student
grant award level, the Secretary would take into account such factors as the
different costs of attendance associated with public and private institutions. If
the Secretary did not establish a minimum student grant award, or if an institution
wanted to provide a grants below the minimum set by the Secretary, proposed
new section 4080(c)(2) would require the institution to demonstrate in its
application, to the satisfaction of the Secretary, that the size of the grants it
would provide were appropriate and likely to have a significant effect on the
persistence problem at that institution.

         Proposed new section 408F of the Act would describe how a grant to a
student would affect the calculation of that student's need for other title IV
assistance. Under proposed new section 408F, a grant provided to a student by
an eligible institution from an award made under this chapter would not be
considered in determining that student's need for grant, or work assistance under
title IV of the Act. However, the total amount of financial assistance awarded to
a student under title IV, including a grant provided under this chapter, could not
exceed that student's cost of attendance, as defined by section 472 of the Act.

       Proposed new section 408G(a) of the Act would authorize the
appropriation of $35,000,000 to carry out this program for fiscal year 2000, and
such sums as may be necessary for each of the 4 succeeding fiscal years.
Proposed new section 408G(b) of the Act would authorize the Secretary to
reserve up to 1% of the appropriation for that fiscal year in order to carry out an
evaluation of the program authorized by this chapter.

      Section 102. Section 102 of the bill would state that this bill is effective on
October 1, 1999.
