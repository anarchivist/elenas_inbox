Hopefully, you have time to review the information I faxed to you on Feb.
7 regarding the National Association of Commissions for Women (NACW)
briefing our Office is hosting in the Indian Treaty Room next Thursday,
Feb. 27, from 3:30 - 5:30 p.m.

We will be happy to work with you on what 15 - 20 minute block that best
fits with your busy schedules on that day. Other invited speakers
include:  L.D. Acheson from Justice (confirmed); Joan Lombardi from HHS
(confirmed); and Larry Irving from Commerce (invited).

Please e-mail or call me at 6-7310 at your earliest convenience to confirm
your participation and address questions or concerns you might have.
Thanks for your assistance in what will be a memorable event for these 30
women board members and commission associates.
