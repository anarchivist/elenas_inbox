TEXT:
They are clearly right on those.  Congress went out of its way to make
FEC enforcement as cumbersome and inefficient as possible.  For example,
the statute requires that even a simple decision to investigate a matter
must be formally approved by the Commission.   There is also no wiggle
room under the statute on foreign contributions. Justice does have the
ability to proceed independently in the case of criminal (not civil)
violations but I am not sure what we want to do with that.

Although we obviously do not want to interfere with our current efforts on
behalf of McCain-Feingold,  we may want to consider, at some point, the
advisability of offering legislation that addresses only FEC reform
issues. This should including streamlining enforcement, requiring more
frequent candidate disclosure filings, and breaking the partisan 3-3
logjam that is endemic to FEC decisionmaking.
