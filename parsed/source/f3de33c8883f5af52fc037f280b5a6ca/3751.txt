I guess our veto threat didn't go over very well.

Hi.

I need to give you what I hope is some helpful guidance.

April Mellody asked for my input for McCurry about the Labor/HHS spending
bill and, in the course of that conversation, she shared with me the
talking points that you had prepared for McCurry.

With regard to veto threats -- especially in the name of the President --
the White House has a very tightly structured process that includes
Erskine, Frank, and other relevant players in deciding whether we're going
to issue them.

Seeing your talking points, I had assumed that the White House made a
decision about the Goodling amendment.  But when I ran i t by Frank as a
final check, he said that no such decision was made.

Anyway, I'd be happy to work with you on such potential veto threats in
the future -- and Bruce or you obviously can work directly with Frank and
Jack Lew.

Thanks for listening.     I hope this helps.
