TEXT:
Senate Finance just called to invited Lew to testify before the Full
Committee on March 10 re:  tobacco recoupment. Also testifying would be
Nancy Ann Min, Dan Crippen (CBO) , and 2 state AGs.  Lew does not think he
has much of a choice but to testify.   He wanted to make sure that you
concurred.
