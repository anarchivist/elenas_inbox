TEXT:
On Monday afternoon, as part of it's meeting, APWA (Yes, I'm still using
the old name until I absolutely have to add one more letter) is holding a
forum called "Implementing Welfare Reform: A View From the States".   The
forum will include a panel of state administrators from TN, OR, and IA
talking about "Implementing TANF: Issues and Outcomes", another panel from
MO, CO, and NY talking about "CCDF: implementation and challenges", and
video from MS called "Heat of the Moment" promoting teen abstinence.   The
two panels will take questions from the 4 key H, S, Rand D staffers for
TANF and child care.   From what I've heard from APWA staff, I'd anticipate
some discussion about:
Financing issues: cuts in Title XX, limit on Title XX transfer, state
rainy day funds, why low draw down of TANF funds does not mean Congress
should cut the program (One of the big issues states are citing is that
with falling caseloads, they are spending state money first to ensure they
meet MOE requirements.   Some states are also saying they committed a lot
more money than the draw down would indicate--i.e. there's a lag).
Need for better coordination among federal programs, especially TANF and
food stamps and importance of strengthening links to make sure people
continue getting food stamps, medicaid even if they go off TANF.
Cost allocation
TANF and child care data reporting issues.
What states are doing to expand eligibility for child care, increase
reimbursement, reduce co-pays, etc while also being concerned about
opening up the floodgates.
Innovative things states are doing, and challenges with serving those with
multiple barriers.


I have agenda and speakers list for the forum if anyone wants to see it
