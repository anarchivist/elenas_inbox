Andrea would like to attend the NGA Center for Best Practices' annual
Workforce Development Policy Forum in Riverside, CA. on December 10-12.
The topic this year is Job Retention and Career Advancement for the
Working Poor. The meeting will bring together state and local welfare
reform and workforce officials, as well as some employers, researchers,
and private program operators to discuss best practices and strategies to
help both welfare recipients and other low-wage, entry level workers
succeed on the job and develop skills that will help them advance to
better jobs.

There will also be sessions on enhancing the prospects of the working poor
through non-earned income including child support (with a particular focus
on how to increase employment and earnings of non-custodial parents
through WtW grants). There is also a site visit to Riverside's successful
GAIN program. Given the mix of attendees, there will be significant
discussion of WtW. Ray Uhalde is speaking on one of the panels.

Also, NGA staff have asked if she would moderate a session on job
retention strategies.

This sounds to me like a good use of our travel budget.
