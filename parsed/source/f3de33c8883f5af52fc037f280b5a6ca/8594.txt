SUBJECT:    PRESIDENT'S INITIATIVE ON RACE WEEKLY REPORT
            JULy 3 - JULy 9


     PBS Panel Discussion. Your discussion about "Race in America" on the NewsHour
     with Jim Lehrer was very successful and received extensive press coverage. Governor
     Winter and Angela Oh will be participating in an on-line discussion next week on PBS
     about the issues raised in your conversation. I have attached two articles about the
     discussion for your information.

ADVISORY BOARD ACTIVITIES

     Dr. Franklin's Letter Regarding the Denver Advisory Board Meeting. On July 7,
     the Associated Press filed a story about Dr. Franklin's June 16, 1998, letter to you
     regarding the Advisory Board's March meeting on stereotypes. The wire story generated
     press attention about the letter. Dr. Franklin's letter highlighted some of the
     presentations of the expert panelists -- including the view that "aspir(ing) to a 'colorblind'
     society is an impediment to reducing racial stereotyping" -- and provided
     recommendations from the Advisory Board. The press article created some confusion
     because it characterized the panelist information as a recommendation of the Advisory
     Board. The June 16 letter and the AP story are attached for your information.

     Race and Health Meeting. On July 10, Dr. John Hope Franklin, Governor William
     Winter, Governor Thomas Kean, PIR Senior Consultant Laura Harris, and I attended a
     meeting sponsored by the Department of Health and Human Services on issues relating to
     race and health. Dr. David Satcher, Assistant Secretary for Health and Surgeon General
     of the United States, gave a strong, insightful address about the need for continued

                                                             Hex-Dump Conversion

    Race and Immigration Meeting. On July 13, Dr. John Hope Franklin, Angela Oh,
    Governor William Winter and Linda Chavez-Thompson will attend a conference on race
    and immigration sponsored by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and the
    Georgetown University Law Center. The meeting will include a discussion of
    immigration issues and examine promising practices.

    American Friends in London. On July 3, Reverend Dr. Suzan Johnson Cook spoke to
    25 business leaders at a meeting of the American Friends in London. She spoke to this
    group about the importance of the Initiative and the private sector's role in promoting
    One America.

    Orange County Women Lawyer's Association. On July 7, Angela Oh spoke about the
    Initiative to 50 participants at the Orange County Women Lawyers Association in Orange
    County, California.

    Fisk University Race Relations Institute. On July 8, Dr. John Hope Franklin delivered
    the keynote address at Fisk University's 32nd annual Race Relations Institute.

    California School Administrator's Summer Institute. On July 9, Angela Oh spoke
    about the Initiative to the principals of all of California's public schools at the California
    School Administrator's 1998 Summer Institute in Los Angeles, California.

    Women's Political Caucus. On July 10, Angela Oh spoke to the Santa Barbara's
    Women's Political Caucus about the Initiative in Santa Barbara, California.

OFFICE OF THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR

    United States Virgin Islands Emancipation Day. Last week, at the request of
    Governor Roy L. Scheider, I participated in several programs commemorating the 150th
    Anniversary of the emancipation of slaves in the Virgin Islands (1848). I used the
    occasion to discuss the objectives and progress of the Race Initiative and to urge Virgin
    Islanders to join in the effort to build one America. The Islands have been experiencing
    some racial and ethnic tensions as increasing numbers of immigrants enter the Territory
    from other largely Spanish-speaking Caribbean islands. During the various ceremonies
    commemorating the emancipation, I accepted on your behalf a handsome clock made of
    Virgin Island mahogany and the Governor's Medal of Freedom (the bronze replica will be
    replaced by a silver medal). They are being shipped to yoI:' and should arrive shortly.
    The Governor will be sending you a silkscreened replica of the Emancipation postage
    stamp with an official July 3, 1998 cancellation stamp attractively bound in a leather case
    suitable for your Presidential library should you choose to place it there.
