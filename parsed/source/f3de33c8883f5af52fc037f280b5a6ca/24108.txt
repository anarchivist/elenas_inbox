TEXT:
Below find today's Q&As on the race initiative from McCurry's briefing (I
included Alicia and Elena on this e-mail to alert them to the new study
referenced in first question) :

Q    On another issue, there's a new study out today'
that says there's been a change in the racial culture in the deep
South. What's the President's feelings on that, especially with this
race initiative and Thursday with his two stops at the NABJ and the
NAACP?

              MR. MCCURRY:   A change in the culture?

              Q     The racial culture in the last 30 years since

            MR. MCCURRY: That's a report that's been issued?        I'm
just not familiar with it.

              Q     Yes, the University of Illinois --

             MR. MCCURRY:  I'm not familiar enough with the report to
comment on it, but I'm sure, depending on how it's been generated or
who generated it, if it's got some serious thinking in it, it will be
of interest to the President's advisory board.

             Q    And also, do you think that the word "tolerance" is
not race-relations-friendly in using the race initiative --

             MR. MCCURRY:  I've heard    no one has suggested that
the President's call for tolerance is anything but encouragement to
all Americans to be respectful of the views of others, even though
you might not necessarily share those views, as the word implies.
