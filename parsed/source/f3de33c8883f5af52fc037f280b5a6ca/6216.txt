TEXT:
FYI:

We have been pulling together longer summaries of the major budget items
for release tomorrow.  In the process, I learned that Josh Gotbaum decided
that the tobacco paper -- essentially the same exact language from the
budget chapter -- was not enough. He is rewriting this summary.   I told
Jill Blickstein who is coordinating this paper in OMB that we (you two
included) have to look at this re-write, but Chris and I wanted to make
sure that you are aware of this.  We are also concerned that we will not
have a chance to run it by HHS, who will be briefing off of this paper
tomorrow.

I f I get such paper,I will page you; if you get it, it would be great if
you could do the same.

Thanks.
