                              ASHINGTON--Vice President Al Gore's recent
 efforts to
                              turn routine agency announcements into upbeat,
                              campaign-style events are provoking amusement
 from the
                         politically savvy. Now, at least one incident has
 prompted complaints
                         that Gore is bringing politics to the bureaucracy.
                               In recent weeks, ashe begins his
                         campaign for president, Gore has billed
                         himself as the defender of harried air
                         travelers and the promoter of a new
                         commuter benefit: a three-digit telephone
                         number for the latest news on traffic jams.
                         The Transportation Department, in a
                         release that does not quite rival Gore's
                         claim to helping create the Internet,
                         credited him for inspiring a research
                         program to improve concrete pavement.
                              But when the Education Department brought Gore
 in to announce
                         new reading test scores, the response was a
 scolding from the
                         nonpartisan board that sets policy for national
 educational testing.
                              In a letter to the department, National
 Assessment Governing
                         Board Chairman Mark Musick objected that Gore
 essentially had
                         turned the Feb. 10 announcement into a political
 rally, which featured
                         a friendly crowd primed to applaud a punchy message
 and
                         downplayed worrisome parts of the test results.

                              An Awkward Shift to Mini-Government
                              Campaign-style government "can cloud the
 confidence people
                         might have in the independence of the data," said
 Education Statistics
                         Commissioner Pascal Forgione, agreeing with critics
 who complained
                         to him that "this should not happen again."
                              Gore's focus on mini-government represents an
 awkward shift for
                         the vice president, who built a political career by
 tackling issues like
                         global warming and technological literacy.
                              Republicans have zinged Gore because of some
 of his claims, but
                         experts said that the era of small initiatives has
 replaced that of big


                           government.
                                "The presidency has become a microbrewery of
 policy," said Paul
                           Light, a Brookings Institution scholar who has
 followed Gore's
                           campaign to "reinvent" government through
 streamlining and better
                           communication. "There isn't much in this
 administration to claim
                           credit for and, on most of the big issues, credit
 has already been
                           claimed by others. If Gore is going to claim credit
 for something, it's
                           going to be small beer."
                                How Gore's approach will play with voters is
 an open question.
                           His early opponent for the Democratic nomination,
 former New
                           Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, is campaigning on more
 traditional liberal
                           themes, such as concern for the poor. Republicans,
 riven by divisions
                           among economic and social conservatives, are
 hitting hard on foreign
                           policy, where they think the Clinton administration
 is vulnerable.
                             Gore's office said that there is nothing new
 or particularly political
                        about his announcements. "For six years, the vice
 president has been
                        working on all sorts of different policy issues,"
 spokesman Chris
                        Lehane said. "These are the types of things he does
 on a daily basis,
                        because these are the kinds of issues he's involved
 with. "
                             But lately, he seems to be doing more of them.
                             One day recently, the vice president announced
 an Internet site
                        for senior citizens. Another day he endorsed
 clearer labels for
                        over-the-counter drugs. He backed grants to make
 sure the year
                        2000 computer bug does not bedevil 'state unemploy
 ment benefit
                        programs.
                             Agency spokespersons insisted that there is no
 organized effort to
                        engage in overt politicking on behalf of Gore. It
 is routine, they said,
                        for Cabinet departments to give credit to people in
 the White House,
                        even for things not directly involving the
 president and vice
                        president--like improving concrete pavement.
                             But some see Gore's office as siphoning off
 announcements that
                        belong in the sphere of Cabinet secretaries, agency
 heads--or even
                        mayors. Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater, for


 example, was
                         set to unveil the proposed national traffic
 information line at a safety
                         conference in early March. The day of the expected
 announcement,
                         aides said the White House had laid claim to it.
                              The incident involving the Education
 Department's release of
                         reading scores was anything but routine. It
 provides a glimpse at how
                         agencies and Gore's office work to generate
 pUblicity.
                              Like the release of unemployment statistics
 and economic
                         indicators, the announcement of national student
 scores is supposed
                         to be insulated from politics.
                              The latest results showed that reading scores
 improved from 1994
                         to 1998 among students in grades 4, 8 and 12.
 However, for 4th and
                         12th graders, the improvement was essentially a
 recovery to previous
                         levels in 1992.
                              According to interviews and internal memos,
 the original plan for
                         releasing the results did not involve Gore. On
 previous occasions, the
                         highest official present had been the Education
 secretary. But
                         statistics commissioner Forgione said that the
 department's top
                         managers were excited about the scores and wanted
 to bring in the
                         White House.
                              The day of the release, about 300 department
 employees and
                         education lobbyists were packed into an auditorium.
 The vice
                         president received a standing ovation as he was
 introduced by a
                         teacher. Education reporters were assigned to a
 roped area in back
                         of the hall.
                              Gore's announcement stressed the gains in test
 scores and he
                         linked them to administration policies, urging the
 Republican Congress
                         to do more. In his eagerness to put a positive spin
 on the statistics,
                         Gore glossed over the fact that long-term progress
 had been modest
                         at best. The vice president left without taking
 media questions. Later,
                         as department officials talked with reporters, the
 mixed message in
                         the numbers became clear.
                              Musick, chairman of the board that oversees
 the tests, wrote the
                         department: "The format, tone and substance of that


 event was not
                           consistent with the principle of an independent,
 nonpartisan release of
                           [test scores], an important and long-standing
 policy. "
                                But Gore's spokesman disagreed.   "The
 administration has made
                           investing in schools one of its top priorities,"
 Lehane said. "It was
                           completely appropriate for the vice president to
 make the
                           announcement."

                                Gore Wins Another Top Endorsement
                                Meanwhile, Gore on Monday tightened his grip
 on the 2000
                           Democratic nomination by winning another high-level
 endorsement,
                           that of Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle of South
 Dakota.
                                Daschle, flanked by Gore in sioux Falls, S.D.,
  said: "I am proud to
                           stand with you and support your bid to become the
 next president of
                           the United States."
                                The backing came one week after Gore was
 endorsed by House
                           Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri,
 once his top foe
                           for the nomination.
