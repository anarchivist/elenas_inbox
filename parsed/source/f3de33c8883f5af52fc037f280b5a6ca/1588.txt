TEXT:
I think CPSC is right that they will have good local hits, particularly in
areas with community programs. I also think that, where the reiner
campaign is strong, both will be covered. I'm not sure that using the
First Lady's time with the product roundup makes the most sense in terms
of pumping up our conference.

What may help us is to focus on what we can do between now and 4/16. For
the First Lady, there are scheduled events where this could be amplified.

other opportunities include:  announcements of regional conferences,
poTus policy announcement, CEA report release.
We could also go through the audience/panel list, and pick a story to play
up before hand.
