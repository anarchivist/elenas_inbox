TEXT:
I am hearing through the grapevine that Congo Waters might have a
candidate that she wants to recommend.  To avoid any confusion, it might
be helpful if someone checks in with her office to see if she has any
"recommendations." I spoke with Bob briefly about this, and he is willing
to check in with her office. We certainly don't want this to spin out of
control. Thanks for your help!
