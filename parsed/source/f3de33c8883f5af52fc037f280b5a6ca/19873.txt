TEXT:
Rahm would like us to go ahead with the plan I sent earlier in response to
Collins upcoming food safety hearing: try and get Mikulski out pushing her
legislation, make FDA available on describing the bill, get other senators
to talk to Collins about the legislation in her statements.

So far, Durbin has agreed to make a statement at the hearing, Eshoo and
Kennedy (the other sponsors) will do press of some type, and FDA has
reached out to Mikulski but her staff is balking.
