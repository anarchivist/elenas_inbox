TEXT:
That's great. By my math, that's a 28% increase since March 96. Do you
know how many people that translates to? 2 million?  (Weren't we at 1.7
million before?)

Also, can you figure out how much we've gone up since the beginning of the
administration? It would be nice to get one welfare reform fact into
Gene's briefing -- whether it's for the first time, more than a third of
people who were on welfare in one year were working the next, or the %
working has gone up by (40%? 50%?) since we took office, or the 2 million
number, or whatever.

I think he and Janet are briefing around noon

Subject:         What new CPS numbers tell us about employment of welfare
recipients

Thanks to good cooperation from Census staff and hard work on the part of
Richard Bavier at OMB, we've been able to take a preliminary look at what
the March 1998 CPS data show on employment of welfare recipients. The
news looks good -- the percentage of people receiving welfare in 1997 who
reported they were working in March 1998 continues to grow, even while
case loads continue to fall dramatically. Even as we get to the harder
part of the caseload, we are not yet seeing any slowdown in people to move
from welfare to work

FYI, the increase between 97 and 98 is not nearly as dramatic as the
"nearly 30% increase" between 96 and 97 that the President talked about at
the August 4th event and is reported in the TANF Report to Congress.  I
don't think we're ready to talk about the numbers yet -- but here they are
for your information.

We need to do some more work to figure out what's going on, and how to
talk about it.   It could partly reflect a change in the way Census asked
the question. Also, the CPS experts say you can't conclude much from
relatively small year to year jumps due to the relatively small sample
 (several thousand people) -- rather what's important is the trend.
