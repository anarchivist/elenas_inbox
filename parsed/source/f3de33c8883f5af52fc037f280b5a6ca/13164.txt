TEXT:
Being Halloween and all ... I was sitting in Room 248 of the OEOB
at 11 o'clock today.    I looked out the door and I saw a
semi-familiar face talking.    I have been struggling all day to
place the face ... and the light bulb just went off.
We worked together briefly on Justice Ginsburg's nomination on
the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1993. I was working for Joe
Biden at the time in the nominations unit.    I assume you have
given up teaching at Chicago and are here to keep the country
safe from Newt Gingrich. Welcome.
