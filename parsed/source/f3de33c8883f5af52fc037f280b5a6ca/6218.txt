    NOTE TO BRUCE REED AND ELENA KAGAN
    Below is the basic approach to an education block grant that I sent to Mike Smith over the
    weekend, modified slightly so you could better understand it. Mike is basically ok with this. Let
    me know what you think.

    It involves combining Goals 2000, Title VI (The Republican block grant that already exists and
    for which we never seek funding), and the Eisenhower Professional Development Program into a
    $1.2 billion or so block grant. It also involves expanding Ed-Flex (in which states are given the
    authority to waive federal education requirements) from a 12-state demonstration program to a
    50 state program.

    Riley is on board with this approach, but hasn't really focused on the details yet. Mike is going
    to involve some the key program staff on this over the next few days, to keep them on board.

    We are aiming for this as a POTUS announcement when he meets with the gov's at the end of
    the month. This package is very close to what NGA is developing at Voinavich's initiative.
    Once this is a bit more firmed up, we'll develop a strategy for reaching out to the Dem. Govs. I
    don't want Voinavich to find out too soon that we are close to him--he will just try to push the
    envelope further.

    1. We should describe this package as building on Goals 2000, even as we change the
    name and build in even more flexibility and streamlining. To avoid the charge of suddenly
    abandoning our top priority over the five years, we should be clear in our initial rhetoric that this
    proposal is building on the most important features of Goals, and expanding them. Since we
    have always called Goals 2000 a "responsible block grant" and since Ed-Flex is part of Goals
    2000, this is not an unreasonable stretch.

    We can accomplish this in several simple ways:

    o      Purpose of the Block Grant: The purpose of this program is to help states and local
           school districts undertake the education reforms necessary to help all students reach
           challenging state standards in the basics and advanced skills in acadeinic subjects.

    o      Underlying Principles: Our rhetoric should stress that the program is built on the same
           principles that have been the foundation for Goals 2000: (I) high expectations and
           challenging academic standards for all students; (2) accountability for results; (3)
           maximum flexibility in the use of funds in order to achieve results; (4) investing in
           strengthening quality and increasing capacity. We should also stress another principle,
           not directly tied to Goals, of getting $ to the local schools.

    o      Make Ed-Flex expansion a part of the Block Grant proposal, not a separate piece.
           This reinforces that our legislative proposal is an extension of Goals 2000. In addition,
           we can require states that want Ed-Flex to have a strong school accountability plan
           (instead of an approved Goals 2000 plan), in ways that link to the overall accountability
           requirements for the block grant.


                                                               Automated Records Management System
                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion



     2. States should have some discretion in how they allocate funds, linked to the
     accountability requirements of the program.
     Funds would be distributed to states according to a formula that would get each state the same
     share offunds that it now receives from the 3 programs. ED has initially proposed that the
     block grant include aformulafor the substate allocation offunds. Below, I've proposed an
     alternative approach, which Mike seems comfortable with:

      I'm not sure that we should have a substate formula as you suggested, especialJy if we are
     looking for some way to align this proposal with the governors. Substantively, I'd like to retain
     for states the ability to incorporate these funds into a broader statewide strategy, to preserve the
     benefits of having local districts compete for funds, and to have the ability to use the funds as
     incentives for forming partnerships between districts and other organizations (e.g.,
     IHE's-especially for teacher training and professional development, or business and community
     groups for other purposes).

     As an alternative, I'd suggest an approach with the following elements:

     o      Drive the funds to the local level: States would have to give out 95% of the funds to
            LEA's or partnerships involving LEA's.

     o      Protect high poverty districts. As we have proposed in class size, states should be
            required to guarantee high-poverty districts at least their "Title I share" of the funds.

     o      Give states flexibility in how to use the rest of the money to achieve the purposes of
            the program, to help all kids reach state academic standards. States should be free
            to use the funds in any fasion that will help kids reach their own state academic standards,
            consistent with the state's own reform strategy. This would leave states free to distribute
            the funds according to a formula, or competitively. States could determine the purposes
            for which the funds could be used--very targeted, or very flexibly.

     o      Require states to issue annual statewide report cards, and district by district (or
            school by school) report cards. States should be required to issue annual statewide
            report card, showing student progress toward reaching academic standards on a statewide
            basis, and disaggregated by socioeconomic level, race/ethnicity, and gender. Report card
            should also report on high school completion rates, and other indicators of the
            effectiveness of the system, as determined by the state. Report cards must also be issued
            on a district-by-district basis (though in local control states such as Iowa, without uniform
            state academic standards, these report cards can reflect somewhat different indicators of
            achievement).

     o      Require the accountability and performance data to inform the use and distribution
            of the funds. The state must describe to the public and the Secretary (but no approval
            required) how its use of the funds will help increase the number of kids meeting state




            standards and reduce the achievement gaps revealed by the report cards. States would .
            still have the flexibility to determine how the money would be used; this requirement
            simply makes the state take into account the accountability data in determining how to
            best use the funds. (This is why I think we need local district or school report cards as
            well as state report cards). It will also exert some pressure on state to target additional
            funds to low performing schools.                       .

     3. Ed-Flex should clearly be built on accountability for results. In addition to whatever
     requirements are necessary to ensure that programatic funds are used for the purposes as
     intended, the basic requirement for states to get Ed-Flex is that they have a rigorous approach to
     holding schools and districts accountable for results, including school and district report cards
     with disaggregated data and some form of meaningful intervention in low performing
     schools/districts. In addition, I believe that Ed-Flex already requires states to demonstrate the
     same kind of flexibility with respect to its own requirements as we are prepared to offer; we
     should retain this approach and strengthen it if necessary based on what we have learned so far.
