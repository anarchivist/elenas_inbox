recent weeks to restrict reproductive choices for women. It is regrettable that some
Members of Congress have chosen to pursue a series of initiatives designed to create a
political issue at the risk of increasing unintended pregnancies and abortion and of
compromising women's health and safety.

        I have long said that I believe abortion should be safe, legal and rare. All of the
proposals being offered would restrict safe medical choices. Some would actually
restrict access to family planning information and services and could have the perverse
effect of increasing the number of unintended pregnancies and abortions. I urge the
Congress to put partisan politics aside and instead put women's health and safety first.

       First, I oppose the language in the [House Labor/ Health and Human Services
Appropriations -- check correct name] bill mandating parental consent for minors seeking
counseling and services from federally funded family planning programs. While Title X
providers should always encourage family communication, mandating such communication may
cause many teenagers to delay or altogether avoid seeking contraceptive services. This could
increase the number of unintended pregnancies and, in tum, of abortions. Surely no one would
support this result.

        Second, I oppose efforts to strike or scale back Congresswoman Lowey's provision in the
[House TreasurylPostal Appropriations -- check] bill that would require health plans participating
in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program to cover all FDA approved prescription
contraceptives. The Lowey proposal would improve basic health care coverage for many
women and help reduce unwanted pregnancies and the need for abortion. The current attempts
to strike or scale back this amendment would undermine these important goals.

       Third, I strongly object to the amendment to impose restrictions on international family
planning programs. By prohibiting foreign non-governmental organizations from receiving
United States funds if the organization uses any non-US government funds for abortion-related
services, the amendment jeopardizes funding to health care providers who are working to meet
the growing demand for family planning and other critical health services in developing
countries. The result of this amendment's provisions could also be an increase in unintended
pregnancy, abortion, and maternal and infant death.

       Fourth, I find it deeply disturbing that Congress would take the unprecedented step,
through an amendment to the House Agriculture Appropriations bill, of intervening in the Food
and Drug Administration's drug approval process by banning funding for the approval or testing
of drugs that medically induce abortions. For years, the FDA has used vigorous testing and the
highest scientific standards to protect public health. This amendment substitutes political
ideology for sound science. It would restrict scientific research that can protect women's lives
and offer them safe medical choices.

       Fifth, I am disappointed that Congress chose to reject the changes that I proposed to the

                                                       Automated Records Management System

properly crafted legislation that would make it illegal to transport minors across state lines for the
purpose of avoiding parental involvement requirements. I have repeatedly stated that I would
sign a bill if it were amended to exclude close family members from criminal and civil liability
and to ensure that individuals who provide only information, counseling, referral, or medical
services to the minor cannot be subject to liability. These changes would preserve the goal of
the legislation to prevent the circumvention of state parental involvement laws, while both
ensuring that minors are not isolated from close family members and preserving healthy family
communications. Unfortunately, the Congress has ignored these proposed changes, as well as
those designed to address the constitutional infirmities raised by the Department of Justice. In
doing so, this Congress has demonstrated that it is not truly interested in passing legislation, but
only creating another partisan political issue.

        Finally, Congress is once again considering legislation to ban so-called partial birth
abortions. This is a difficult and disturbing issue, but real dialogue about it has been eclipsed by
those more interested in scoring political points than in putting meaningful limits on the use of
this procedure. I urge you, once again, to put partisan politics aside and come together to protect
women's health and lives. I have long opposed late term abortions, and I do not, as a general
matter, support the use of this procedure. However, rare and tragic situations can occur in a
woman's pregnancy in which, in a doctor's medical judgment, the use of this procedure may be
necessary to save a woman's life or to protect her against serious injury to her health. In these
situations, in which a woman and her family must make an awful choice, the Constitution
requires, as it should, that the ability to choose this procedure be protected.

        As I have said to Congress on several occasions, I would sign legislation banning this
procedure if it included an exception allowing the procedure to be performed in order to prevent
a serious injury to a woman's health. If Congress responds to my repeated requests to add such
a narrow, tightly drawn exception, I would sign the bill now.

       I urge Congress to move beyond ideology and political maneuvering and think about the
women affected by each of these proposals. This is about their health and their lives, and they
deserve better.
