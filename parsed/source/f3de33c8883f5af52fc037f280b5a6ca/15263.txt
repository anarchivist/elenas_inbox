TEXT:
An April 12th Houston Chroniclestory disclosed that former Houston Police
Chief Nuchia had stopped doing background checks after the 5th u.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals ruled the Brady Law unconstitutional a year
ago.

Because of this public revelation, new Police Chief Bradford announced
today that he would recommend to the Mayor that they resume the checks.

[Bob Walker at Handgun Control told me that they had Peter Hart conduct a
poll in Houston and 90% favored a background check (81% "strongly")
also, they love the smart gun idea. He told me that there is a bill in NJ
that would require all handguns to be sold w/ smart gun technology in 4
years and the City of Boston has some measure they are considering, too.]

Mayor Lanier was quoted last week as saying,   "My instincts are probably
more in favor of doing the,background checks" .... and that he "would give
great weight to the recommendations of the chief."

Assuming Lanier agreed already w/ the recommendation, maybe the President
should call Lanier tomorrow and congratulate him on his decision?
