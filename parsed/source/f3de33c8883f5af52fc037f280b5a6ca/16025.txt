TEXT:
Just a quick follow-up on this morning's meeting. Ideally, by tomorrow
morning, Ann and Don would like 3-4 strong, news-making event/announcement
ideas for July-September in the following areas:

Education (especially standards);

Welfare-to-Work (beyond the existing Eli Segal proposal for a travel
event) ;

Tobacco, to show that we're in the picture (though I think Rahm has pretty
strong ideas on this one) .

Many thanks,

Eli
