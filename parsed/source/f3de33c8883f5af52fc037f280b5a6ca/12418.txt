TEXT:
        We have received word that Rep. Canady intends to move quickly on
RLPA, the Religious Liberties Protection Act. In general, RLPA would
create a religious free exercise defense to many state laws that are
inconsistent with the religious beliefs or practices of individuals. In
order to apply the law, the government would have to show that it was
particularly important to apply the law to the individual with religious
objections. You may recall that RLPA is a sequel to RFRA, the Religious
Freedom Restoration Act. RFRA became law a few years ago but was largely
struck down as beyond Congress's power. RLPA is intended to restore the
major part of RFRA that was held unconstitutional.

        The President strongly supported RFRA, and it was widely supported
in Congress. However, some of the potential implications of the bill are
now better understood. In particular, RLPA could provide a religious
liberties defense to many state laws, including some civil rights laws,
such as fair housing laws that prevent discrimination against gays and
lesbians and unmarried persons. This result is not certain, but it is
certainly possible, at least in some states. As a result, the gay
community,  supported by many civil rights groups, oppose RLPA as
currently drafted. Last year, no Democrats on the House Constitution
Subcommittee supported the bill after they heard from this community.
Canady wants to move this bill quickly, and the Administration is going to
have to decide how to respond. We will discuss the Administration's
response to this bill on Monday at 1:00 in 472 OEOB. Representatives of
DOJ will also attend. Can you come or send someone? Thanks.
