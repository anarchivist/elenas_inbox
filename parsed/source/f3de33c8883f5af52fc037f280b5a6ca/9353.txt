MEMORANDUM FOR ELENA KAGAN AND SALLY KATZEN

FROM:          JULIE FERNANDES and CECILIA ROUSE

RE:            AMENDED WYDEN-GRAHAM AGRICULTURAL GUESTWORKERS BILL

         As you know, Senators Wyden and Graham have put forward a series of changes to their
bill to reform the H-2A agricultural guestworker program. On Friday morning, you will be
meeting with staff of Senators Ron Wyden (D-OR), Bob Graham (D-FL), Edward Kennedy
(D-MA), and Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), and Representatives Howard Berman (D-CA), Sanford
Bishop (D-GA), and Xavier Becerra (D-CA), to discuss where we are.

        Though their new proposal does move in our direction in a couple of areas (M., it
restores the requirement that growers reimburse workers for transportation and adds a
requirement that growers make a "good faith" effort to assist workers in utilizing the housing
voucher), fundamental substantive objections remain. The following is a list of the most
significant problems with the new Wyden-Graham proposal.

1.     The bill would eliminate the current requirement that growers must conduct private
       market recruitment for workers, substituting a simple requirement to check a new and
       untested government-run "job registry".

        The core of the Wyden-Graham bill remains the creation of a new "job registry"
administered by the government. Under their bill, growers would need only to check this
registry before employing H-2A workers. Thus, all responsibility for the recruitment of
domestic farmworkers would shift to a new, untried, process for which the government and
low-wage workers are entirely responsible. In addition, although this registry would take years
to create and implement effectively, employers could begin to hire H-2A workers within 6
months of the enactment of the bill.

        At last week's meeting, there was some discussion about extending the start date for the
use ofthe registry from six months to one year after the enactment of the bill. However, even if
this change is made, it would not address the fundamental problems with the proposed registry:
(1) that use of the registry would relieve the growers of any obligation to do positive recruitment;
and (2) that the bill would require wholesale reliance on a method of recruitment that has not
been shown to be effective.

2.     The bill would erode U.S. worker wages.

                                                                  Automated Records Management System
                                                 1               Hex-Dump Conversion
program, growers who employ H-2A workers are required to pay all their farrnworkers the higher
of the prevailing wage (equal to the average local wage for the crop) or an "adverse effect wage
rate" (AEWR) (equal to the average statewide wage). The use of the AEWR reflects the fact
that foreign workers (both undocumented and H-2A guestworkers) can sometimes dominate a
local labor market and depress the local prevailing wage: in such a case, using a statewide
calculation (the AEWR) may be more appropriate. The Wyden-Graham bill caps the AEWR at
105% of the local prevailing wage. We continue to believe that this cap is not set high enough
to compensate for the depression of wages in areas where there is a heavy reliance on foreign
workers.

       In addition, the current proposal from Sens. Wyden and Graham bill does not include the
much-discussed "user fee" (equal to 8Y2 percent of the H-2A worker's wage). Without this fee,
the wage cost of hiring a U.S. workers remains 8 Y2 percent higher than hiring an H-2A worker.

3.     The bill does not provide an adequate mechanism for housing foreign guestworkers.

        Though the proposal continues to replace the requirement that growers provide housing
with a requirement that the growers provide workers with a housing voucher, it now includes a
requirement that growers make a "good faith" effort to locate housing for the worker. Though
this minimal assistance obligation is an improvement, the fundamental obligation that the grower
assure that workers are adequately housed would be eliminated.

        As was outlined previously, there are many areas (particularly in the West) where there
simply is not an adequate supply of rural housing to meet the needs of farrnworkers. This
proposal does not address that. Moreover, even with the "good faith" assistance by growers, it
remains unrealistic to expect low-wage foreign migrant farrnworkers to be able to secure housing
using a federal voucher. Thus, many workers will likely end up without housing, or will
overcrowd any available rental housing.

4.     The bill would eliminate the requirement that growers guarantee part of the work offered
       to recruit U.S. and foreign workers.

         This proposal continues to eliminate the requirement that growers guarantee 3/4 of the
work offered to recruit U.S. and foreign farrnworkers. Under current law, H-2A workers must
be paid for at least 75% of the work contract period for which they were recruited, except when
there is an "act of God." This "three-fourths guarantee" gives migrant workers some indication
of their potential earnings and discourages employers from over-recruiting to secure a labor
surplus and drive down wages. Though Wyden's staff discussed trying to include a modified
version of this requirement in their bill, their most recent proposal does not restore this
protection. The elimination of the 3/4 guarantee would encourage growers to lure workers from
hundreds or thousands of miles away with the promise of potentially high earnings without any
obligation to fulfill any part of that promise. The change also could encourage growers to
