TEXT:
Agencies are wrapping the report to us this week.   You had asked that we
leak it Sunday for Monday -- without an event, however,    it will be tough
to get meaningful press coverage so I don't think release date is
critical.   Shalala and Glickman will both be out of town Monday as well.
I'd like to cut the agencies loose to release to press when they send the
final over here later this week or early next week.   Is that o.k.? Do you
still care what date it gets out or can I defer to agencies?
