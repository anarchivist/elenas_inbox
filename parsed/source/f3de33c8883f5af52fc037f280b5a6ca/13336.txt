     DRAFT 2 - ADMINISTRATION POLICY ON LOGGING RIDER
     TALKING POINTS

     ?       The Administration is convinced that the "logging rider" on
     the rescissions act has to be changed.
     ?       Ancient forests are being clearcut. Critical habitat for
     fish and wildlife is being destroyed.   wild places that
     almost everyone in the Northwest and the country want to
     protect are being lost forever. This has to stop.
     ?       The logging rider has reopened wounds that were just
     beginning to heal.  It is dividing people and communities.
     This has to stop.
     ?       In addition to the problems with the old growth provisions,
     a significant number of concerps have'been raised regarding
     implementation of the salvage logging program.
     ?       The Northwest deserves better.   Forest policy should be
     predictable and fair.  Environmental protections should be
     solid. Harvest levels should be sustainable. Agencies
     should be accountable for their actions. Most of all, the
     people who own the forests need to know that their values
     and their voices are being heard.
     ?       This Administration's Northwest Forest Plan is the right way
     to run federal forests in the Northwest. We have to get
     back to that plan. We also have to make sure that the
     salvage program meets the President's directive to obey
     environmental law.
     ?       We have to change the logging rider.   The Administration
     believes that we must:
     1.      Repeal the provisions of the logging rider that opened
     up the Northwest's ancient forests and closed the courts to
     protecting old growth timber;
     2.      Repeal the provisions that some in the timber industry
     want to use to disrupt the Forest Plan.

     3.      Suspend the salvage timber program in Oregon,
     Washington, Idaho, and Montana for 45 days to allow a full,
     objective review of the program's implementation in those
     states, and
     4.      Get agreement from Congress to provide the Forest
     Service and BLM the funding and other authorities they need
     to buy
     o
     -back or find substitute timber for old
     o
     -growth sales

     released under the rider that simply shouldn't be cut.
     ?       We will work with Senator Murray, Senator Wyden,
     Congresswoman Furse, and others in the Northwest delegation
     to win passage of these changes. We know there will be
     opposition. But we are determined to get Northwest forest
     management back on track and to res~ore the balanced and
     reasonable approach that is achieved under the Northwest
     Forest Plan.
