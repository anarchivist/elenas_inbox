TEXT:
I just heard from Watt's staffer (Tina Hone) and the DOL that Abraham is
announcing a deal with industry next week.  Industry was supposed to meet
with Smith today or tomorrow, and has called off the meeting.  Neither
Tina nor Labor had any idea what this deal looks like, except that it
contains something that says "attestation" but is very weak.  According to
Tina, George Fishman (Smith's staffer) is going to call us to ask for a
veto statement.

Julie
