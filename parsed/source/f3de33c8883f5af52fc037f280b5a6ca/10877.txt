TEXT:
FYI, it looks as if the VP will host a small Roosevelt Room event tomorrow
afternoon to announce our budget increase for Head Start -- $607 million
for FY 2000 to serve 42,000 new children (35,000 3- and 4-year olds, and
7,000 0-3 year olds) , bringing Head Start enrollment to a projected
877,000, as well as new $ for Head Start quality.
