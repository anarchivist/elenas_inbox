User Fee, FDA Reform Bills Head List Of Legislative Priorities, PhRMA
Reauthorization of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act of 1992 and passage
of legislation reforming the Food and Drug Administration are top priorities
for members of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America in
1997, officials from the trade association said at a Jan. 15 briefing.
Reauthorization of the user fee act fits in with the association's goal of
expediting the availability to consumers of safe, effective new drugs,
according to Sidney Taurel, PhRMA's chairman-elect and president and chief
executive officer for Eli Lilly and Co. phRMA has been participating in
negotiations with FDA and Congress that should lead to reauthorization of the
user fee act, he said.
To further the goal of expediting the availability of drugs, PhRMA also is
prepared to support legislation that would "break down barriers to the
dissemination of information,"  and efforts by the International Conference on
Harmonization that would streamline drug approvals and establish common
standards on drug development throughout the world, Taurel said.
Under the heading of creating an environment that promotes innovation,
PhRMA's other priorities for 1997 include seeking a permanent extension of the
research and development tax credit, strengthening U.S. intellectual property
protections, and enforcing international property protection laws. PhRMA also
will support legislation that improves the Clinton administration's ability to
negotiate trade agreements as part of its goal to promote open markets and
free trade, Taurel said. "We will strive to convince foreign governments that
the best way to contain health-care costs is through free-market


competition, " he added.
Second Phase, New Goal
Under the user fee act, FDA promised to meet certain deadlines for
reviewing and approving drug applications in exchange for additional revenues
generated by industry's user fees, which were dedicated to paying for the
personnel and supporting activities necessary to complete the reviews in a
timely fashion.
A second phase of the user fee act, known colloquially as PDUFA II, should
"build on the progress already made in reducing approval times and make
similar progress in cutting overall drug development times," Taurel said in a
statement.
Since the first phase of the user fee act has been successful in improving
review times, industry is focusing its reauthorization negotiations on
lessening overall drug development times. Drug companies "are making internal
improvement to speed drug development and improve the productivity of the
process--and there are improvements we can make,"   Charles A. Heimbold Jr.,
PhRMA board chairman and chairman and CEO of Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., said.
However, "we continue to need the support and cooperation of government to
make a meaningful impact. If meetings are required between a pharmaceutical
company and the FDA, they should be set promptly. Extraneous meetings should
be eliminated. written protocols on aspects of the development process should
be created by the FDA. Drug development remains highly regulated and requires
the closest partnership between government and industry to shorten it. We hope
to do just that in 1997," Heimbold added.
Alan F. Holmer, PhRMA president, said, according to FDA, drug reviews, a
period extending from the time a company files a new drug application to the
time it receives FDA approval, actually have decreased from 2.5 years to 1.5
years since the user fee act was implemented. By contrast, the overall time
spent on clinical development has increased from 5.5 years for drugs approved
between 1990 and 1993 to 7.2 years for drugs approved in 1994 and 1995, Holmer
said, citing the findings of a study by Tufts University Center for Drug
Development.
The amount spent on research and development in 1997 by research-based drug
and biotechnology companies will reach a new high of $18.9 billion, PhRMA
said, which represents a 11.5 percent increase from 1996. Of the total $18.9
billion, approximately $15 billion will be spent in the United States.
Expressed as a ratio of R&D to sales, pharmaceutical companies will spend
about 21.2 percent of their revenues on R&D in 1997 compared to an average
of 4 percent for all industries, Heimbold said.
According to Heimbold, "countries everywhere look to the United States and
its pharmaceutical industry to discover many of the new drugs and do much of
the significant new research for new medicines."   He pointed out that, in
addition to a record level of R&D investment, research-based drug companies
in 1996 introduced 53 new medicines to U.S. patients that were designed to
treat more than 40 diseases, including drugs for AIDS, Alzheimer's disease,
various cancers, glaucoma, and multiple sclerosis.
Reform, User Fees?
PhRMA also will concentrate its energies on ensuring passage of
legislation in 1997 that would bring about improvements at FDA. The principal
focus at PhRMA over the past few months has been addressing the technical
issues included in the reauthorization of the user fee act, Holmer said.
However, there are many other issues about improvements that could be made
beyond the scope of user fees that PhRMA would like to take up with FDA, he
said.
For example, PhRMA supports efforts aimed at revising the agency's policies
about dissemination of information about prescription medicines. The policies
governing distribution of scientific information should be less proscriptive,
particularly for pharmacoeconomic data and off-label uses of approved drugs,
Holmer said.
As for indications that House Commerce Committee Chairman Thomas J. Bliley


Jr. (R-Va) will tie user fee reauthorization to FDA reform, Holmer merely said
the question of how these issues are approached by Congress should be left to
congressional leaders. Both are high priorities for phRMA. "We hope they
h~ppen this year, " he said.
Mike Collins, communications director for the House Commerce Committee,
told BNA that Bliley believes the reauthorization and reform issues are
"joined at the hip" and already has informed Health and Human Services
Secretary Donna E. Shalala that user fee reauthorization will be taken up in
the context of FDA reform. However, for a bill to get the president's
signature, it must be both popular with the president and hugely bipartisan,
so it cannot be an extreme measure, he said.
The measures introduced in the l04th Congress were not very extreme, had
broad bipartisan support, and came very close to being passed, which has had a
profound impact on FDA operations, according to Collins. The job should be
less complicated this session, he said.
