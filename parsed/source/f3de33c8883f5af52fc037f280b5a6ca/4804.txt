TEXT:
Donna called from the road to say she was still worried that the House
might agree to the Murray arndt, and suggested that we talk to Mary again
about ways to keep them from doing so.   (I don't think she had any new
info; she has not talked to Murray.)   She raised the possibility of
getting appropriators to add more $ to the hotline or for battered women
shelters. We agreed that if it looks like the House will cave, we should
get the Republicans to push our (revised) language instead.

I told her we talked to Mary yesterday.    Are y'all talking again?
