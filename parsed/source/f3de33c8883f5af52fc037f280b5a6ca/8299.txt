TEXT:
The attached one-pager is intended to demonstrate that we are     fighting for
our domestic agenda despite the tobacco events this week.  It     includes an
education section listing the initiatives we are fighting for     that are
fully funded in our balanced budget, without tobacco revenues     (e.g.,
school construction, High Hopes, after-school, charters, etc.)      It does
not include class size on the list.

I'm uncomfortable about leaving class size off the list, because it will
convey the message that we are not fighting for it any longer. On the
other hand, adding ,it to the list at present would undermine the
credibility of the entire document. On balance, I think we should leave it
off, but wanted you to have a chance to weigh in. What do you think?

                     President Clinton: Advancing the Critical Agenda of
                          Fiscal Discipline and Strategic Investments
                                                   June 18, 1998


In 1993, President Clinton put in place a three-part economic strategy of cutting the deficit,
making strategic investments in the future, and opening markets abroad. The President's
strategy has been remarkably successful, balancing the budget for the first time in a generation,
and he is now building on that success:
SAVING SOCIAL SECURITY FIRST: With the first surplus in a generation imminent, the
President is leading to nation to meet the next major fiscal challenge -- the retirement of the baby
boom generation. The President has pledged to reserve every penny of the surplus until Social
Security is strengthened. With strong support from the American people, the PreSIdent will
stand firm against any efforts to spend the surplus before comprehensive Social Security reform
is enacted.
ADVANCING STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS: As he has in the past, the President will
hold the line on fiscal discipline, and will continue to push Congress to make smart investments
in our future. Every year, our opponents put obstacles in our place, but we manage to prevail.
Since taking office, the President has won increases in funding for critical investment priorities:
increasing funding for health by 35 percent, for education by 28 percent and for the environment
by 10 percent.


This year, we will fight through the budget process for:
·   Investments in the American people through education and training. The President will
    continue his effort to make our schools the best in the world --by raising standards, raising
    expectations and raising accountability. He will fight critical education investments,
    including the following, all of which are fully paid for outside of any tobacco biI1:
       _ School Construction Tax Credits to help rebuild, modernize, and build over 5,000
         public schools.
       _ A new mentoring program to encourage young people to go to college.
       _ Expanding Head Start -- fighting to increase Head Start funding.
         After-School Learning Centers -- a $1 biilion, five-year investment to provide
         after-school care for up to an additional 500,000 children each year.
         Expanding Choice and Accountability in Public Schools -- increasing Federal
         funds for starting up public charter schools, continuing toward the goal of 3,000
         charter schools by 2001.
         Preparing for the 21st Century with Greater Education Technology--
         continuing to invest to help connect every classroom to the Internet, train
         teachers, and promote high-quality educational software.
·   A health care consumer bill of rights. The President will push Congress to pass federally
    enforceable consumer health care protections before it adjourns this year. This Health Care
                                                                           H~~~O\!mp   Conversion
    Bill of Rights should contain a range of protections, including guaranteed access to needed
    health care specialists to ensure that patients are provided appropriate high quality care and
    access to emergency room services when and where they need it.
·   Mo·re Affordable and Improved Child Care. To improve child care for America's
    working families the President has proposed investing$20 billion over five years for
    child care, including initiatives to help working families pay for child care, build a good
    supply of after-school programs, improve the safety and quality of care, and promote
    early learning. Only one-third of that funding was provided for by tobacco receipts.
·   A major effort against juvenile cr.ime and drugs. President Clinton has called for a
    special focus on addressing juvenile crime --providing more resources to crack down on
    gangs, guns, and drugs. When coordinated with the support provided by the largest
    anti-drug budget in history and with the leadership General McCaffery brings to our national
    drug policy, these new efforts are sure to keep drug use on decline.
·   Further investments in our environment and public health, protecting our natural
    treasures and ensuring our children clean air and water. The President's plan invests:
       An additional $600 million next year, a 40 percent increase, to accelerate cleanups of
       toxic Superfund sites, to help meet the President's goal of doubling the cleanup pace.
       An additional $568 million in FY 99 to carry out a comprehensive new Clean Water
       Action Plan that wm control polluted runoff.
       An additional $92 million dollars in FY 99 repair deteriorating infrastructure at national
       parks and other public lands.

·   Community Empowerment Investments:
    _ Funding for a Second Round of Empowerment Zones.
    _ Increasing the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit By $1.6 billion
    _ Expanding the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund
    _ Funding 50,000 incremental housing vouchers for families moving from
      welfare-to-work.
      Establishing a Community Empowerment Fund, which will help create an estimated
      280,000 private sector jobs for low and moderate-income individuals.
