Welfare Reform Q&A

Question:    You have promised to help States and local areas in ensuring there are job
             opportunities for welfare recipients who lose benefits under welfare reform. How
             does the Budget fulfill your commitment, and how would the program operate?

Answer:      The 1998 Budget includes $3 billion over the FY s 1998 through 2000 for
             Welfare-to-Work Jobs to help communities move one million of the
             hardest-to-employ welfare recipients into jobs by the year 2000. Approximately
             $1 billion in mandatory funding is included annually through 2000; States may
             use their TANF grant to complement Welfare-to-Work Jobs for similar activities
             if they so choose.

             To complement the $3 billion Welfare-to-Work Jobs proposal, the FY 1998
             Budget includes an enhanced and expanded'Work Opportunity Tax Credit. First,
             the WOTC would be enhanced for long-term welfare recipients for three years.
             This credit would allow employers who hire welfare recipients to claim a 50
             percent tax credit on the first $10,000 of wages paid to that person for two years.
             Wages may include the cost of training, health insurance, and day care. Second,
             the WOTC would be expanded to make a new population eligible for the existing
             base credit for the next three years. Employers could claim the WOTC for hiring
             able-bodied childless adults aged 18-50 who are subject to the work requirements
             under the food stamp legislative proposal in the budget. However, these
             employers would not be eligible for the enhanced credit offered for long-term
             welfare recipients.

Question:    How is the Administration going to move people from welfare to work when there
             are nojobs?

Answer:      I believe jobs are available and that the welfare rolls will continue to decline.
             Minimum wage jobs have always been open, but the package of welfare benefits
             previously available offered more to recipients than a minimum wage job. Now,
             with increases in the Earned Income Tax Credit, child care subsidies, and other
             provisions that makes work pay, work is a more attractive option than welfare.
             Once working, former welfare recipients will gain the employment experience
             necessary to move up the ladder of work.

              But, we will need more jobs -- and jobs that pay more than the minimum wage if
              we are ensure the success of the new welfare law. The combination of private
              sector commitments, such as those made by the CEOs with whom I recently met,
              economic development, tax credits, additional welfare-to-work funds, and a focus
            . on jobs in the growing technology industry will create the new, higher paying jobs
              we need.

Question:   Why do you need another new welfare to work program?

Answer.     Passing the welfare law was an historic accomplishment that represents a
            significant step forward in social policy for this country, as was the aggressive
            welfare waiver strategy I pursued before I was sent a welfare bill I could sign.
            And we are seeing results already. Since the beginning of my first term, the
            welfare rolls have fallen by an unprecedented 2.5 million people. Some of this
            drop is due to our strong economy, but a good deal is due to the aggressive
            welfare waiver strategy and the new welfare law. However there is more work to
            do.

            Now that the welfare law has passed, we have to work tirelessly to ensure its
            success.

            To truly succeed, states and localities need additional funds targeted specifically
            toward helping the hardest to place welfare recipients find jobs. The Welfare to
            Work initiative would provide funds to states and their cities that could then be
            leveraged with existing welfare to work funds in creative efforts to move large
            numbers of hard to place recipients in to the labor market.

            And too, I will continue to challenge and encourage the business community, the
            faith community, states, localities, and others to put together plans that will move
            welfare recipients permanently into the workforce.

Question:   During your State of the Union address, you announced that five prominent
            CEOs had joined the effort to help move welfare recipients to work. However,
            recent press stories indicate that these companies have done little to date to actually
            hire welfare recipients. Further, the one company that has done the most --
            Marriot -- was not one of the five you announced Can you comment?

Answer.     During my State of the Union address, I was thrilled to announce that five of this
            country's major corporations had pledged to work with me in the effort to move
            welfare recipients permanently into the workforce. In early January of this year, I
            met with 14 CEOs interested in becoming involved in the welfare to work effort.
            The five companies I announced during the State of the Union emerged from the
            CEO meeting as the companies that wanted to take a leadership role in this effort.
             The CEO of Marriot was invited to the initial meeting but he unfortunately had a
            conflict and could not attend. However, Marriot has a top notch welfare to work
            program already in place that we are reviewing and will encourage other
            corporations to emulate. I hope Marriot, as well as all of the corporations I met
            with in early January, will work with me and others to make the new welfare law
            a success.

Question:   What has the White House done to hire welfare recipients since the new welfare
            law was signed?

Answer:     Just last week, James King, Director of the U.S. Office for Personnel Management
            completed a report outlining several options the Federal Government might
            pursue to hire welfare recipients. He and his staff came up with some very good
            ideas and I am currently reviewing those ideas. I hope to have something to
            announce very soon.

Question:   How many welfare recipients will states have to put to work to meet the work
            requirements?

Answer:     For states to meet the work requirements included in the new welfare law, states
            must be move an additional 1 million recipients into work nationwide by the year
            2000.

Question:   You have mentioned several times that under the new welfare law, employers may
            turn the welfare andfood stamp checks into temporary wage subsidies. How
            does this actually work?

Answer:     As of August 22, 1996 when you signed the welfare law, 11 states had received
            waivers to modify work supplementation rules. Most of those waivers sought to
            combine AFDC and food stamp benefits to subsidize jobs. Oregon pioneered
            this concept. HHS is currently gathering more recent statistics on work
            supplementation since you signed the law. In Oregon, both private and public
            sector jobs are subsidized for up to six months per placement. The job is
            subsidized at minimum wage and gives employers cashed out AFDC and food
            stamps benefits to cover the minimum wage. In addition, the employee is entitled
            to the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). If the minimum wage and the EITC do
            not bring the recipient up to the poverty line, the employer must make up the
            difference by paying up to $1 dollar an hour over the reimbursed minimum wage
            or may put $1 for every hour worked into an Individual Development Account
            (IDA). Once a recipient is hired in a full-time, unsubsidized job, she becomes
            eligible for her wage, the EITC, and food stamps coupons previously used to
            subsidized her wage. Such a system creates an escalating financial incentive that
            always makes full-time, unsubsidized work the most attractive option
