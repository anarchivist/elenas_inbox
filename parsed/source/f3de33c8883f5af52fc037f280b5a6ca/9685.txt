Nutrition Bill Passes House

                            By EUN-KYUNG KIM Associated Press Writer

                            WASHINGTON (AP)   -- A bill that would expand and
renew
                            various nutrition programs aimed at poor women
and children
                            was approved Friday by the House and now heads
to the White
                            House.

                            The measure, supported by the Clinton
administration, was
                            approved by a 422-1 vote. The Senate passed it
by voice vote
                            Sept. 17.

                            Under the bill, an after-school program that
serves free snacks
                            to children up to age 13.would be expanded to
teens as old as
                            18 in hopes of keeping unsupervised teen-agers
out of trouble.

                            The legislation also would authorize a 3-year
pilot breakfast
                            program to evaluate the effect of free
breakfasts on a child's
                            academic achievement, attendance and tardiness.

                            The current school breakfast program is
available only to poor
                            children, but some of them don't take advantage
of it due to the
                            stigma attached. Under the pilot program,
certain states could


                             get money to provide breakfast to all students,
     regardless of
                             income.

                             Rep. William Goodling, R-Pa., who chairs the
     House Education
                             and the Workforce Committee, said the bill would
     "go a long'
                             way toward improving the operations of these
     programs, freeing
                             them from fraud and abuse and ensuring that
     children are
                             provided with nutritious meals."

                             Goodling's bill also would renew the Women,
     Infants and
                             Children program through 2003. The program
     provides
                             vouchers for cereal and milk for some 7.4
     million needy women
                             and children up to age 5.

                             The measure includes several anti-fraud
     measures, including a
                             requirement that applicants apply in person for
     certification.
                             Other measures are aimed at stores accepting the
     WIC
                             coupons, including fines for embezzlement
     ranging from $10,000
                             to $25,000.

                             The one vote against the measure was cast by
     Rep. Ron Paul,
                             R-Texas.

                             "He questions the· wisdom behind the federal
     government
                             getting involved in these kinds of programs, ' ,
     said Paul's
                             spokesman, Michael Sullivan. " I t has the best
     of intentions
                             but the federal government can't believe it can
     go in and simply
                             make people not hungry anymore. ' ,
