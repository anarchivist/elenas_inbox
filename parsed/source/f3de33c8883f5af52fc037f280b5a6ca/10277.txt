TEXT:
We should sit down with Gene to figure out how to spend that $1-2 billion.

Here are some thoughts:

HOW TO SPEND $2 BILLION:

EDUCATION ($1 billion) :
Social Promotion/After-School: $300m
Teachers: $200m
Adult Literacy:   $___ m
Training:   $   m
Americorps:   $176m (Harris's appeal)
Work-Site & Choice:    $50m?
[Second-chance schools:    cheap Kerry idea for disruptive students]

HEALTH -- $500m
Bioterrorism -- $100m (helps with terrorism #)
Diseases -- $300m
Food safety -- $75m?
FDA tobacco enforcement    ??
Medicare suit     $10m?

MISCELLANEOUS     $200m
Child support crackdown -- $50m
Foster care -- $150m
Equal pay -- $20m
Parental leave demo -- $10m

GORE STUFF (CEQ/OSTP)     -- $300m (probably unrealistic)

NON-TAX IDEAS FUNDED OUTSIDE THE POT:
Crime Bill II -- $1 billion
WTW -- $1 "billion

TAX IDEAS FUNDED BY TAX OFFSETS:
Long-term care tax credit -- $5-6.5b
Stay at home DCTC (no cost or modest cost)

Work-site schools & workplace literacy -- $200m
Americorps
Interest deduction -- $300m
CDFI -- $100m
Telecommuting -- $500m
Welfare/pensions

BIG QUESTIONS:
Medicare buy-in
Other coverage ideas?


Non-tax long-term care (community centers, nursing home quality)
NIH
Other disability tax credit
Whether to shave child care
                                                                                                \
