TEXT:
Don't know the answer to these questions. The Dems have hold on
it on the floor.  It's not likely to come up before the senate
recesses unless someone attempts to do it as an amendment on the
floor--this too though is improbable.  I think since we have a
"challenge" from Dole to oppose it, we must be at the ready for
any possible scenerio.
