TEXT:
The New Jersey speech on the 8th will now be at a convention of african
american, Baptist ministers.  So, there will no longer be an emphasis on
education standards, but he could give a general education speech. Ann
has asked us to see if there's something he can say in that speech or
prior to his departure from the WH that will make news -- and also will
appeal to the group he will be addressing.  (She suggested something on
Head Start or Service). Mike Cohen felt a departure statement on whatever
the Republicans are doing that day on education could work.  If we have
other ideas, we should let Ann know today. This will probably come up at
the COS Scheduling meeting. Thanks.
