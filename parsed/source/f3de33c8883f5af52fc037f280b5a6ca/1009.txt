Campaign Finance Reform

Question:   Isn't hypocritical to keep calling for campaign finance reform when you continue
            to attend Democratic fundraisers?

Answer:     We have challenged the Republican party to join with the Democratic party to
            voluntarily restrict soft money contributions. Already the Democratic National
            Committee has agreed to my request to unilaterally stop taking money from
            non-citizens and to limit large soft money contributions. However, I believe it is
            unfair for the Democratic party to go any further to unilaterally disarm in the face
            of the Republican party's absolute refusal to voluntarily restrict their fundraising
            In any way.


Question:   Given that you have made campaign finance reform a top priority for your second
            term, why didn't you raise passage ofreform legislation during the bipartisan
            leadership meeting two weeks ago? .

Answer:     The fact is that I did raise campaign finance reform as one of my priorities during
            that meeting. We agreed during the meeting that the bipartisan priorities would
            include those issues, such as the balanced budget, juvenile justice reform and
            others, that should gamer widespread bipartisan support and could move quickly.
            It is clear to me that there is still a lot of debate on the Hill about the right way to
            reform the campaign finance system.

Question:   What actions have you taken to insure that campaign finance reform is enacted by
            your July 4th deadline?

Answer:     We are making every effort to insure that bipartisan reform passes by July 4.
            I have had meetings at the White House with the lead sponsors of bipartisan
            reform -- Senators McCain and Feingold and Representatives Shays and Meehan
            and I have also met with the House sponsors of the legislation. As I have done
            with other issues that I have designated as a priority, such as the crime bill and
            welfare reform, I have appointed several senior White House officials to lead our
            effort to pass McCain Feingold/Shays Meehan. They have met on several
            occasions with outside reform groups and are working closely with hill staff on
            ways to insure that the legislation is enacted by July 4. In addition, we will
            shortly announce a significant initiative to build grassroots support across the
            country for passage of real campaign finance reform.




Welfare Reform: Welfare-To-Work

Question:   You have promised to help States and local areas in ensuring there are job
                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion

            opportunities for welfare recipients who lose benefits under welfare reform.
            How does the Budget fulfill your commitment, and how would the program
            operate?

Answer:     The 1998 Budget includes $3 billion over the FY s 1998 through 2000 for
            Welfare-to-Work Jobs to help communities move one million of the
            hardest-to-employ welfare recipients into jobs by the year 2000. Approximately
            $1 billion in mandatory funding is included annually through 2000; States may
            use their T ANF grant to complement Welfare-to-Work Jobs for similar activities
            if they so choose.

            To complement the $3 billion Welfare-to-Work Jobs proposal, the FY 1998
            Budget includes an enhanced and expanded Work Opportunity Tax Credit. First,
            the WOTC would be enhanced for long-term welfare recipients for three years.
            This credit would allow employers who hire welfare recipients to claim a 50
            percent tax credit on the first $10,000 of wages paid to that person for two years.
            Wages may include the cost of training, health insurance, and day care. Second,
            the WOTC would be expanded to make a new population eligible for the existing
            base credit for the next three years. Employers could claim the WOTC for hiring
            able-bodied childless adults aged 18-50 who are subject to the work requirements
            under the food stamp legislative proposal in the budget. However, these
            employers would not be eligible for the enhanced credit offered for long-term
            welfare recipients.

Question:   How is the Administration going to move people from welfare to work when there
            are nojobs?

Answer:     I believe jobs are available and that the welfare rolls will continue to decline.
            Minimum wage jobs have always been open, but the package of welfare benefits
            previously available offered more to recipients than a minimum wage job. Now,
            with increases in the Earned Income Tax Credit, child care subsidies, and other
            provisions that makes work pay, work is a more attractive option than welfare.
            Once working, former welfare recipients will gain the employment experience
            necessary to move up the ladder of work.

            But, we will need more jobs -- and jobs that pay more than the minimum wage if
            we are ensure the success of the new welfare law. The combination of private
            sector commitments, such as those made by the CEOs with whom I recently met,
            economic development, tax credits, additional welfare-to-work funds, and a focus
            on jobs in the growing technology industry will create the new, higher paying jobs
            we need.


Question    Why do you need another new welfare to work program?
                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion


Answer.     Passing the welfare law was an historic accomplishment that represents a
            significant step forward in social policy for this country, as was the aggressive
            welfare waiver strategy I pursued before I was sent a welfare bill I could sign.
            And we are seeing results already. Since the beginning of my first term, the
            welfare rolls have fallen by an unprecedented 2.5 million people. Some of this
            drop is due to our strong economy, but a good deal is due to the aggressive
            welfare waiver strategy and the new welfare law. However there is more work to
            do.

            Now that the welfare law has passed, we have to work tirelessly to ensure its
            success.

            To truly succeed, states and localities need additional funds targeted specifically
            toward helping the hardest to place welfare recipients find jobs. The Welfare to
            Work initiative would provide funds to states and their cities that could then be
            leveraged with existing welfare to work funds in creative efforts to move large
            numbers of hard to place recipients in to the labor market.

            And too, I will continue to challenge and encourage the business community, the
            faith community, states, localities, and others to put together plans that will move
            welfare recipients permanently into the workforce.

Question:   During your State of the Union address, you announced that five prominent
            CEOs had joined the effort to help move weltare recipients to work. However,
            recent press stories indicate that these companies have done little to date to actually
            hire weitare recipients. Further, the one company that has done the most --
            Marriot -- was not one of the five you announced Can you comment?

Answer.     During my State of the Union address, I was thrilled to announce that five of this
            country's major corporations had pledged to work with me in the effort to move
            welfare recipients permanently into the workforce. In early January of this year, I
            met with 14 CEOs interested in becoming involved in the welfare to work effort.
            The five companies I announced during the State of the Union emerged from the
            CEO meeting as the companies that wanted to take a leadership role in this effort.
             The CEO of Marriot was invited to the initial meeting but he unfortunately had a
            conflict and could not attend. However, Marriot has a top notch welfare to work
            program already in place that we are reviewing and will encourage other
            corporations to emulate. I hope Marriot, as well as all of the corporations I met
            with in early January, will work with me and others to make the new welfare law
            a success.
                                                                          Hex-Dump Conversion

Question:   What has the White House done to hire welfare recipients since the new welfare
            law was signed?

Answer:     Just last week, James King, Director of the U.S. Office for Personnel Management
            completed a report outlining several options the Federal Government might
            pursue to hire welfare recipients. He and his staff came up with some very good
            ideas and I am currently reviewing those ideas. I hope to have something to
            announce very soon.

Question:   How many welfare recipients will states have to put to work to meet the work
            requirements?

Answer:     For states to meet the work requirements included in the new welfare law, states
            must be move an additional 1 million recipients into work nationwide by the year
            2000.

Question:   You have mentioned several times that under the new welfare law, employers may
            turn the welfare andfood stamp checks into temporary wage subsidies. How
            does this actually work?

Answer:     As of August 22, 1996 when you signed the welfare law, 11 states had received
            waivers to modify work supplementation rules. Most of those waivers sought to
            combine AFDC and food stamp benefits to subsidize jobs. Oregon pioneered
            this concept. HHS is currently gathering more recent statistics on work
            supplementation since you signed the law. In Oregon, both private and public
            sector jobs are subsidized for up to six months per placement. The job is
            subsidized at minimum wage and gives employers cashed out AFDC and food
            stamps benefits to cover the minimum wage. In addition, the employee is entitled
            to the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). If the minimum wage and the EITC do
            not bring the recipient up to the poverty line, the employer must make up the
            difference by paying up to $1 dollar an hour over the reimbursed minimum wage
            or may put $1 for every hour worked into an Individual Development Account
            (IDA). Once a recipient is hired in a full-time, unsubsidized job, she becomes
            eligible for her wage, the EITC, and food stamps coupons previously used to
            subsidized her wage. Such a system creates an escalating financial incentive that
            always makes full-time, unsubsidized work the most attractive option

Welfare Reform: Food Stamps

Question:   The new welfare law cuts off food stamps for non-disabled adults who
            refuse to work after three months of benefits, and allows the Department
            of Agriculture to exempt areas with high unemployment. Why does the
            Administration want to give food stamp benefits to men and women who
            refuse to work?
                                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion


Answer:       Enacting the welfare law was an historic accomplishment that represents
              a significant step forward in social policy for this country. However, as I
              said when I signed this bill, several provisions of the law have nothing to
              do with the goal of welfare reform -- putting people to work. Instead, they
              cut back on our vital food safety net and are unfair to immigrants who
              have entered this country legally.

              I strongly support work requirements. But the welfare law's harsh and
              unreasonable time limit of 3 months in 36 cuts off people who want to work but
              can't find jobs. In my budget, I proposed an alternative: a real and tough work
              requirement without arbitrary cut-offs.

              Under my proposal, those who refused to work or refused to take advantage ofa
              work opportunity would face tough new penalties. We would limit food stamps to
              6 months out of 12. This policy would encourage work while giving those out of
              work the transitory help they need to get back on their feet. We proposed new
              funding and a wage supplementation option to expand the number of work slots
              available to this group by nearly 400,000 over five years. I am looking forward
              to working with Congress to enact this sensible proposal.

Background:
·    As of March 1, states will begin to cut off food stamp benefits for people who have not
     met the new work requirement in the welfare law.

·      Under the law, able-bodied childless adults between the ages of 18-50 are not permitted
       to get food stamps for more than 3 months in a 3-year period, unless they are working at
       least 20 hours a week.

·      USDA can waive the work requirement in cities or counties with high unemployment.
       To date, USDA has granted waivers to 23 states that exempt specified counties or cities
       with high unemployment.

·      Despite these exemptions, 600,000 individuals will lose their food stamp
       eligibility in FY98 due to this provision. Under the Administration's proposal,
       approximately 35,000 individuals would lose eligibility in FY98. Unlike the
       welfare law, the Administration's proposal targets tough sanctions at those
       individuals who are unwilling to work and to play by the rules.


Welfare Reform: Benefits To Legal Immigrants

Question:     Immigrants shouldn't be coming to the U.S. to get on welfare. Why is the
              Administration making restoration of these benefits a priority?
                                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion


Answer:     I believe that legal immigrants should have the same opportunity, and
            bear the same responsibility, as other members of our society. The
            welfare law denies most legal immigrants access to fundamental safety
            net programs unless they become citizens -- even though they are in the
            U.S. legally, are working and paying taxes and are responsible members
            of our communities. My Administration has always supported making
            individuals who encourage their relatives to emigrate to the United States
            responsible for the immigrant's well being. However, as a nation, we
            should not turn our backs on anyone who has lost their ability to earn a
            living due to injury, disease, or illness.

            Consequently, my budget proposes to make legal immigrants who
            become disabled after entering the United States eligible for SSI and
            Medicaid.

            My budget would also provide poor immigrant children the same Medicaid
            health care coverage low-income citizen children receive.

            The United States admits refugees and asylees into this country on a
            humanitarian basis. My budget proposes to lengthen the five-year
            exemption for refugees from the ban from five to seven years in order to
            give this group adequate time to naturalize.

            Finally, the law denies food stamps to most legal immigrants. My budget
            would delay the cutoffs from April 1, 1997 to August, 1997 in order to give
            immigrants more time to naturalize.


Welfare Reform Fix Legislative Proposals

Question:   You say you are ready to work with Congress to fix the immigrant andfood stamp
            parts of the welfare law, but the Republican leadership says the bill is fine as it is.
             Even some Democrats are saying the law shouldn't be changed until we have
            had a chance to see how it works. Doesn't this mean your proposals have no
            chance of being enacted?

Answer:     I think it is very significant that the nation's Governors are now on record as
            recognizing that the cuts in benefits to legal immigrants are too harsh and need to
            be addressed -- even though their final resolution was softened at the last minute
            at the request of the Congressional leadership.

            As the new welfare law is being implemented, the Governors are gaining a new
            appreciation of some parts of the bill that I have had a problem with from the
            beginning -- those parts that are not related to putting people to work. This is
            particularly true of those Governors in states with large numbers of legal
            immigrants. They are now looking more carefully at their state budgets and the

                                                                          Hex-Dump Conversion

                  fact that many legal immigrants who are disabled, many in nursing homes, will
                  lose their SSI and Medicaid over the summer. In addition to noting that these
                  provisions are unfair, they can see the potential costs to their own state budgets if
                . they make the decision to ameliorate those cuts.

                 I think that, over time, more and more people will come to see the harm that these
                 provisions could do to hard-working people who came to this country and,
                 through no fault of their own, became disabled and could no longer support their
                 families.

                 Also, I truly believe we are seeing some real changes in our relationship with the
                 Congress. It appears that we have gotten past some of the unproductive ways of
                 doing business we have had over the past two years, and that we are learning how
                 to work with one another in a far more constructive fashion.


    Question:   Last summer when you said you would sign the welfare bill there were
                press reports that you wanted to restore about $14 billion in cuts. Now
                we understand your budget includes $18 billion in legislative restorations.
                Are you proposing to restore more in food stamps and benefits to
                immigrants that you were last year?

    Answer:      No, absolutely not. The budget includes $18 billion in legislative
                 proposals for Food Stamps and immigrants that correspond directly to the
                 commitments I made at the time I signed the bill. Because of a number
                 of technical reestimates, the budget estimate for these legislative
                 proposals is now higher.

                The commitment I made to a $3 billion program to help the private sector,
                states, and cities move welfare recipients to work was always separate
                from that total, and was paid for separately elsewhere in my budget.
