TEXT:
I took the opportunity tonight to discuss with Bruce my concerns about our
strategy on America Reads and my view that, unless there is something I'm
missing, the most logical thing is to launch our legislation, build
grassroots support, and then negotiate from a position of str'ength, rather
than trying to strike a bargain on reading/literacy up front.

In a nutshell, he agrees that we need to have another discussion about
what approach makes the most sense.    He said Gene may be thinking that,
in the budget end-game, we will only get so many of our initiatives, so if
there is something we can lock in early, we should try to do it.; the
longer we put the R's in a position of opposing a specific proposal of
ours, the harder it may be for them to come to an agreement.    However,
Bruce has doubts about the likelihood of getting a Republican commitment
to a specific piece of legislation early on ....

Maybe this can be revisited at next Monday's ed strategy meeting (although
I won't be there).

By the way, Mike--I put in a call to Blocker today, but we never
connected ...

Bill
