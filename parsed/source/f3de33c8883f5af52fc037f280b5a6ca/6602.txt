TEXT:
As you all know, the President likes the idea of going to a high school
for the TIMSS Roundtable.  I think this will change the format of the
event, so if you all have any opinions please let me know.  If we go off
campus it pushes us towards some open press event. Right now here are the
options:

1.       Do a pool spray at top of the roundtable, then have POTUS give
remarks to an auditorium of students (open press) .    Downside:  it will
be hard for it to be anything but a rally; and I'm not sure an upbeat
crowd is the ideal opportunity for him to be serious about the TIMSS
results.

2.      Do the roundtable entirely open press.   It may help give the
press more to write about. What do you think?
