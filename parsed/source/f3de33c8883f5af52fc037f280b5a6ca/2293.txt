I'll do this.  I've got info on this -- but what I don't have is the
letter the governors sent the President. Can you get that to me?

Could one of you send me an email telling me (1) what the moe requirements
for the contingency fund are and (2) how the nga wants to change them? I
was trying to write an entry for the weekly on the governors' bifurcation
letter and realized I didn't have this necessary information.  Thanks
much.
