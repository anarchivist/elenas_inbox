STATEMENT OF ROBERT T. SCULLY, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR
NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF POLICE ORGANIZATIONS (NAPO)
ON THE PRESIDENTD,S RADIO ADDRESS ON POLICE MISCONDUCT

Washington, D.C. 0) D&Today, President Clinton praised the majority of our
nationD,s law enforcement officers for their success in lowering the
nationD,s crime rate to its lowest levels in decades.   And, the National
Association of Police Organizations agrees that even one incident of
police misconduct is one too many.   However, the majority of our nationD,s
nearly 700,000 law enforcement officers are honest, hardworking
individuals who are willing to put their lives on the line to protect the
public.   If we want to end the few cases of police misconduct that do
happen, we must both re-evaluate hiring practices and institute better
training and education programs. That is why NAPO has asked the
Administration and the Department of Justice for backing to produce
training and education programs to inform both police academy cadets
before they begin their law enforcement careers and those officers already
on the street exactly what happens to police officers that practice
misconduct 0) time in federal prison.   For the police to maintain its
strong stance against corruption, it is up to the municipalities to raise
the officer sO, salaries and hiring standards so that the more qualified
find the job appealing.   In addition, funding must be made available for
important training and education programs to prevent cases of police
misconduct.DB

The National Association of Police Organizations (NAPO) is a coalition of
police unions and associations from across the United States that serves
in Washington, DC to advance the interests of AmericaD,s law enforcement
officers through legislative and legal advocacy, political action and
education.  Founded in 1978, NAPO now represents 4,000 police


organizations and more than 220,000 sworn law enforcement officers.
