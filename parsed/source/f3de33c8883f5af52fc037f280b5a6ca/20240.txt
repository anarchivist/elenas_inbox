TEXT:
I just learned that the Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled that Milwaukee's
private school voucher program is constitutional. In light of the voucher
plan attached to the Senate bill last night. as well as the President's
support for the privately funded voucher plan annoucned yesterday by ted
Forstmann and John Walton. Mike might get a question on it today.
therefore. here is a quick Q&A:

Q.      The Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled today that the private school
voucher program in Milwaukee is cons.titutional. In light of the
PresidentD.s opposition to school vouchers. what is his view of this
decision?

A.      The President has not'had a chance to review the Court
decision.  However. the President is opposed to school vouchers because he
believes that we must use public funds to strengthen our public schools.
We must raise standards. increase accountability. expand public school
choice. and invest taxpayer resources in the steps that will make a
difference. such as reducing class size. improving teaching. and
modernizing our school buildings. He is opposed to diverting taxpayer
funds away from the public schools. which serve 90% of the students. when
the needs there are so great. The Wisconsin Supreme Court decision does
not changes these views. nor the PresidentD.s opposition to private school
vouchers.
