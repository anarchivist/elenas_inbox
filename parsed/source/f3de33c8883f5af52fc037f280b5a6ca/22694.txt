I spoke to Ann Lewis re NGA message for the 22nd.  She said that folks
wanted to do education accountability as our message. I told her it may
not be a lovefest, and she said that folks were aware, but wanted to have
that debate.  She did mention that they needed to check with POTUS again
cause he may not want a confrontation with his former peers.
