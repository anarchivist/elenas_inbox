MEMORANDUM FOR BRUCE REED
              GENE SPERLING

FROM                    Paul Weinstein

SUBJECT:               Update on Community Development Financial Institutions
                        (CDFI) Fund


The following memorandum describes the current state of operations at the CDFI Fund_

Completion of the First Round

        As you may be aware, the CDFI Fund has experienced some difficulties in finalizing grant
agreements between recipients of first round awards and the Fund. I have been in regular contact
with the Treasury Department about the importance of improving this process. I am pleased to
report there has been some modest improvement. As of today, about two-thirds of the CDFI
grantees have begun to draw down on the first round money. The CDFI Fund is planning on
closing the rest of the agreements with CDFI grantees by the time the House and Senate
Appropriations Committee begin their markup at the end of this month.

        Second round applications are currently in circulation. All applications for the second
round are due by June 20th. Treasury has taken several steps to insure that the mistakes and
delays experienced in the first round are not repeated. This includes hiring additional people at the
Fund and putting into effect controls to regularize the process.


New Initiatives Associated with the CDFI Fund

       Michael Barr is leading an effort at Treasury to develop new projects for the CDFI Fund.
The Department is looking into three areas. 1) Securitization. The agency is very interested in the
development of a secondary market for CDFI lending. Treasury is working closely with the
Commerce Department on a pilot program to fund intermediaries such as the Minnesota
Community Reinvention Corporation. They are also looking at government-wide regulations that
discourage CDFI securitization and are implementing an education program on secondary markets.

        2) Welfare-to-Work. Treasury is also developing ideas to encourage CDFls to invest in
individuals mOving from welfare-to-work. 3) Un-banked. The Department is reviewing proposals
to leverage the Bank Enterprise Act awards to increase financial service availability to the
un-banked.
