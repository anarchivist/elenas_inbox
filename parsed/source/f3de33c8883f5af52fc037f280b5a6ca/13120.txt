Elena,
I've sent the most recent draft of the release over to Lois and
Peter at Justice and told them that they have until Sunday morning
to put it into a form that they could stand to see released on
Monday.  I made it clear that there was a real determination
around here to get our side of the story out before the hearing.
If you need me, don't hesitate to call me at home over the weekend
I          P6/(b)(6)        I ,-,  11
Thanks for your help.         LOOa j
Tom
