    I want to update you on two conversations I had yesterday:

    1. I talked to Danica and told her we had gone as far as we could with the
    civil rights groups but still had a disagreement over language.  I walked
    her through the issues, and told her we thought it was time for Kennedy to
    get involved, and indicated we were thinking that Riley should give Kennedy
    a call to update him and ask for him to help bring this to a conclusion.

    Danica asked that we not have Riley call Kennedy yet. She and Michael will
    meet this morning to figure out what they think Kennedy's next step should
    be.   She expects that he will want to support our view and press the civil
    rights groups to give more ground, and therefore expected that Kennedy
    would
    prefer to talk to Wade et. al. rather than Riley at this point.

    I will talk with her this morning to see what happened in her discussion
    with Michael.

    2.  I talked with Bill Taylor last evening and told him that his latest
    offer was unacceptable, because it failed to include language that required
    students to meet standards before being promoted. Bill seemed genuinely
    concerned that we would fail to reach an agreement after all this time and
    effort, after coming so close, and in light of what is at stake in the rest
,
"
    of ESEA.

     We talked at length about several alternatives he proposed (almost none
    of
    which were an improvement over his other offer, though I promised to share
    on for reaction -- see below), and about the underlying issues of what
    happens to kids who don't meet standards.

    At bottom, Bill is trying to find language that he believes will meet our
    requirements, while not at the same time requiring that kids who do not
    meet
    standards are "retained, as a punitive, noneducational step".  In his view,
    any formulation that includes the notion that kids would be required to
    meet
    standards before being promoted would inevitably require "punitive
    retention" even if only as a last resort.

    I indicated that we could not envision a workable formulation that did not
    include a requirement that kids meet standards.  With regard to the
    inevitability of "punitive retention", I also indicated that our language
    requiring multiple measures, including teacher judgement, left room for
    case-by-case judgments rather than automatic retention for a kid who didn't
    meet the standards after comprehensive interventions, age-appropriate
    placements, and any other educational intervention that the school tried.
    He was unconvinced.

    I agreed to share with all of you one of the alternatives Bill proposed
    during our conversation.  I did this partly as a way to not slam the door
    on
    further conversations, and partly because (compared to his other proposals)
    it was sufficiently vague that I couldn't be immediately sure it couldn't
    be
    read in an acceptable fashion. Here it is:

               "The components of state policy under this section shall:

                    Require steps by State's, local education agencies, parents
    and students to ensure that all students will meet challenging academic
    performance standards required under section 1111(b) (1) (A) at three key
    transition points as determined by the' State ..... "

    Upon reflection, it is still vague, and I can't see how it gives us what we
    need.

    Next steps:

    1. I will talk to Danica this morning, and make sure we are moving fairly
    rapidly along toward some step by Kennedy, either with the civil rights
    groups alone or with all of us.  I'll fill her in on the conversation I had
    will Bill last night (though I suspect Bill will also call her).  I think
    we
    should hold off on a Riley call to Kennedy unless Danica thinks its a good
    idea, or unless it looks like Danica and Michael are coming down on the
    wrong side.

    2. Get back to me with any reaction to Bill's language. Assuming you
    agree
    that this language is unacceptable, I want to get back to him this morning
    so that he doesn't send Donica a signal that our negotiations are
    continuing


    and thereby forestall action by her.
