                           AAUW STUDY ON SINGLE-SEX EDUCATION



        Question:   Today's New York Times reports that the AAUW has released a new study on
                    single-sex education that finds no overall evidence that single-sex education was
                    better for girls than coeducation. In light of these findings, does the
                    administration continue to support the establishment of single-sex schools, such
                    as the Young Women's Leadership Academy which is currently the subject of a
                    complaint filed with the U.S. Department of Education?

        Answer:     We agree with the AAUW on the point that single-sex schools are not a silver
                    bullet for educational achievement -- and that challenging standards, stronger
                    curriculums, smaller classes and well-qualified teachers are essential elements of a
                    good education. And that's why the President has been fighting to get these
                    crucial reforms into every school in this Nation. The President also believes that
                    parents ought to have expanded choices in the public school system, including the
                    option to have their children attend single-sex schools.
