Q&A on Representative HydeO,s Media Violence Proposals
June 8, 1999


Q: TodayO,s Wall Street Journal says that Rep. Henry Hyde will propose new
legislation to limit childrenO,s access to media that contains violence.
What is the AdministrationO,s position on the Hyde proposals?

A:   The President has repeatedly called for further steps to limit
childrenO,s exposure to violence.  While we have not seen the specifics of
Chairman HydeO,s proposals and cannot comment on them, we look forward to
working with all parties on this crucial problem in a manner consistent
with the First Amendment.  We believe it is vital that this package, in
particular the crucial gun control legislation, move through the House
expeditiously.
