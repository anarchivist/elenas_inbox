TEXT:
Senate

1.   Friday meeting with Daschle staff and other democratic staff

2.   After that, possible meeting with task force members

Additional meetings are possible after meeting with the Daschle folks.

House

1. House Commerce Committee Democratic staff (Dingell - Reid Stuntz,
Waxman - Phil Shilero, and possible additional staff from their
offices)

2.   Representative Boucher (D-VA)

3.   Representative DeGette (D-CO)

4.   Commerce Committee Chairman Bliley (R-VA)

5. Gephardt staff (not clear who this is at present due to recent
departure)

Depending on how these go, we can set up additional meetings with
agriculture/tobacco members/staff.  Increasingly, however, it sounds like
the House Democrats are not very interested in pushing legislation.  There
is also concern because the issue splits the caucus.
