           I want to commend the Senate for reversing its position of last year and voting
  overwhelmingly today to require that child safety locks be provided with every gun sold. This
  was a common sense yet courageous vote by the Senate that is sure to prevent tragic shootings
. and gun-related accidents in the future. I also want to thank Speaker Hastert for coming out in
  support of our proposals to close the gun show loophole and to raise the age of handgun
  ownership to 21 years of age. The Senate should likewise put progress over politics and give
  their strong backing to these reasonable measures to keep guns out of the hands of kids and
  criminals.
