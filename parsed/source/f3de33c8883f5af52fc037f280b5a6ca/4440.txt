TEXT:
Sorry we missed you at today's meeting.     A brief run down:

WH Statement: We agreed that we should have a statement prepared for
release on 9/30, when the Commission releases its report. We (DPC) will
draft the statement and circulate it internally by Friday. The statement
will be general: thanking the Commission for their work, saying that we
will seriously review their recommendations, etc. We will not mention our
internal follow up process in the statement. We will also coordinate
some Q&A for McCurry in case we get asked about issues we do not want to
put in our·statement.

Process:   We agreed to form an informal WH-Ied work group to specifically
review three things: 1) Commission's proposal; 2) INS reform plan already
in existence; and 3) ONDCP's recommendations on border/enforcement
issues. The work group will coordinate an interagency process explore the
feasibility of these recommendations. Our internal goal to finish the
process is the end of the calendar year, which would allow us to use the
FY 99 budget as a vehicle if we choose.  I will work with Jose' and Steve
to set up these meetings.

Follow Up Meeting with AG/Meissner: Chuck suggested that a small WH group
meet with the AG and Meissner next .week after the Commission's report is
released to inform them of our process.

** You may want to put in a call to Chuck regarding today's meeting and to
check in with him on the follow up meeing with the AG.
