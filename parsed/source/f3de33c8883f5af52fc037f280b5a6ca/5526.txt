TEXT:
Because the President is going to the Bronx on Wednesday, Christa thought
Rahm might want NYC caseload numbers for the fact sheet.  I got them, but
it turns out they are not much to crow about, so I think we should leave
them out.

 Case loads have dropped 15 percent in the New York State since Clinton
 became President and by slightly less than that -- 13 percent -- in New
.York City, compared to 27 percent in the nation as a whole. About 100,000
 fewer people are on welfare in New York City (the rolls are down from
 about 770,000 to about 670,000 individuals).
