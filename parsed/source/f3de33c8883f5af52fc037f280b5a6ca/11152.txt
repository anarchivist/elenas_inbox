TEXT:
Per John's request I called Caroline Verveer, in Bob Graham's office, to
say that we would get together after I returned from Mexico to discuss
Graham's ideas for how to proceed with this tough issue. She said that
they were open to working and were not starting with the Wyden bill.
Elena--you had said you had a mtg late last week--remind me, what was it
on; and also you, Karen and I discussed that we would need to get DOL on
the same page (whatever that page is )--so it seems to me time for a small
mtg among us to figure out we're doing here--I'd like to do it Friday or
Tues of next week---tell me what works and let's discuss agenda and
participants--not a large mtg.
