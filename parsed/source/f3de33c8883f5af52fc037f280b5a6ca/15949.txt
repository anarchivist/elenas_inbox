TEXT:
I just heard that Senate Finance didn't do the Medicaid grandfathering of
kids losing SSI under the new definition -- which was part of the budget
agreement. And it got struck in the House. Bad news -- disability
community is very concerned.  I assume our next best hope is to get Chafee
and/or Conrad to do something on the floor (I don't know why they didn't
in committee; they are supposedly champions of this group).    In the
meantime, we need to keep talking about this in our communications.

Cynthia, I think we need to talk to Chafee and Conrad about this.
