 TEXT:
 This letter replaces the draft sent to you 6/19/98 (revised LRM CJB221)
 for the Wed., June 24th H. Committee markup of HR 3248.    It addresses a
 substitute bill prepared by Rep. Goodling that would replace the original
  (Rep. Pitts') bill -- the revised bill text was also circulated earlier
 today.   The letter now asserts that the President's senior advisers would
 rec'ommend he veto HR 3248.    (Further explanation of how the substitute
 bill differs from the bill as introduced appears for your information in a
 note below the letter.)

   *** Please provide any comments by 12:00 noon, Tuesday, June 23rd ***

 Revised Draft 6/22/98

 Honorable William Goodling
 Chairman
 Committee on Education and the Workforce
 United States House of Representatives
 Washington, DC 20515

 Dear Mr. Chairman:

 I am writing to express my strong objections to H.R. 3248, the "Dollars to
 the Classroom Act," both to the bill as originally introduced by
 Representative pitts and to a substitute version that I understand you
 will propose. This legislation would convert a wide array of Federal
 education programs into block grants. The President stated last fall that
 such a step is unacceptable, and that he would use his veto power to
 prevent this approach from becoming law.  If H.R. 3248 were presented to
 the President, his senior advisers would recommend that he veto it.

 The issue here is not about who controls public education -- we all agree
 that that responsibility rests at the local and State levels. At stake,
 rather, is whether the Federal Government will maintain its long-standing,
 bipartisan commitment to helping local communities strengthen
 accountability, raise standards, and improve student achievement, by
 providing assistance that focuses on our neediest children and schools and
 on activities in which national leadership can playa critical role.


The American people rightly look to the Federal Government to focus its
efforts not on general aid to school districts, which H.R. 3248 would
provide, but for leadership on national priorities, such as helping States
and school districts raise educational standards for all students,
improving the quality of teaching, bringing the benefits of technology to
our Nation's students, and increasing the availability of after-school
programs.

This Administration has worked diligently to eliminate unnecessary
regulations and take other steps to promote State and local flexibility in
carrying out these targeted efforts. At the same time, we have supported
strong accountability mechanisms, such as the Government Performance and
Results Act of 1993, that ensure program effectiveness and results that
justify continued support by the taxpayers.  Block grants would replace
these worthy efforts with general aid, providing no focus, no
accountability for results, and no rationale for ongoing support.
I am also very concerned about language in the pending substitute that
would provide broad authority to waive Federal requirements, now afforded
to 12 States with comprehensive education reform plans, to all States.
While I am a strong supporter of flexibility at the State and local
levels, including expansion of the current "Ed-Flex" authority to
additional States, this proposal lacks the essential ingredient of
accountability, connected to high standards and high expectations for all
children, that must go hand in hand with such a broad waiver authority.

The Office of Management and Budget advises that there is no objection to
the submission of this report from the standpoint of the Administration's
program and that enactment of H.R. 3248 would not be in accord with the
President's program.


                                                          Yours sincerely,



                                                          Richard W. Riley


     Notes for Executive Branch reviewers of draft letter from Sec. Riley:

       A few more comments on the Goodling substitute:

        (1)   The block grant provisions are   a lot   more straightforward than
in
       the pitts original.  Instead of putting Congress through the exercise
       of appropriating funds under numerous current programs and then
       diverting those funds to block grants, the substitute would simply
       repeal (most of) those programs, and create a new program that,
       notwithstanding its long list of authorized activities, is pretty
hard
       to distinguish from general aid.

        (2)  The list of blocked programs is a little bit shorter.  Goodling
       'has deleted OERI research and dissemination and Safe and Drug-Free
        Schools from the hit list.  This changes the examples we'll use in th
e
    Secretary's letter, but not the overall points on the
Administration's
    objections to block grants.


       (3) Title I. The pitts version had a provision that, while
difficult
      to interpret with confidence, could have been read to let LEAs use 95
      percent of their Title I funds for any classroom activities they
found
      appropriate, without regard to any of the normal Title I provisions.
      This provision is not in Goodling's version. Goodling's version,
      however, has an equally puzzling provision (section 202, p. 30) that
      amends the schoolwide programs authority (ESEA, sec. 1114).   It looks
      like it would eliminate the poverty thresholds, thus allowing an LEA
      to run a schoolwide program in any Title I school.   (I can't follow
      the literal bill language, but it's hard to see what else they might
      have in mind.)

      (4) Waivers. Goodling'S bill adds a waiver authority in Title II of
      the bill. Having repealed Title III of Goals 2000, his bill would
      then resurrect, almost word for word, the current waiver provisions
in
      section 311 of Goals 2000. He would make every State eligible for
      Ed-Flex authority (only 12 States c·an have it now), while removing
any
      connection to an approved State plan under Goals 2000 as a condition
      of attaining Ed-Flex status.  I've added a paragraph to the
      Secretary's letter expressing concern over this lack of
      accountability.
