TEXT:
At our last weekly welfare reform meeting we learned that Olivia will be
visiting several states in the midwest in coming weeks, including a trip
to Milwaukee.  I asked if she would brief us on what she hears,
particularly about welfare reform.  I think she would like it if Bruce
and/or Elena could attend.  She can come to our regular Tuesday afternoon
welfare reform meeting on 4/21 at 4 p.m., in which case the other agencies
can also participate. Would either of you be able to attend then?
Alternatively, she is available Monday 4/20 at 4 or Friday 5/1 at 4.
