As promised, here is your ass{sted suicide update.  I know it is a bit too
long, but I thought you might want the information contained in it to give
the POTUS a good sense of the status of this bill on the Hill, the
complications of this issue and our response to it.

Hope you find it to be helpful.    Call or page with questions.

Abuse Prevention Act (H.R. 4006/S. 2151) next week. Speaker Gingrich has announced his
intention to bring H.R. 4006 for a vote before the House and Senator Hatch has scheduled a
mark-up of S. 2151 in his Judiciary Committee for next Thursday.

As you will recall, the Lethal Drug Abuse Prevention Act would empower the Drug
Enforcement Agency to prosecute physicians who inapproriately used pain control medications to
assist in a suicide of a patient. While we have consistently underscored your opposition to and
abhorence of assisted suicide, we have opposed this legislation because we felt it was an
inappropriate and ill-advised use of DEA's limited resources and because, like AMA and a host
of other national health care organizations (who also oppose assisted suicide), we fear the
intimidating effect it would have on the willingness of physicians to appropriately prescribe
already underutilized pain relieving medications for the terminally ill.

Despite our opposition to H.R. 4006, it appears that Speaker Gingrich has a sufficient number
of votes to pass this legislation through the House. Having said this, the provider and hospice
communities' compelling argument of this bill's negative impact on palliative care is apparently
starting to have an impact. We will be sending up a Statement of Administration Policy on
Monday to reiterate our opposition to the current draft of H.R. 4006 and to restate our
commitment to working with the Congress to develop an approach that more effectively deals
with this complex and controversial issue.

On the Senate side, Senator Hatch has been' insisting that the Administration reconcile our
position against assisted suicide with our opposition to S. 2151, the Lethal Drug Abuse
Prevention Act. In an attempt to box in our position, he requested that we submit an alternative
approach that you could support. He is now insisting that we forward a formal response to
him prior to his scheduled mark-up of S. 2151 next week.

Because of myriad of health and federalism controversies surrounding this issue and the limited
time left in this Congressional session, it is virtually impossible to imagine producing any
workable legislation that would satisfy Senators' Nickles and Hatch without severely impacting on
palliative care for the terminally ill. Doing so would also seriously strain our relationships with
almost every respected member of the health provider and consumer community and, of course,
the entire Oregonian delegation, particularly Senator Wyden.

We do believe, however, that we need to respond to Senator Hatch's request. To accomplish
this, we recommend forwarding a letter from Justice that more explicitly illustrates our
commitment to work collaboratively on this issue. It would combine a reiteration of your
strong opposition to assisted suicide with a specific commitment to work with the Congress to
establish (either by statute or through a new executive action) a new advisory board to develop
consensus guidelines on the appropriate use of controlled substances for terminally ill patients.
Such guidelines would be designed to be sufficiently clear that a physician who followed them

most appropriate enforcement entity, as well as the authority and responsibility such an entity
would have. It would have representatives of doctors, nurses, consumers, ethicists, law
enforcement officials and others, and it would have a mutually agreed to timeframe (say 90 days)
for reporting back to the Congress and the Administration.

We believe the health, hospice, and consumer communities' arguments against S. 2151 will have'
a more significant impact on both the Judiciary Committee and the full Senate. As of this
writing, we are fairly confident that the Senate will be unable to pass legislation in this area,
primarily because of the limited time left in this session, Senator Wyden's strong opposition to it
and his commitment to use delay tactics on the Senate floor, and a growing concern about the
unintended consequences of passing this legislation in the Senate. We will keep you apprised of
developments.
