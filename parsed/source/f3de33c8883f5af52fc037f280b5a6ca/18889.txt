PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
RADIO ADDRESS ON TOBACCO
THE WHITE HOUSE
March 7, 1998

        Good morning.  Since I took office I have done everything in my
power to protect our children from harm. WeO,ve worked to teach our
children that drugs are dangerous, illegal, and wrong.  This week, we took
a major step to protect all Americans -- especially our young people --
from the danger of drunk driving, by proposing bipartisan legislation to
lower the legal limit to .08 in every state.  Today, I want to talk to you
about the historic opportunity we now have to protect our nationO,s
children from a far more deadly threat: smoking.

        Smoking kills more people every day than AIDS, alcohol, car
accidents; murders, suicides, drugs and fires combined -- and nearly 90%
of those smokers lit their first cigarette before they turned 18. Today,
the epidemic of teen smoking is raging through our nation as, one by one,
our children are lured in by multi-million dollar marketing schemes
designed to do exactly that.   More of our children are smoking than every
before.  In fact, 3,000 children start to smoke every day ... and 1,000 of
them will die because of it.

        This is a national tragedy in the making that every American
should be honor-bound to help prevent.  For more than five years we have
worked to stop our children from smoking before they start, launching a
nationwide campaign with the FDA to educate them about the dangers of
smoking, to reduce their access to tobacco products, and to severely
restrict tobacco companies from advertising to young people.

        But even this is not enough to fully protect our children. To put
an end to this epidemic, Congress must act.     Last Fall I called on the
Congress to put aside politics and pass comprehensive bipartisan
legislation that raises the price of cigarettes by up to $1.50 a pack over
the next 10 years so our children can!.!, t afford to buy them ... that gives
the FDA the full authority to regulate tobacco products so our children
canO,t reach them ... and that outlaws tobacco ads aimed at young people,
so our children canO,t fall prey to the deadly threat of tobacco.



        We learned last week that if we do this, we will cut teen smoking
by almost half over the next five years.  If we act now, we have it in our
power to stop three million children from smoking -- and to save one
million lives as a result.

        There are only about 70 legislative days left before this Congress
adjourns. On everyone of those days, 1,000 adults will die from
smoking. On everyone of those days, 3,000 children will light their
first cigarette. And on everyone of those days, this Congress has the
opportunity to stop them.

        So on this day, I call upon the Congress once again to take that
opportunity, and pass comprehensive bipartisan legislation that protects
our children from tobacco. There is no more important step you can take
this year. And there will be no greater measure of your commitment to the
health of our children or the future of our nation.   Thanks for listening.
