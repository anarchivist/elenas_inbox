      Police Corps

      As part ofthe Service Summit, you will be announcing $20 million in grants to 17 states for the
      Police Corps program. The Police Corps was created in your 1994 Crime Bill to increase the
      number of community police officers with advanced education and training, and was one of your
      pledges during the 1992 presidential campaign.

      The Police Corps offers educational assistance to qualified college students who commit to enter
      the police after graduation and serve in the force for at least four years. Students accepted into
      the Police Corps receive up to $7,500 in educational assistance for up to four years of
      undergraduate study. In addition, Corps recruits receive 16 weeks of rigorous training to help
      make them effective community police officers.

      As an incentive to police departments to take recruits, state and local law enforcement agencies
      receive cash assistance for employing Police Corps officers-- $10,000 per participant for each
      year of the recruit's service.

      The announcement nearly triples the number of states that will receive Police Corps funds, from
      6 to 17 states, and is double the funding appropriated in FY 1996 for the program. Your FY 1998
      budget contains $20 million in funding for Police Corps.
