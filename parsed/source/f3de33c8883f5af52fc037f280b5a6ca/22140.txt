TEXT:
A correction from the 6:30 meeting:  you should have received a copy of
the "Building One Nation" chapter in a package from Staff Secretary
yesterday. Apologies for the confusion; I thought it was still in the OMB
editing process.  Comments are due by 4 tomorrow.  If you did not receive
a copy, please call me at 55733 and I will get you one.
