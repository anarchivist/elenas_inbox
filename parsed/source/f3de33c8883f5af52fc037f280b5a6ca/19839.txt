TEXT:
The network coverage if you missed it, ranged from ok (CBS mentioned the
legislation, showed a clip of Clinton, and its Friedman interview) to bad,
ABC (edited Friedman in mid-sentence so he doesn't say anything about the
legislation) to ugh, NBC (alarmist, just says Congress and the
Administration blame each other.)

The next test on this issue is   Collins' hearing Thursday. The topic is
the GAO report and she'll have   GAO and a former FDA investigator who may
describe how the safety system   can be cheated.  So far, Collins has not
invited FDA to testify, though   they made clear they would be available.

Without FDA, it becomes more likely the story stays on the problem, and
Collins avoids stories saying that a bill is pending and Congress should
act.  I wonder if we shouldn't more formerly press to testify and put her
in the position of refusing to have administration testimony. Any ideas?

FDA has sent me some material on further legislation they would like on in
this area on civil penalties which I will pass along. They suggested they
could ask for· this additional tool this week prior to the hearings, but it
seems a little small. We need a way to focus on the languishing
legislation.
