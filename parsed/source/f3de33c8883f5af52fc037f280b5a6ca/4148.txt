Subject:         Tobacco Ad

FYI, The Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids is running an ad on Tuesday,
September 2, with the following headline "Tobacco is a Back Room Budget
Deal." The ad criticizes the tobacco industry on slipping in the $50
billion into the budget bill. The ad does not mention the White House.
