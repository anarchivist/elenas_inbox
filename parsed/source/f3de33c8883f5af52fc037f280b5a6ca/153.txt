TEXT:
Per WH Leg Affairs (Jacoby) the Crime Victims Fund provisions will
be dropped from the bill. There will be added a provision from a
Senate bill that will authorize HUO to make grants to
not-for-profits to rebuild churches.
The second paragraph of the SAP sent to you a short wile ago will
be deleted and may be replaced with a reference to supporting the
"HUO" piece.
