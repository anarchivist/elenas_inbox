TEXT:
 FYI: In addition to the brain and volunteer meetings, the CEB is in the
planning stages of a White House Community Empowerment Conference
tentatively scheduled for some time during the week of April 15th in
Detroit.

I imagine that once the CEB Director is final then their conference plans
will follow suit.

I am involved in their planning process and we are all on the same page in
trying to link these three major April conferences in some way.
