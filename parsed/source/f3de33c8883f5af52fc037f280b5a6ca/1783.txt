TEXT:
The letter says in part "We are writing to commend your ongoing commitment
to restore SSI, Medicaid and other benefits to legal immigrants, which
were cut or eliminated through enactment of the 104th Congress' welfare
reform initiative. As budget negotiations with Congress proceed, we are
prepared to stand firmly with you to demand that key federal benefits to
legal immigrants be restored." Signed by Senators Wellstone, Durbin,
Kennedy, John Kerry, Bob Graham, Boxer, and Lautenberg.

number.
