TEXT:
The votes are in.   After going into the weekend neck and neck, Word
Perfect rolled ahead on the "all change is bad" campaign. A key turning
point was Bruce Reed's comment that Microsoft Word and Word Perfect were,
in his view, "virtually identical, but ... (Microsoft) Word has a handful of
annoying features."

The argument from Microsft Word supporters that we should switch because
the rest of the·country is moving in that direction created little
support.  Jose Cerda's view that we should support the monopolization of
the computer world because the information revolution is based on
different economic principles than the industrial revolution, was also a
non-starter.

Tom Freedman, leader of the Microsoft Word coalition was unavailable for
comment.
