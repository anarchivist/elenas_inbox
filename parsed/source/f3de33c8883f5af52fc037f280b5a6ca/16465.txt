TEXT:
I am trying to write up FLSA and anti-displacement for a very general
audience, to put into the NEe "budget wins" document that is now
circulating. Here's what I have; it's pretty sketchy, but I'm not sure
how to embellish without making it sound too left. NEC says they want all
comments this a.m.  Can you let me know what you think?

Preserves the minimum wage and other labor protections for welfare
recipients moving from welfare to work.   Does not include the
House-passed provision to leave workfare participants unprotected by the
Fair Labor Standards Act and other employment laws.
Protects workers from displacement by those leaving the welfare rolls, and
establishes a process for workers to raise grievances.
