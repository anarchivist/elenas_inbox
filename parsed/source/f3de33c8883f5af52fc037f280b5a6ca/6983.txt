TEXT:
Just talked to Maria--she could be talked into the middle option if it
were described in such a way that made it clear we weren't pushing kids
out of programs if they didn't learn English in 3 years.  She wants some
language to that effect (either in POTUS (VOTUS???Riley???) remarks or in
the press paper that gets handed out, that could be used to calm down the
advocates.

I don't know if there is language that would give Maria what she wants,
and not appear to you, Bruce and Rahm to undermine the clear principle.
Further, I think the value of a clear principle is that you don't muck it
up with a whole bunch of explanatory statements and loopholes--that's what
we have legislation for!
