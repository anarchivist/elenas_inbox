TEXT:
The letter is regarding the U.S. Marshals Service preventing security officers
from organizing.  I have re-faxed you the incoming.  Is this something that
would be better handled be the Department of Justice? This incoming is dated
7/16/96, and if I am to do a POTUS response, I need to get a draft asap.  Thanks
for your help with this.
