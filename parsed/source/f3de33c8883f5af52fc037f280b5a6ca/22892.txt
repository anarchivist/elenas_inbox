       Dear Hugh:

       Thank you for your thoughtful letter on the issue of police abuse and misconduct. I
       appreciate your recommendations on this difficult issue, and have forwarded your letter to
       the Attorney General for her consideration [as she continues to work with state and local
       law enforcement agencies on these matters].

       But I want to be clear: My Administration is committed to vigorously enforcing the law,
       including against those police officers who would betray the public's trust through
       lawlessness or brutality. We are equally committed to strengthening the bond between
       community residents and their local police, and making the criminal justice system more
       responsive to the public safety needs of all our people.

       Again, thank you for your letter. I have asked Chuck Ruff, the White House Counsel, to
       follow up with you personally.

       BC
