     Subject: One more question

     If you haven't already talked to the policy/leg. people, one more
     question:

     There is also some talk that the Republicans will try to sweeten the
     Coverdell piece with add ons, including possibly something on school
     infrastructure that the President would like (e.g, something akin to his
     infrastructure initiative). We're concerned that this might complicate
     his veto position. Could you also explore that for us?

     Thanks so much.
