                                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion
                                Q&A on the Safety of Imported Food
                                      September 25, 1997


     Q:   I have young children and I am worried about the safety ofthe food I buy for them. I am
          especially concerned about the stories I have read about the outbreaks of foodbome
          disease linked to imported food. Is food produced in the United States safer than
          imported food?

     A:   Both U.S. and foreign produced food are extremely safe. In fact, our nation's food
          supply today is probably the safest it has ever been, and we are working to make it even
          safer. During the last four and half years the Clinton Administration has taken a number
          of steps to further improve the safety of the food we eat. With the help of the
          Vice-President's National Performance Review, we have fundamentally enhanced the
          way we ensure the safety of meat, poultry, and seafood. We put in place important new
          protections against the risks of pesticides in our food, especially for our children. And
          Congress has recently agreed to provide most of the $43 million the President requested
          to improve food safety and beginning next month we will be using that money to further
          reduce the incidence of foodborne illness.

          In rare cases, however, food produced either here or abroad has caused an outbreak of
          foodborne illness. We are committed to taking additional steps to further ensure that all
          of our food is safe whether domestic or imported.


     Q:   It seems like we are hearing about more outbreaks of foodborne illness. Are we
          experiencing an increase in the number of outbreaks of foodborne disease?

     A:   Even though our food supply is among the safest in the world, each year there are still
          millions of Americans who get sick from the food they eat. The overwhelming majority
          of these cases are what is known as sporadic illnesses. These illnesses are individual
          cases not related to one another and are not caused by a single, specific contaminated
          food. An "outbreak" of foodborne disease is when many people become sick from being
          exposed to the same source of contaminated food.

          As a result of new steps we have taken over the last four years, we are doing a more
          thorough job looking for outbreaks than we have ever done before. Experts we have
          consulted say that our improved surveillance is one of the primary reasons we are hearing
          about more food-related illnesses. We our catching and quickly responding to outbreaks
          of foodborne illness that we often missed in the past.
