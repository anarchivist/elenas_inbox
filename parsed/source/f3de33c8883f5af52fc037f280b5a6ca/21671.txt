TEXT:
Unfortunately, as this Times story indicates, the conflict between Jason
Turner and Mayor Gui1iani over the Food Stamp/Medicaid application policy
has heated up (there have also been stories in the Daily News and
Newsday) .

We're right on the policy: PRWORA amended Food Stamp law to say "a State
agency ... shall permit an applicant household to apply to participate in
the program on the same day that the household first contacts a food stamp
office in person during office hours." NYC is resting its argument that
it can force applicants to wait until their second visit to get a Food
Stamp application on the fact that USDA has not promulgated regs yet.

Devorah or Jeanne    could you verify the basis for the Medicaid policy
(i.e., statute or reg) and get a copy of it?

I've gotten USDA out of the limelight    they are only talking to
reporters on background to correct factual errors, and they are not
engaged in any discussions with the city (regional office staff are still
on site checking records). What worries me is that Guiliani is way out
there, and views this issue as a challenge to his work first welfare
strategy.   I'm trying to figure out what if anything we can do.    Any
thoughts?

HEADLINE: Mayor Backs City Policy On welfare
BYLINE: By RACHEL L. SWARNS
BODY:
   Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani yesterday defended his policy of delaying the
distribution of food stamp and Medicaid applications to the poor and
denied that
his Welfare Commissioner had ever said the policy would change.

   Mr. Giuliani's remarks came as Federal officials from the Department of
Agriculture and the Health Care Financing Administration continued their
inquiry
into the city's welfare policies. The Federal officials have said the city
appeared to be violating the law by delaying applications in an effort to
discourage the needy from applying for welfare.

    On Sunday, the Welfare Commissioner, Jason A. Turner, told The New York
Times that he planned to speed up the distribution of applications as an
 extra
II


precaution" to mollify Federal officials. "Our new policy is just to hand
them a
food stamp application," Mr. Turner said in the telephone interview,
calling the
change "an improvement."

    But yesterday, Mr. Giuliani denied that Mr. Turner had ever made that
statement. The Mayor did not explain why he did not dispute those comments
on
Monday, the day when Mr. Turner's comments appeared, and Colleen Roche, a
spokeswoman for Mr. Giuliani, declined to elaborate yesterday. Mr. Turner
was
not available for comment yesterday, according to his press secretary,
Debra
Sproles.

   "The Commissioner didn't say that," Mr. Giuliani said during a hews
conference yesterday, referring to the comments published in The Times.
"Sometimes; things aren't reported exactly the way somebody says something
because there is an emotional or ideological bias that drives the way
something
is reported."

   Joyce Purnick, the metropolitan editor of The Times, dismissed Mr.
Giuliani's
accusations.

    "Our reporter had two extensive conversations with Mr. Turner on
Sunday, took
detailed notes, and never got a subsequent complaint from him saying he was
quoted incorrectly," Ms. Purnick said. "We do not make things up, nor are
our
reporters politically motivated."

   Mr. Giuliani's remarks were the city's latest response to questions
about the
Federal inquiry into his welfare policies. The topic is sensitive for the
Giuliani administration since the Mayor has repeatedly described his tough
welfare policy as one of his primary accomplishments.

   The Mayor is particularly proud of his decision to convert welfare
offices


    into "job centers," where the needy are encouraged to rely on jobs,
    relatives
    and food pantries instead of on government checks.

       In the job centers, the vast majority of people receive applications
    only on
    their second visit, the practice that touched off the Federal inquiry.
    Federal
    law requires city officials to give food stamp and Medicaid applications
    upon an
    applicant's first visit.

       Mr. Turner said on Sunday that the city would expedite the distribution
    of
    applications. On Monday, city officials appeared to reverse themselves,
    saying
    they would not speed the process after all. Anthony P. Coles, a senior
    adviser
    to Mr. Giuliani, said the Agriculture Department had decided to judge the
    city's
    programs based on the 1996 Federal welfare law, which allows states and
    cities
    to delay welfare applications.

       The current law governing food stamps and Medicaid, however, requires
    city
    officials to distribute applications without delay. And officials from the
    Department of Agriculture and Health Care Financing Administration said
    those
    existing laws still applied.

        On Friday, Medicaid officials are to meet with state health officials,
    who
    are responsible for monitoring the city'S Medicaid program. The Federal
    officials, who have requested copies of the city's application and referral
    procedures, hope to determine whether the city's program complies with
    Federal
    law.
