TEXT:
Okay, now that Herman is done you can expect that the volunteer bill will
no longer be filibustered and I'm not sure what's going to happen here.
(We knew we were going to lose Lieberman on the cloture vote today). Have
we decided anything about the Leahy alternative?

On products, the Senate Commerce Committee has its mark-up tomorrow and we
don't expect anything out of the ordinary. breaux talked to rockefeller
who said he plans to vote against the bill and it'll be a party-line
vote.  breaux is not planning to offer his alternative tomorrow.

We need to keep in mind though that the volunteer bill can be amended with
products and staff of a few of the democrats are concerned that that might
be the plan.  I'm checking with folks now and will keep you posted.
