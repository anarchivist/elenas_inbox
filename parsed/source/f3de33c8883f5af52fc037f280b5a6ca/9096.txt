ADVISORY BOARD ACTIVITIES

Advisory Board Report. Advisory Board members Angela Oh and Governor William
Winter spent part of the week in our offices working on the Advisory Board's report to
you. Advisory Board members Bob Thomas and Governor Tom Kean participated via
telephone. Their discussions focused primarily on the recommendations section of the
report.

OFFICE OF THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR

Visit to the Lummi Reservation in Washington State. On August 17, senior staff met with
the tribal leader of the Lummi Indian Business Committee and the tribe's economic development
officer on the Lummi Reservation in Washington state. In addition to a tour of the reservation's
clam and oyster hatchery, the work of the Initiative and future economic development needs of
the reservation were discussed.

I have attached, for your review, an article in the Washington Post by Tom and George Manatos.
The Manatos brothers are area student leaders who, inspired by the Initiative, have organized a
network of students across the country to address the issue of racial reconciliation at their
generational level.

Note: Federal Agencies will not be reporting for the remainder of August.
