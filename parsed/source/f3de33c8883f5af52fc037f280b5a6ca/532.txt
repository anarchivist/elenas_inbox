 Gene,
 For purposes of the principles that you may be sending up on the WTW Jobs
 Challenge and the WOTC, may I suggest a couple of sub-principles that I hope you
 will either think about including or be open to negotiating
 1. WOTC -- enable non-profits who hire eligible recipients to sell the tax
 credit to corporations. This would do three good things: (1) put whatever power
 there is in the tax incentive for employment into the hands of non-profit as
 well as for-profit firms; (2) buys the support of all of the
 anti-poverty/pro-commnity coalition that is otherwise skeptical of all targeted
 tax credits; and (3) it provides major corporations (and investors) a way to
 participate in helping to make welfare reform work (in addition to their own
 hiring or asking their suppliers or investees to hire WTW participants.)
 2. WTW Jobs Challenge -- use harder to employ rather than long-term as the
 general principle -- and be open to negotiating for a concentration of poverty
 criteria (like the 20% we are using for all other POTUS/VPOTUS community
 empowerment initiatives). The more I hear when speaking to groups and listening
 to their reactions -- business, community, welfare, mayors, etc -- the more I
 think that we could have biggest impact here on connecting those already
 isolated from labor markets by living in concentrated to job opening throughout
 local labor markets.  If you can't go for this principle in Budget or State of
 the Union explicitly, at least be open to negotiating this as the eligibility
 principle for WTW Jobs Challenge (and for enhanced WOTC by adding living in 20%
 or more poverty concentration).  If you implemented this principle, it could
 also have complementary spin-off effects if it helped break down isolation from
 labor market for all job-seekers who live in high-poverty pockets. We may have a


 unique opportunity to do this in labor markets where media unemployment rate in
 suburbs oputside central cities in 4.5% and the Manpower job-placement types are
 contemplating opening offices in inner cities.

 I'm not sure whether any of this will or should be relfected in description of
 budget or State of the Union .... I leave that to you.
 Paul
