draft 5/25/99 1:00 pm



Amending the Regulatory Flexibility Act to include MSHA in the Small
Business Advocacy Review Panel Process.    We oppose this proposal
because:

It is Unnecessary and Redundant:

     MSHA has close and frequent contact with every mining
     operation in the nation

MSHA's focus on safety and health issues    in the regulatory arena
    or enforcement arena -- is discussed by MSHA with labor,
     industry, state representatives and other affected parties
     in advance.   For example, MSHA began discussing the need to
    update its 20 year old noise standards with the mining community
     in 1989.

MSHA's regulatory process includes mailing a copy of its advance
    notice of proposed rulemakings, proposed rulemakings, public
    hearing dates and locations to every affected mining operation
     -- large and small -- as well as industry and labor
    representatives.              .

In addition to taking steps to personally involve miners and mine
     operators affected by MSHA's rulemakings, MSHA:

Issues press releases in the mining regions regarding its proposed
           rules and public hearing locations and dates.  Public
           hearings are held in locations convenient to the mines
          .and miners.

Requests the involvement and participation of industry and labor
          associations in getting their ·members to attend.

Uses the Internet to publish rulemaking activities: all proposed
          rules, preliminary regulatory flexibility analyses and
          public hearing notices are posted on MSHA's home page.

Involves its inspectors and other Agency personnel in advising mine
          operators and miners of rulemaking activities.

MSHA's Process is Better. MSHA uses innovative and imaginative
approaches to involve the affected mining operations to adopt a
solution that gets to the problem:

MSHA convened a small mine summit to discuss the safety and health
     problems of small mines.

MSHA established advisory committees to address diesel and dust
     issues. These committees held public meetings specifically
                                             Hex-Dump Conversion
     to obtain information from affected mines and miners.

Following the 1992 advance notice of proposed rulemaking for diesel
     particulates, MSHA held diesel particulate workshops in
     Beckley, WV, Mr.Vernon, IL, and Salt Lake city, UT.    MSHA
     developed a diesel toolbox, identifying best practices, which
     is on MSHA's home page on the Internet.

MSHA began using its field offices to accept comments on its noise
     rule to expand the participation to all miners.

MSHA's inspectors are taking copies of its current Part 46 training
    proposal to mines employing 5 or fewer workers, providing
    operators and miners with the opportunity to directly
    participate in the process.

The Training Rule for surface nonmetal mines is unique:

All parties agreed on the goal:    ensuring that miners receive
     training

Beginning in 1997, MSHA publicly advised the affected mining
     community that the number of preventable fatalities was
     unacceptable and that it would tackle the training issue.

MSHA and representatives of the affeqted mining population met and
     discussed the need for and approach to effective training for
     the more than 120,000 workers at the affected mines.

MSHA is under a Congressional mandate to issue a rule by September
     1999.

Panels are a "one-size-fits-all" solution:

The SBA defines a small mining business as having 500 or fewer
     employees; this definition would cover more than 90 percent
     of the mines in the United States.

Under this definition, mines employing more than 400 workers as well
     as those employing five to ten workers would be all considered
     small, and therefore eligible to participate in the panels.
     Smaller mines, for example, those employing fewer than twenty
     workers, however, may be less likely to participate because
     of resource constraints.

Panels are an inadequate substitute for the effective mechanisms
     MSHA currently uses.  Requiring panels would require MSHA to
     curtail its current activities.
