TEXT:
Dennis Hayashi, the director of HHS' Office of Civil Rights, has a long

history (both before and during the Administration) on both the race and

hate crimes issues.   Sec. Shalala   would like to have him included in the

work on race and on hate crimes.     Sylvia prefers not to expand the large

group even further, but would like us to plug Dennis into our efforts on

hate crimes and (I think) the thinking about affirmative action

replacement strategies. Dennis and I worked together in 93-94 on the

antiviolence hate crime work, and he worked closely with Warnath on these

and other issues throughout the first term.     He was a part of all of the

work on affirmative action in 95 and 96, and is a great team player, with

good instincts and judgment about these issues. Dennis comes from the San

Francisco Asian civil rights community, and can be very helpful on several

fronts. His number is 619-040
