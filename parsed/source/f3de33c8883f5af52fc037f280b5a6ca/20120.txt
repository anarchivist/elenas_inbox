TEXT:
You may have gotten a call from Sally Katzen on this. Ceci Rouse gave me
a heads up that Sally wants the memo to be from the deputies, to ensure
strong NEC/DPC role.  Apparently NEC basically drafted the new cover memo
highlighting more of the political considerations and sugggested moving
most of the old memo to what's now a "technical background" piece.
