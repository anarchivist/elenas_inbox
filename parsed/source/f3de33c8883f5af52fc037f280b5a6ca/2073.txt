TEXT:
I sent out the subject report for comment on April 25, 1997.   Defense
supports the enactment of HR 411,  which would repeal the ban on abortions
at U.S. military health care facilities overseas.  Nancy-Ann Min approves
of the report, as does OMB's National Security Division.

However, I wanted to touch base with you before I clear the report.  If
you have any comments on the Defense position, please let me know by 2:00
PM, Thursday, May 1.

Thank you.
