TEXT:
I have been trying to leave the impression that the budget does not
address in detail the scope of tobacco legislation.   I have also been
saying that it does not address the question of liability or what to do
with any revenue that may exceed the $65 billion.  In that sense I may
have suggested it as a floor.  I agree with the characterization of our
number as representing the amount necessary to address youth smoking, and
thought I had said that as well. What do you think we should say in
response to questions about potentially larger revenue streams?
