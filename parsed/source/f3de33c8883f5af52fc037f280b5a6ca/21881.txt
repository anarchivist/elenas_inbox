 The jobs gap idea is Edley's (see attached memo which is being revised)

 Subject:         One-pagers for New Initiatives

 In order to make the case for our new initiatives, we will need to present
 more detail to OMB and others about what they entail.  By mid-week, I
 would like to be able to show them one-pagers on each significant
 initiative. This will help us get the $ we're asking for, and force us to
 think through -- and vet with other relevant people -- all the wrinkles of
 what we're doing.  It will also force others to do the same for their
 initiatives, which may not be as well thought through.

 We don't need a lot of rhetoric -- just nuts and bolts about what the
 money would go for and how the initiatives would work, and what it would
 enable the President to say in the State of the Union  (e.g., 500,000 kids
 in afterschool programs; 100,000 people a year in Americorps by 2001;
 etc.). please get drafts to Elena by mid-day tomorrow.

 Here's our draft wish list on NDD (all #'s are above passback). We will
 go through a similar exercise on mandatory/tax initiatives -- let's plan
 to have those ready by Wednesday.

Subject:       Proposed Major Policy Initiatives Related to the Race Book

        Below and in the attachment, I offer some elaboration of the four ideas included in my
November 11 th memorandum to the President, in an effort to assist you and your staff colleagues
in framing choices for him. As you know, I hope the President's reportlbook on race will avoid
the laundry-list approach so characteristic of past race-related commissions.

(1) Educational achievement: The President's vision of One America with racial and ethnic
justice requires that the nation undertake a more focused, dramatic and sustained effort to tackle
the intolerable education achievement disparities between poor and rich, between minority and
non-minority. The era of excuses is over -- for everyone.

       Recommendation: The President should propose a Compact for EquaJ Opportunity in
Education -- quite simply, a new covenant to benefit America's children. In those states and
school districts willing to enter into this covenant:

       The federal government will offer new grant-in-aid support and greatly expanded flexibility
       in the use of current federal funding.

       In return, the state or school district would agree to establish a strong system of
       accountability for results in closing the measurable achievement gaps between minority
       and non-minority and between poor and non-poor students in public schools.

       The federal government would not dictate the means used; the state or district could even
       propose its own goals and timetables, with all the public scrutiny that entails. But the
       decision to award the federal funds and enter into a Compact would be based on a public
       review of the applicant's comprehensive strategy by an independent, diverse, peer revIew
       panel, including experts in successful school reform strategies.

       The Compact bears some similarities to the tiny Comprehensive School Reform Demon-


                                                                                                n.I

                  Automated Records Management System
                  HeX-Dump Conversion
in scale, less prescriptive, focused on systems (and preferably metro areas) rather than individual
school sites, and with accountability for results. The undertaking parallels the President's announced
goal of narrowing health disparities. Instead of a formula program like Title I, this substantial
"honey pot" would not attract participation from all jurisdictions initially, which is fine.

         Flexibility should spur innovation, replication, and tailoring of approaches to fit local
needs. We would expect but would not require that each Compact for Equal Opportunity in
Education include such things as: (a) strategies for breaking through the red tape of various
federal, state and local programs in education as well as related fields, and ways to build
partnerships across jurisdictional lines of school districts and local government agencies; (b) ways
to engage businesses and other local institutions; (c) a strategies focused on quality teachers; (d)
creative responses to the needs of immigrant children with limited English skills; (e) ways to
promote higher expectations for achievement and to take aggressive action when there is failure;
(f) reduce disparities in resources; and (g) plans for accountability at all levels, so that
performance is measured fairly and has consequences.

        Budget: In FY 2000, a substantial round of planning and startup grants could be funded
for $250 million, with a five-year total of $15 billion reaching approximately the size of Title I
($7 billion) in the final year. This is the only expensive discretionary proposal I plan to present to
the President.

(2) Jobs: We must break the back of the endemic hyper-unemployment of young adults (18-30)
in our most distressed poor communities, eventually eliminating the racial and regional
disparities in joblessness.

        Recommendation: Propose a Jobs Gap Challenge Program for states and metro area
jurisdictions to raise the employment rate of young adults in distressed neighborhoods through
regional strategies:

       Provide incremental new resources and greatly enhanced flexibility with categorical
       federal and state programs, for interested regional alliances willing to accept
       accountability for creatively tackling the especially difficult problems of young adult
       unemployment.
       Flexibly link programs in education, training, job search, transportation, employer
       networking, day care, housing assistance, drug treatment, and many more. But results
       must matter.
       Must include public-private partnerships, and strong involvement of schools, parents and
       community groups.

This builds on the Youth Opportunities Initiative within the Workforce Investment Act of 1998,
and the $250 million FY99 appropriation for target grants for comprehensive out-of-school youth
employment. But, returning to the President's broader vision of 1992 and 1993, this must be

                                                                                                    1t.2
promote the reinvention of federal, state and local delivery systems.

         Budget: In FY 2000, expand the Labor Department's program by $250 million, add a
complementary HUD program stressing regional approaches at $250 million, a $250 million
"Transit-to-opportunity" program to permit coordinated, saturation attack on the problem of
spacial mismatch between inner city workers and suburban jobs. This integrated package would
grow to approximately the size of the CDBG program in the out years, for a five-year total of $1 0
billion.

        Lesser budget options include: (a) trimming to do fewer grantees while maintaining
sufficient sweetness to leverage systemic change; (b) trimming to be a modest Title I supplement
while introducing stronger statutory and administrative enforcement of accountability in Title I,
including funding sanctions; (c) minimal investment level in the budget, but statement of the
ambitious, longer term vision in the President's book.

(3) Economic Development: We can do more to harness the power of financial institutions and
markets to create opportunity in distressed communities here at home, just as we try to do abroad
through a variety of US and multilateral programs.

       Recommendation: Launch a major refocusing of the large housing-related GSEs --
FNMA, Freddie Mac and the Federal Home Loan Bank Board System. In particular, the FHLBB
should have a new mission: working side-by-side with CDFIs to fuel economic revitalization in
our most distressed communities through affordable financing of a range of community
development and job-creating projects. In general, these entities commonly assert that they are
"private" and must therefore not be expected to make uneconomic, tightly targeted investments.
On the other hand, their profitability flows from their access to a government guarantee or a
discount Fed window. The FHLBB is the most egregious at playing loose with the public
purpose, making much of its profit through arbitrage. Specifically, the President could propose
to:

       Adopt new regulatory and statutory provisions: to press the GSEs to focus their housing
       activity on severely distressed communities; to give the GSEs more effective tools to
       promote targeted lending for community development purposes.
       Re-charter the FHLBB system to stem abuses (especially arbitrage) and focus on
       investments and technical assistance that implement comprehensive strategies for
       community economic development, analogous to IMF and World Bank missions in
       developing nations.
       Make the fiscal impact of implicit Federal subsidies on-budget, on the PAYGO side; for
       example, FHLBB capital reserves for community development activities could be raised
       from private investors by offering deep tax incentives.

       Budget: To be determined, but could be fashioned on the mandatory side for inclusion in


                                                                                              re.3

(4) Combating Discrimination and Hate: The fight against ordinary discrimination is not
finished. Last year's budget included an increase for some civil rights law enforcement agencies,
to help those standing in line waiting for justice.

        Recommendation: Sustain that investment and extend it to other enforcers of our basic
rights. Specifically:

       New investments for the DOJ Civil Rights Division and the Offices for Civil Rights at
       the Departments of Education and HHS.
       With the investments, re-engineer enforcement activity to emphasize voluntary
       compliance, technical assistance, education and dispute resolution.
       Build a DOl grant-in-aid program to support state attorneys general in their civil rights
       work, analogous to the HUD grants to public and nonprofit fair housing enforcers.
       Major increase in the DOl Community Relations Service to meet the demand for crisis
       dispute resolution, while building its work in prevention and community dialogue.
       Restructure and rehabilitate the US Civil Rights Commission, especially its capacity for
       conducting investigatory hearings and issuing reports.
       Build a federal capacity for authoritative time series data on the extent discrimination in
       various sectors, starting with housing and entry-level employment.

       Budget: Total $100 million in FY 2000. We took unnecessary political criticism for not
"rounding up" last year's investment request to $100 million from $86 million.
