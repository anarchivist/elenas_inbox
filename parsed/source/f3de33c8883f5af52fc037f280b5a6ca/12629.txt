TEXT:
Congressman Reyes would like to meet with you next week to discuss the'
Border Patrol funding issue. As you may know, he and 59 other bipartisan
Members and Senators signed a letter to the President this week
expressing deep disappointment at the lack of compliance with the
congressional mandate to increase the Border Patrol by 1,000 agents per
year.   He's already met with INS and Justice and now wants to meet with
the relevant folks at the White House, he specifically mentioned OMB.
What do you recommend? Please advise.    (I will fax you a copy of the
letter in case you haven't seen it).
