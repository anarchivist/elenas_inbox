TEXT:
You now have hard copy and E:Mailed version of the memo Bruce.  Although I
did E:mail a copy of it to Carole Parmelee, I did ask her to hold of on
giving it to Erskine until you and Rahm give an ok sign.

I know the memo is a bit too long, but I thought you guys could use the
info and pull from it what you wanted.

Please page or call with any questions/complaints.
