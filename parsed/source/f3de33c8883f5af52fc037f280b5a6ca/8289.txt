                                          June 23, 1998



Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee:



Thank you for the opportunity to testify on the Employment Security Financing Act of 1998

(H.R. 3684) and its impact on the unemployment insurance (UI) program. There are several

significant issues that need to be considered in order to ensure that the Employment Security

system fulfills its mission in today's changing economy and that it remains on sound financial

footing for the 21 st Century. As I will discuss below, the Administration has proposed

legislation to begin to address some of these issues and initiated a broad dialogue on reform

of the VI program.



As you know, the bill that is the focus oftoday's hearing, H.R. 3684, was developed by the

Coalition for Employment Security Financing Reform, essentially to address administrative

funding problems. I applaud the bill's overall objective to reform the funding structure ofthe

Employment Security system. The Department of Labor, however, has serious concerns about




                                          Draft 6/19/98
                                                   2                       Hex-Dump Conversion

the proposal as well as important issues which should be addressed, but are not included in the

bill.




BACKGROUND

Before turning to H.R. 3684, I would like to take a moment to provide some background

information on the VI program. Enacted over sixty years ago as a Federal-State partnership, VI

has been a major source of temporary income support for laid-off workers who are seeking work.

    In addition, for over sixty years, the Employment Service (ES) program has served to assist"

workers in finding new jobs. Since the advent of both programs, the economy has changed, the

workforce has changed, the workplace has changed and the way we work has changed, affecting

both workers and businesses. Research suggests that these changes may be impacting the VI

program in unanticipated ways.




Studies conducted by the General Accounting Office and by Metrica, Inc.-- both in the early

1990's -- and a study conducted by the Vrban Institute in 1998, all conclude that the VI program

has lost some of its effectiveness as an automatic stabilizer over the past 20 years. They cite the

following reasons:

·         the decline in VI recipiency which means that a lower percentage of the unemployed

          receive benefits;

·         State law changes that restrict program eligibility and lowered wage replacement rates;

          and


                                            Draft 6/19/98
                                                                          l-Iex-D        or Management System
                                                                                  ump Conversion
                                                  3

·      changes in the labor market.



This research also concludes that in the 1980's the UI program was about two-thirds as effective

as a stabilizer as it was in the 1970's, and that State borrowing during the next recession will be

much higher because of relatively lower State trust fund reserves. Now, while the economy is

strong and unemployment is low, is an opportune time to reform and strengthen the UI program.



KEYISSUES.

Reform is needed to strengthen the UI program in three (3) key areas: recipiency, recession

readiness, imd administrative funding.



Recipiency -- The recipiency rate for unemployment compensation has dropped from 49% in the

1950's to an average 35% in the 1990's and is below 20% in some States. That means that the

program is currently serving proportionately fewer unemployed workers than in the past. This

harins the program's ability to help workers who have lost their jobs, as well as weakens its role

as a stabilizer in the economy.



Recession Readiness -- Recessions are experienced at the State and Regional levels and the UI

program should work effectively at those levels. However, during the last recession, only nine

(9) States "triggered on" to the Extended Benefit (EB) program -- the program established to

provide additional benefits during periods of economic downturn. State trust fund levels, which


                                           Draft 6/19/98
                                                                       Hex-Dump Conversion
                                                 4

are the amount of funds States have available to pay benefits, are also a concern. Even though

we now enjoy a period of very low unemployment, estimates show that an economic downturn of

the magnitude of the 1980-82 recession could result in $20-$25 billion of State borrowing of

Federal funds to cover VI benefits.



Administrative Funding -- Funding for the Employment Security system has been steadily

declining. Since fiscal year (FY) 1995, the VI appropriation has remained static, ignoring the

increased costs of inflation and workload growth associated with increases in the number of

subject employers and growth in the civilian labor force. As a result, FY 1998 administrative

funding'is insufficient to handle benefit payments to the approximately 7.1 million unemployed

workers and collect taxes from about 6.4 million employers. Consequently, activities that are

needed to preserve the integrity of the Trust Fund are curtailed. These include prevention,

detection, and collection of benefit overpayments, as well as tax audits and collections of

delinquencies. The reduction of these activities costs the Trust Fund approximately $240

million per year.



The Employment Service (ES) has also experienced steady cuts in funding. Since 1984, when

adjusted for inflation, Wagner-Peyser grants to States to provjde job finding and placement

services to VI claimants and other job seekers have been reduced by about 33 percent. Among

other impacts, this affects services to help unemployed workers return to work quickly,

contributing to a higher average duration of unemployment (14.8 weeks) during this good


                                          Draft 6/19/98
                                                                         Hex-Dump Conversion
                                                 5

economy and to a higher rate of exhaustion (33%) of benefits than is typical at this stage of the

economic cycle. In an attempt to compensate for the underfunding, States supplemented Federal

funding of the Employment Security system with approximately $200 million in FY 1997, about

$89 million for UI and approximately $111 million for ES. Since some of these funds were

raised through employer taxes, employers may feel they are being taxed twice to support the

Employment Security system.



These issues and program trends indicate that it is time to address both funding and program

reform to ensure that the fundamental principles of the UI program are met.



UI PRINCIPLES

The major components of the UI program involve payment of benefits, funding of benefits, and

administration ofthe program. Accordingly, a fundamental principle of the UI program is that

benefits should provide an adequate economic cushion while recipients search for suitable work.

For the program to provide macroeconomic stabilization, these benefits must be available to a

sufficiently large portion of workers who lose their jobs.



A basic benefit funding principle is that the UI program be self-financing. This means that

funds should be accumulated during periods of economic growth so that they will be available to

pay benefits during economic downturns. This self-financing principle also has a Federal

component. Federal UI taxes build up balances to pay the Federal share (50%) of the EB


                                           Draft 6/19/98
                                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion
                                                 6

program and to provide repayable advances to States that have become insolvent. In both cases,

Federal funds are available to all States without regard to how much Federal tax the employers in

a State have paid.



In tenns of program administration, States and the Department of Labor share responsibilities.

Each State operates its UI program in accordance with its law, but State law is required to

confonn with certain basic provisions of Federal law. Administrative funding for the UI

program and 97 percent of funding for ES programs comes from Federal UI taxes. Congress

appropriates administrative funds which are allocated based on individual State needs without

regard to the amount of taxes paid by the employers in a State. Federal UI taxes also pay

Federal administrative costs.



WHAT H.R. 3684 DOES

I would like to begin by addressing our concerns with H.R. 3684. The stated primary purpose of

the bill is to remedy insufficient funding of Employment Security programs by Congress. I

certainly agree that the States should be fully funded to provide adequate services to job seekers

and employers. The solution proposed -- transferring the funding from Congress to the States --

does not guarantee full funding, however. Transferring the appropriation authOrity from one

body to 53 legislative bodies does not, by itself, provide full funding and may exacerbate the

problem. This is of special concern for both the Veterans' Employment and Training (VETS)

program, which relies on these funds to provide special veterans' employment services, and the


                                          Draft 6/19/98
                                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion
                                                 7

UI program regarding workload funding. Most State legislatures meet for only a portion of a

year and six meet on a biennial schedule. This makes it difficult for States to respond quickly to

changes in workload caused by an unforeseen economic downturn (or even unemployment

caused by a large natural disaster) and could cause serious funding shortages at a time when they

can least be afforded. In addition, this approach undermines the insurance principle of the

program that funds are to be pooled into a unified account and distributed based on workload --

not on taxes paid.



The bill would also transfer the responsibility for collecting Federal Unemployment Tax Act

taxes, known as FUTA taxes, from the Internal Revenue Service to the States, effective calendar

year 2000. The tax would remain a Federal tax, with the States acting as agents for the Treasury

Department on a contractual basis. We do not believe that having States collect Federal revenue

and having their legislatures appropriate Federal dollars with no required guidelines or standards,

is the best option for funding administration of these programs. The absence of guidelines and

standards would seem to run counter to the Congressional emphasis on performance in the

Governmental Performance and Results Act (GPRA). A theme that is beginning to emerge from

the Department's UI dialogue is that other changes to the funding structure need to be

considered: such as switching the funding to the mandatory side of the budget; creating a

permanent adjustment of the caps on the discretionary side of the budget to accommodate the

changing needs ofthe Employment Security system; or if the States are to be responsible for

adminstrative funding, combining State UI-ES administrative tax with the State benefit tax,


                                          Draft 6/19/98
                                                                       Hex-Dump Conversion
                                                 8

reducing but maintaining the FUTA tax for Federal purposes.



The bill calls for a wholesale restructuring of the Unemployment Trust Fund, effectively

breaking the current Employment Security Administration Account into 53 State accounts. A

new Federal administration account would be established for the Secretary of Labor, with

funding limited to 2% ofFUTA collections. This would be $20 million less than the current

funding level of$120 million (a 17% cut) for Federal administration ofUI, ES, VETS and

Bureau of Labor Statistics oversight, and funds for State collection of hibor market information.

Since the Secretary's obligations would remain substantially the same, this option would not

allow the Department of Labor to continue to administer the programs responsibly.[insert re BLS

programs to added]



The Extended Unemployment Compensation Account, the current source of funds for the Federal

share of EB, would be eliminated by bill, as would the Federal partnership in the program. The

EB program, established to provide additional benefits during periods of economic downturn,

would be funded and administered independently by each State. There would be no special

funding mechanism for these benefits. Since the proposal would not reform the EB program,

Congress would be faced with enacting special extended unemployment compensation (EUC)

in the event Of an economic downturn, as it did in the last recession. Of the $28.5 billion in

Federal EUC costs, $12 billion was funded by FUTA. The FUTA funding would no longer be

available to Congress.

                                                                                       eCOr"" J\fanagement System

                                                  9

Lastly, the proposal weakens State accountability by requiring States to individually detennine

perfonnance and report to their Governors. The proposal still requires the Secretary of Labor to

review and certify that States' laws confonn and activities substantially comply with Federal

requirements. Because the bill removes State administrative funding from the Federal

government, there are no sanctions that can be imposed on State governments for

noncompliance. Only the employers of a noncompliant State would suffer any consequences if a

State failed to meet the requirements of the law. Failure of a State to meet the requirements for

certification would result in a loss of credit against the Federal tax for employers in the State.

This would place a State in the peculiar situation of charging employers a higher Federal tax --

6.2% rather than 0.8% -- for a condition that the State itself caused. In the spirit of GPRA,

Federal perfonnance standards should be considered to ensure that a viable national economic

security system is in place for the country while providing States flexibility to tailor the programs

to their individual economies.



WHAT THE BILL DOESN'T DO

The bill does not address the most fundamental principle of the UI program, that is the assurance

of adequate benefits for a sufficiently large number of job seekers. For instance, the recipiency

rate for unemployment compensation is not addressed in the bill. If the program devolves

further to the States without standards, what is to stop the recipiency rate from eroding even

further? Devolution may in fact create incentives for States to cut costs by creating more

stringent eligibility requirements, lowering benefit levels, or taking other policy measures to


                                            Draft 6/19/98
                                                                             Hex-Dump Conversion
                                                 10

reduce the benefis paid to unemployed workers and to reduce related administrative services.



The bill is silent in regard to trust fund solvency standards and bolstering the EB program --

elements that are essential in any reform effort to assure that the program responds adequately to

economic downturns. There is no assurance that the self-financing principle can be met.



I agree that the administrative funding mechanism for the Employment Security program is in

need of repair. However, I do not believe that transferring funding from Congress to the States

achieves the program administration principle.



THE ADMINISTRA TION'S APPROACH TO REFORM

With the issuance of the Administration's FY 1999 budget request, President Clinton set in

motion a reform of the Employment Security system. Due to the complexities inherent in a

major reform effort, the Administration is pursuing a two-phase strategy. The first phase is

comprised of a legislative, as well as an appropriations component. The funds requested in the

FY 1999 budget are designed to provide full-funding for the UI program, while a long-term

solution to the administrative funding problem is developed.



The Administration has also proposed legislation, H.R. 3697, introduced by Representatives

Levin, English and Rangel, that represents an important step toward addressing the issues

confronting the Employment Security system. This bill would provide incentives to strengthen


                                          Draft 6/19/98
                                                                         Hex-Dump_ Conversion
the UI program in the areas of recipiency, recession readiness, and admimstrative lunding and is

a "down payment" toward more comprehensive reform. The major components ofH.R. 3697

are:

Recipiency -- H.R. 3697 provides incentives to States to voluntarily implement administrative

systems that will make the program more accessible to low-wage workers. $20 million will be

available in each of fiscal years 1999,2000, and 2001 to reimburse costs to States to implement

alternative base periods. An estimated additional 450,000 low-wage unemployed workers could

be helped annually if all States adopted an alternative base period. This would increase

recipiency by 6-8% and benefit payments by 4-6%.



Recession Readiness -- The Administration's bill would enhance the Federal-State Extended

Benefit program by revising program triggers to make the program more responsive during a

recession. H.R. 3697 also provides an incentive -- in the form of a Reed Act distribution -- to

encourage States to voluntarily improve the solvency of their unemployment thIst funds

accounts. Currently, 22 States have reserves below the 1.0 average high cost multiple

recommended by the Advisory Council on Unemployment Compensation. Inadequate trust fund

account balances could cause States to take actions such as increasing taxes, reducing benefits, or

taking out interest bearing loans in the next recession as some have been compelled to do in the

past.



Administrative Funding -- The bill proposes the installation of a temporary mechanism to


                                          Draft 6/19/98
                                                                             Hex-Dump Conversion
                                                12

strengthen State funding for administration of the VI program through a special distribution to

fill the funding gaps between the calculated need and the appropriated amount resulting in full

funding for FY 1999-2003. This is a temporary "fix" only. A long-term solution is needed for

the underfunding problem, and this will be focused on in the upcoming dialogue.



In addition, H.R. 3697 proposes to extend for ten years the Self-Employment Assistance (SEA)

Program, which is due to expire December 8. SEA -~ which gives greater flexibility to VI

claimants by allowing them to receive unemployment compensation while becoming

self-employed -- has been adopted by ten States and has proven to be a useful tool for States to

assist certain unemployed workers create their own jobs by starting small businesses.



The second phase is a national dialogue which will engage all interested parties -- including

Congress, workers, employers, State governments and Federal agencies -- in an effort to work

through a broad range of issll:es. The following questions will be discussed:

·      how well is the VI program serving as an individual economic stabilizer,

·      how well is it serving as a macroeconomic stabilizer,

·      is the financing structure financially sound in terms of meeting core insurance principles,

·      how well is the benefit financing structure working with respect to its efficiency, equity,

       and incentives, and

·      how well does the administrative funding component work? .

The VI program is an American success story -- working efficiently in good times and bad, as it


                                          Draft 6/17/98
                                                                        I   kx-Dump Conversion

                                                13

helps millions of workers annually. We need to be sure we are on the right track to maintain this

successful program and strengthen the nation's economic infrastructure in the coming

millennium. Therefore, during the coming months, the Administration will hold public

hearings, and meet with interested parties across the nation to receive input toward the resolution

of these issues.



This concludes my formal remarks. I appreciate the opportunity afforded me to speak to the

subcommittee and look forward to working with you, the States, and all other stakeholders who

share with the Department of Labor the ultimate goal of reforming and strengthening the UI

program.
