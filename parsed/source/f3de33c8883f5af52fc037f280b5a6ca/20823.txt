TEXT:
I just ran into Sharon Kennedy Gil who told me that journalists are likely
to be on the guest list for the Youth Violence dinner on August 3.
Stephanie and I were not aware that there would be any journalists at the
dinner and told the President the event was closed press.

Jen    would you please run the list of potential journalist/authors for
the dinner by Amy?   Then I think Stephanie and I need to follow up with
the President to reconfirm his interest.  thanks.
