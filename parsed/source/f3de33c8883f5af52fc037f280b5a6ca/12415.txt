TEXT:
Apparently, Maria and IGA have suggested that we reschedule the ESEA event
for May 13th, when the President is scheduled to be in Seattle.  IGA
indicated that they would like to do the event out of DC, and that they
would then be able to get more governors there.

My understanding was that we wanted this event to be here at the White
House, East.Room/South Lawn style.  Paul was in the meeting where this was
suggested, and indicated that we would run the idea by you and see what
you thought.

Please let me know your thoughts on this.

thanks
