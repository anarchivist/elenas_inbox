STATEMENT OF THE VICE PRESIDENT

ON THE HOUSE WAYS AND MEANS


SUBCOMMITTEE WELFARE PROPOSAL


 I am very concerned about how the proposed Republican amendments to the
welfare law would affect disabled legal immigrants. The amendments are
harsh,
unfair, and unnecessary, and they violate the terms of the bipartisan
balanced
budget agreement by failing to restore a minimal safety net for these
individuals.

 The Republican proposal is unfair to families of limited means.   In
failing to
restore benefits for SSI beneficiaries whose sponsors have incomes over
150
percent of the poverty level, it would cut off 100,000 severely disabled
immigrants who would receive benefits under the budget agreement. A
family of
four with an income as low. as $24,000 would have to fully support a person
with
a·severe disability.

 The Republican proposal also fails to protect SSI and Medicaid benefits
for
legal immigrants who were in the United States as of August 23, 1996 and
later
become disabled. As a result, it violates a key provision in the budget
agreement that was designed to target assistance to the most vulnerable
individuals.

 The provisions affecting disabled legal immigrants were an important
element
of the budget agreement, and the Administration worked hard to secure
them. We
expect both sides to adhere to them.
