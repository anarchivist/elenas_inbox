PRINTER FONT 12 - POINT- ROMAN
Unless I hear otherwise by 10:00 A.M. tomorrow June 13, 1996, I
will assume you have no objection to LRM
o
-4678 (dated 6/7), which
requested comments on a draft Treasury Department bill entitled
"Technical Amendments to the Tariff Act of 1930."
If you need another copy of the LRM, intend to comment but need
more time, or have provided comments that I may have overlooked,
please let me know by answering this fax/E
o
-mail.

Thanks,


Ron Jones
