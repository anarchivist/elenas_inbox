Q:     Any comment on the Republican budget plan?


I welcome discussion about budget increases for education but need to know many more details
about this proposal. Clearly, any funds for education must address critical national priorities, be
targeted to students most in need, and be held accountable for results. The President has
outlined clear priorities for education funding within his balanced budget plan -- including after
school programs, reducing class size, helping disadvantaged students, and preparing students to
go to college. Any talk of additional funds for education must include the details of where and
how it would be spent.

We have a number of concerns about the Senate budget plan, primarily that it does nothing to
strengthen the solvency of the Social Security and Medicare trust fund -- and that it will lead to deep
cuts in domestic priorities -- like investments in the environment, law enforcement, health care, and
children.

o      The Republican budget plan does nothing to extend the solvency of Social Security, and in fact calls
       for reconciliation legislation to preclude the President=s proposed transfers of surplus funds to the Social
       Security Trust Funds.

       By contrast, the Social Security actuaries have estimated that the President=8 plan will extend solvency
       of the Trust Funds to 2055.

o      The Republican budget plan does nothing to extend the solvency of Medicare, and chooses instead
       to cut taxes by nearly $800 billion over the next ten years.

       By contrast, the President=8 plan would extend the solvency of Medicare to 2020, and provides targeted
       tax relief

o      The Republican plan calls for drastic cuts in domestic nrol!rams. The Domenici mark calls for a
       reduction in total Non-Defense Discretionary (NDD) spending from $266 billion in FY1999 to $246
       billion in FY2000, or an average cut of 7.5 percent in all NDD programs.

o      If you accept that the proposal protects the additional areas it claims it does, it would require a cut
       of 12.2 percent to all other Federal programs.

o      Discretionary cuts of 12.2 percent could seriously impact:

       MEANWHILE: basic programs that Americans rely on. 12% cut below funding in 1999 are severe and
       punishing cuts. This is not a tenable program.

Q:     But doesn=t their lock-box save money for Social Security?

A:     It is true that Republicans are racing to catch up with the President on Social Security, but they
       still have a ways to go. Just last year, Republicans were determined to use the Social Security
       surplus for a tax cut. They originally proposed a trillion dollar tax cut and House Republicans
       eventually passed a $80 billion five year tax cut in late September at a time when the only
       surplus was the Social Security surplus (on-budget deficit of$137 billion). Unfortunately, their
       plan still has some serious shortcomings:
                 Hex-Dump Conversion
X   It fails to extend the solvency of Social Security by even one day. Contrastingly,
    according to Social Security=s independent actuary, President Clinton=s plan extends
    Social Security solvency 23 years until 2055.

X   It continues to ignore Medicare. Just a year ago, Chainnan Domenici said, AWe
    should save Medicarefirst.: President Clinton=s plan allocates 15 percent of the
    surplus over 15 years or $686 billion to Medicare and extends its solvency until 2020.
    The Republican budget outline, however, does not include a specific allocation for
    Medicare and does not extend its solvency by one day.

X   The amount of debt reduction in the Republican plan is a mystery. On the one
    hand, the Republicans are saying that they are going to reduce the debt by the amount of
    the Social Security surplus. On the other hand, they always include a caveat that opens
    the door to use those funds to finance Republican privatization of Social Security plans,
    leaving open the question of whether they are setting aside the surplus for debt
    reduction or privatization.

X   The Republican plan would lead to dramatic cuts in key priorities, and it is hard to
    see how the numbers can add up. Republicans dedicate all of the on-budget surplus
    for a tax cut targeted away for the middle class, while also proposing to boost defense
    spending. This will not only leave nothing for Medicare but also will lead to dramatic
    cuts in education, the environment, research, and law enforcement.
