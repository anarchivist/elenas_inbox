TEXT:
I thought you would be interested in the following Q&A from today's Potus
budget photo-op.  As you may know, the WSJ ran a story today claiming our
budget will include a cigarette tax that will raise $10B in 1999 and
between $40B and $60B over 5 years.  CNN has been amplifying the story. A
number of reporters and Hill staff have focused on the President's
statement: "I will propose a plan...  I'll say more about the details
later" and the WSJ and CNN stories and concluded we have a new plan that
will be unveiled during the SOU speech.

Q    Mr. President, are you going to call for cigarette
tax increases to help pay for new initiatives?

             THE PRESIDENT:  I will -- first of all, on the tobacco
issue generally -- I'll have more to say about this later, but keep
in mind what my first priority is.  My first priority is to protect
our children from the dangers of tobacco, from the illegal dangers of
tobacco.  And I will propose a plan that I believe is best designed
to do that, that will build on the settlement agreement that was
reached earlier. And I will work with members of Congress in both
parties in good faith to try to pass comprehensive tobacco
legislation that I think will achieve that goal.

             And I'll say more about the details later.
