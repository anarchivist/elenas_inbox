TEXT:
BR/EK:

I forgot to mention at today's meeting that DOJ/FBI will be releasing the
final uniform Crime Report data for 1996 this week.   The new crime stats
book will be released Thursday and embargoed until Saturday at 9am. Only
new juvie arrests #s, which the AG will comment on at her press
availibility, will be releaseable on Thursday.   I understand that Rahm
intends to push for a crime radio address, but I don't know if this is
final or not. This is a rare opportunity to talk about crime just as the
#s are coming out (as opposed to the usual Sunday evening release).   I'll
get the embargoed release Thursday and see what other interesting tid bits
have surfaced since the preliminary data in May.

Jose'
