PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
RADIO ADDRESS ON EQUAL PAY
THE WHITE HOUSE
January 30, 1999

        Good morning. Americans have always believed that people who work
hard should be able to provide for themselves and their families.  That is
a fundamental part of AmericaO,s basic bargain.  Today, I want to talk to
you about what we are doing to make sure that bargain works for all of our
people, by ensuring that women and men earn equal pay for equal work.

        We are living in a time of remarkable promise. Our economy is the
strongest in a generation -- with nearly 18 million new jobs, the lowest
unemployment in 29 years, family incomes rising by $3,500, and the
greatest real wage .growth in over two decades. I believe we have an
opportunity -- and an obligation -- to make sure that every American can
benefit from this moment of prosperity.

        One of the most important ways we can meet this challenge is by
putting an end to wage discrimination.  When President Kennedy signed the
Equal Pay Act thirty-five years ago, women were entering the workforce in
ever-increasing numbers -- but their work was undervalued. At the time,
for every dollar a man brought home to his family in his paycheck, a woman
doing the same [work) [job) earned only 58 cents.

        We have. made a lot of progress since those days. Last June, the
PresidentO,s Council of Economic AdvisorsO, reported that the gender gap


has narrowed considerably -- in fact, we have nearly cut it in half.
Today, women earn 76 cents for every dollar a man earns.

        We can and should be proud of this progress -- but 76 cents on the
dollar is only three quarters of the way there.  Americans cannot be
satisfied until we are all the way there.

        One big reason why the pay gap persists -- despite womenD,s gains
in education and experience -- is the demeaning practice of wage
discrimination in our workplaces. Too many employers still routinely
undervalue -- and underpay -- work done by women. [this line comes almost
verbatim from Harkin talking points]

        Make no mistake: When a woman is denied equal pay, it doesn't just
hurt her -- it hurts her family.  Between 1995 and 1996 alone, the number
of families with two working parents increased by nearly two million.  And
in over ten million families [from Labor], the mother is the only
breadwinner.

        Just think what that 24 percent wage gap means in real terms.
Over the course of a working year, it means hundreds, even thousands of
bags of groceries ... visits to the doctor ... rent and mortgage
payments. Over the course of a working life, it can mean hundreds of
thousands of dollars ... smaller pensions ... and less to put aside for
retirement.

        To prepare our nation to meet the challenges of the 21st Century, we must
do more to ensure equal pay, equal opportunity, and equal dignity for
working women.

        Today, I am pleased to announce a new $14 million Equal Pay
Initiative, included in my balanced budget, to help the Department of
Labor and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission expand opportunities
in the workplace for women and make wage discrimination a thing of the
past. With more resources to identify wage discrimination, to educate
employers and workers about their rights and responsibilities, and to
bring more women into better-paying jobs, we will be closer than ever to
making equal pay a reality for every American.

        In my State of the Union address, I called on Congress to ensure
equal pay for equal work -- and it brought members of both parties to
their feet in an unanimous show of support.' We know that equal pay is
not a political issue -- it is a matter of principle, a question of what
kind of country we want American to be today, and in the 21st Century,
when our daughters grow up and enter the workplace.

        There has been strong leadership from members in both houses of Congress,
including Senator Harkin and Representative Norton.   And I ask the
Congress to take the next step and pass the Paycheck Fairness Act,
sponsored by Senator Daschle and Representative DeLauro -- legislation
that strengthens enforcemeOnt of our equal pay laws, expands opportunity
for women, and helps working families to thrive.

        If we meet this challenge, if we value the contributions of all
AmericaD,s workers, then we will be a more productive, prosperous and
proud nation in the 21st century.

        Thanks for listening.
