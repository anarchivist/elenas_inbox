TEXT:
With the goal of causing some split off from Lugar, we've asked OMB
(Gotbaum) to put together state by state numbers on what Lugar would mean
in cuts for each state programs so we could go to Collins, Snowe,
Jeffords, etc. and show them the impact on their state.  Josh may mention
this project to you.
