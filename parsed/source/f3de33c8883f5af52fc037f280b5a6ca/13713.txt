TEXT:
Ladies and gentlemen of the takings team,
I would be grateful if you would join me for a brainstorming
session on Tuesday, June 4th, at 10:30 a.m., at CEQ's conference
room.
The purpose of the meeting is to identify and ensure preparation
of amendments that those Senators who share the Administration's
position on takings legislation may wish to offer -- if S.605 or
any of its variants reach the floor.  For example, we will review
the so-called "Wyden" amendment.  However, I would like to canvass
the full field of ideas, particularly those that would spotlight
the anti-environment, anti-community, budget-busting,
litigation-generating, and other hypenated problems of S.605.
If you have collected these types of amendments, please bring the
text with you.
I've invited a small number of takings team members (Sax, Dowling,


Guzy, Coursen, Kagan, Dennis, Fitzpatrick, Konigsberg and Goad)
simply because group exercises of this type are difficult. If
there are persons who should be invited, please let me know and
I'll take care of it.
Thanks for your cooperation.
