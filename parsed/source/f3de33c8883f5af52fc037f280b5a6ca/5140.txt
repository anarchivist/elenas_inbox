I agree w/McCaffrey here.  The current date (ll/l2) would have us doing a
drug meeting during Zedillo's, which would only fuel some of the
drug-related issues we have ~/Mexico. My guess is that's why the General
wants to move this. Also, I mentioned it to Rahm tonight, and he thought
it seemed like a bad idea, too.
