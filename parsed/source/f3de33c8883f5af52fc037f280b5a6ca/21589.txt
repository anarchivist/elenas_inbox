             STANDING UP FOR A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE


"I'm committed to keeping abortions safe, legal, and accessible -and to making it more rare... 1 will
continue to do everything I can to make sure that every child in America is a wanted child, raised in a
loving, strong family. "
                                                              President Bill Clinton, January 22,
    1998

          Throughout his Presidency, President Clinton and Vice President Gore have worked
   hard to protect a woman's right to choose and to promote safe reproductive health services for
   women.

   Provided Contraceptive Coverage to More than a Million Women. The FY99 Omnibus
   Appropriations Act contains an important policy breakthrough on reproductive choice. The
   final bill requires the 300 Federal Employees Health Benefits Plans (FEHBP) to cover
   contraceptive drugs and devices, providing coverage to approximately 1.2 million women of
   childbearing age.    Until now, only 19% of federal health plans covered prescription
   contraceptives and 10% of the plans offered no contraceptive coverage at all. The Republican
   Leadership tried to remove this measure, but President Clinton and pro-choice members
   remained firm.

   Increased Funding for Family Planning. In the FY99 Omnibus Appropriations Act, the
   President won an increase of $12 million over FY98 levels for family planning services or Title X
   Family Planning grants. The House-version would have denied any additional funds.

   Stopped the Coburn Amendment Which Would Have Prohibited the FDA from Approving
   RU-486. On January 22, 1993, President Clinton reversed the ban on the importation of
   Mifepristone or RU-486j RU-486 is currently under review by the Food and Drug
   Administration (FDA). Unfortunately, the FDA's scientific drug approval process became
   under assault in the 10Sth Congress. President Clinton threatened to veto a provision that
   would have prevented the FDA from using government funds to test, develop or approve drugs
   that may induce medical abortion, including RU-486. Because of the President's veto threat,
   Republicans backed down and decided not to attach this provision to any funding bill.

   Defeated Parental Consent· Restrictions on Contraceptives for Minors. The House voted to
   require minors to obtain parental consent prior to receiving any Title X family planning services
   (this has also been referred to as the !stook amendment). The President's veto threat helped to
   keep it out of the final bill.

   Stopped the So-Called "Child Custody Protection" Act.         Senior Clinton Administration
   Advisers recommended a veto of this bill which would have made it illegal to transport a minor
   across State lines for the purpose of avoiding parental consent or notification laws. The
   Clinton Administration, as detailed in the Statement of Administration Policy, was very
   concerned that the bill did not protect close family members -including grandmothers, aunts
   and siblings -from criminal and civil liability. Family members could face criminal charges

                                                                    Automated Records Management System
                                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion
information, counseling, referral or medical services to the minor from liability. Under a veto
threat, the Senate failed to invoke cloture (or end debate) on the Child Custody Protection Act.
Upheld the Late Term Abortion Veto. This year, the House of Representatives voted to override
President Clinton's veto of a bill banning certain late-term abortions, known by proponents of
the ban as "partial birth abortions." While the House voted to override the President's action,
the Senate sustained the veto by a vote of 36-64 -just three votes short of the required
two-thirds majority needed to override the veto. President Clinton vetoed the measure in
October 1997 because it did not contain an exception that protected the health or life of the
woman.

Continued to Fight Restrictions on International Family Planning. The FY99 Omnibus
Appropriations Act does not contain the so-called "Mexico City" policy, a provision that denies
U.S. funds to international family planning organizations that use their own resources to
perform abortions or lobby on abortion policy. The Mexico City restrictions were also included
in the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act. President Clinton vetoed this legislation
because it contained these unacceptable restrictions.
