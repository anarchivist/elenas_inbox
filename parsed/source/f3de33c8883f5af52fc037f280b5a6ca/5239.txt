TEXT:
Here's my Cliff Notes version of the HHS proposals (Elena, I faxed you the
pages) :

Waivers:

        1) A state that wants to continue inconsistent time limit and work
requirement waivers must have the Governor certify which ones, why, and
what standards the state will use to assign individuals to alternate work
assignments or to grant time limit exemptions or extensions;

        2) A state that continues inconsistent waiver policies and still
fails the work rate or time limits a) will not be eligible for a
reasonable cause penalty exception and b) would have to consider changing
their policy as part of the corrective action plan.

        3) The Secretary will make public what how states performed
compared to other states without waivers.

Fingerprinting:

        Rule language is as we proposed Monday, but it adds the word
"calculable" back in, i.e., "A State need not factor out calculable
effects of enforcement mechanisms or procedural reguirements .... etc.
