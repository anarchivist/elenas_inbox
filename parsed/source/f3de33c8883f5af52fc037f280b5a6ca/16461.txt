Race-blind policies signal segregational shift


By Mary Beth Marklein, USA TODAY

Boston University's law school offered Marisa Salazar a $10,000
scholarship.    Notre Dame and Baylor accepted her into their law schools.
She is on waiting lists at Columbia
and Georgetown.

But the law school Salazar really wanted, at the University of Texas at
Austin,
didn't want her.

"I am the Hopwood fallout," says Salazar, 22, of San Antonio, referring to
Hopwood vs. Texas, the
case that prompted the ban this year on racial preferences in admissions
to Texas public institutions.

In Los Angeles, however, 18-year-old Danielle Smith has avoided getting
caught up in the fallout
from the University of California's policy banning affirmative action.

Smith, valedictorian of her Crenshaw High School class, was accepted at
highly selective UC.
Berkeley and UCLA but enrolled at private pitzer College in Claremont,
Calif., which gave her a
scholarship. She says the buzz over the affirmative action ban, which goes
into effect next year for
undergraduates but is already spurring changes in UC admissions, "really
didn't have any effect on
my final decision."

The experiences of Salazar and Smith illustrate how difficult it is to
draw sweeping conclusions about
the new rules on affirmative action and how they'll affect minority
students. But when enrollment
figures are tallied this fall in Texas and the UC system, one thing is
certain: There will be more white
and more Asian-American students than last year, and there will be fewer -
in some cases
dramatically so - underrepresented minorities, including blacks, Hispanics
and Native Americans.

Opponents continue to fight the bans: The U.S. Education Department
recently told civil rights
groups in California, for instance, that it would investigate whether the
new admission policies at
three UC law schools discriminate against blacks and Hispanics.

But should affirmative action rollbacks continue, many fear the gap could
widen more, creating "a
fairly dramatic segregation," says Thomas Kane, a professor in Harvard's
John F. Kennedy School
of Government. "Elite colleges would become even more dominated by whites
and
Asian-Americans, (and) black and Hispanic enrollments at less selective
public and private
institutions would then increase."

And not just in California and Texas, bellwether states whose affirmative
action bans in college
admissions have begun to influence other states.



Enrollment numbers could change, but early figures show:

     None of the 14 black students admitted to the University of
California-Berkeley law school
     plans to enroll, but one black student who had deferred admission
last year has enrolled this
     year. Neither of the two admitted Native Americans will enroll.
     At the University of Texas law school, the percentage of
underrepresented minorities has
     dropped from 15% last year to 5% this year among first-year students.
     90% of students admitted to UCLA's law school are white or
Asian-American, compared
     with 78% last year. About half of the underrepresented minorities
admitted - 10 of 21 blacks,
     41 of 73 Hispanics, and none of four American Indians - have said
they will enroll.
     At the flagship Austin campus of the University of Texas, a state
where 39% of the population
     is of Hispanic origin or black, the freshman class, based on 7,074
deposits paid to date, will
     be 15% black and Hispanic, compared with nearly 19% last year.

The numbers trouble those who believe diversity of cultures enhances
higher education. But there are
compounding problems, too, says Drew University president Thomas Kean, a
member of President
Clinton's race commission.

In the not-too-distant future, minorities will make up the majority of the
nation's workforce, he says.
Yet a new Rand Corp. report says unless institutions control soaring
tuitions, millions of students will
be shut out of college by 2015. Most denied would be poor and minority
students.

That, Kean says, is "not only a threat to the economy, but a threat to
democracy itself."

Not everyone believes the situation is so dire. "Everybody's going to find
a college. It's just not going                                 .
to be the one they might have gone to," says Roger Clegg, general counsel
of the Center for Equal
Opportunity in Washington.

Community colleges, for example, which serve nearly half of all minority
students in college, are
working harder to reach minorities who might not have gone to college at
all, says Norma Kent of
the American Association of Community Colleges in Washington.

Also, some high school counselors in California and Texas noted heavier
recruiting of their most
talented minority students by schools unaffected by racial preference
bans.

"The one good thing this whole affirmative action thing has done is made
kids look beyond the UC
system," says Cassandra ROy, counselor at Crenshaw High School, where 95%
of students are


black.

Many colleges, too, have a "heightened sense of awareness" of the effects
of affirmative action, says
Victoria Valle, admission director at the historically black Spelman
College in Atlanta. She says the
school's recruiting efforts in California and Texas didn't change.a lot
but adds, "It would be foolish of
us not to talk about what's going on."

Even if recruiters said nothing, some students got the message. The
University of Michigan, Ann
Arbor, courted Jos·e Pompa Garza of San Antonio with phone calls, videos
and a handsome
financial aid package. Garza, 18, enrolled at the University of Texas at
Austin - his top choice - but
the attention from Michigan almost changed his mind. "I thought I might be
more appreciated
somewhere else," he says.

His mother, Elizabeth Pompa Garza, a doctoral student at the University of
Texas, is proud of her
son but says he is lucky he had the choice. "When you've been
discriminated against historically as a
group, your opportunities are not the same," she says.

And, those opportunities narrow over time, says education professor Gary
Orfield, co-director of
the Harvard Civil Rights Project.

Professional schools, for instance, increasingly choose candidates from
the nation's most selective
undergraduate schools. And state flagships like those in Austin, Los
Angeles and Berkeley tend to
produce community leaders, Orfield says. If the schools grow
overwhelmingly white and Asian, the
future leaders graduating are "going to become very disconnected" from
communities they serve, he
says. Research shows, for instance, that minority doctors and lawyers are
far more likely to serve
minority clients and patients.

Moreover, Orfield says, growing resegregation, primarily of blacks and
Hispanics in inner-city public
schools, already threatens college access.

"When you put kids in schools that are less competitive, have fewer
college prep courses and
less-well-prepared teachers, those kids will be much less prepared for
college. So you're raising the
barrier for college and lowering the preparation at the same time," he
says.

Terry Pell, an attorney for the nonprofit Center for Individual Rights in
Washington, which
represented the Hopwood plaintiffs, isn't convinced a ban on racial
preferences hurts minorities. But
he says college administrators have only themselves to blame for creating
an atmosphere that sends
"a very strong signal to minority youth that they can't possibly get in"


without a boost.

There's no question the ban on affirmative action has been "a public
relations nightmare,"
acknowledges Bruce Walker, admission director at the University of Texas
at Austin. "It sort of
ended up with us being the bad guys" even though the school fought the
ban, he says.

He's encouraged, though, by this statistic: Although fewer
underrepresented minorities applied this
year compared with last year, the school admitted nearly the same
proportion of black applicants -
54% compared with 55% last year - and a larger proportion of Hispanics,
whose admission rate
increased 6 percentage points, to 71%.

The same pattern appears to be occurring at UC Berkeley graduate programs
(excluding the law
school), where the number of underrepresented minorities admi·tted fell 17%
from last year, but the
admission rate of those who applied is down only 3%.

Some high school and college admission counselors interpret that as
meaning the universities of
California and Texas must convince minority students they're still
welcome. But Salazar suggests that
opportunity is lost.

"They could have been more outspoken about the injustice" of the Hopwood
ruling, she says of the
University of Texas, adding, "I don't really want to be at a school that
isn't·fighting for people's
rights."

Ultimately, Harvard's Kane says, the solution will require an "unavoidable
tradeoff. Everything else
equal, I think we would all prefer race blindness. But then we see the
results - dramatic segregation -
and it concerns us," he says. "Rather than swing from one extreme to
another, the trick is finding the
level of segregation along with the degree of race consciousness that
we're willing to live with."

Many other factors in college choice
By Mary Beth Marklein, USA TODAY

Lots of variables come into play when a student - of any race or
background - chooses a college.
The influence of anti-affirmative action policies is not always clear-cut:

     Norma Cruz, 18, a graduate of Crenshaw High School in Los Angeles, is
heading to the
     University of La Verne in La Verne, Calif. Having achieved a grade
point average of 3.76 and
     a class rank in the top 10, she applied to UC-Riverside, UCLA and
several other schools.
     She got into all but UCLA, but by the time that rejection came, "I
already had my mind set on
     a small school." La Verne, she says, "is a mixture of everything. All
 .-
races are there. Everyone
     gets along with everybody. My friend goes there (and she says) nobody
discriminates against
     you. II
     Crenshaw classmate Taaji Abbdur-Raus-Madyun, 18, who dreamed since
the ninth grade of
     going to UC-Berkeley, was admitted there but opted instead for Mills
College, a smaller,
     private women's school in nearby Oakland. "I decided I wanted to go
to a school where I
     was wanted," she says. "I'm going to school to learn, not to fight
everyone's battles. I can do
     that later."
     Edwin Garay, 18, a senior at Thomas Jefferson High School in Los
Angeles, was interested in
     UC schools but decided on California State University in San Diego
after talking with a UC
     representative and deciding he was "not ready to go to UC." Garay's
3.4 GPA is adequate,
     but his SAT score was 680, far below the acceptable minimum. That's
pretty typical at
     Thomas Jefferson, even among kids with higher grade point averages,
says counselor Esther
     Walling. The highest SAT score this year, 1100, is "barely
competitive," she says, noting that
     the students, 92% of them Hispanic and most of them poor, "are not
used to taking an SAT."
     She hopes to boost scores by encouraging her students to retake the
test and helping them to
     prepare better. Meanwhile, Garay plans to pursue a degree in
electrical engineering; he says
     he may try to transfer to UCLA later.
     Thomas Jefferson High School graduate Maria Parra, 18, wants to
"venture out in the world,"
     so she hopes to go to Smith College in Northampton, Mass., where
she's on a waiting list.
     She was accepted to UCLA, University of Southern California and UC
schools in Irvine,
     Davis and Santa Barbara. If Smith doesn't pan out, she'll go to
Irvine, mostly because it
     offered the most financial aid but also because she wants to attend a
small school. Affirmative
     action is irrelevant, she says: "If students do their work, they
deserve what they get."
