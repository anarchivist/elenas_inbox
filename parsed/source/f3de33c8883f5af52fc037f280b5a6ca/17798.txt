TEXT:
Although my last official day over here won't be for another week or so
(nothing like easing out slowly), beginning Monday I ' l l be spending the
bulk of my time at the Commerce Dept. -- building on my one week of
experience from late August as Deputy Director of the Office of policy and
strategic Planning in the Office of the Secretary.       So now is as good a
time as any to say that, although the result was less than optimal, I have
really enjoyed my almost three months here working on fast track.      After
seven years on the Hill and with a Congressionally-created commission,
this has been a great opportunity to get initiated in a hurry into the
Executive Branch.   I look forward to keeping in touch and continuing to
work with many of you -- maybe even on fast track, the continuing saga, in
early 1998.   If you're coming over to DoC, I ' l l be wandering around the
fifth floor there and can be reached at 482-4127. Best of success with
all of your work.
