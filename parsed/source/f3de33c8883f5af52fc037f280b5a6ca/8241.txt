TEXT:
Julie Anbender from INS sent me a copy of the new Reyes legislation.
According to Michael Meyers (Kennedy's counsel) Smith intends to mark this
up on Tuesday. Also, Rogers has indicated to Smith that he endorses the
Reyes proposal. Rogers will likely take the subcommittee's product as an
expression of what the authorizers want and start crafting his
appropriations bill pursuant to it.  This is sure to upset Abraham, who
has indicated his intention to control the reform process (and has already
held his first hearing) .

This bill effects the same kind of change that was outlined in Reyes's
                                                                      .
earlier version -- pulling the enforcement components of the agency
(including inspectors) out of INS and into Main Justice, headed by a
Bureau Director ( a la FBI and DEA).  The bill does not mention the
Services side of the operation, but does direct the AG to put mechanisms
in place to coordinate between the Bureau of Enforcement and the INS.

I have put in a call to the subcommittee's minority staff person (Tina
Hone) and will try to find out more about what our options are.

Julie
