[These Q&As assume the Chief of Staff agrees to meet with the members of the Texas
delegation.]


Question:       Did you get a letter from Sen. Gramm, Rep. Archer and other members of the
                Texas delegation asking for a meeting next week with the President's Chief of
                Staff? Do you plan to agree to the request?

Answer:         We did get the letter. We do plan to meet with these members of Congress to
            I   discuss the response we have given to the state of Texas. We do not intend to
                re-open the issue of the Texas request at this meeting, but instead to discuss with
                members of Congress the position we will have already discussed with state
                officials.

                Last week, HHS and USDA officials met with the Texas Health and Human
                Services Commissioner. They told him that the state could release an RFO
                subject to written guidelines that will be provided by the agencies. By the
                time the Chief of Staff meets with members of Congress, the agencies will
                have conveyed these guidelines, which will make clear what federal statutes
                and regulations allow -- and what they prohibit -- with respect to
                privatization.


                   [In general, Texas will not be allowed to privatize eligibility
                   determination or information gathering functions.          The state,
                   however, will be able to contract with a private party to do outreach
                   and to revamp computer and other automation systems.)

                   We have never stated publicly the bracketed information, but this was
                   the line taken by the agencies in this meeting with Commissioner
                   McKinney. This distinction does not apply toTemporary Assistance
                   to Needy Families, i.e., cash welfare, which the new welfare law
                   explicitly allows to be privatized.
