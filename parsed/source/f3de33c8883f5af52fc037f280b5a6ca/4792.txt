 TEXT:
 Elena - would it make sense for you to take the lead on this for the
 policy work group in terms of contributing to this weekly report? Since
 DPC will have a weekly update as part of its report to the President on
 Race Initiative progress, it makes sense to make these two reports
 consistent.

 If you have other ideas for doing this, please let me know and we can
 discuss. Thanks!

 PIR team leaders--

         I'll be compiling the weekly report to the President from PIR.
 Sylvia Mathews wants us to include updates from all the working groups.
 I'll need to get information from you by the end of the day on Wednesdays
 in order to make our Friday deadlines.  (For this week, that means
 tomorrow).  If you are not the contact person, please let me know who on
 your team will be.  In the updates, please include activities that you
 expect to occur on Thursday and Friday of the week.

         Also, because we are working out of the Department of Justice,
 please remember that the updates you send to me are subject to the Freedom
 of Information Act as are all of our weekly reports.

            Thanks for your help.

                                                  --Jacinta
