TEXT:
I have to be in a morning meeting with the First Lady.  If there are
questions about how to respond to the good, but skeptical, coverage
today.  I can think of a three part answer: 1. it was just announced
yesterday, local theater owners are in the best position to know what to
do to control their doors, let's see what they come up with, 2. the
announcement includes an education campaign where parents are to work with
local NATO owners to figure out what is going on in their communities, 3.
this is not the only step, POTUS has ~hallenged the industry about the
films they make and challenged to improve the rating system.
