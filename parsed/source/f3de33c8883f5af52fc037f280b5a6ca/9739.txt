Background
As you know, Rep. Shaw wants the high performance bonus to include
measures of family stability, noting rightly that the bonus is supposed to
be awarded based on state performance in achieving the objectives of TANF
which are:

           1.   help needy families
           2.   end welfare dependence by promoting work and marriage
           3.   reduce the incidence of illegitimate pregancies
           4.   encourage the formation and maintenance of two-parent familes

He now understands that good such measures, except for those measuring out
of wedlock births, are not currently available, but that the Census
Bureaus's American Community Survey (whose data should be available for FY
2000 if it is properly funded in this appropriations bill) will make such
measures available.

Shaw wrote to the Secretary Shalala saying:

        1. We were right to use only work measures in year 1
        2. For year 2, we should award 1/3 of bonus based on out of
wedlock data (the same
        data used for illegimacy bonus) .
        3. We should work together to fund the Census Bureau's new survey
(Shaw wrote to the
        appropriators in support)

Shalala wants to write back saying:

         1. She wants to extend the year 1 guidance (work only) to year 2
 (which began Oct 1)     2. "We need to expand the bonus to include a
broader set of measures
         and I am committed to doing so."
         3. She plans to publish an NPRM early next year which "would
include for comment
         measures of family formation, family stability, and child
well-being. "

Recommendation: I think we should agree to extend the year 1 guidance to


year 2, but I think we shouldn't commit ourselves to what we'll do in the
NPRM. OMB agrees with this concept.
Thus, I'd suggest letter anguage something like:

I agree with you that the Census Bureau's new American Community survey
will be a vital source for reliable State data on a range of indicators
including nonmarital births, marriage, and two parent families.  I support
your efforts to obtain full funding for this survey effort.  I believe
these data could form the basis for a broader set of high performance
bonus measures in future years.

 As you know, because of the extensive consultation process we undertook
 with states and other experts, the first year HPB guidance (for FY 1998)
 was released in March 1998. We believe that given this timing, it would
-make more sense to extend the first year of guidance to the second year
 (FY 1999), rather than as you suggest institute an interim measure for
 year two which may be then amended. We intend to publish a Notice of
 Proposed Rulemaking which would seek comment on the bonus for future
 years, and we will be closely considering measures on nonmarital births,
 marriage, and two parent families in that process.
