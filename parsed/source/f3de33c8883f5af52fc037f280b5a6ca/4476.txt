    I think town halls are a great idea.     I'm happy to tag along for any or
    all of them.

    Florida is a good place to start, esp. if you can get Chiles and
    Butterworth to come. Of the others on your list, I would recommend NJ in
    particular (because of Lautenberg and Pallone,both active on this) .
    Calif. is also good (a chance to highlight what they've done to cut teen
    smoking).  Suburban Cleveland would be good (Rep. Sherrod Brown from the
    Cleveland suburbs took over from Waxman as ranking member on the key
    health subcommittee that will take this up) .

    I would not do this in Iowa -- you don't want it to look like this whole
    effort is really just about building support for the VP in 2000.    I would
    probably stay away from Virginia, because you'll run into a lot of
    pro-tobacco, anti-govt sentiment.    (There's a press argument for doing one
    of these in grower country -- maybe with Gov. Hunt in NC -- but the risks
    probably outweigh the benefit.)   I think I would avoid New York as well,
    just because I've never seen a town mtg go well there.

    Other good sites if you're in the neighborhood would be Mass.
     (Harshbarger, Kennedy, good state effort), Illinois (Durbin), Washington
    state (Gregoire), and if you wanted a safe bipartisan place, Indiana
    (Lugar who's very supportive, and AG Jeff Modisett, a Dem who was fairly
    involved in the original negotiations) .

           In order for the VP to build national support for the President's plan on
           tobacco, Ron wants the VP to do three regional town-hall style meetings
           with kids, anti-smoking activists etc.  The first one, we're hoping will
           be in Florida on October 3. Ron would like you, Bruce and/or Secretary
           Shalala to try to attend each forum, if possible. Ron would also like to
           invite Dr. Koop and Dr. Kessler if they are available.  I have contacted
           the Secretary's office to give them a heads up, but don't want to contact
           Koop and Kessler until the event is more confirmed.

           Here are a list of places the VP tentatively will be going in the next
           several weeks, please let me know if any of them strike you as a good
           location for a town-hall on tobacco (assuming we have our pick) .

                  San Diego, LA, Orange County CA
                  Iowa
                  New Jersey
                  Virginia
                  New York
                  Cleveland

           I'll keep you posted on the Florida event.   Thanks.
