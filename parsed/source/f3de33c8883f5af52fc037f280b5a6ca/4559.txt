       Following is a draft Statement of Administration Policy prepared by DPC
       (Weinstein) .  Please call Chuck Konigsberg at OMB/LA by COB Monday
       evening with any concerns you may have -- 54790.


       DRAFT -- NOT FOR RELEASE
               September   ,1996
                (Senate)

       S'. 25 - Senate Campaign Finance Reform Act of 1997 (?)
       (McCain (R) Arizona and Feingold (D) Wisconsin)

       The Administration strongly supports Senate passage of S. 25, as modified
       by Senators McCain and Feingold, for the reasons explained in the attached
       letter from the President dated September 23, 1997.

       This bipartisan legislation includes many proposals that have been
       endorsed by the President since 1992.  It will put an end to the D&soft
       moneyD8 system, increase disclosure of independent expenditures, and
       enforce strict prohibitions on contributions from foreign nationals.  S.
       25 will open the political process and shift power from special interests
       to ordinary citizens.

       S. 25 addresses many of the most pressing needs for reform.  While the
       legislation does not include all the elements of reform that the
       Administration believes are needed, such as voluntary spending limits,
       restrictions on political Action Committee (PAC) contributions, and free
       and discounted broadcast time, the Administration considers S.25 to be an
       important first step and believes it represents the best opportunity to
       enact meaningful reform in this Congress.

    Dear Mr. Leader:

  Senators McCain and Feingold have pledged to bring their campaign reform
  legislation to a vote. When that happens, the American people will be
  watching.  I encourage you to act responsibly and support passage of this
  long-overdue, bipartisan legislation.

  This measure is of the utmost importance, and it deserves full
  consideration on the Senate floor.  If any attempt is made to bring this
  bill up in a manner that would preclude sufficient time for debate, I will
  call on Congress to stay in session until all of the critical elements are
  fully considered.

  There is a real need for reform. The amount raised by both political
  parties is doubling every four years. And as candidates are forced to
  spend ever greater amounts of time raising ever larger amounts of money,
  the people's business suffers. We have an obligation to restore the
  public trust.

 The bipartisan measure that Senators McCain and Feingold intend to bring
 to the floor is balanced and effective.   It addresses many of the most
 pressing needs for reform.   It does not include every reform that I
 believe necessary. But it is an important first step --and it represents
 the only real opportunity to enact meaningful reform in this Congress.
 Any attempts to attach amendments that would make it unpalatable to one
 party or another are nothing less than attempts to defeat campaign finance
 reform. And a vote to filibuster this measure is nothing short of a vote
 to maintain the system that favors special interests over the public
 good.   For years, the special interests and their allies have filibustered
 reform. But this year, the American people will hold accountable those
 who vote to maintain the status quo.

 Despite formidable odds, the congress faces the best opportunity in a
 generation to enact campaign finance reform. Let us work together in       a
 bipartisan spirit, as we have throughout this legislative session, to
 thwart special interests who seek to smother reform and deny the will      of
 the people. I urge you to support the bipartisan efforts embodied in       the
 McCain-Feingold proposal, permit the Senate to debate their bill, and      vote
 to enact these needed changes to our political system.

                                    Sincerely,
                                    (signed: Bill Clinton)


   ** The following is a broad outline -- provided by Senators McCain and
 . Feingold --
   of the revised package **

              MCCAIN/FEINGOLD -- PART I

                               The Base Package
,-
         Banning Soft Money. All soft money contributions to the national political
         parties from
         corporations, labor unions and wealthy individuals would be prohibited.

         Independent Expenditures. Modifies statutory definition of "express
         advocacy" to
         provide a clear distinction between expenditures for communications used
         to advocate candidates
         and those used to advocate issues. Candidate-related expenditures will be
         subject to federal election
         law.

         Greater Disclosure. Requires more timely and expanded disclosure of
         campaign
         contributions and expenditures, strengthens-penalties for election law
         violations and provides the
         FEC with stronger tools for enforcing current and new campaign finance
         laws.

         Strict Codification of the "Beck" Decision. Requires labor unions to
         notify non-union members that they are entitled to request a refund of the
         portion of their agency fees
         used for political purposes.

         Wealthy Candidates. Bars the political parties from making "coordinated
         expenditures" on behalf of Senate candidates who do not agree to limit
         their personal wealth
         spending to $50,000 per election.


                 MCCAIN-FEINGOLD -- PART II

                             The Challenger Amendment

         Leveling the Playing Field. Creates a voluntary system that provides
         Senate candidates with a
         50% discount on television costs if they agree to raise a majority of
         their campaign
         funds from their home states, to accept no more than 25% of their campaign
         funds in aggregate
         PAC contributions and to limit their personal spending to $50,000 per
         election.
