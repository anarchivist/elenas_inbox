TEXT:
Elena    in my soon-to-be-new capacity in the VP's office, I'm casting
around for good announcements, reports, etc. that the VP could do between
now and mid-August -- and will always be interested in anything from now
on (realizing that this no longer gets the same priority as POTUS
announcements) ... In particular, he's going to have a few opportunities to
talk about urban policy in early August (including his own Urban League
speech 2 days after POTUS) ...

Any thoughts?

Many thanks,

Eli
