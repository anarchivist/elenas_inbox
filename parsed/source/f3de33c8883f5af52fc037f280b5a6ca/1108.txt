Subject:         : EARLY LEARNING CONFERENCE

URGENT -- PLEASE READ THE FULL MESSAGE.     NAMES FOR THE CONFERENCE MUST BE
SUBMITTED ASAP.

Doris and I have just gotten back from a meeting on the Early Learning &
Development conference tentatively scheduled for April 17 here at the
White House. The theme is the critical importance of the earliest years
of children's lives, and the development of their cognitive, emotional and
social development. Generally, it is the 0-3 years, but experts warn that
it does extend beyond those years to the pre-school and early-school age.

The Conference will be a day long event consisting of two interactive
panels, moderated by the First Lady.  The first panels will examine
current scientific research on early brain development and the practical
applications of this information by parents and caregivers.  There will
then be a lunch followed by a second panels discussing how society
contributes to the development.  This will included a large number of our
groups including, religious, business, child and/or health care, child
advocates, educators, etc.  Part of this discussion will also be examining
the role of government.

YOUR ASSIGNMENT:

        We have been asked to develop a list of suggested invitees for
review by the President and First Lady ON THURSDAY.  Therefore, we must
have your suggestions, PRIORITIZED, WITH A ONE-TWO SENTENCE DESCRIPTION BY
COB WEDNESDAY.  (YES - - TWO DAYS FROM TODAY. )
