TEXT:
Agree that it's probably time to move forward on the EO.  I'm checking
status of related second hand smoke activities (e.g. litigation of EPA's
second hand smoke risk assessment and OSHA's long-pending workplace
standard) .

ALSO,  Waxman and others are introducing two tobacco bills tomorrow,
Tuesday, at 10:00am press conference.

Waxman/Meehan and Sen. Lautenberg will introduce the "Smoke Free
Environment Act," a far-reaching bill they passed out of subcommittee in
1994 with some restaurant, insurance and building industry support.  It
prohibits smoking in any "public" facility (any building used by more than
10 people), except in specially-designated smoking areas that are
ventilated according to EPA-promulgated standards.  Citizens can sue to
enforce.

Waman/Meehan and Sen. Durbin will introduce a kids use performance
standard for tobacco brands -- an idea on the table in the settlement
talks.  Tobacco companies would have to reduce by 90% over 6 years the
number of kids using (not buying) any given brand, or face a
non-compliance penalty/tax of $1 per pack in the first year of
non-compliance; $2 per pack in the second year of non-compliance, etc.

These tackle key problems, albeit very aggressively.  Do we want to say
anything besides "we'll look at them" if asked tomorrow? Should I ask HHS
to do talking points?

I talked to Kevin about the Thurs mtg.  He thought it would be great to
put a process in place to analyze the settlement, if any.  Their
recommendation for our opening line is, we haven't seen the agreement,
I've asked my public health advisers to study it.



 He also said they would probably make a formal recommendation soon that
it's time to proceed with an EO banning smoking in federal workplaces.
