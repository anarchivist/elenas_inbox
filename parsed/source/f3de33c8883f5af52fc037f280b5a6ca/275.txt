TEXT:
I sent all of you a draft notice from SSA on SSI for non-citizens.
This is one of these leaflets that will be distributed very widely
in their field offices -- a million copies -- explaining the new
law.   Please get me or Brian Coyne of SSA your comments by the
close of business today.   Brian is at 482-7128 if you want to get
him comments directly.
My only question/suggestion was whether they could tell people a
little more about how much time they have -- approximately when
they would get a notice, and when they will be called in for a
redetermination. The current document is silent.    I would think
they could say notice beginning in Jan 1997 (or whenever), and
redeterminations beginning in April 1997 (or whenever). Brian had
an initially positive reaction and is checking into this.
 (I just talked to a woman whose 80-year-old mother is a Holocaust
survivor on SSI.   Her SSA office told her the cutoff notice would
be next month, and her INS office in Indianapolis told her
naturalization could take up to 18 months.   I tried to set her
straight on both timelines, and advised her to get in that
application. )
