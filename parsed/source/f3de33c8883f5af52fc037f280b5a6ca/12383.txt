     SUBJECT:           Colorado School Shooting - Agency Updates


     On Thursday, April 29, the students of Columbine will join students at
     Chatfield High School for classes.   Four (4) funerals were held
     yesterday, and two (2) more will be held today, Tuesday, April 27.  More
     funerals are planned throughout the week.   In addition, radio stations
     and local companies are collecting funds to help assist families to deal
     with the economic component of this tragedy. As reports becom~ available,
     we will circulate.

     The Department of Justice

     Justice expects a request from Colorado today for federal funds to address
     additional security both in and around the school, especially with respect
     to student concerns at local proms.  In addition, this money would aid in


helping increase security at counseling centers, additional bomb sweeps,
responses to bomb threats, law enforcement overtime, and other security
related costs.  The request is expected to be around $750,000 to
$1,000,000.

The Department of Health and Human Services

At 11:21am (Mountain time) today, April 27, the time during which the
original shootings began last week, there will be a moment of silence for
30 seconds throughout the Denver Metro area.  Churches that have bells
will toll 15 times; one for each victim.

It is estimated that 10,000 people will need long term counseling after
this tragedy.

The Department of Education

Bill Modzeleski, of the DOEd's Safe and Drug Free Schools, is in Colorado
with a team of other federal officials who have experience in deaiing with
similar tragedies, advising local officials on long term recovery efforts.
