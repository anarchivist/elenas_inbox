                         Zero Tolerance Drug Supervision Event
                                    January 5,1999
                                Questions and Answers


Q.   What more can you tell us about the Justice Department report released today?

A.   The President highlighted key findings of the report on prisoner drug use, including:

     Vast majority of all prisoners report drug use. In 1997, 83 percent of state prisoners
     and 73 percent of federal prisoners reported past drug use -- considerably more than the
     21 percent of state prisoners and 60 percent of federal prisoners who are serving time for
     drug offenses. In addition, 57 percent of state prisoners and 45 percent of federal
     prisoners reported using drugs in the month before their arrest.

     Many prisoners commit crimes to buy drugs or while high. Nearly 20 percent of
     state prisoners and IS percent of federal inmates reported committing their offense to get
     money to buy drugs. And 33 percent of state prisoners and 22 percent of federal
     prisoners were actually under the influence of drugs at the time of their offense.

     Drug offenders have long "rap sheets." State prisoners serving sentences for drug
     offenses reported extensive criminal histories: 76 percent had been previously sentenced
     to prison or probation; 54 percent were on probation or parole at the time of their arrest;
     45 percent had three or more prior sentences; and 23 percent had previously committed a
     violent crime. Although federal drug offenders generally reported less severe criminal
     histories, 59 percent had prior criminal records.

     However, the report makes other significant findings, such as:

     Prisoners report significant alcohol use. About 37 percent of state prisoners and 20
     percent offederal inmates committed their offense under the influence of alcohol. About
     40 percent of state and 30 percent of federal prisoners reported a prior binge drinking
     experience. In addition, over 40 percent of both state and federal inmates had driven
     drunk in the past.

     Smaller portion of prison population receiving treatment. The percentage of
     prisoners participating in drug treatment since admission declined between 1991 and
     1997: from 24 percent to 9.7 percent for state inmates; and from 15.7 percent to 9.2
     percent for federal inmates. However, between 1991 and 1997, prisoner participation in
     other drug abuse programs (e.g., peer groups, self-help) grew -- from 15.5 percent to 20.3
     percent for state inmates, and doubled for federal prisoners, from 10 percent to 20
     percent.

     [Additional questions about the report's findings should be forwarded to the Office of
     Justice Program's Bureau of Justice Statistics.]
                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion

Q.   The Administration cites in its accomplishments that it has increased drug testing
     and treatment in the federal prisons, but the Justice Department report suggests a
     decrease in inmate treatment since 1991. How do you explain this contradiction?

A.   We have definitely increased the number of federal inmates that are drug tested and
     treated. The 1994 Crime Act mandated that, by the end of FY 1997, all federal prisoners
     eligible for residential drug treatment should receive such treatment. As a result, by
     1998, the Federal Bureau of Prisons was conducting about 30,000 more drug tests per
     year and providing residential drug treatment to four times as many prisoners. The
     number of inmates participating in other types of drug abuse and education programs also
     increased during this time.

     However, these increases may not have kept pace with the rapid growth in the prison
     population during that same period. In fact, between 1991 and 1997, the federal prison
     population grew by well over 50 percent (from 71,000 to about 113,000). Thus, even
     while more treatment slots were being made available -- and more prisoners were
     participating in other drug abuse and education programs -- the overall percentage in
     treatment may have declined.

     Finally, it should be noted that the Justice Department report includes a disclaimer saying
     that -- because the likelihood of receiving treatment increases as a prisoner's release date
     approaches -- it may have underestimated the total number of prisoners who will
     ultimately receive drug treatment.


Q.   What will the overall increase in funding be for drug testing and treatment as a
     result of this new initiative?

A.   The "zero tolerance" drug supervision initiative represents a funding enhancement of
     $112 million for FY 2000. This includes: $100 million in new funds for states and
     localities to drug test and treat prisoners, parolees, and probationers; an increase of $1 0
     million for additional drug courts (from $40 to $50 million); and an increase of $2 million
     for the residential drug treatment in state prisons (from $63 million to $65 million).


Q.   What is the average cost of a drug test?

A.   The Federal Bureau of Prisons spends less than $9.00 per drug test for the nearly 130,000
     drug tests it conducted last year. Costs can vary depending on the number of drugs
     tested for, procedural requirements, and the number of tests needed --lower quantities
     will cost more.


Q.   Is overall drug use increasing or decreasing? And how does it compare to the
     statistics contained in today's report on prisoner drug use?
                                                                  Hex-Dwnp Conversion


A.   According to the most recent National Household Survey on Drug Abuse, there were 13.9
     million current drug users in 1997 -- or about half the number of drug users during the
     peak year of 1979. These nearly 14 million drug users represent about 6 percent of the
     American population age 12 and older, and the number has remained roughly flat since
     1992.

     By comparison, current drug use by prisoners has increased since 1991, and ranges
     between 5 to 10 times greater than the overall population. Current drug use by state
     prisoners increased from 50 percent to 57 percent between 1991 and 1997, and from 32
     percent to 45 percent for federal inmates during the same period.


Q.   But isn't youth drug use increasing?

A.   Not according to the most recent study released by the Department of Health and Human
     Services. The 1998 Monitoring the Future Survey showed that for the second year in a
     row, youth drug use, in nearly every category, has either decreased or leveled off
     among 8th, 10th, and 12th graders. Specifically, marijuana use -- the most widely used
     drug by teens -- appears to have leveled off, with declines reported for the second year.
     Just as importantly, youth attitudes toward drugs appear to be turning around,
     with more young people viewing marijuana use as risky behavior.

     So, while teen drug use remains unacceptably high -- and considerably higher than its low
     point in 1991 -- we are encouraged by these positive trends.
