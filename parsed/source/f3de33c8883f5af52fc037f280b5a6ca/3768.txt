                  $3 BILLION TO HELP MOVE PEOPLE FROM WELFARE TO WORK

         The Administration is extremely pleased that the new budget includes the President's proposal to
         create a $3 billion Welfare to Work Jobs Challenge fund. This program will help states and
         local communities move long-term welfare recipients into lasting, unsubsidized jobs. The
         budget provides aU of the funds the Administration was seeking in this area.

         The President first made this proposal last August, as a critical part of his strategy to make
         welfare reform a success and move 1 million people from welfare to work by the year 2000.
         This program recognizes that there are special challenges to moving the hardest-to-employ
         welfare recipients to work and finding jobs for welfare recipients in areas of high unemployment.

         These funds can be used for job creation, job placement, and job retention efforts, including
         wage subsidies to private employers and critical post-employment support services. The Labor
         Department will provide oversight but the dollars will be placed in the hands of the localities
         who are on the front lines of the welfare reform effort.

         The funds will be awarded starting in 1998, with spending continuing through 2001. 75% of the
         $3 billion will be distributed under a formula that targets areas of high poverty and
         unemployment within each state, including inner cities and rural areas. One-quarter will be
         awarded competitively to innovative projects submitted by local governments, private industry
         councils, and private entities like community organizations.

         Spending must target long-term welfare recipients; those who face special obstacles such as no
         high school diploma, a need for substance abuse treatment, or a poor work history; and those
         facing loss of benefits due to time limits. The program gives states and local governments great
         flexibility to design welfare to work strategies that will be most effective in that community and
         for that individual.


         Notes: This program is for families with children on TANF (formerly AFDC), not single
         childless adults. Today's New York Times incorrectly described this program as benefitting the
         latter group, confusing it with the $1 billion that the Administration achieved to create work slots
         for childless unemployed adults who face a food stamp cut-off.

         Also, it was a major political victory for the Administration that states must pass through most of
         the money to local private industry councils, whose members are appointed by mayors.
