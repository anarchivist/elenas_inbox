TEXT:
A couple of comments:

I don't see any merit in HHS rushing forward to approve the five remaining
waivers when they admit that the proposed demonstrations are nothing
exicting or new. Why not ask the remaining states to resubmit proposals
on topics HHS would like to see explored? Or better yet, have HHS suggest
demonstrations for them.  I really don't think we should encourage HHS to
go forward with a new set of demonstrations before we are satisified that
the full first set will be useful.

What do you think?
