Per your request ... This isn't perfect, but here's a quick and dirty on the
major health care provisions. The telemarketing stuff is less
substantive, I think ... jc3

Health Care Fraud. The VP could announce/leak the provision to crackdown
on health care fraud that will be included in the Presidents upcoming
crime bill. These include:

- Tougher penalties.  The crime bill will increase from 5 to 10 years the
maximum penalty for providing false statements in relation to health care
matters and for obstructing a health care fraud investigation.  It also
directs the Sentencing Commission to review and amend, if appropriate, the
penalties for health care fraud.

- Kickback schemes.  To better crack down on health care kickback schemes,
the crime bill proposes expanding the law in the following 3 ways: (1)
granting federal prosecutors the authority to enjoin kickback schemes
while they are in progress; (2) allowing the AG to pursue civil actions in
kickback schemes against federal health plans; and (3) applying the
current penalties for kickback schemes not just to federal health
providers (Medicare, Medicaid, and CHAMPUS), but to private health
insurance plans as well.

- AG's ability to issue subpoenas in civil cases. Under current law, in
investigating civil health care fraud cases the AG/Justice Department must
rely on subpoenas issued by HHS' Inspector General. The crime bill will
make clear that DOJ has the authority to issue subpeonas and pursue
wrongdoers in any health care fraud cases.

- Sharing of grand jury information.  Current law allows government
attorneys in criminal cases to share grand jury information with other
government attorneys involved in civil actions commenced to enforce the
banking laws. The crime bill would allow government attorneys to similar
share information in health care fraud cases.
