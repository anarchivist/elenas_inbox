TEXT:
Do you do labor relations issues? More specifically, any clude about the
IBEW and their allegations that the Tennessee Valley Authority is not
negotiating with them properly.  I have a letter from the Tennesee IBEW
President (Carl Lansden) and Sara has one from the lAM on the same subject
 (that maybe you gave her). Any advice on how to handle this. Normally,
Jim Dorskind's office would do a reply, but in this case, I'm not sure
that is sufficient or appropriate. Thoughts?
