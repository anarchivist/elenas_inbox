                Democratic Unveil Patients' Bill of Rights. Today, the Democratic Leadership introduced
                their version of the patients' bill of rights in a ceremony attended by Labor Secretary Alexis
                Herman. Your letter to the Leadership, which indicated strong support for this bill without
                providing an all out endorsement, was extremely well received. This legislation includes every
                patient protection recommended by your Advisory Commission on Consumer Protection and
                Quality. It builds on these recommendations and includes an enforcement provision that allows
                remedies achieved through the state courts. Because this provision would preempt ERISA, it is
                the most controversial aspect of the bill and has already attracted strong opposition from the
                employer community. This legislation also includes a compromise whistleblower protection
                that is acceptable to the labor community and not serious objectionable to the hospital
                community. We helped draft this compromise provision, and Congressman Dingell and Senator
                Kennedy were extremely appreciative of our help in this regard.


                On Track to Cover One Million Children at Sixth Month Anniversary of the Children's
                Health Insurance Program. Wednesday marks the sixth month anniversary of the Children's
                Health Insurance Program. Donna Shalala, in an event with Bruce Reed and Gene Sperling, will
                announce the approval of New York and Illinois children's health plans. With these two new
                approvals, eight states will have come into this new program and will provide health care
                coverage for one million children. At this event, we will also be releasing a NEC/DPC report on
                the rapid implementation of this new program. The report illustrates that an additional 15 states
                have already submitted proposals to HHS to expand health care coverage and that virtually every
                other state has a process underway to submit a proposal.
