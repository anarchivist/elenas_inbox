     PRESIDENT CLINTON ANNOUNCES INTRODUCTION OF SENATE FOOD
       SAFETY LEGISLATION AND REPORT TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF
           IMPORTED AND DOMESTIC FRUITS AND VEGETABLES
                            March 4, 1998

Today President Clinton will announce the introduction of legislation by Senators Milkulski and
Kennedy to ensure the safety of all imported foods, including fruits and vegetables. This
legislation will enhance the Food and Drug Administration's authority. to prevent the import of
fruits, vegetables, and other food products that do not meet U.S. food safety requirements. The
President also will announce the release of a report that provides a blueprint on how the
Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Department of Agriculture (USDA)
will work cooperatively with the agricultural community to develop guidance on good
agricultural and manufacturing practices for fruits and vegetables.

Enhanced FDA Oversight for Imported Foods. The President will call on Congress to pass
the food safety legislation to be introduced today in the Senate to give the FDA greater authority
over imported foods. This legislation will ensure that the FDA halts imports of fruits,
vegetables, and other food products from any foreign country with food safety systems that do
not provide the same level of protection required for U.S. products. The legislation also permits
the FDA to consider refusal of inspection as a factor in halting imports from a country or facility.
 This legislation gives FDA authority that is comparable to USDA's existing authority to prevent
the importation of unsafe meat and poultry. The President already has committed to providing
approximately $25 million in his Fiscal Year 1999 budget to enable the FDA to dramatically
expand its international food inspection force in order to implement this legislation. Reps.
Eshoo and Pallone previously have introduced this legislation in the House of Representatives.

Development of Guidance on Good Agricultural and Manufacturing Practices. The
President will announce the release of a report on how the Secretary of Health and Human
Services, in partnership with the Secretary of Agriculture and in cooperation with the agricultural
community, will develop guidance on good agricultural and manufacturing practices. This
report outlines the progress already made -- and the measures that must still be taken -- to
develop guidance for the growing, processing, shipping, and marketing of fruits and vegetables
by October 1998. The guidance -- the first-ever specific safety standards for fruits and
vegetables -- will address potential food safety problems throughout the production and
distribution system and help ensure the sanitation and safety practices of all those seeking to sell
produce in the U.S. market. The report also provides both short- and long-term plans for
technical assistance, education, and outreach activities to support the appropriate application of
the guidance.

            Clinton Administration Accomplishments In Improving Food Safety

The President's announcement builds on a strong record of food safety initiatives, ensuring that
Americans eat the safest possible food. The Administration has put into place improved safety
standards for meat, poultry, and seafood products, and has begun the process of developing
enhanced standards for fruit and vegetable juices. The Administration also has expanded
research, education, and surveillance activities throughout the food safety system.

*February, 1998. Administration announces its proposed food safety budget, which requests an
approximate $101 million increase for food safety initiatives.

*May, 1997. Administration announces comprehensive new initiative to improve the safety of
nation's food supply --"Food Safety from Farm to Table" -- detailing a $43 million food safety
program, including measures to improve surveillance, outbreak response, education, and
research.

*January, 1997. President announces new Early-Warning System to gather critical scientific
data to help stop foodborne disease outbreaks quickly and to improve prevention systems further.

*August, 1996. President signs Safe Drinking Water Act of 1996. The law requires drinking
water systems to protect against dangerous contaminants like cryptosporidium, and gives people
the right to know about contaminants in their tap water.

*August, 1996. President signs Food Quality Protection Act of 1996, which streamlines
regulation of pesticides by FDA and EPA and puts important new public-health protections in
place, especially for children.                   .

*July, 1996. President Clinton announces new regulations that modernize the nation's meat and
pOUltry inspection system for the first time in 90 years. New standards help prevent E.coli
bacteria contamination in meat.

*December, 1995. Administration issues new rules to ensure seafood safetY; utilizing HACCP
regulatory programs to require food industries to design and implement preventive measures and
increase the industries' responsibility for and control of their safety assurance actions .

. * 1994. CDC embarks on strategic program to detect, prevent, and control emerging infectious
  disease threats, some of which are food borne, making significant progress toward this goal in
  each successive year.

*1993. Vice-President's National Performance Review issues report recommending
government and industry move toward a system of preventive controls.

            Q&A for Presidential Announcement on Food Safety Legislation
            and Report to Ensure Safety of Imported Fruits and Vegetables
                                   March 4, 1998

Q:   What did the President announce today?

A:   The President announced the introduction of food safety legislation in the Senate that will
     ensure that the FDA denies the entry of imports of fruits, vegetables, or other food from
     any foreign country or facility that does not meet U.S. food safety requirements or
     otherwise achieve the level of protection required. The legislation also pennits FDA to
     consider refusal of inspection as a factor in halting imports from a facility or country.
     This legislation was introduced in the House in November of last year. The President
     also announced the release of a report on how the Secretary of Health and Human
     Services, in cooperation with the Secretary of Agriculture and the agricultural
     community, will develop guidance on good agricultural and good manufacturing practices
     for any fruits and vegetables that are sold in the U.S. market.

Q:   Why is your Administration proposing these actions?

A:   There have been dramatic changes in the produce department of the grocery store. Thirty
     years ago, most produce sections only had around a dozen items year round, increasing to
     as many as 50 in the summer. Today, the chances are that there are 400 or more items in
     the produce section and they are there all year round. Last year, 38 percent of the fruit
     and 12 percent of the vegetables Americans ate were imported.

     We have changed as well. Americans are eating more fresh fruits and vegetables than
     ever before, and our nation's health experts tell us we will live longer, better quality lives
     as a result. Our environment is also changing. We are finding "new" exotic bugs such
     as cyclospora and E. coli 0157: H7 on our food that once were not there.

     We must ensure that these changes do not increase the risk to American consumers of
     foodbome illnesses. Although raw produce -- including that imported from foreign
     countries -- is now safe, experts have suggested ways to make further improvements, and
     my actions accord with their recommendations.

Q:   Are you saying that imported produce is unsafe?
                                                            Hex-Dump Conversion

A:    There is no data indicating that imported fruits and vegetables are more unsafe than
      domestic products. But some recent outbreaks of foodborne illness have been traced
      back to imports, and it is important to ensure that foreign fruits and vegetables meet U.S.
      food safety requirements or otherwise achieve the level of protection required. The steps
      we are taking today are adding additional layers of protection. We am making sure that
      there are no gaps in our food safety system -- that high safety standards apply to imported
      as well as domestic food, and to fruits and vegetables as well as to meat, poultry, and
      seafood.

Q:    What steps is the Administration taking to improve food safety?

A:     Last year we launched a new Presidential food safety initiative, and added more than $40
       million to the FY '98 budget. With that money we started putting in place new
       science-based preventive systems to improve the safety of seafood, meat and poultry and
       began work on a new early warning system to help detect and respond to outbreaks of
     . foodbome illness. This year, our budget seeks an even more substantial increase in
       resources, $101 million, to improve food safety. The resources will go to a variety of .
       initiatives, including: giving FDA authority to prevent the import of produce from
       countries without safety precautions equivalent to our own; hiring FDA inspectors to
       improve the safety of our nation's fruits and vegetables, both domestic and imported;
       developing new ways for federal inspectors to detect food-borne illnesses in meat and
       poultry and determine the source of contamination; improving educational outreach on
       proper food handling; and further expanding our early warning system and strengthening
       state surveillance activities for foodborne illnesses.


      Questions on Food Safety Legislation

Q:    What does the legislation do?

A:    This legislation helps ensure that the FDA will refuse imports of any food regulated by
      the FDA, including fruits and vegetables, from any country or facility that does not meet
      U.S. food safety requirements or otherwise achieve the level of protection required. The
      legislation also permits FDA to consider refusal of inspection as a factor in halting
      imports from a facility or country.

Q:    How is this different from current authority?

A:    This legislation increases the FDA's authority to refuse imports for foods from countries
      or facilities that do not meet U.S. food safety requirements or otherwise achieve the level
      of protection required. Currently, the FDA can only refuse imports after inspection or
      testing at the border when the FDA determines that the food appears to be unsafe or
      otherwise violates U.S. law. This new legislation will enable the FDA to ensure that


                                               2
                                                          Hex~Dump Conversion


     .food products entering this country were grown and processed in conditions that meet
      U.S. food safety requirements or otherwise achieve the level of protection required. This
      authority is necessary because experience has shown that inspection and testing of
      products at the border may not be sufficient in all cases to ensure the safety of food
      products. It may be necessary to identify and address the source of potential
      contamination to ensure that products offered for sale in the United States meet domestic
      food safety requirements or otherwise achieve the level of protection required. FDA
      currently has such authority with respect to domestic production.

Q:   . Does this legislation give FDA additional authority to inspect in other countries?

A:    No. Foreign inspections will continue to be done by consent. In making the
      determination that a food offered for import into the U.S. is adulterated, the legislation
      does permit the Secretary to consider whether FDA has been refused access to conduct
      inspection of the places where such food has been prepared, packed or held. The
      Secretary may deny importation to foods from such location or establishment on the basis
      of such refusal and other relevant factors. Because denying reasonable access is one
      factor in making that determination, the exporting country and the food establishment
      both have a strong incentive to allow such access.


Q:    There is concern that this legislation is the first step in providing FDA with the
      authority to inspect farms in tbe U.S. Is that next?

A:    Under current law, FDA already has authority to inspect establishments where food is
      prepared, packed, or held, which would include places where food is grown, such as
      domestic farms. While such inspections are infrequent, FDA has taken action against a
      U.S. farmer when a violation occurs. When FDA is involved in a food safety problem
      that is found to originate on a farm, the agency's focus generally is on identifying the
      source of the problem and removing the unsafe food from commerce.

Q.    Doesn't this legislation impose trade barriers to food imports at a time when you are
      saying you want to lower them? Is this legislation consistent with free trade?

A.    This legislation is consistent with free trade and all our treaty obligations. We have no
      obligation toopen our borders to imports that pose a greater risk than domestic products
      to American consumers. As long as we are not imposing any greater requirements on
      foreign countries -- as long as we are only holding them to our standards -- we are acting
      consistently with our trade policy and international obligations.

Q:    What makes you think this new legislation can be effective? Do you seriously think
      you are going to be able to put FDA inspectors in every country abroad?



                                               3
                                                         Hex-Dump Conversion

A:   The new legislation would give the FDA the same kind of responsibility that the USDA
     already has for meat and poultry. The USDA system has worked well to ensure that
     unsafe meat and poultry, produced in foreign facilities which do not provide the same
     level of protection that is required in domestic facilities, will not be imported. The FDA
     should be able to run a similarly effective system that ensures food safety and prevents
     imports from any foreign country or facility that does not meet U.S. food safety
     requirements or otherwise achieve the level of protection required.

     Questions Related to Report on Guidance

Q:   Why has this report been prepared?

A:   On October 2, 1997, President Clinton announced an initiative to ensure the safety of
     imported and domestic fruits and vegetables which included the development of good
     agricultural practices and good manufacturing practices for fresh fruits and vegetables
     that would include ways to prevent potential contamination. This voluntary guidance
     will address potential food safety problems throughout the production and distribution
     system and help ensure the sanitation and safety practices of all those seeking to sell
     produce in the U.S. market. The guidance effort will include outreach and education,
     reflecting the Administration's commitment to direct resources toward improving food
     safety and the availability offood safety technologies.

     The President requested this status report about progress made toward providing industry
     with good agricultural and good manufacturing practices guidance for fresh fruits and
     vegetables. It also presents a plan for outreach to the domestic and foreign industry.

Q:   When you say good agricultural practices (GAPs) and good manufacturing
     practices (GMPs), are you talking about mandatory GAPs and GMPs?

A:   No, theGAP/GMP guidance is voluntary. We are developing this science-based
     guidance with input from USDA, states, the agricultural community, industry, academia,
     consumers, and organizations representing the foreign produce industry. The guidance is
     intended for appropriate use by growers, packers, manufacturers of minimally processed
     products and produce distributors. Because the guidance is broad-based, it may be used,
     where applicable, by both the domestic and foreign produce industry to' reduce the risk of
     microbial contamination.

Q:   Does the report give a timeline for publishing the guidance?

A:   Yes, we anticipate publishing the draft guidance in late March with a 75-day comment
     period. We anticipate that the guidance will be available in final form in October 1998.

                                                                      Hex-Dump Ccnversicn

                   This may come up because the deadline for the importation of Guatemalan
                   raspberries is March 15.

              Q:   What is the status of the Guatemalan raspberries?

              A:   On November 20,1997, FDA notified the Guatemalans that fresh raspberries will not be
                   allowed entry into the U.S. during the period of March 15 through August 15, 1998.
                   However, if the source of Cyc/osporacontamination is found and corrected or if
                   intervention technologies are developed that will prevent cyclosporiasis in humans, we
                   will revisit this decision. FDA has assisted Guatemala in seeking a resolution to this
                   problem since 1996 .. In fact, we currently have people in Guatemala reviewing the
                   interventions they have reportedly put in place.
