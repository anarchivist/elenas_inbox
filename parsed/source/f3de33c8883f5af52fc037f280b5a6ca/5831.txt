Subject:         Status of pure food agency proposal

Per both of your requests for status and offers to help, here is what
happened at first planning meeting on the issue today, chaired by Elena.

Sally Katzen presented OMB's arguments for single agency and why we should
do this in terms of policy benefits and government efficiency. NPR
supported recommendation as we have since 1993. We agreed that OMB's idea
for single agency is an even better idea and might help with the meat and
poultry producers who wanted no part of being regulated by HHS the last
time.
Decision was made to run this one by Secretaries Glickman and Shalala
before proceeding. Bruce Reed was to do that. If either of you want to
help Bruce, talk to him about it.  There does appear to be a legislative
vehicle already out there that might be used for this. Hilley was to
check out its status.
Question was asked as to depth of VP's support. Since I wasn't there,  NPR
repeated that this is one of those recommendations that we have never
backed off of or abandoned.  I will get further reading from VP ASAP and
let you know if there is any reason for concern there.
Morley
