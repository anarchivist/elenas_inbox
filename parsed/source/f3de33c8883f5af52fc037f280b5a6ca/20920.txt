STATEMENT OF NANCY E. McFADDEN
GENERAL COUNSEL
U.S. DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION
concerning
THE USE OF PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENTS BY TRANSPORTATION CONTRACTORS
before the
COMMITTEE ON SMALL BUSINESS
U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
August 6, 1998

Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee:

I am pleased to be here today to clear up several misconceptions about the
use of project labor agreements in transportation construction projects.
Clearly there are some who misinterpret the thrust of Secretary Rodney
Slater's recent memorandum encouraging the agencies in our Department to
consider use of an agreement in the direct contracting and financial
assistance processes when it will "promote cost savings, efficiency,
quality, and labor-management stability."

From your recent correspondence with Secretary Slater, I know that your
Committee is concerned in particular about the impact of a project labor
agreement on small business concerns' ability to compete for construction
work under the project. The Clinton Administration is very sensitive to
the interest of small businesses, because we understand the enormous
contributions they make to the economic vitality we enjoy in this country,
the opportunities that only they provide to disadvantaged entrepreneurs,


and the fact that much of the innovation this country is famous for comes
from small businesses. In fact, I appeared just last February before this
Committee to detail how our Department works to ensure the interests of
small business in the DOT rulemaking process by making use of the "610"
process. Secretary Slater cares about and strongly supports small business.

The most fundamental misconception about project labor agreements is that
they are being newly visited on federal construction contracting by this
administration. To the contrary, these agreements have a long history in
the construction industry. According to a May 1998 GAO report on the
extent of use of project labor agreements in federal contracting, they
date back to construction of the Grand Coulee Dam in 1938 and were
employed on a project-by-project basis as the occasion arose, including
transportation projects.  President Clinton effectively endorsed this
long-standing, proven procurement tool when he issued his June 5, 1997,
Memorandum for the Heads of Executive departments and Agencies.

This reaches a second misconception--that the President's Memorandum, or
the Secretary's implementation of that Memorandum, imposes or requires
project labor agreements on contractors. This is entirely erroneous. These
memoranda do not mandate but rather encourage consideration of the use of
these agreements when--and only when--they will benefit the Government's
procurement interest. I would like to set out the operative language
because it so clearly leaves the choice about employing project labor
agreements to those who are cognizant of a particular project and the pros
and cons of employing such an agreement in that case:

     "Section 1. Executive departments or agencies during this
Administration
authorized to award a contract for the construction of a facility to be
owned by
a Federal department or agency may, on a project-by-project basis, use a
project
labor agreement on a large and significant project, (a) where a project
labor
agreement will advance the Government's procurement interest in cost,
efficiency, and quality and in promoting labor-management stability as
well as
compliance with applicable legal requirements governing safety and health,
equal
employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters,
and
(b) where no laws applicable to the specific construction project preclude
the
use of the proposed project labor agreement.

     "Section 2. If an executive department or agency during this
Administration
determines that use of a project labor agreement will serve the goals set
forth
in section l(a) of this memorandum on a large and significant project, and
that
no law precludes the use of a project labor agreement on the project, the
executive department or agency may require that every contractor or
subcontractor on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or
become a
party to a project labor agreement with one or more appropriate labor
organizations. The executive department or agency has discretion whether to
include such a requirement."


Under my reading of this language, it would be hard to be clearer that use
of an agreement is entirely discretionary by the agency and, even more
important, may not even be considered where there is applicable law on the
subject that would preclude its use. I am sure you are aware that the use
of these agreements has already been determined by the Supreme Court in
1993 to be consistent with the National Labor Relations Act (Building and
Construction Trades Council of the Metropolitan District v. Associated
Builders & Contractors of Massachusetts/Rhode Island, Inc., et al., 507
U.S. 218, 113 S. Ct. 1190 (1993)).

It is also made clear by the June 1997 Memorandum that it addresses only a
project that exceeds $5 million--that is, a "large and significant
project." In the case of our Department, the relevant direct construction
contracting involves a very small subset of the annual budget--I am told
in fact that, over the past five years, only about one contract a year
meets the dollar threshold. The vast proportion of DOT direct
construction contracts are for projects below$5 million--and therefore
outside the purview of the President's Memorandum--and would appear to be
prime candidates for small business bids.

Most important and most clearly set out in the President's Memorandum is
that project labor agreements should only be employed "where a project
labor agreement will advance the Government's procurement interest in
cost, efficiency, and quality and in promoting labor-management stability
as well as compliance with applicable legal requirements." I do not think
it is possible to be clearer that the agreements may be employed only
where they are in the public interest, rather than the narrower interests
of the builders, the unions, or the employees.

Secretary Slater issued his April 1998 Memorandum to carry out the
President's Memorandum and in the same spirit of encouraging consideration
of their use only on federal construction projects where they will prove
beneficial. Recognizing that an agreement can also be beneficial in the
case of a project undertaken by one of our grant recipients, the Secretary
strongly encouraged each agency head at the Department to authorize and
promote ,its use for DOT-assisted construction projects, consistent with
underlying legal authorities. As the President has stated, project labor
agreements, when used under appropriate circumstances, can achieve economy
and efficiency in federal construction contracts. We need to ensure, as
responsible managers of federal resources, that we use the variety of
techniques available for fiscally responsible management.

Another common misconce'ption is that one's belief in the efficacy of this
tool is somehow a matter of partisan politics. This is actually not the
case, as demonstrated at the state level. I need only cite the issuance by
New York Governor Pataki of an Executive Order No. 49 in February 1997
directing state agencies to consider the use of these agreements when
appropriate, and comparable action by Governor Whitman of New Jersey in
March 1994. These are very current actions by the chief executives of
large states with major construction contracting activity that can benefit
from project labor agreements.

I know the Committee's particular concern is over the potential effect of
a project labor agreement on small business construction contractors. I
hope that today's hearing will shed light, rather than heat, on this
important issue, and that it will become evident that the Secretary's
April Memorandum has not placed a new burden on small businesses--they
already have their fair share of burdens. You are aware I am sure of the
Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization at DOT and on the
strong emphasis we place on assisting small entrepreneurs. Also, I am very


conversant with and firmly committed to fulfilling Congress' recent
decision to continue providing opportunity through highway and transit
construction contracts to small, disadvantaged businesses to obtain
business opportunities. The Secretary shares that view in this important
area and would do nothing to endanger small-business prospects for
contracting opportunities.

I hope that my remarks have made clear that there is no heavy-handed
mandate at issue here. Quite the contrary. Our view is that the actual
parties to a particular construction project--the contractors, the
employees, and involved labor organizations--know best what serves their
common interests and the public interest as a result. Accordingly, the
Department does not seek to levy a mandate or general directive about the
application of project labor agreements, but instead encourages
consideration of their use where consistent with law and likely to prove
beneficial.

Ironically, the Senate has now determined that it will make the same point
I have just stressed--that there is no mandate, requirement, or coercion
to employ project labor agreements in transportation construction
contracting. You are aware I am sure that section 322 the Senate-passed
Fiscal Year 1999 DOT Appropriations Act states that DOT funds may not be
used "to compel, direct, or require" DOT "agencies to use a project labor
agreement, nor to preclude its use. Secretary Slater made certain that the
Senate leadership knew that, although it is unnecessary, we have no
objection to the provision as it was revised from the introduced measure.

In conclusion, Mr. Chairman, the Secretary strongly believes that all
useful tools should be brought to bear to make government programs as
beneficial and cost-effective as possible--and that the appropriate use of
project labor agreements is one such tool. The spirit of the National
Performance Review and of "reinventing government" is to find the methods
that work best and to employ them on behalf of the customer and, I might
add, the taxpayer. We have no doubt that project labor agreements, which
have a long history in government contracting of judicious application on
a case-by-case basis, contribute to more efficient, higher quality
transportation construction projects.

Mr. Chairman, this completes my prepared statement. I would be pleased to
respond to any questions you or other Committee Members may have.
