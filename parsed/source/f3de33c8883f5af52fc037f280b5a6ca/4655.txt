MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:          Bruce Reed
               Elena Kagan

RE:            DPC Weekly Report




         1. Welfare Reform: Arizona Privatization Waiver -- This week, USDA requested
more infonnation from the state of Arizona on its privatization waiver request, meeting the
welfare law deadline that it must approve, deny, or request more infonnation on waiver requests
within 60 days. Arizona wants to privatize food stamp and Medicaid operations in 13% of the
state, as well as the authority to expand privatization state-wide in two years. USDA expects to
take final action on the request after Congress adjourns. During the fight over Texas's proposal
to privatize state-wide, we indicated some openness to a good demonstration affecting only part .
ofa state.

        2. Welfare: New Maryland Study on Recipients Leaving the Rolls -- A new study of
Maryland's welfare reform program found that 54 percent of former recipients were working
within three months of leaving the rolls. By the sixth month, 17 percent of recipients had
returned to the rolls. The study's author, Professor Catherine Born ·of the University of
Maryland, did not account for the remaining recipients, but plans to try to do so for a follow-up
report to be released in January. This interim report tracked five percent of the state's caseload
for six months after they left the rolls.

        Not surprisingly, .welfare recipients with recent work experience were more likely to be
working once they left the rolls (66 percent vs. 54 percent) and those welfare recipients with
younger children were more likely to return to the rolls. Notably, the study found no increase
in foster care caseloads as a result of welfare reform. This research project will track this sample
of recipients for two years.

       3. Welfare: New Caseload Numbers --Welfare caseloads have dropped another 250,000 to
just below 10.5 million -- a 1.7 million decline since last August and a 26 percent decline since
                                                             Hex-Dump Conversion
January 1993.    We are currently considering how to release these numbers, which are from
June.

        4. Welfare: October 1st -- As you know, there was a great deal of media interest in the
start the new fiscal year on October 1st. We won't have end-of-year data on state work
programs until mid-November, however, and because of staggered TANF start dates, only
two-thirds of states are required to report what will be three months or less of data (from
7/1/97-9/30/97). Most states expect to meet the 25 percent overall work rate, but about 20
expect to fail the 75 percent rate for two parent families. We will have the option of fining them
up to 5 percent of their block grant or letting them enter into correction action plans.

        On October 1st, the National Directory of New Hires went on-line, enabling states to
locate parents who owe child support and live in different states. HHS estimates that the
directory will help collect $6 billion more in child support over the next ten years. October 1st
also marks the deadline for states to have in place comprehensive state-wide child support
computer systems, as required by the Family Support Act. Seventeen states, including
California, are expected to fail. As you know we will be working with the House Ways and
Means Committee to develop a legislative proposal which will enable us to penalize these states
without withholding all federal child support funds. In addition, HHS this week released
several grants authorized by the welfare reform law. One provides $50 million for programs to
promote abstinence; another provides $10 million to promote access and visitation of children by
their non-custodial parents. As you may know, many fathers rights groups believe increased
father involvement will not only be good for children but will make fathers more likely to pay
child support.

         5. Immigration: Commission" Americanization" Proposal- The U.S. Commission
on Immigration Reform released its final report to Congress on Tuesday. In its report, the
Commission calls for a new "Americanization Movement" -- a process to help immigrants
integrate and become full participants in our national community. The Commission defines
"Americanization" as the cultivation of a shared commitment to the American values ofliberty,
democracy, and equal opportunity. The Americanization proposal centers around three core
elements: education, orientation, and naturalization. First, the Commission calls for a renewed
commitment to the education of immigrant children, with a focus on English language
acquisition. Second, it recommends that the federal govemment provide orientation materials to
"legal immigrants when they arrive as well as modest grants to states to create information
clearinghouses oflocal resources available to immigrants. Third, the Commission proposes
changes to the naturalization process (e.g., enhancing automation, improving civics and English
tests, revising the naturalization oath) to enhance its credibility while maintaining an appropriate
level of formality and ceremony.
