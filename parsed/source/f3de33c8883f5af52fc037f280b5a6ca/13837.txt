TEXT:
I am updating the form letter on securities litigation reform, and I understand
from Jennifer Dudley that you must clear off on this language. This letter is
based on an updated letter provided by Bruce Lindsey's office.
Thank you.

Thank you for your advice on the subject of securities litigation
reform.
My Administration fully supports securities litigation reform to
end frivolous lawsuits and to ensure that investors receive the
best possible information by reducing the litigation risk to
companies making forward-looking statements.
As you probably know, I vetoed the securities litigation reform
bill Congress sent to me. However, as I said in my veto message
to Congress, I supported the need for reform and wanted one
small, but important, change to the pleading rules to guarantee
genuinely meritorious suits their day in court. The objections
do not signal my opposition to private securities litigation
reform, but reinforce my position for advocating the strongest
and fairest possible reform.
Today we are in the middle of a critical debate about the role
government plays in our society. My Administration continues to
pursue what we were sent here to do -- to change the direction of
the nation -- and we're making progress on that goal every day.
As we work together to strengthen our economy and honor our
values and our future, I encourage you to help ensure that we
continue to lead America into the twenty-first century.
