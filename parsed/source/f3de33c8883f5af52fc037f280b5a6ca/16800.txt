DRAFT

                                      Septembert X, 1997

Patrick J. Kennedy
Member of Congress
1505 Longworth Office Building
U.S. House of Representatives
Washington, D.C. 20515

Dear Congressman Kennedy:

Thank you for writing to the President on matters relating to the juvenile justice system and race.
 Please forgive the delay in response.

As you know, the President opposed the passage ofH.R. 3 because it fails to provide a
comprehensive plan to crack down on youth and gang violence-- including failing to provide
targeted resources for after school programs to keep young people safe and off the streets.

While the Administration's Anti-Gang and Youth Violence Act of 1997 does expand the
circumstances in which federal prosecutors can transfer juvenile offenders to adult criminal
court, the change is designed to ensure that these decisions are made fairly and expeditiously, and
that they appropriately reflect the dangers that some juveniles pose to their communities. It
should be noted that in most cases, juveniles charged as adults may petition the court to be tried
as juveniles.

I also wanted to thank you for sharing your proposals to address the issue of racial disparities
within the juvenile justice system. As you know, on June 14th, the President announced that he
was initiating a year-long dialogue on race with the American people. To this end, he appointed
a seven-member commission to help educate Americans about the facts surrounding issues of
race, to encourage leadership at all levels to help breach racial divides, and to recommend
concrete solutions to our problems. The commission began its meetings in July, and I have
shared your proposal with the White House staff members working with them on the race
initiative.

Again, thank you for contacting the President on these very important matters.


                                      Sincerely,



                                      Bruce N. Reed
                                      Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy

                                      August X, 1997


The Honorable Barbara B. Kennelly
United States House of Representatives
Washington, D.C. 20515

Dear Congresswoman Kennelly:

      Thank you for your letter to the President in support of his efforts to reduce juvenile
crime. Please forgive the delay in response.

        President Clinton believes we must all take responsibility to protect our children from
violent crime, including crime committed by other young people, in order to give them the safest,
most secure future possible.

        As you know, the President's Anti-Gang and Youth Violence Strategy contains a
balanced approach to combat youth violence by combining tough punishments for gangs and
guns with smart prevention and intervention programs. The President opposed H.R. 3, the
House-passed juvenile crime bill, because it failed to address the juvenile crime problem in a
comprehensive manner. The President's proposed legislation recognizes the need to crack down
on some of the most dangerous juvenile offenders, and contains new tools for prosecutors to
accomplish this goal. However, the President's balanced strategy also provides funding for
after-school programs and an at-risk youth initiative, to make sure young people are given
positive a\ternatives to gangs and drugs.

       Again, thank you for writing to the President. Your support is important to him and I
know he appreciates hearing about the steps your constituents are taking to address the serious
problem of juvenile crime.


                                      Sincerely,



                                     Bruce Reed
                                     Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy
