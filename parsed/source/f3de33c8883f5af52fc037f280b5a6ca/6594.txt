TEXT:
I spoke with Assistant Attorney General Colgate about the conversation
between the AG and the Commissioner on the placement of the shared service
function on the Booz INS organizational chart. He said that the
Commissioner expressed concern to the AG that splitting shared services
(i.e., personnel, recordkeeping construction) and placing them within the
operating areas of services and enforcement would lead to duplication and
under funding of these important functions as well as weakening the glue
that holds the agency together.

I explained to Colgate that we agreed the shared services operation was an
important function and it was never our intention to establish two
separate support functions -- one within each operational component.
Rather, we believed that shared services (functions that serve the entire
agency or which can be done more efficiently or cost effectively on a
centralized basis) should be provided centrally.   Our recommendation for
its placement off the Commissioner -- as a staff function similar to
finance, budget and strategic planning -- was for the optics created by
having ,services and enforcement represented as the preeminent focus within
a restructured INS.   Colgate agreed that this was essen'tially a matter of
function over substance. Colgate called the Commissioner and tried to
make this pitch.   He called me back and said that he was unsuccessful and
recommended that Elana/Michael make a call to Doris to explain the DPC/OMB
rationale.

Colgate understood our position completely and had no objection to it. He
also indicated in confidence that the AG would not fallon her sword on
this issue.

Michael:  Following our meeting on the Hill, Elana suggested that both of
you should talk to Doris on this issue.
