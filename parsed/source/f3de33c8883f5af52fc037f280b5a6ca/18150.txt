Subject:         Activities of President's Ad~isory Board on Race

 In order to insure the most effective coordination of our activities, we
 have scheduled a meeting on Tuesday, December 16, from 10:30 a.m. to 11:30
 a.m., in Room 180 OEOB, to discuss future activities of the President's
 Advisory Board on Race. We will outline the proposed schedule of Advisory
.Board meetings, as well as outreach activities to the corporate community,
 the faith community, and the education community in which Board members.
 are involved, and we will seek your suggestions and ideas on all of these
activities.   I hope each office will designate at least one representative
 to attend.

We are extremely grateful for the cooperation we have received from all
White House offices.  I hope that by reviewing with you our plans well in
advance and obtaining your input at an early stage, we can further
strengthen cooperation among all of us.  Thanks.
