GOP Split Over Moral Agenda

 By RON FOURNIER

WASHINGTON (AP) - Fueling the party's ideological divide, a group of GOP
moderates is warning that a narrowly drawn moral agenda could cost
Republicans control of the House in November.

The Republican Leadership Council recently commissioned a poll of voters in
77 competitive House districts, concluding that undecided voters are likely
to vote Democratic if Republicans appear too extreme.

"The center of the electorate is both the problem and the opportunity for
the Republican Party, " wrote pollster Kieran Mahoney. She suggested the
GOP focus on its popular education and economic plans - not social issues
such as homosexuality, abortion and pornography.

The poll was being released at a news conference today - 100 days before
Election Day. It follows the Republican National Committee's weekend
meeting in New York, which showcased vocal moderate leaders who are
sometimes at odds with more conservative Republicans.

New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani told RNC members Friday to set aside
"philosophical bickering" and rally behind any Republican who can win the
presidency - even if it means sacrificing "one principle here or one
principle there."

He was given a warm reception, although several RNC members said
conservatives will not sacrifice their principles on issues such as
abortion, gay rights and gun control.

Moderate GOP Govs. George Pataki of New York and Christie Whitman of New
Jersey also addressed the group.

The poll of 800 likely voters was conducted July 17-20 in congressional


districts where the Republican candidate for Congress in 1996 won or loss
the district by a margin of 10 percentage points or less. It had a margin
of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.

About 12 percent of those surveyed said they were interested primarily in
moral issues. The economy, education and health care drew higher numbers.

"If the Republican Party decides to focus on an issue cluster that
contains only 12 percent of the voters, while ignoring over 87 percent of
the electorate, the Republican Party will lose control of the House and
fail to maximize opportunities in the United States Senate and
gubernatorial contests," pollster Mahoney wrote.

Among voters who thought the party was most interested in moral issues, the
GOP was 27.8 percent favorable and 47.6 percent unfavorable.

On the other hand, conservative leaders argue that in November's election,
which will draw relatively few voters, it is most important to energize
core supporters. The polls shows that the GOP base is intact; 86.6 percent
of traditional Republicans plans to voter for their party's candidates.

Registered Republicans were asked if they favor or oppose "excluding
homosexuals from leadership positions in the Republican Party because they
are gay."  Sixty-one percent said they opposed it.

Republican leaders, including Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, have said
recently that homosexuality is a sin.

with a large number of undecided voters up for grabs, respondents who plan
to split their tickets among Democrats and Republicans - along with voters
who call themselves moderates or independents - tended to slightly favor
Democrats in the poll.
