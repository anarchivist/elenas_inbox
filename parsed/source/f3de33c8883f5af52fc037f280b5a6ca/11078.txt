TEXT:
Representative George Miller of California has written the President
asking him to provide a message for "National Talking With Kids Awareness
Week" -- the week of March 14. This apparently is a national campaign
being promoted by Children Now and the Kaiser Family Foundation to
encourage parents and caregivers to talk sooner and more often with their
children about such tough issues as sex, AIDS, violence, drugs, and
alcohol, and they would like the President to help raise public awareness
of the campaign.

Do you recommend that we provide a message for this campaign, or do you
think it's something we should turn down on the grounds that some parents
would resent being told by the President when and how to discuss sensitive
issues w/their children? Thanks for your help!
