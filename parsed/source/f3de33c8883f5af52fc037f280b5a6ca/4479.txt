TEXT:
The Univ of Arkansas at Little Rock recently completed a study on the
Little Rock School District.

Bill Kincaid asked me to check and see whether you were aware of this
study - and whether we needed to do a Q&A on the study for tomorrow's
event.  I don't have a copy of the report -- but I am faxing the cover
letter to Carolyn Huber that describes the contents of the study.
