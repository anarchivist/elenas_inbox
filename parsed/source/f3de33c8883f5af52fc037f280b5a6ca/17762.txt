        THE PRESIDENT ANNOUNCES NEW WELFARE TO WORK COMMITMENTS
                              November 17, 1997


         Today, President Clinton announced that in six months over 2,500 companies have pledged to hire
new workers from the welfare rolls, far surpassing the goals set May 20th when the Welfare to Work
Partnership was launched at the White House. The President traveled today to Wichita, Kansas to
dedicate a new welfare to work facility at one of the Partnership's founding members, Cessna Aircraft
Company, and to praise a new campaign by the u.s. Chamber of Commerce to enlist every local chamber
of commerce in the welfare to work effort. The President also unveiled new work-focussed welfare
reform rules which will ensure state and local governments are accountable for results and have the
flexibility to use federal resources most effectively. [He also announced that welfare caseloads have
continued their dramatic decline, falling _ months in a row           to _ _,         less than when he
became President and _ _ less than when he signed welfare reform into law.]

The President Announces Private Sectors Commitments have Grown from 100 to 2,500
        On May 20th, 100 company executives joined the President at the White House to launch the
Welfare to Work Partnership and pledged to enlist 1,000 companies within six months. Today, the
President announced that over 2,500 companies have joined the Partnership and pledged to hire welfare
recipients without displacing current employees.

The President Dedicates New State-of-the-Art Welfare to Work Facilities at Cessna
       Today, the President dedicated Cessna Aircraft Company's new state of the art facilities where
welfare recipients will be trained for skilled jobs at Cessna. The new _ _ square foot facility will
allow Cessna, one of the founding members of the Partnership, to double its welfare to work program and
provide on-site child care for its trainees. The President hailed Cessna's model program for providing
individualized training, a salary with health benefits, child care, and a guaranteed job upon completion of
the program. Over 200 graduates of the program are now working at Cessna, at an average wage of
$_ _. The new facility was built by the city of Wichita using $_ _ in loan guarantees from the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development, and is part of a successful urban revitalization effort.
Today, the President was joined in the dedication ceremony by Cessna CEO Russell W. Meyer, Jr. and
two program graduates --               , a _ _ [year] graduate who is now a program supervisor, and - - -
who just graduated in _ _ [year].

The President Praises New U.S. Chamber of Commerce Welfare to Work Campaign
        Today, the President praised the u.s. Chamber ofCornmerce's new campaign to enlist every local
chamber of commerce in the welfare to work effort. u.s. Chamber of Commerce President Tom
Donahue appeared with the President today to urge the hundreds of thousands of companies who belong
to over 3,000 chambers of commerce nationwide to join the Welfare to Work Partnership and look to
welfare recipients to fill critical labor shortages.                                      .

President Unveils New Results-Focussed Welfare to Work Rules
       The President today unveiled new federal welfare reform rules which underscore his cornmitment
to work and welfare reform. The rules provide additional guidance to states operating the Temporary
Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) welfare reform program and to states and localities receiving
Welfare to Work (WtW) grants enacted in the Balanced Budget Act.
·     ,.                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion
        The new rules uphold the law's strong emphasis on work by underscoring the importance of the
law's work participation rates. Under the T ANF program enacted last year, states must put an increasing
percentage of adults to work each year (25 percent of all families must work in fiscal year 1997 rising to
50 percent in 2002; 75 percent of two parent families must work in 1997, rising to 90 percent in 1999).
The rules announced today provide a clear and firm structure of penalties for those states that do not meet
these critical work rules. States that fail the work participation rates will be assessed penalties based on
degree of noncompliance. They will then be given an opportunity to correct the violation -- and if they
do not make substantial progress, then they will receive a financial penalty (up to 5 percent of their
welfare block grant). By law, states that are penalized must expend more of their own funds to make up
the penalty amount, to ensure that families are not short-changed.

        The new welfare rules do recognize that some welfare recipients may, at a given time, be unable to
join the work force. For example, the rules allow states to grant temporary waivers from the work rules
for victims of domestic violence who are unable at that point to work, but only if they provide services to
help those individuals prepare for work and become self-sufficient. States that fail the work participation
rates because they grant such good cause domestic violence waivers will be eligible for reasonable cause
exceptions from the penalties.

       The new welfare rules ensure that states and localities have the flexibility they need to design
welfare to work initiatives that meet individual needs and local conditions. Both the TANF and Welfare
to Work rules provide tremendous flexibility to state and local governments to decide what programs and
services will best help families become self-sufficient.

       Both the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) regulations (issued by the Department
of Health and Human Services) and the Welfare to Work (WtW) regulations (issued by the Department of
Labor) will be published in the Federal Register this week for 60 days of public comment.

[The President Announces that Welfare Caseloads Continue their Dramatic Decline
        President Clinton announced today that welfare caseloads have declined another _ _ , bringing
the total reduction to more than _ million since he became President, a drop of_ percent. In the_
 from August 1996 when he signed welfare reform into law through _ _ (the numbers released today),
welfare rolls have declined by _ million to just under _ million. A total of       out of 50 states have
lowered their welfare rolls --   states by 40 percent or more.

        The new caseload numbers demonstrate the success of the welfare reform law. This           million
caseload decline is the largest in history. Today, welfare caseloads, which fell by a record 1.9 million in
the President's first three-and-a-halfyears in office, have dropped by 2 (?) million more in the one year
after signing the law (??)]
