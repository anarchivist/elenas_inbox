TEXT:
Question:  OMB told me that they are assuming that the tobacco tax assumed
in the budget stops at $1.10 real in 2003 (it only increases for inflation
afterward). We did not assume that it continues to rise to $1.50?

Also, do you have the 10 and 25 year revenue (analogous to the $65 billion
over 5 years)?
Chris and Bruce are trying to figure out ways to make the governors
happier with their cut.

Thanks!
