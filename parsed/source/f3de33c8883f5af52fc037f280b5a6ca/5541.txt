TEXT:
We made a pretty specific list of the $107 million programs. Mary will
send it you. There are a lot that could be cut, but it sounds substantial
as a ~100 million program. We phased in ADR at 13 million for the first
year. Mary says the Ed survey has not been approved by OMB, they came up
with it for us. Should we lower the dollar figure in the memo and take it
out?
