TEXT:
Christa and I talked today, and discussed some ideas on how she can be
best utilized. One thing we discussed, which makes great sense to me, is
for her to draft all DPC scheduling requests under your name.  I believe
this is important, since she is attending the short-term scheduling
meetings where she must defend our proposals.

If you agree,   I will let the staff know and ask Christa to begin with this
task.
