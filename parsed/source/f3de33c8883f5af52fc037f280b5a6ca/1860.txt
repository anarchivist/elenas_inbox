TEXT:
Hi Elena,

Following is the draft response for this letter which Bob Shireman in NEC
has cleared.  Phil Caplan sent you and Mike Cohen copies of the incoming
(Per Mike, this is Bob Shireman's issue). Can you please let me know as
soon as possible if this draft is okay with you? The letter is for the
President's signature. Thanks.

DRAFT:


Thank you so much for your recent letter.  I appreciate the support of
 the 23 presidents in the California State University System
and of the American Council on Education (ACE) for my Administration's
national education agenda.

As I said in my speech earlier this year to members of the ACE, we
must work hard to craft a bipartisan balanced budget that reflects
our values and paves the way to a better future.  Your endorsement
is an important element in enabling us to expand educational oppor-
tunities through the Hope Scholarship tax cut, the college tax
deduction, and Pell Grant and work-study increases.

Thank you for standing with us.  I look forward to continuing our
work together as we build new opportunities for future generations
and help change America for the better.
