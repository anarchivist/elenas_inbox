. TEXT:
  I am meeting a couple of times a week with OPM and NPR to ensure that the
  implementation process runs smoothly. So far, so good.   However, a couple
  of questions were raised today that I told them I'd ask you both and then
  pass on the answers.

1}      At the point agencies assess their success, can they count
welfare recipients hired before March 8, 1997 or must they count from
March 8 on?

2}      The primary goal of agency plans will be to directly hire welfare
recipients. Can agencies also encourage government contractors to hire
welfare recipients, and then count those recipients when reporting
progress? This is an issue particularly relevant to NASA and similar high
tech/science-based agencies that contract out a tremendous amount of work
and have few in-house entry level jobs. NPR and OMB say doing so is legal
and there is precedent for it. The only question is whether we want
agencies to include this option or not.

 3}         Same question for federal grantees.

 4}      The Postal service is a quasi-governmental agency so is not
 covered under this directive. Do we want to include them? (We
 should--lots of entry-level jobs.)  NPR and OPM think that if we want to
 include the postal service-, one of you (Bruce or Elena) should call
 Runyon directly.

5}      Are we, at the DPC, going to hire a welfare recipient?  (This
question came up at today's earlier White House meeting, not at the
OPM/NPR meeting.)
