TEXT:
FYI, Eli Segal called me today regarding his proposed Welfare to Work
conference. He would like to move ahead with plans to do this in St.
Louis on August 14 and needs to lock in on a date soon.

I told him that it would realistically be at least a week before we could
give him an answer. He believes that he needs to move ahead with plans
and is going to start discussions with the Mayor of St. Louis this week on
the possibility of doing a conference in St. Louis on August 14.   He is
going to describe it as a "Welfare to Work Foundation" event -- not a
Presidential event.

I asked that he hold off as long as possible before committing to the 14th
in case this does not work for the President. He will let me know before
he makes committments, but is not going to be able to wait long.

He said that if the President cannot do the St. Louis event, that he could
work to create another event in DC around the anniversary the President
could be involved in. Again, I reiterated our interest in making St.
Louis work and asked that he hold off before committing to a date.

Please let me know your thoughts on this and if you hear from Eli, too.
