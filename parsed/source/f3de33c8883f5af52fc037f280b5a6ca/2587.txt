 When I couldn't get Gips, I went to Kohlenberger. This was his response.
 It seems a little on the soft side. What do you think?

 Bill,
            I think you need an answer more on the lines of this:

 While we are working to connect all of our classrooms to the Internet by
 the year 2000, we must also protect our children from inappropriate
 material on the Internet while preserving their freedom of expression.
 The Internet can be a great tool for learning.   But this expanded ability
 to communicate also reaches to places we don't want our children to go.
 While the Justice Department is defending the Communications Decency Act
 which limits exposure of children to on-line "indecent" material, I also
 support industry efforts to develop and market technology, including
 Internet screening software, that will give parents and teachers the
 ultimate control over what material is available to children over the
 Internet.

 Below is a draft Q&A that we hope to share with the POTUS this afternoon.
 Please review and us know if you are comfortable with this.

 Thanks


 Question:       Internet Access. With the emphasis on connecting classrooms to
 the Internet, how can our public school children be protected rom the
 harmful aspects of the Internet?

 Answer: I am committed to ensuring that our children do not get
 exposed to indecent material and will take all constitutional measures to
 make sure that they dono,t.  I signed the Communications Decency Act and
 we are currently defending that law in court.  If the Act is invalidated,
 I will carefully consider alternative routes to the same goal. We are
 also exploring a V-chip for the Internet that will help parents screen out
 this kind of material.
