TEXT:
I just talked to Tom Miller who will call Christine Greggiore and urge a
conf call tomorrow with the AGs to see if they will join us on a deal that
will "get this done". He was, he was quick to remind me, one of the four
AGs who did not sign the AGs "no strings attached" letter.  He thinks 15%
is the bare minimum.  I told him he had friends here but needed to work
his colleagues . .
