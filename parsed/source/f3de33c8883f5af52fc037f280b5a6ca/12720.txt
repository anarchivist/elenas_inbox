TEXT:
I'm still waiting to hear if there is anything new out there in terms of
announcements, but I wanted to run what I have by you.  Please let us know
what you would like us to push at today's message meeting.

1.   Release Regulations to Safeguard Safety of the Blood Supply
         -will be ready for early June
         -submitting scheduling proposal today

2.  Profiling Directive
        - I understand that this could be ready for early June, and that
there has been talk about issuing it around the June 9th DOJ Conference on
Police Integrity.   (NOTE: This is the day POTUS is scheduled to do the
NIH/Bumpers Building Dedication.)

3.  Release DoEd's Guide to Ending Social Promotion
        -June
        -Is this still something we would want to do as a stand-alone
Presidential event?

4.   Release DoEd's Report on School Choice
         -June

5. Announce Federal Government's Model plan for Employment of People with
Disabilities
        -There is a possibility this will be announced as part of the
Mental Health Conference.
        If not, we could do this in July around the ADA anniversary.

6. Paternity Numbers
         -Cynthia and Andrea just told me we have some good paternity
numbers.   Maybe something around Father's Day ... maybe VP event?
