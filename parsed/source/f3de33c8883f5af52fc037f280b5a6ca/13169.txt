TEXT:
We are informed by DOT that the following compromise language has
been agreed to in the course of DOT (Leiber's) discussions with
your office and DOJ:
"Delete the provision which would replace the current Amtrak Board
of Directors with a new Board. The current Board has proved
capable fo directing Amtrak during these sensitive times.   (The
Administration, however, supports removing existing restrictions
on the President's authority to appoint future members of Amtrak's
Board and requiring that such appoitnees be confirmed by the
Senate.)"
If this language is acceptable to you, we will plug it into the
SAP (it is likely that the Amtrak bill will be on the floor next
week. )
Thanks for your help.
