Potential weekly inserts:

"On Sunday the FBI will release preliminary data on crimes reported in
1996. The data show that the number of serious crimes reported in the
U.S. are down for the fifth year in a row and 3 percent overall from
1995. More importantly, the data indicate that this decline was fueled by
a 7 percent drop in the number of violent crimes -- including an 11 percent
 drop in the number of murders.

"On Friday the Department of Justice's COPS Office will announce $33
million in grants to develop Regional Community Policing Institutes at 35
sites in 29 states. These institutes will offer training in specialty
areas, including -- problem-solving, community-based partnerships,
technology, and community policing in rural, urban and suburban settings.
The announcement will be made in Boston, where community policing has been
credited with helping cut the crime rate to its lowest level in nearly 3
decades."
