              TEXT:
              1. NYT may run a listeria story tomorrow.    USDA press input to the story
              e-mailed below.

              2.    Sally may bring up 2 things we've worked on a bit w/NEC: a. USDA is
              testifying tomorrow morning on ago concentration issues which is
              especially relevant to the pork price crisis. Rather than testify about
              recommendations, USDA will give a statistical report, saving announcements
              for the POTUS/Podesta. Also, pork prices have improved. b. NEC wants to
              do a deputies meeting on financial consumer issues, it involves a little
              of Chris' health stuff, and some consumer moves we've supported in FTC/FCC.

              Subject: NYT recall story

              M. Burros is working on story about the increase in listeria-related
              recalls.

              Kaye Wachsmuth talked to her this afternoon and pointed out that PulseNet
              has enabled us to better identify related illnesses and connect them to
              specific product. She also said these recalls are causing us to
              re-evaluate our listeria testing effort to ensure that we are doing all we
'~




     can.
