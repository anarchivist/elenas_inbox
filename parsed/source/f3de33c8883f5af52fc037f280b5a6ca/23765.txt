TEXT:
I know that everyone is overwhelmed with just the day-to-day so I hate to
ask -- but ..... we would really like to highlight any executive actions
that you may be aware of, have, would like a reason to push ----etc.
etc.   John has become singularly focused on this issue and I told him I
would follow-up.    I know that a number of these are highlighted in the
reports you provided me earlier last month --- my question is are any of
those ripe for pushing out this month --- and if they are, what are your
recommendations for timing --
