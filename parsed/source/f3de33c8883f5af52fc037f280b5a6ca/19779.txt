TEXT:
The Indian Health Service has received inquiries from McCain's, Inouye's,
and Conrad's staffs regarding our position on the Native Americ:;an
provisions in the McCain bill related to public health (not to the Gorton
amendment).   We had some staff level policy changes (which we haven't sent
in yet), but with those changes, HHS, DOJ, OMB, and Interior were all fine
wi th the provis'ions in the McCain bill.
