Hefley upset by order on gays

By Marilyn Robinson
Denver Post Staff Writer
     u.S. Rep. Joel Hefley, a Colorado Springs Republican, introduced
  legislation on Wednesday to neutralize, at least in part, an executive
order
  issued last month by President Clinton that Hefley says gives homosexuals
  special status as a protected class throughout the federal government.
     Hefley announced in a news release the amendment to the 1999 Treasury-
  Postal Appropriations bill. The amendment would prevent any of the funds
  appropriated in the bill to be used "to implement, administer or
enforce"    the
  executive order.
     It doesn't affect other appropriations.
     The order, signed by the president on May 28, protects homosexual
federal
  workers from job discrimination.
     "Bill Clinton has added a new category to the nation's civil rights
  laws, " Hefley said. "With this action, the president effectively
established
  institutional quotas for homosexual employees.' ,
     His amendment would "neutralize this order, " Hefley announced.
     "Apparently Bill Clinton has decided to rule by executive order, ' ,
Hefley
  said in the release. "Last time I checked, amending federal law was
Congress'
  job, and not the role of the executive branch. This is not the time to
carve
  out additional protected classes of people. Current law is sufficient to
  protect against discrimination."
     A White House spokeswoman called the amendment a continuation of
comments
  made recently by Sen .. Trent Lott, R-Miss.
     "This is about discrimination, " said Nanda Chitre, the spokeswoman.
"If
  this is what the Republicans want to focus on, we're willing to engage on
this
  issue because we are anti-discrimination. ' ,
     Ken Alford, Hefley's Democratic opponent in the 5th Congressional
District
  this November, supported the president.
     "I would have to support something that prevents discrimination, even
for
  sexual orientation, " Alford said.
     "I doubt that it's an attempt to overthrow the civil rights laws."
     "Individuals should not be denied a job on the basis of something that
has
  no relationship to their ability to perform their work, " Clinton said in
a


 statement accompanying the order.
     Gay and lesbian political activists heralded the move for adding sexual
 orientation to the list of categories for which discrimination is
illegal. The
 others are race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disabilities and
age.
     Clinton's order amended the 1979 executive order signed by President
 Nixon, according to Hefley's press aide, Leigh LaMora. The effect of the
order
 extends beyond just federal workers, LaMora said.
      "It does affect non-federal employees because it becomes a condition
of
 receiving federal grants, " she said.
     Chitre disagreed.
     "The order did not create any new rights, " she said. "It does not
apply
 to federal contractors. ' ,
     The order merely formalizes an administration policy that has been in
 effect since 1993, Chitre said.
