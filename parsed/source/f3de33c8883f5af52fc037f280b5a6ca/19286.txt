TEXT:
I want to give you all a heads-up about a rapidly moving situation in
California that is closely related to the Unz/bilingual ed issue we are
dealing with, and in which the Education Department will likely become
publicly involved in the next several days--unless we decide to stop it.
(I'm not recommending that we intervene--I just want to make sure everyone
is aware of this, and that there be ample time to slow things down if
necessary)

1. Last year, at Pete Wilson's insistence, the CA legislature passed    a
                                                                       new
statewide testing program that requires all local school districts in the
state to administer the same battery of tests to its students. The
testing occurs in a number of grade levels and subject areas.

2. Districts are required to give the tests, and the state pays for it.
The tests have to be administered this Spring, and districts have to sign
up to give the test within the next week or so (i don't have the exact
deadline handy.)

3. The law requires that all kids, including LEP kids who have been in
school for at least a year, take the tests in English, regardless of their
English language proficiency. The results are reported publicly for every
school district--which means that school districts with large proportions
of LEP kids will look worse on the tests than one might otherwise predict,
because there will be scores from a lot of kids who couldn't even read the
test questions.

4. Big city school districts with lots of LEP kids (LA, San Diego, San
Francisco, etc.) are up in arms.  Initially, a number said they would
refuse to participate, though all but San Francisco have now signed up.
SF either has or will soon file a civil rights complaint with ED on this
issue.

5.  In the midst of the state/local power struggle over this, the CA Board
of Education adopted a policy that required local districts to provide an
assurance that they would participate in the tests as a condition for
receiving $ under the federal education technology program. The CA
,

Department of education adminsters this program.  Subsequently, the board
decided that it would withhold all federal education $ from districts that
don't participate in the test.

6. The Council of Great City Schools, the DC based group that represents
a number of the big districts in CA (and elsewhere) protested this action
to the Education Department--which is looking into the legality of the
state's move.

7.  There is a recommendation bubbling up within ED to Riley that would
tell CA that they can't use federal $ as a club to force implementation of
its testing policy. A letter to that effect could go from ED to CA by the
end of this week.

8.   I think ED is making the right call on this--while states can add
requirements to federal programs they administer, the requirements must be
fair and reasonable.    I don't think the testing program in its current
form meets that standard. While we shouldn't interfere with CA's
state-determined testing policy, neither should we let them use our $ as
the hammer to force compliance. They've got plenty of their own $ they
can use for that purpose if they want to.
