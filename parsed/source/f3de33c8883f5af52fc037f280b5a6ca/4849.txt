                                                                         Aut0mated Records Management System
     Possible Non-Budgetary Policies re: Fathers                         Hex-Dump Conversion

     In the context ofthe race initiative, policies to promote the role of fathers in the lives of their
     children could be proposed either 1) as an appeal to the values of family that is shared across
     racial and ethnic lines in our nation; or 2) as a recognition that African American and Hispanic
     children are more likely to live without their fathers.

     1)     "Appeal to Parenting" Public Service Campaign: President and/or First Lady could
            appear in a public service campaign urging parents to be emotionally and financially
            responsible for their children. The Families, inc. film and television production
            company in New York has written to the First Lady to ask for her and the President's
            participation. The producers are reaching out to as many high profile parents, including:
            The President and the First Lady; The Vice President and Mrs. Gore; Mayor Guiliani and
            his wife; Michael Jordan and his wife; Patrick Ewing and his wife; Sylvester Stallone and
            his wife; Denzel Washington and his wife. (The proposal has not yet been vetted.)

     2)     "Don't Drop the Ball" Public Service Campaign: Work with the National Football
            League to expand nation-wide a public service announcement campaign conducted in
            Florida featuring pro-football players with their children with the slogan "Don't Drop the
            Ball: Support Your Children." (The Florida campaign was organized by the child
            support enforcement unit of the Florida State Department of Revenue. There have not
            yet been any discussions with the National Football League.)

     3)     Involve Fathers in Children's Education: Call upon schools to send report cards to
            noncustodial as well as custodial parents, to follow upon the report recently released by
            the Vice President and Secretary Riley that shows that children whose fathers are
            involved in their education do better in school. (This was one of the recommendations
            of the May 1996 conference on fathers chaired by the Vice President. We need to check
            to ensure that we have not already recommended this.)

     4)     Congressional Task Force for the Promotion of Fatherhood: The President could do a
            roundtable or other event with the bipartisan Congressional Task Force for the Promotion
            of Fatherhood, formed this June and chaired by Rep. Mike McIntyre (D-NC) and Rep.
            Joseph Pitts (R-PA). Both Speaker Gingrich and Minority Leader Gephardt are
            members. The mission of the task force is "to confront the growing problem of father
            absence, and ... seek to increase the number of children growing up with comrhitted
            fathers." The task force will promote fatherhood by arranging public awareness
            campaigns, educating Members about the problems of fatherless homes in America,
            organizing conferences and forums, and by encouraging television stations, local leaders,
            and community groups to promote fatherhood.
