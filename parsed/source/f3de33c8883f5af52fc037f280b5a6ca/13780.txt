TEXT:

I wanted to reconfirm the meeting tomorrow at 11:00am in Room 180
with the Biomaterials companies on product liability.
Attending the meeting will be:
Kelly Slone, Baxter Healthcare
Sarah Gregg, Baxter Healthcare
Anna Richo, Baxter Healthcare
Ron Groon, Wilmer, Cutler and Pickering
Jim Benson, Health Industry Manufactureres Assn.
Tara Federici, Health Industry Manufacturers Assn.
Since they have asked for this meeting, we should view it as a
listening session. They will restate their case with regard to
the status of biomaterials, appropriate legislative language that
does not protect companies who could be negligent (if there is a
way to do that), and finally, what their strategy is on the Hill
to possibly legislation again.
If any of you want additional materials, let me know.  I obviously
have written materials from these groups and would be happy to
forward to you.
