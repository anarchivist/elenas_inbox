TEXT:
I talked to Kent Markus about the nanny checks. The Oprah Bill really did
not do anything.  It merely encourages states to allow criminal history
checks to be conducted for non-criminal purposes and added a few extra
categories for the FBI to include in their database.

Up until now,  it has been entirely a matter of state law -- each state
determines how they will provide criminal history records to someone for a
non-criminal purpose. There are some minor exceptions -- people who are
employees of Federally-insured banks have criminal history background
checks conducted upon them for employment.

Last year, Justice sent to the Hill what is known as a "Compact "
agreement, in which states enter into an agreement to share criminal
history info for non-criminal purposes. We were going to do an event
around it -- bragging about how we were going to permit parents to conduct
background checks on nannies, schools on bus drivers, etc. -- but then
realized that the POTUS had made a very similar statement around Oprah a
few years back.

Kent thinks there is room to do something here -- unfortunately, nothing
by executive action -- and we would have to concede that Oprah really
hasn't done anything in the last few years, too.
