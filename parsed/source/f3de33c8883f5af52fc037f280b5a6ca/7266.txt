TEXT:
Rep. Solomon is fast-tracking a bill to prohibit federal funds from
directly or indirectly funding needle exchange.   It was our understanding
from the meeting earlier this week with Bruce, Elena, Chris et al that we
were going to stay the course on protecting the Secretary's authority,
though we would have to modify the justification.   Reps. Waxman, Morella,
and Pelosi are wanting to know what we're going to do.
Our assumption, Elena, is that OMB can prepare a SAP in opposition to HR
3712 and similar bills.  Can we threaten veto?
FYI, here's the text of the bill.  I understand it's going to sail through
rules and may hit the floor the middle of next week.

H. R. 3712
To prohibit the expenditure of Federal funds to provide or support
programs to provide individuals with hypodermic needles or syringes for
the use of illegal drugs.   .
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
April 22, 1998
Mr. SOLOMON introduced the following bill; which was referred to the
Committee on Commerce

A BILL
To prohibit the expenditure of Federal funds to provide or support
programs to provide individuals with hypodermic needles or syringes for

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States of America in Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. PROHIBITION ON USE OF FUNDS FOR HYPODERMIC NEEDLES.
Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no Federal funds shall be made
available or used to carry out or support, directly or indirectly, any
program of distributing sterile hypodermic needles or syringes for the


hypodermic injection of any illegal drug.
