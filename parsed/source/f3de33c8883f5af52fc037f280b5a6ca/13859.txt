MEMORANDUM
To:               Distribution
From:   Lyn Hogan
Date:   July 19, 1996
Re:               Q&A For Mifepristone (RU
o
-486) Hearing
please refer questions about the FDA process to Jim O'Hara,
301
o
 -443
o
-1130, at FDA Public Affairs.
PRINTER FONT 14 - POINT- COURIER
Background
PRINTER FONT 12- POINT- COURIER
Today, Friday, July 19, the FDA's Reproductive Health Drugs
Advisory Committee will consider data submitted by the Population
Council as part of a New Drug Application (NDA) for Mifepristone.
FDA routinely refers NDAs to this Advisory Committee and asks the
panel for a recommendation on the drug's safety and efficacy.
Mifepristone, commonly referred to as RU
o
-486, is an effective,
non
o
-surgical method of early abortion that has been in use since
1981. The drug was approved for use in France, Great Britain and
Sweden following extensive clinical trials that demonstrated its
safety and efficacy.
During the Bush Administration, the FDA issued an import alert
which helped ensure that mifepristone would not be available in
the United States for any purpose.
On January 22, 1993 the President issued an executive order that
directed the FDA to reassess whether mifepristone qualified for
importation.


1) What is expected to happen at today's FDA
hearing?

PRINTER FONT 12 - POINT- COURIER
Today, Friday, July 19, the FDA's Reproductive Health Drugs
Advisory Committee will consider data submitted by the U.S.
o
-based
Population Council as part of a New Drug Application (NDA) for
Mifepristone.
FDA routinely refers NDAs to this Advisory Committee and asks the
panel for a recommendation on the safety and efficacy of the
drug. Today's advisory committee is the usual next step in the
review process of the marketing application.
There will not be a decision on Mifepristone in 1996.

PRINTER FONT 14 - POINT- COURIER
2)      What official action has the President taken to
date regarding RU
o
-486?
PRINTER FONT 12 - POINT- COURIER
January 22, 1993 the President issued an executive order that:
PRINTER FONT 24 POINT COURIER
?
               -       -
        Directed the FDA to reassess
whether Mifepristone qualified
for importation under FDA's
personal use import policy;
?       Said that if the FDA concluded
Mifepristone meets the criteria
for personal use importation
exemption, Sec. Shalala should
rescind the' Import Alert 66
o
-47;
and
?       Ordered HHS to assess
initiatives to promote the
testing, licensing, and
manufacturing in the U.S. of
Mifepristone.

PRINTER FONT 14 - POINT- COURIER
3)      Prior to this hearing, what has the FDA
concluded?
PRINTER FONT 12 - POINT- COURIER
In July 1993, the FDA concluded that Mifepristone is not an
appropriate candidate for the FDA's personal use policy governing
the importation of unapproved new drugs.
In its assessment, FDA determined that the distribution of
Mifepristone is very tightly controlled in the UK, France, and
Sweden, where it is approved. The strictly regulated
administration of mifepristone in those countries suggests that
it may not be able to be safely taken without careful medical
supervision and controls.

PRINTER FONT 14 - POINT- COURIER
4)      Since the FDA ruled that this drug is not safe
for personal use, why are they continuing with


 regulatory hearings?
 PRINTER FONT 12 - POINT- COURIER
 The FDA believes the drug can be taken safely with careful
 medical supervision and controls, and therefore, in routine
 fashion, has referred the New Drug Application to this Advisory
 Committee to ask the panel for a recommendation on the safety and
 efficacy of the drug.

 PRINTER FONT 14 POINT COURIER
 5)      How can we be sure the FDA process is a fair,
 objective process?

 PRINTER FONT 24 POINT COURIER
 ?       The FDA advisory committee
 is a nonpartisan, objective
 committee comprised of
 scientists and doctors from
 outside the FDA.

 ?       The process for approving
 New Drug Applications is based
 in science and medicine.
 ?       The FDA is giving
 mifepristone a straightforward,
 honest review and will make
 their decision on the basis of
 whether this drug is safe for
 American women.
 ?       The FDA follows well
 established procedures to
 assess independently all
 published studies and data,
 including those from other
 countries.
 ?       Voting members of the FDA
 Advisory Committees are subject
 to conflict of interest laws
 and regulations governing
 federal employees and Advisory
 Committee members are required
 to have diverse professional
 education, training, and
 experience.

 6)
                -     -
         I understand that two members on the review
 panel were forced to resign because of pressure
 from    right
 D
 -to
 D
 -life groups.  Is this true?
 PRINTER FONT 12_POINT_COURIER
 This is a rumor and is inaccurate. Two members on the panel had
 conflicts of interest so were recused.

 7)      What are the pro
 D
 -life groups and pro


      o
      -choice
      groups saying about RU
      o
      -486?
      PRINTER FONT 12 - POINT- COURIER
      Pro
      o
      -Life

      On July 18, pro
      o
      -life groups held a press conference on the FDA
      hearings.
      The Family Research Council (FRC) lead by Gary Bauer issued a
      statement calling on the FDA not to approve RU
      o
      -486 due to ethical
      considerations.  In the statement, the FRC questioned the drug's
      safety and efficacy.
      At the same time, the FRC accused the FDA of attempting to
      circumvent its own approval statutes that ensure safe and
      effective drugs for the sake of the lives and safety of women and
      children.
      Other pro
      o
      -life organizations claim RU
      o
      -486 has long
      o
      -term health

      risks for mothers and children.
      Last summer a pro
      o
      -life group, Americans United For Life, and
      other abortion opponents, submitted a Citizen's Petition to the
      FDA opposing approval of mifepristone.  They did so before the
      clinical trials were over and before the extensive scientific
      data collected by the Population Council was submitted to the
      FDA.
      Pro
      o
      -Choice
      Also on July 18, women's and reproductive health advocates held a
      press conference to call for approval of mifepristone. These
      groups called mifepristone a major medical advance for women and
      described its expected positive impact on the provision of
      women's health care services in this country.
      The Feminist Majority is concerned that five Reproductive Health
      Advisory Committee members have demonstrated that they have a
      conflict of interest with the subject matter of the July 19
      meeting concerning mifepristone,  They expressed their concern in
      a July 10 letter to FDA Commissioner David Kessler.

      8)      Why does the Population Council hold the u.s.
      patent on mifepristone?
      PRINTER FONT 12_POINT_COURIER
      Roussel Uclaf, a French subsidiary of the German company, held
      two United States patents for its product, Mifepristone. On May


          16, 1994 Rouse1l Uclaf, at the encouragement of the Clinton
          Administration, donated its United States patent rights for
          mifepristone to the U.S.

          begin the necessary steps to bring Mifepristone to market in this
          country. U.S. clinical trials conducted by the Population Council
          were completed in September 1995.
