TEXT:
This message is from Mickey's assistant, Suzanne.

Although he is on "vacation" this week, Mickey asked me to let you know
that he has reviewed the final draft of the memo to the President
regarding our National Testing Initiative.  He greatly appreciates your
efforts to include the opinions he expressed on this issue.  Mickey is
satisfied that the memo incorporates these perspectives clearly and
accurately.

Mickey will not be attending today's 5:00pm education meeting -- Lynn
Cutler will be representing our office.  Thanks again for your efforts.
