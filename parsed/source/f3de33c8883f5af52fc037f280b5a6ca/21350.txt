FOOD SAFETY STUDY AND NEWS STORY

USDA has prepared data on the effectiveness of your science-based food safety program, Hazard
Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP), which shows an almost 50 percent reduction in the
frequency of salmonella in broiler chickens and an almost 40 percent reduction in the frequency
of salmonella 'in swine. These data, while preliminary, indicate that HACCP is already having a
significant impact on the safety of food American families eat. The DPC provided this data to
the Washington Post which plans to use it in a story this Sunday or Monday. We are using this
study to demonstrate the effectiveness of the Administration program and to urge Congress to
provide full funding for your Food Safety Initiative. It appears that the Agricultural
Appropriations conference will meet formally early next week, and we hope this study influences
their deliberations.
