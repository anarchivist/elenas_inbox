        I actually like it, too.   I found that Dole had pushed for a RICO Gang
specific amendment on the Senate Floor back in 1993, so I guess we will have to
be careful about what we do (since he will claim he thought up all this stuff 3
years ago) .
        For Thursday's speech we are going to announce the drug testing as a
condition for State prison grants.   Justice is supposedly drafting something for
us, and you should take a look at it. Thanks.
