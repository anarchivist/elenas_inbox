Subject:         The YMCA called and asked for a child care meeting

The YMCA has asked me for a meeting on child care and other topics. The Y
is the nation's largest provider of after-school care (which is why I'd
put them on the experts-to-talk-to-list) and their child care expert from
Chicago will be in town June 2nd and 3rd.

I have tentatively scheduled them for Tuesday, June 3rd at 10:00am.   Laura
has reserved rm 211.

We need to:
        1) Confirm the meeting date and time with them and clear in their
visitors.
        2) Invite others in the Administration--HHS/Mazur--Elena who else
did you envision inviting to the experts meetings?

        If we all agree we should have this meeting, I am hoping Laura can
follow-up from here. The contact person is Ms. Eden Fisher Durbin at
202/835-9043.   She is expecting to hear from either me or Laura.

Jose -- they'd also like to talk about their anti-gang activities.
