Hi Elena,

Following is the draft to Reddy for your edits/approval.      Thanks!

Thank you for writing to me.  I deeply appreciate the support of the
International Union of Police Associations, and I have shared your
letter with the Office of the Counsel.

My Administration remains strongly supportive of collective
bargaining for public and private sector employees. Be assured that
as we continue our review of Executive 12171, the I.U.P.A's concerns
will be taken into consideration.
