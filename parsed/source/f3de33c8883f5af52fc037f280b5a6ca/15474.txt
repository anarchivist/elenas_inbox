TEXT:
Tell them that General Counsel said that scheduling a meeting for them to
share information with Bruce was ok. But Bruce could not discuss or
report on the meeting with FCC.  They also advised us to contact
OIRA/Sally Katzen to inform her that we wanted to do a meeting and see if
someone from her office needed to sit in.

Let me know what you find out ... the Distilled Spirits folks call me daily!

Thanks for your help.
