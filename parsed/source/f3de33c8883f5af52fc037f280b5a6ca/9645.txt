TEXT:
Today's MMWR (embargoed until 5pm today) finds that more than 3000
children begin smoking regularly everyday.  While the actual number is
estimated to be 3359, the confidence inte~al is such that CDC is saying
"more than" 3000 (compared to the "nearly" 3000 that they used to say) .
This translates to 1.2 million kids each year becoming daily smokers.
What is perhaps more newsworthy is their finding that between 1988 and
1996, the number of children who became daily smokers increased by 42
percent -- if the rate of smoking had remained constant during this time,
then 1.5 million fewer children would have become regular smokers by 1996.

We are doing a weekly item on this.
