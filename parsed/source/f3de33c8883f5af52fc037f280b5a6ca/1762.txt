TEXT:
I forgot to mention that when I spoke with Janet Forsgren at OMB she said
that they needed to circulate the latest language one more time, in any
event.   It apparently had not been cleared by OMB yet.  Because I said
that we shouldn't send this up tomorrow to allow time for this meeting,
she set the response deadline for 4pm tomorrow.   You should receive a copy
of the draft with a cover letter to Gingrich this evening or tomorrow
morning.

I took the steps that I did because the time was short to handle the
situation.  I certainly hope that this is all consistent with what you
would have done.  If there is anything else that I need to do (or to undo)
please let me know.  thanks
