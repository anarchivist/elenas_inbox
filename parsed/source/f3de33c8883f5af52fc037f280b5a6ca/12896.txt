TEXT:
The Stanford Law and Policy Review has invited the President to submit an
article on education reform for its Spring 2000 issue on "Education in the
New Millienium:  Examining Alternatives to Traditional Public Education."

Ann Lewis has asked me to pull together a draft article. These are my
rough notes from a brief conversation I had with her on this article.  She
thought we could do an article around the WH millineum theme of honoring
the past and imagining the future:
   tracing the history of public schools in this country,
-- what they've meant to our democracy, and
-- key principles for how the President believes we can make them better
(in no particular order)
        standards
        accountability
        choice
        teaching basics (reading, math, smaller classes)
        early childhood education
        parental involvement
        values and character
        leaving no child behind
        21st century skills
        order and safety

I will refine these ideas and work on a more detailed outline of an
article.   I just wanted to flag this for you in case you had any thoughts
on direction/concerns before I started drafting.
