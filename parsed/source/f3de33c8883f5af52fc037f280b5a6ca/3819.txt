TEXT:
Great. I just think we should aim high. This should be one of the
defining issues for the Democratic party coming into the next elections.
On this issue we have the strategic high ground-- the country wants pretty
bold action and the longer the R's fight against it, the more they will
lose. They will likely want the next year to be a fight about cutting
taxes, we would love to have it be a fight about this.   I noticed that
Bruce's notes on the Residence meeting seem to indicate that the President
wants to make it a major part of the State of the Union.
