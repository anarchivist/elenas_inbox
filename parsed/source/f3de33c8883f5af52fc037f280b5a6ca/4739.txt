        By LAURAN NEERGAARD
        WASHINGTON (AP) - Several of President Clinton's AIDS advisers
  say they are considering resigning to protest the White House's
  refusal to spend federal money on buying clean needles for drug
  addicts.
        Some members of the Presidential Advisory Council on AIDS said
  Wednesday they also are upset the administration has not
  implemented other council recommendations.
        --I think it's fairly serious,"  Dr. Scott ,Hitt, a Los Angeles
  physician who chairs the 30-member council, said of the resignation
  threats.
        Leading the protest is council member Robert Fogel, a Chicago
  lawyer and Clinton fund-raiser. He said Wednesday he plans to seek
  a vote on the resignation at the council's next meeting in
  December.
        --Somebody up there is thinking more about politics than
  health,"  Fogel said. --If they're not going to listen to us and do
  the right thing, I for one, and a number of other people on the
  council, can't think of any more excuses or apologies to give on
  this subject."
        Fogel said ,--quite a few" members of the council would consider
,.
      resigning, mostly because of anger over needle exchanges.
            Hitt has not taken a position on the idea of resigning. But he
      has met recently with Health and Human Services Secretary Donna
      Shalala and White House aides in hopes of getting some action
      before the council issues its evaluation of national AIDS policy in
      December.
            Hitt said the report will have "some fair but harsh things to
      say." He said he had recently told Clinton in a letter there is
      "growing perception that in your second term, HIV/AIDS issues are
      not the high priority that they were"     previously.
            " I t ' s not like we're asking for pie-in-the-sky or perfection in
      this, but there are a few basic things that need to be done," Hitt
      said in a recent interview.
            An administration plan announced this spring to expand Medicaid
      coverage to HIV patients appears stalled because of budget
      concerns, Hitt said. The administration also has not lifted
      restrictions on the content of federal HIV-education materials or
      revised "scientifically discredited"      guidelines against
      HIV-infected health care workers.
            "This administration has an extraordinary record in fighting
      the HIV/AIDS epidemic, " responded Melissa Skolfield, a spokeswoman
      for Shalala, who met with concerned council members last month.
            An estimated one-third of American adults with AIDS got the
      killer virus through contaminated needles or sex with injecting
      drug users. Scientific studies indicate that programs that let
      addicts exchange used needles for fresh ones cut HIV's spread. The
      National Institutes of Health has called such needle-exchange
      programs a powerful weapon against AIDS that has been blocked by
      politics.
            Congress in 1988 outlawed federal money for needle exchanges
      until there is proof that they don't encourage drug use. That
      question "has not been answered conclusively, " said Skolfield.
            OVer 80 needle exchanges paid for by private or other nonfederal
      money already operate in the United States, but AIDS activists say
      expanding them will require federal money.
            Fogel said he was concerned because a House-approved spending
      bill would strip from Shalala the ability to approve federal money
      for needle exchanges, even if it's proved they don't encourage drug
      use.
            The Senate version of the bill retains the 1988 language and
      negotiators for both houses are trying to work out differences on
      needle exchanges and other differences in the two measures.
            "At the moment, we just have to wait to see what happens, ' ,
      Fogel said Wednesday. "If they (administration officials) lose
      that authority, or retain it but choose not to exercise it, that
      will be a factor in deciding whether to resign."
