Your note to Paul mentioned single men, but I'm assuming this would also
include non-custodial fathers. So, here's info about the President's
proposal in the welfare-to-Work reauthorization to dedicate at least 20~
of the state formula funds (about $150 M) to helping low income
non-custodial parents (primarily fathers) increase their employment and
earnings so they can better meet their responsibilities to their children
and become more involved with their children.  I think Paul is getting
back to you on some other issues, but in the meantime, I'd be glad to
discuss any of these with you (6-5573)

Paper from 1/25 event where POTUS highlighted the initiative (he also made
brief mention in State of the Union)


POTUS remarks from 1/25 (see bold sections)


Bio and remarks from Carlos Rosas, the father who introduced the President
on 1/25


Two pager on the WtW reauthorization
