TEXT:
as you might expect, the republican governors are unhappy that the r's on
the hill removed the language on minimum wage.        fyi., republican govs may
try to push nga to do a letter--and the chiles folks think he may sign
on.   i ' l l let you know how this proceeds ... but if we go to the hill with a
new position--one other than complete opposition to ways and means, we
need to let chiles know asap.
