Event Ideas

1.    Homeless Report. We could announce the results of the National Survey of
      Homeless Assistance Providers and Clients, which is the first-ever comprehensive
      survey of both clients and providers of homeless programs funded by the federal
      government. Representatives of 11,909 programs out of an estimated 40,000
      nationwide were interviewed, and 4,207 people who use the programs were
      interviewed. The survey will show that 15 percent of the homeless respondents
      have one or more children under the age of 18 with them; that 28 percent of
      respondents say they sometimes or often do not get enough to eat, compared to 12
      percent of poor Americans; and 38 percent report alcohol use problems, 26 percent
      drug use problems, and 39 percent mental health problems, and 66 percent report
      one or more of these problems. The report does not estimate the total number of
      homeless persons. The announcement of the survey could be combined with
      another push for our FY2000 budget for HUD which includes $1.125 billion for
      homeless assistance. If enacted, the $1.125 billion will be the largest ever
      appropriation to HUD for homeless assistance. (Tentatively ready in a month, likely
      sooner if we pushed for it).

2.    Food Safety Event. We can urge Congress to pass funds for our food safety
      initiative, support Harkin's bill to give USDA recall authority for tainted food, and
      announce a new rule regulating eggs to prevent salmonella. The FDA rule now at
      OMB (and its USDA companion already completed and set to go into effect in
      August) will require eggs to be kept at 40 degrees and put warning labels to
      consumers on each carton. There are at least 800,000 cases of salmonella a year
      and eggs are the leading culprit. They project a median savings of $700 million in
      reduced health care costs (OMB analysis includes a range of $87 million to $6
      billion). The cost of the rule to companies is $60 million the first year, $10 million a
      year afterwards. USDA also has a reinventing government rule clearing OMB to
      move from a regulatory approach on sanitation of meat and poultry plants to a
      performance setting standard method which companies will like and shows we are
      interested in flexible means of achieving goals. (Timing: OMB wants time but could
      be pushed to get the rule out).

3.    Nutrition Executive Order. USDA and consumer groups have urged us to establish
      an inter-agency council on nutrition. While there has been a relatively recent
      scientific recognition of the important connection between diet and disease
      prevention, (well-covered in Newsweek, Time, and elsewhere), the Administration
      has little coordination between our health and nutrition programs at HHS and
      USDA. If given a choice, the groups would prefer a WH Conference on Nutrition
      and have approached Chris Jennings about it. The Council would operate like our
      food safety council and hold public hearings, report on what we know about the
      topic, and recommend ways to link our programs at HHS and USDA better.
                                                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion


    4.     Presidential Rank Awards for Distinguished Executives. (OPM has submitted a
           scheduling request for this but we could likely tie it in with our issues, particularly,
           PBOR): The President could announce the 52 awardees from many federal agencies.
           These winners are members of the Senior Executive Service (SES) whose work has
           improved the programs and the federal departments where they work in innovative ways.
           Both the President and Vice President have announced these awards in past years.
           There is already a scheduling request in at Cabinet Affairs for April 29. OPM proposes to
           tie the announcement of the winners with highlights of the Administration's policies --
           ~, OPM's winner, Ed Flynn, helped develop the federal government's Patients Bill of
           Rights. Mr. Flynn and OPM also helped develop the federal government's long-term care
           proposal.


    5.     Native American Education Foundation. The Department of the Interior proposes
           legislation to establish a non-profit Native American Education Foundation. This
           legislation would create a foundation similar to the National Park Foundation and
           would permit the Foundation to solicit donations for the furtherance of Native
           American education for grades K-12. While there is an American Indian College
           Fund, there is no existing non-profit that focuses on this issue of K-12 education for
           Native American children. The Foundation would be able to give funds to support
           projects such as developing American Indian cultural curriculum, research on
           American Indian education, and initiating model programs to improve Native
           American education. This effort would build upon the Native American executive
           order that the President signed last August. Senator Inouye has indicated that he
           would like to sponsor this legislation, and Interior expects that they will be able to
           garner additional support. This proposal has received support from the Native
           American education community, particularly from the National Indian Education
           Association (NIEA) and the American Indian Higher Education Consortium
           (AIHEC). OMB is worried that staffing the Foundation would cost money, Interior
           is trying to reach an accommodation. (Needs to go through OMB clearance,
           possibly ready by May).

    6.     Endangered Species Act Delistings

           Bald eagle -A proposal to delist the bald eagle is set to be announced on July 4, 1999.
           Perhaps we should push to move up.

           Peregrine falcon -Similarly, the final proposal to deli sting the peregrine falcon is set to be
           announced in August 1999.

    FYI.
    Report on Health Effects of Cigars. FTC is currently working on a report to Congress that
    would recommend that health warnings should be adopted for cigars. (Ready in 6-7 weeks).
