      Subject: Draft Executive Order on Data Collection for Fed Law
      Enforcement


       AS discussed at our meeting on Wednesday, attached is a rough first
      cut for an executive order that would require federal law enforcement
      agencies to collect data on the use of race and national origin in covered
      law enforcement activities. We would like to circulate something to folks
      at Treasury late today, if possible, so please forward me your comments
      today so that they can be incorporated.   My fax number is 514-9962.
      Thanks.

fair administration of law enforcement activities throughout the
Federal establishment, without discrimination because of race,

the data collected to the Attorney General [and the Secretary of
the Treasury?] for transmittal to the President.

c. The report of the Attorney General [and the Secretary of the

techniques, the investigation and resolution of citizen complaints,
and other methods for identifying and preventing bias and
stereotyping based on race, color, or national origin in federal
law enforcement activities, including specific measures to address
any indications of bias and stereotyping in the reported statistics.

Section 2. The data collected by each department respecting covered
law enforcement activities shall, to the extent practicable, be
sufficiently detailed to permit an analysis, by department component,
of those categories of stops, requests for consent to search,
