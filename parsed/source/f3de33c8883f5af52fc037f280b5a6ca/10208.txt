TEXT:
The State Department is sending over draft q&a on TPS for Honduras and
Nicaragua by cob today.  They are also providing updated summaries
outlining the differences on the ground among the six countries (including
the Dominican Republic and Haiti) .

  At our meeting with DOJ and State last Wednesday, we put forward the idea
  of directing a presumption of extreme hardship for purposes of·suspension
  of deportation under NACARA for those from EI Salvador and Guatemala.
  This would be a way of achieving parity for Salvadorans and Guatemalans
  covered by NACARA without having to wait for legislation (though we would
  still need legislation to permit the small class of Hondurans to be
  covered by NACARA).  This would also be a way of recognizing and
. responding to the destruction done by Mitch in EI Salvador and Guatemala,
  while maintaining the differences between these two countries and
  Nicaragua and Honduras .. DOJ and INS resisted such a presumption,
  primarily b/c it is inconsistent with past practice to have coun
  try-specific presumptions (though they concede that it would be legally
  permissible).  They would prefer to give guidance to their adjudicators
  that outlines the d.estruction in the two countries and that advises the
  adjudicators to take these conditions into account when making their
  decisions reo suspension. We have asked DOJ/INS for more specifics reo
  why they oppose a presumption and how their idea would operate.

Scott and I have scheduled a follow-up meeting with DOJ and State for
tomorrow morning at lOam.
