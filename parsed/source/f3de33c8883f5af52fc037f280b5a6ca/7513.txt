MEMORANDUM FOR THE CHIEF OF STAFF

FROM:                 ELENA KAGAN
                      SALLY KATZEN

SUBJECT:              USDA's Proposed Organic Rule

        In 1990, Congress passed the Organic Food Production Act which required the
Department of Agriculture (USDA) to establish a national standard defining the use ofthe tenn
"organic" for use on food products. The legislation was strongly supported by the organic
industry which sought to involve the federal government in creating a unified organic standard,
rather than the myriad of private and state-endorsed definitions.

        In December 1997, USDA published a proposed regulation to establish a national organic·
standard. It has been the USDA position that the standard is a marketing description of
what is and is not organic. The Secretary has emphasized that the organic designation is
not intended to convey information about the safety, nutritional value, or environmental
benefits of organic products and practices. On the other hand, the Administration has
long promoted food safety and some agencies have strong concerns that an organic label
will inevitably be construed as an indication of the improved safety of the product.

        Since the publication of the proposed rule, it has been the subject of extensive criticism.
The primary complaint has been that it does not explicitly prohibit the use of genetically
modified organisms, irradiation, and biosolids (sludge) in food that could be labeled "organic."
In the preamble to its proposal, USDA had requested comments as to whether foods using any of
these techniques could be considered as organic. In response, USDA says it has received almost
200,000 comments regarding the proposed rule, the most ever received for a USDA rulernaking.
The rule has also been the subject of unfavorable editorials in many newspapers including the
New York Times, the Washington Post, the Chicago Tribune, and the Los Angles Times. (
Sample "Organic Hash From the USDA Kitchen"). Finally, 47 members of the House and 30
Senators have signed letters to Secretary Glickman expressing concern about the proposed rule.


Current Status
        Secretary Glickman plans to issue a press release this Friday, May 7th, (attached),
indicating that USDA will repropose the rule and "make fundamental changes in the new
proposed rule on organic standards." Specifically, the statement would indicate that
biotechnology, irradiati9n, and biosolids are "being taken off the table and will not be included in
our new proposal." Articles in the last week in USA TODAY, and the Washington Post have
                                                        Automated Records Management System
                                                                Hex·Dump Conversion
indicated that USDA is preparing such a statement.

        Representatives ofOMB and NEC have been concerned about USDA's plan to issue a
statement taking these techniques "off the table." These agencies argue that consumers will likely
view a product labeled as organic as safe, despite the fact that there is not evidence to
demonstrate that organic food is any safer than non-organic food, or that genetically modified,
irradiated, or food grown using sludge is unsafe. To the extent that consumers read an
organic label as demonstrating safety, they-may be misled. OMB points out that organic
material might be even worse in terms of some microbiological hazards, and supposedly organic
foods have been and may in the future be linked to illnesses such as occurred in the Odwalla
juice outbreak. OMB notes the danger of contradiction in Administration policy in areas such as
genetically modified products and biosolids (sludge) in which the Administration is on record
supporting the safety of the practice. OMB suggested that USDA consider modifying the organic.
label to include a provision stating something along the lines of "organic food may be no more
or less safe than non-organic food" or that USDA continue its comment review process and not
prematurely prohibit using the term organic for food using any of the three disputed techniques.

         USDA felt strongly that the label should not be modified and that a statement announcing
a reproposal needs to be made promptly. USDA states that the organic label is not intended to
signify the overall safety of the food, only the methods by which the food was produced, and that
it will not advertise the label as having anything to do with safety. USDA notes that the
disputed techniques are clearly not in keeping with the public's expectation of what constitutes
organic. The Food and Drug Administration has expressed general support for USDA's
position.

Recommendation
        We recognize the need for USDA to clarify its position on organics, and recommend that
Secretary Glickman issue a statement indicating that biotechnology, irradiation, and sludge will
not be part of the revised proposal. We suggest USDA not include the phrase "taken off the
table," however, which may imply they could never be considered. In its place we suggest the
phrase "we will be clear that the term 'or'ganic' is not intended to encompass these
products and practices." In addition, after discussions with OMB, OSTP, NEC, FDA and
USDA we have agreed upon two additional measures that could ameliorate some concerns over
safety. These include (1) having USDA and FDA conduct a survey on consumer attitudes
towards organic food to determine whether consumers purchase organic products on the basis of
unproven safety claims, and (2) having USDA insert in the preamble of its new rule language
indicating that the National Organic Standard Board should report regularly to the Secretary on
possible uses of new technologies and whether they might meet an organic standard.
