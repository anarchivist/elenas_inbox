TEXT:
I've learned (and am sure you knew this) that Sen. McCain is strongly
opposed to the Gorton amendments, but that he didn't have the votes to
strike in conference. He is signing on to the Campbell amendment to
strike Gorton, and as of now, there are 51 S.enators who have no idea how
they'll vote on this amendment. Gorton is so complicated and so bad for
Indian country, that some signal from us or from Interior will be very
important so that our friends know where we stand on this.    It is also
very important to be able to tell Indian country that we took a stand on
this.  I feel that the President would want to send this signal--the
language in the letter of last night was very mild.
