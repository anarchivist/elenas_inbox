TEXT:
The other day, Bruce mentioned that we should be able to quickly announce

After-School grants as soon as Congress OKs the money.   Given the VP's

strong interest in this piece of the Child Care Initiative, we'd obviously

love to have him participate in this     either here in a WH ceremony, or,

on the road in an area where there will be winners.   Thanks.
