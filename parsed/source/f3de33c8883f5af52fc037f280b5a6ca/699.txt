TEXT:
Sorry I didn't follow up on this earlier. Does Bruce want to do something
specific with the DOT announcement? It sounds great.   $100 million is
good money -- and they think they can get a full match for it. Does it
have to be announced before the budget or can we do it after? Maybe we
could wait until a few other welfare announcements pop up. What do you
think?
