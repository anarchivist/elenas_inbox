TEXT:
I met with NaCo and with Louise Renne to discuss (Cutler wasn't there, but
one of her staff was) .
I must say I am sympathetic -- the McCain bill, like the settlement, would
wipe out local lawsuits without provising compensation to local
governments, and would preempt local lawsuits in the future.   However, as
you know, we have other priorities.

I've asked DOJ for their advice -- at first blush, they seem to think it's
somewhat unfair, but they are going to get back to me.

The problem you describe that is raised by Sen. Feinstein that the McCain
bill eliminates the right of local governments to sue the tobacco
companies    is is a very big deal for several cities. In fact, San
Francisco had sued RJR long before the AG's did.  I've asked Mickey to


help relay to Bruce and Elena the scope of the problem so that Erskine
might be able to raise it with McCain today.
