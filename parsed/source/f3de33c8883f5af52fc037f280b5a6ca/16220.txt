    We did, and then we unaccountably let it slip.  It seems as if someone
    canceled a meeting on the subject (to be attended by DPC, HHS, and Waters
    staff) and then it was never rescheduled. We will make sure to make
    contact her office again on Tuesday. As you know, both we and HHS have
    substantial policy concerns about her proposal, but we should be giving
    her every opportunity to make her case.

    I hope by now Elena has made contact with her office.  I remember
    forwarding two e-mails asking her to follow-up even if there was no
    resolve.  Please check with her.  Let me know if you find out anything.     I
    haven't heard one way or the other.

    On the note of the children, thanks for pushing me to do that. Boy were
    they excited.  I will definitely show you the pictures.

Do you know where we are on the grandmothers exemption?  (Can you tell
that I am trying to catch up?)  Hope you had a good time with your
family. What beautiful little ones. I want to see the pics.
