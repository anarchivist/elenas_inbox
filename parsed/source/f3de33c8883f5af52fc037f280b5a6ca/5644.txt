TEXT:
The welfare law required HHS to produce a report on the status of state
TANF data processing systems and what would be required to establish a
system to track participants over time and across states. They've
produced a rather dry report, which outlines 5 technical options (from
"file match," the least sophisticated, to a centralized "one-stop
database.")  The report lays out some alternatives for Congress if it
decides to pursue a national tracking system -- it could:
1) choose one of these 5 technical options; 2) take an evolutionary
approach (starting with file tracking and moving to a one stop database),
or 3) establish a steering committee to choose among options.  In earlier
drafts of the report, HHS had endorsed the evolutionary approach, but we
made them take out any recommendations.

In addition, HHS worked wi.th APWA and NGA to survey states. The survey
shows that while m~ny states are in the planning stages of adapting their
computer systems to track TANF requirements, such as the 5 year time
limit, only a handful of states now have fully operational systems.  The
report estimates that the necessary information systems changes cou~d cost
states up to $1 billion.

I am planning to let this report go up to the Hill now when everyone is
distracted by the holidays.  It is, of course, late (the statute asked for
a report within 6 months), but I would as always appreciate your words of
wisdom.
