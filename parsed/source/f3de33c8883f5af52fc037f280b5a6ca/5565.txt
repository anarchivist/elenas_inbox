BR:

I don't think we need to do anything in the budget for next year. It has
full funding for COPS as agreed to in the BBA (1.4+ billion). What we
need to do is some combination of the following:

(1) get DOJ to back-off its "settle for 70,000" attitude and look for
creative new ways to keep demand up (i.e., new targeted programs, waivers
of the 75,000 cap for big cities, etc.);

(2) get DOJ to back off its position that it can't use its statutory
waiver authority w/out the appropriators signing off;

(3) have OMB accept that COPS funding won't necessarily drop off in FY
2000 -- and get them to realize that keeping demand/interest up, through
some flexibility, is as important as keeping the 100,000 count;

(4) have WH and OMB leg. affairs make this a bigger priority with the Hill
leadership types (will never win the DOJ/approps. relationship battle); and

(5) get the President talking COPS again and doing cop events (I'll take
handing out COPS funds and talking about crime rates going down any day
before another directive.

Plus, I'm sure there's more we can be doing that hasn't immediately
occurred to me. I'll keep thinking about it.

Also, I called to ask about the Bowles/McCaffrey meeting on the SW
border. Are you, Elena or both going? What's the strategy? Nothing has
happened since the meeting between the Generals about a month ago. I know


MCCaffrey still wants the Drug policy Council to take this up and come out
w/a strategy in 6 months.  I'm checking withe DOJ and Treasury bureaucrats
to get their take.
