TEXT:
The spring intern session begins on January 15th and I have to let the intern
coordinator know how many worker bees our office will need.  If you can
anticipate what your needs are going to be for the spring (for example, would
you prefer a full-time or part-time student, undergrad or graduate student?),
please let me know by Friday, December 6th.
ALSO, there is a Gallaudet University senior applying for an internship. She
would be a non-traditional intern in that she is hearing impaired and a mature
student (she held many jobs before attending college, including clerking for a
law firm and being a member of a School Board). She would like to intern in
Counsel's Office as she hopes to attend law school after Gallaudet.  If anyone
has a specific project that they will need help on throughout the spring (that
does not include phone work), please let me know.
