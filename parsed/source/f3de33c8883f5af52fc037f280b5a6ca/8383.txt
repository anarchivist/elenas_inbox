TEXT:
I spoke with Nancy Zirkin last night who was on the phone call with the
civil rights groups in the afternoon--1) they don't understand why EEOC
went down the path it did other than the abused child syndrome (sort of
like INS--they are always being kicked, so they move very cautiously
hoping to avoid getting kicked again); 2) they (LCCR) are planning to send
a letter to the committee outlining their concerns with Gingrich's
objections (not all of them--testers is the most impt, but they are also
worried about the directive that more resources be dedicated to charging
processes and less to litigation); 3) they know we are not settled on the
other issues 4) she indicated that it certainly was a good strategy to try
to avoid a rider but they are still really upset with EEOC and want to
know who at the White House was minding the store and what does the white
house do when an agency takes steps that perhaps (they hope in this case)
the White House is not in favor of -- she thought doing a small meeting
with folks later in the week so they could tell us their views would be
helpful-- so what do you all think? And where are we?

Subject: EEOC update


All:
Ellen Vargyas had a conversation with David Frank this afternoon.  He told
her that according to Mike Rengler, there has not yet been a committee
report drafted for the subcommittee. On the $ front, he told her that the
appropriators had not settled on a figure.  One of the big issues is the
part of the increase ($9 million) that is slated to improve technology at
the agency. According to Frank, some on the subcommittee indicated that
they were interested in having the EEOC fund its technology improvements
(computers; e-mail; legal data bases) using discretionary dollars in the
Treasury-Postal legislation ($ intended to be used to address the the Y2K
problem).  Frank further indicated that the agency should get "a big
chunk" of the rest
($28 million) .

Ellen told Frank that we want to make sure that we have resolution on the
other five conditions as soon as possible.  Frank told Ellen that he would
try to get Rengler to focus on drafting conference language on this.
Given this delay, he indicated that they could push back the date 'by which
he would want to know whether we had a deal on testers (they had
originally talked about a July 1st deadline).

Julie
