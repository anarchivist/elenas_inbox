    The second fact they are asking for SOTU seems like one that we may not
    want emphasized .... I am sure you are aware of this but thought I'd ask.

    PLEASE HELP ... THANKS

    Our helath care bill of rights says: Every American should have the right
    to the best care ... the right emergency care. Within my power as
    President, I have enacted, extending these rights to the [85 million]
    Americans served by Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal health plans.
    IS THAT CORRECT?

    Illness due to smoking -- from cancer to emphezyma -- costs Medicare [X
    billion] a year .... Already, state governments have recovered [X] billion
    dollars for taxpayers for state health care costs.
