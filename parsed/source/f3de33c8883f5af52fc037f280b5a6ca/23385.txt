Subject: Consumer Financial Event

Since Rep. LaFalce is traveling over the recess, Legislative Affairs
strongly recommends postponing the Consumer Financial Event until Congress
returns to Washington the week of April 12. LaFalce very much wants to be
here when we have this event, and.would be upset if we went ahead without
him.  In any case, the event would be more effective if we wait until
Members are back in town and able to attend.
