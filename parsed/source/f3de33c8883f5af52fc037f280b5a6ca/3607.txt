TEXT:
I asked Elizabeth to check into the updated MDRC findings on Ohio's LEAP
program for teen parents, which will be released tomorrow. The resu1ts
are somewhat better than the findings from the recent New Chance study,
but nothing to cheer about.   Here's what she found:

FINDINGS:

 LEAP showed modest success in increasing school attendance, employment
and reducing AFDC receipt.   By contrast, the teen mothers in New Chance
were not more likely to hold jobs or leave welfare.
 LEAP did not increase high school graduation and had very little impact
on teens who had already dropped out of school before entering the
program.

PROGRAM DIFFERENCES BETWEEN LEAP AND NEW CHANCE:

 New Chance provided extensive services to participants through
community-based programs. LEAP did not provide additional services to
participants, but rather created incentives for participants to attend
school, by providing monetary sanctions and bonuses.
 New Change was a voluntary program, while LEAP was a mandatory
requirement that applied to all teen parents in Ohio who had not completed
high school.
 New Chance served only teen parents who had already dropped out of
school. LEAP served both in-school and out-of-school youth, and most of
its success was concentrated among participants who were enrolled in
school at the time of random assignment.

Q+As.

HHS is updating their old Q&As for tomorrow. We haven't seen them yet, but
are told to expect the same basic message as usual: we look forward to
reviewing the report in detail; we're encouraged by many of the findings;
mixture of carrots and sticks seems to be the
right tact to take; but we know this is an extremely difficult prob1em and
we have a long way to go ... etc.
