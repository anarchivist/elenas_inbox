Q:   What is happening involving a meat recall in Illinois?       Have there been any reports
     of illness associated with the beef?

A:   IBP, a company that produces ground beef at a plant in Joslin, Illinois, yesterday
     voluntarily recalled all the ground beef that was produced by the plant on April 14, 1998.
     A package of ground beef produced at the plant on that day and shipped to Florida was
     tested and found positive for E.coli 0157:H7. USDA has notified all state health
     departments, and there has been no known illness reported from the product. The
     positive test was performed as part of a regular program of testing conducted by the
     USDA. USDA officials have visited the IBP facility and continue to work closely with
     IBP in ensuring that all product is removed from commerce as soon as possible.

Q:   How much beef is being recalled? What should consumers do?

A:   The recall involves over 280,000 pounds of ground beef, and the recall is planned to
     reach every state where the beef may have been shipped. Consumers should follow safe
     handling labels and thoroughly cook the meat to an internal temperature of 160 degrees
     which kills harmful bacteria, including E.coli 0157:H7.
