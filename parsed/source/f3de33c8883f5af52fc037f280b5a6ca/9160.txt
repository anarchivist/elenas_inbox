       MERRILL LYNCH BECOMES FIRST GLOBAL FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANY TO OFFER
       DOMESTIC PARTNERSHIP BENEFITS

       HRC Praises Merrill Lynch For Leadership, Business Savvy

       WASHINGTON -- Merrill Lynch announced to its workers today that it will
       offerthem domestic partnership benefits starting next year, becoming the
       first global financial services corporation to extend such coverage,
       according to the Human Rights Campaign.
               The company, based in New York, will offer the benefits to
       same-sex domestic partners and to adult "extended family members," such as
       children, parents and in-laws if they are tax dependents as defined by the
       Internal Revenue Code. The policy will cover Merrill Lynch's 60,000
       employees, including more than 47,000 domestic workers.
               "Merrill Lynch joins with some of the most forward-thinking
       businesses in America by extending these benefits to their employees," said
       Kim I. Mills, HRC's education director who oversees workplace issues.
         "Offering domestic partnership benefits is a low-cost, high-return means
        ,
,.      J

     of equalizing the workplace for gay people. And a company with the stature
     and business acumen of Merrill Lynch would not make this move unless it
     made good business sense."
             Other major U.S. corporations that offer domestic partner benefits
     to their lesbian and gay employees include IBM, Walt Disney, Eastman Kodak,
     Sun Microsystems and AT&T. Between 10 percent and 13 percent of all U.S.
     corporations now offer these benefits and, according to HRC's research, the
     trend is increasing.
             "We receive word virtually every week of another company adding
     these benefits," Mills said. "And we get anywhere from 10 to 30 requests
     each week from employees or employers who are looking into offering them."
             The Human Rights Campaign is the largest national lesbian and gay
     political organization, with members throughout the country. It effectively
     lobbies Congress, provides campaign support, and educates the public to
     ensure that lesbian and gay Americans can be open, honest, and safe at
     home, at work, and in the community.
