TEXT:
1. USDA has results back on the initial implementation of our
science-based HACCP system for reducing pathogens.

2. While the data is preliminary, it is very, very good.   Swine went from
salmonella infection rates of 8.7% as a baseline to 5.5%; poultry is even
better going from a baseline of 20% to 10.4%.

3.   The data show that 88% of large plants are participating.

4.   The President could announce this with Secretary Glickman, note that
the data is just from the first 6 months, but it shows we must stay the
course in implementing our food safety plans. We need Congress to provide
the resources that are pending in Congress and we need to go ahead to
apply HACCP to the small plants -- which is the stage we are at now.

5.   They hope to have the study ready by the end of the week.    Interested?
