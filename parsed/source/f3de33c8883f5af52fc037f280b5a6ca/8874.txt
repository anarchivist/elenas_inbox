TEXT:
I've asked Patrick Steele at USDA to pull together a tobacco update on the
situation in NC.  Janet M. is trying to get the staffer who asked for the
meeting on the phone with us.  I'll pull some background from our memos to
POTUS and call around to groups and see if there is anything else to add.
I asked Patrick to get me a backgrounder by 4 which I can integrate within
an hour into our memo.   Is 5 too late to shoot to get it to you?
