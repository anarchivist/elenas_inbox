TEXT:
The Senate plans to begin consideration of the C/J/S FY99 Appropriations
bill later this afternoon.  please review the draft and provide
comments/clearance no later than 3pm today.  Thanks.

S. 2260 -- COMMERCE, JUSTICE, STATE, THE JUDICIARY,
AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS BILL, FY 1999
(Sponsors:  Stevens (R), Alaska; Gregg (R), New Hampshire)

        This Statement of Administration policy provides the


AdministrationO,s views on S. 2260, the Commerce, Justice, and State, the
Judiciary, and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill, FY 1999, as reported
by the Senate Appropriations Committee. Your consideration of the
AdministrationO,s views would be appreciated.

        The Administration appreciates efforts by the Committee to
accommodate certain of the PresidentO,s priorities within the 302(b}
allocation. However, the allocation is simply insufficient to make the
necessary investments in programs funded by this bill.

        The only way to achieve the appropriate investment level is to
offset discretionary spending by using savings in other areas.  The
President's FY 1999 Budget proposes levels of discretionary spending for
FY 1999 that conform to the Bipartisan Budget Agreement by making savings
in mandatory and other programs available to help finance this spending.
In the recently enacted Transportation Equity Act, Congress -- on a broad,
bipartisan basis -- took similar action in approving funding for surface
transportation programs paid for with mandatory offsets. We want to work
with the Congress on mutually agreeable mandatory and other offsets that
would be used to increase high-priority discretionary programs, including
those funded by this bill.   In addition, we hope that the Committee will
reduce funding for lower priority and unrequested discretionary programs,
and redirect funding to programs of higher priority.

        The Administration appreciates the CommitteeO,s support for many
of the PresidentD,s priorities within the bill.  For example, we
appreciate the Committee's funding of law enforcement programs in general
and the COPS program in particular.  Funding COPS at the requested level
of $1.4 billion is consistent with the Balanced Budget Agreement and would
enable us to achieve the goal of hiring 100,000 additional police officers
by the year 2000. However, the Administration is deeply concerned about
the funding level for certain important programs, and has additional
concerns about other aspects of the bill.  These concerns are discussed
below.

Small Business Administration

        The Administration strongly objects to the Committee mark of $94
million to administer the Small Business Administration's (SBA's) Disaster
Loan Program, a 43-percent reduction from the President's request.   Such a
drastic reduction in funding to originate and service disaster loans would
severely curtail SBA's ability to respond to the needs of victims of
natural disasters.  We also urge the Senate to provide for additional
disaster loans.

        In addition, the Administration has serious concerns about the
Committee mark of $265 million for SBA's Salaries and Expenses account,
$16 million below the request. A cut of this magnitude could require SBA
to reduce its staffing by up to 300 staff years, which would require
furloughs and/or reductions-in-force, jeopardizing SBA's ability to
accomplish its mission.

Equal Employment Opportunity Commission

        The Administration strongly urges the Senate to fully fund the
President's request of $279 million for the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission (EEOC), $25 million above the Committee mark. The additional
resources are essential, and would allow EEOC to reduce the backlog of
pending complaints and implement much-needed reforms in the way all
complaints are managed, including an enhanced alternative dispute


resolution program. We look forward to working with Congress to provide
funding for EEOC and other programs included in the President's civil
rights enforcement initiative.

Department of Commerce

        The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for the
Department of Commerce overall, and in particular its full funding of the
President's request for the Decennial Census, the Nation's single largest
statistical operation. However, the Administration remains concerned
about funding for a number of high priority programs, including:

 Statistics initiatives that are necessary to upgrade the Nation's core
statistical infrastructure, particularly efforts to improve our current
measurements of the Gross Domestic Product, Poverty Rate, and other
fundamental economic indicators crucial to sound private and public sector
decision-making.    Increased funding is also vitally important to maintain
the full development of the Continuous Measurement program, which will
provide critical demographic data about the Nation's communities every
year.

 The Advanced Technology Program (ATP) and its support of cutting-edge
research.  A $39 million cap on new award grants is a 58-percent cut below
the request. Also within the National Institute of Standards and
Technology, the absence of full funding for the new Advanced Measurement
Laboratory would result in insufficient funds to complete this facility,
and no funds are provided for the Climate Change Technology Initiative.

 The Clean Water and follow-on weather satellite initiatives, for which
funding levels are inadequate to fulfill existing contract obligations and
would jeopardize NOAA's ability to combat non-point source pollution and
ensure satellite continuity. The satellite allowance would necessitate
delayed launch vehicle 'delivery, elimination of technology development
currently underway to replace fifteen-year-old instruments, and a
restructuring of the converged satellite program -- a complex and
carefully negotiated multi-agency system.

 The National Information Infrastructure Grants Program, which provides
seed money for innovative projects that deploy, use, and evaluate advanced
information technology, would be severely curtailed with the Committee's
50-percent reduction.

 The Economic Development Administration (EDA) , which has achieved
impressive results in creating jobs, leveraging private sector dollars,
and increasing local tax bases. A reduction to EDA's Title IX (emergency
relief) and defense conversion programs would adversely affect EDA's
ability to help distressed communities deal with the burdens imposed by
industry down-sizing and international trade agreements.

Department of Justice

        We appreciate the CommitteeD,s continued support for law
enforcement and other Department of Justice activities. However, the
Administration is concerned about non-hiring set- asides in the COPS
program and the Committee's action in a number of other areas:

 Winstar. The Administration strongly opposes the Committee's approach to
funding for Winstar, which would require substantial reductions to the
non-Wins tar related activities of the litigating divisions, including
Civil Rights. We believe that the large, one-time litigation costs


arising   out of the savings and loan rescue are appropriately borne by the
Federal   Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC) Resolution Fund
(FRF) .   The Administration is working with the Banking Committees to
provide   permanent funding for Justice's Wins tar costs from the FRF Fund.

 Immigration and Naturalization Service.  The bill would use $166 million
in receipts from the Immigration and Naturalization Service's (INS's)
Immigration Examination and User Fee accounts to pay for expenses not
directly related to fee activities. Without these receipts there would be
insufficient resources to support fee-related activities -- in particular,
funds to process pending naturalization applications and reduce the
citizenship application backlog.

The Committee mark of $2.4 billion for the INS is $350 million below the
Administration's request.   This level would jeopardize the
Administration's bipartisan border management and enforcement strategy.
We strongly urge the Senate to fully fund the border infrastructure and
technology, detention support, and interior enforcement initiatives
requested by the President.

  Protection Against Chemical and Biological Weapons. We appreciate the
Committee's support of the Administration's effort to combat terrorism
involving the use of chemical and biological weapons.  However, we believe
that the levels proposed in the President's June 8th budget amendment
reflect the appropriate balance among all aspects of antiterrorism
activities.   In particular, we hope that the Senate will provide the $49
million that the Administration has requested for bomb squad equipment in
direct appropriations.

 Juvenile Justice Block Grant. While juvenile justice programs are an
important element of effective law enforcement, the new $100 million block
grant program recommended by the Committee would authorize a broad and
unfocused range of spending. Rather than funding the block grant, we urge
funding for targeted activities, such as the community prosecutors
program, prosecutorial initiatives, and youth violence courts.

 Drug Testing. The Committee bill does not provide the $85 million
requested for the drug testing and intervention program.  Systematic drug
testing is a proven, cost-effective means of using the coercive power of
the criminal justice system to move non-violent offenders into drug
treatment programs, and should be funded.

 Counterdrug Strategy.  Report language that directs the Attorney General
to create a new interagency counterdrug strategy is inappropriate.   The
Director of National Drug Control Policy is mandated by statute to perform
this function; it should not be transferred to the Attorney General. The
Administration strongly opposes this report language.

 Controlled Substances Act. The Administration has serious concerns about
sections 118 and 119 of the Justice General Provisions, which would weaken
the Drug Enforcement Administration's authority to regulate the flow of
drugs classified as controlled substances. The proposed provisions would
allow relief for recordkeeping and reporting violations. Careless,
negligent, or unknowing violations create an opportunity to divert drugs
to illicit channels just as do knowing or intentional violations, which
are properly subject to misdemeanor penalties under current law.

 Critical Infrastructure Protection. The Committee bill provides only $19
million of the $34 million requested to reimburse agencies for expenses
related to protection of the Nation's critical infrastructure. In


particular, the Committee's funding level excludes $6.6 million needed to
create a national plan for protecting the Nation's infrastructure,
including funds for core staff in the Critical Infrastructure Assurance
Office.

 Narrowband Communications.  The Administration is disappointed that the
Subcommittee has not provided the $86 million requested to establish a
fund for the consolidation and coordination of the Department's conversion
to narrowband communications systems.

Bureau of Prisons/Abortion. The Administration urges the Senate to strike
section 102 of the Committee bill, which would prohibit the Bureau of
Prisons from funding abortions except in cases of rape or where the life
of the mother is endangered. The Department of Justice believes that
there is a great likelihood that this provision would be held
unconstitutional.

Legal Services Corporation

        The Administration commends the Committee for increasing the
funding level for the Legal Services Corporation (LSC) to $300 million,
$13 million above the FY 1998 enacted level. The recent Supreme Court
ruling that interest on lawyer trust accounts (ILTAs) cannot be used to
support civil legal services eliminates a funding source that provided LSC
programs with more than $57 million last year.  It is vitally important
that the Congress fully fund the President's request of $340 million to
ensure equal access to the judicial system.

International Affairs Programs

         The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for the
Department of State accounts that fund diplomatic and consular activities
and, in particular, funding the request for the State Department's
information technology modernization effort, including year 2000 (Y2K)
activities.   However, the Committee's cuts and unrequested earmarks in the
Diplomatic and Consular Programs and Salaries and Expenses accounts,
totaling over $30 million, would prevent the Department from meeting
expected wage and price increases, covering critical overseas staffing
gaps, an,d addressing other infrastructure shortfalls.

        While the Administration is encouraged by the Committee's
recognition of the Department's overseas facility requirements, we urge
the Senate to restore the $90 million reduction to the Security and
Maintenance of'United States Missions account and to provide full funding
of the President's request for urgently needed embassy facilities in
Beijing and Berlin. The Administration appreciates the Committee's
support for funding the Arms 'Control and Disarmament Agency's activities,
particularly in light of recent events in South Asia.

        The Administration appreciates the steps the Subcommittee has
taken to fund the request for arrearage payments this year.  The
Administration wants to work with the Congress to ensure that these funds
are available in a timely fashion to retain our influence in these
organizations and to identify reform measures that further U.S.
interests. However, we oppose the bill's authorization requirement that
is intended to subject this important foreign policy measure to the
unrelated issue of family planning policy. There is legitimate
disagreement over this issue, but none of the U.N. and related
international organizations arrears payments are related to this issue.
Therefore, it is wholly inappropriate to hold the payment of U.S. arrears


     hostage to the family planning issue.

             Further, the Committee bill significantly under funds , by about $75
     million, the annual assessed contributions to these organizations. This
     would increase arrears again and further inhibit qhances for the reforms
     that we are all seeking.  In addition, the Committee has imposed a number
     of certification requirements and conditions before payments by the United
     States to these organizations can be made. The consequence of these
     provisions would likely be the loss of vote of the United States in the
     United Nations and other international organizations. This would
     seriously diminish the ability of the United States to influence issues
     before the U.N. General Assembly such as selection of future Secretaries
     General and resolutions affecting the Middle East.

             Finally, the Administration strongly opposes section 403 and urges
     the Senate to strike it from the bill. This provision would reduce
     funding for arrears payments by 25 percent of the total expenditure of the
     United States made to respond to efforts by Iraq to block United Nations
     weapons inspections. The decision of the United States to incur these
     critically important expenditures was made on the basis of our own
     national security interests.

             The Administration is very concerned that funding for the United
     States Information Agency's overseas information and broadcasting programs
     has been reduced by $80 million below the President's request. The
     funding level of $427 million for International Information Programs is
     $34 million below the President's request, $24 million of which results
     from the omission of funding for overseas administrative costs.   For
     broadcasting programs, the Committee mark is $46 million below the
     President's request.  A reduction of this magnitude would require a
     personnel reduction-in-force, eliminate broadcast language services, and
     defer necessary capital and technical radio modernization improvements.
     We urge the Senate to provide funding for core information and br
     oadcasting programs at the President's requested level. Finally, earmarks
     placed on the Educational and Cultural Exchanges program should be removed.

             This bill also contains provisions that raise serious
     constitutional concerns.    For example, Section 405 regarding Vietnam
     unconstitutionally constrains the President's authority with respect to
     the conduct of diplomacy, in addition to containing objectionable elements
     beyond those contained in similar provisions from previous years.   In
     addition, Section 613 on Haiti would limit the President's unfettered
     constitutional authority to "receive ambassadors and other public
     ministers."

             Federal Communications Commission (FCC).  Federal Communications
     Commission (FCC). The Administration urges the Senate to provide funding
     for the FCC's scheduled move to the Portals complex. Absent this funding,
     the FCC's ability to implement the mandates of the Telecommunications Act
     of 1996 and to carry out critical mission operations may be severely
     impaired.

             Exxon Valdez Settlement Funds. The Administration strongly objects to a
     provision of section 619 that would require certain Exxon Valdez
     settlement funds to be spent only for grants for marine research and
     community and economic restoration. This language is contrary to the
     Clean Water Act and a court-ordered consent decree that require that the
     State and Federal natural resource trustees determine how these funds
     should best be used.
