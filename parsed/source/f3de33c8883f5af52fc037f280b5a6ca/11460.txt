TEXT:
Education has asked us not to release this statement until 1pm (the time
that their briefing to Congress is scheduled to begin) .

"Today, the Education Department is releasing an assessment of Title I
that shows that we have made some progress in improving achievement for
students in our highest-poverty schools and those who are in the greatest
need, but that a substantial gap remains between these students and
others. While the federal Title I program has helped states and school
districts make progress in setting academic standards, provide greater
flexibility and target resources to those in the greatest need, this
report makes it clear that there is much more to do.   Over 1/3 of teachers
in high-poverty schools reported that they felt unprepared to teach to
high standards. Only 32% of students in high-poverty schools scored at
the basic level of proficiency in reading and only 42% in math. This
report makes clear that we have been heading in the right direction, but
provides compelling evidence that we must dramatically increase the pace
of reform.  That's why we must work across party lines to enact my
Education Accountability Act, ensuring that schools end social promotion,
children are taught by qualified teachers, states and districts
turn-around low-performing schools and provide parents with reports on the
progress that schools are making.  And that's why we need to provide
intensive investments to help all our children reach high standards
including, resources to help states and school districts fix failing
schools, expand after-school and summer programs and reduce class size in
the early grades by hiring more 100,000 well-prepared teachers so that
children master the basics and learn to read well.   "
