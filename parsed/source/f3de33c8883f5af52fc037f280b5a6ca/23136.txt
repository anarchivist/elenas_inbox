    TEXT:
    On behalf of the Press Office, OPL and the Women's Office, we would like
    to invite you to stop by and meet the Editors-in-Chief and Senior Writers
    of 17 top national women's magazines at a luncheon on Monday, March 15,
    anytime between 11:30 AM to 12:15 PM in the Indian Treaty Room.  Please
    e-mail Sondra Seba in the Women's Office or call her at 6-7310 if you
    think you may be able to drop by or if you have any questions about the
    event.

    FYI--after the luncheon they will move to the West Wing to participate in
    a roundtable discussion entitled "Economic and Retirement Security: What
    Every Woman Should Know" with the First Lady and other Administration
    officials. The roundtable will focus on Social Security and Medicare
    reform--issues of importance to women of all generations.

    We hope to see you at the luncheon on Monday!
