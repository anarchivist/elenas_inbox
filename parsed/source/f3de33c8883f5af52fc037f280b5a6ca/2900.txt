TEXT:
I talked to Rob a few minutes ago.  The meeting Chuck is having tomorrow
at 11:00 is not on the California teacher testing issue (that one will be
on June 20); rather, it is on higher education enrollment in California
and Texas the impact of 209 and Hopwood respectively. There is some
discussion about Justice undertaking an investigation to determine if
minority enrollment dropoff in those states is a violation of Title VI.

If you need more information for tomorrow's meeting, you should call Rob.

Rob said Chuck wanted our "policy view" on whether we should get involved
in the teacher testing case. While I have a clear viewe on this, I'd feel
better about expressing and advocating for it after I get more complete
information. Dawn Chira apparantly has some information the Justice sent
over on this.  I'm going to get that from her and review it.  In light of
our earlier conversation, I'll make sure to talk to you before taking any
kind of position with Chuck.   I'm happy to remain officially neutral
until (1) I actually read the material from Justice, which presumably will
reflect both ED and EEOC views; (2) we talk to Wade Henderson and co.;
and, (3) we have had a chance to discuss it among ourselves.
