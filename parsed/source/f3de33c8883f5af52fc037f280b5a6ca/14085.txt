Hi! How are you? At yesterday's Counsel's meeting ( yes, I was there), Kathy
Wallman mentioned that the reinvention work that will be going on at PTO will
be used as a model in other performance-based agencies & that we should be
careful about the appointment language for those agencies. You should know
this for future reference. Also, for my reference, can I get a copy of the
language that you and OLC finally agreed upon.  Thanks. ksg
