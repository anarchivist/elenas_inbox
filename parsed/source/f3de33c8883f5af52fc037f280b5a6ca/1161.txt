 TEXT:
 Attached is the lastest draft of the agency privatization paper.  There is
 another option and one or two more policy issues.  It is a long read, but
 almost everything is there.  If I were to do it again, I'd differentiate
 more between Wisconsin and Texas.  Wisconsin has a more performance based
 approach which expands or contracts their privatization efforts based on
 how the public counties do compared with the privatized counties.

 This version is being distributed to all the agencies tonight.

           PRIVATIZATION OF              FEDERAL PUBLIC ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS

I.    OVERVIEW & ISSUES

This paper has been prepared jointly by staff from the Departments of Agriculture (Food
and Consumer Service), Health and Human Services (Health Care Financing
Administration and Administration for Children and Families), Labor (Employment and
Training Administration), and the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). The Federal
agencies have been meeting recently to discuss the general background and issues
surrounding privatization initiatives that are under review within the Departments and to
explore options for making final decisions and responding to States. Decisions made
here will set the precedents for proposals around the country.

Policy Issues: To what extent should the States be permitted to transfer the
responsibility for eligibility determination for Federal public assistance programs to the
private sector through competitively bid contracts?

Legal Issues: May the Merit System of Personnel Administration requirements,
applicable in different ways in each statute, be waived to allow States to enter into
contract agreements?

II.   BACKGROUND

There is increasing interest among the State welfare agencies in transferring the
administration of public assistance programs to the private sector through competitively
bid contracts. This interest stems in part from the efforts of the Federal and State
governments to test new methods to reduce costs, to improve program services and to
increase self-sufficiency among program recipients.

Contracting or privatizing certain functions of the public assistance programs is not new,
e.g. backroom data processing. What is new is the possibility of contracting with
private entities to perform functions that have historically been the responsibility of the
public sector, such as conducting the determination of eligibility and certification for
public assistance programs like the Federal Food Stamp Program and Medicaid.
While the new welfare law explicitly permits States to privatize TANF administration and
service provision, no other major Federal public assistance program has such broad
latitude. Other programs became part of this issue because typically eligibility for
AFDC (now TANF), Food Stamps and Medicaid and a host of other programs has been
determined by a common process and worker.
III. THERE ARE CURRENT PROPOSALS BEFORE THE ADMINISTRA TION

        I Note that eligibility for $6 billion in Pell Grants and $25 billion in student loans is routinely
determined largely by non-Federal, non-public entities.

                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion
REQUIRING DECISIONS ABOUT THE EXTENT TO WHICH PRIVA T/ZA TION
SHOULD BE PERMITTED

A.   Texas Integrated Enrollment Services (TIES)

TIES is a statewide privatization initiative of the Texas Health and Human Services
Commission (HHSC) and the Texas Council on Competitive Government (CCG) in
support of a State law enacted in 1995. Under TIES, the certification and eligibility
determinations for most public assistance programs, including the Food Stamp, Special
Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC), TANF and
Medicaid programs, would be contracted to the private and/or public sectors through
competitive bids.

USDA has determined the TIES proposal would require a waiver of the merit system.
requirements under the Food Stamp Act. HCFA is still reviewing the extent to which
merit system requirements must be waived. The Federal agencies and the State of
Texas have been negotiating the conditions for releasing a Request for Offers (RFO)
for TIES since May 1996. With the exception of a final decision about the merit
system provisions contained in the RFO, and the role of the single State agency, all
other issues have been resolved with regard to the draft RFO.

Texas was expecting final approval of the RFO in January to be able to release the
RFO by the end of the month. Two consortia have been developed with the intention
of bidding on the RFO. One consortium is composed of the Texas Workforce
Commission, International Business Machines Corporation and Lockheed Martin
Corporation. The other consortium consists of the Texas Department of Human
Services, Electronic Data Systems Corporation and the Unisys Corporation. Arthur
Anderson has also indicated an interest in the proposal but has not aligned itself with a
State agency.

Wisconsin Works (W-2)

Under the W-2 proposal, the State is contracting on a competitive basis with public or
private agencies for certification actions such as gathering client eligibility information,
conducting eligibility interviews and data input. The State, presuming the Department
of Agriculture's approval of its waiver request of the merit system requirements for the
Food Stamp Program, released its Request for Proposals (RFP). While the State can
issue the RFP without USDA's approval, they will need to hear back from USDA in
order to award the contract. State officials have advised that the contract process has
been completed for one County (with over 60 percent of the State caseload) without the
inclusion of the Food Stamp Program. Contracts have been awarded to six private,
non-profit agencies.

C.   Employment Services -- One-Stop Grant


                                                                       DRAFT                2
                                                                  Hex·Dump Conversion

Legislation enacted in the State of Texas, effective September 1, 1996, provides for the
delivery of labor exchange services that are authorized under the Wagner-Peyser Act
and currently delivered by State employment security agencies by local workforce
development boards and private, non-governmental providers. Thus far, Texas has
not considered contracting out the delivery of unemployment insurance services. The
Department of Labor has urged Texas to delay implementation until the Department's
review is completed.

In addition, the State of Massachusetts, with the Department of Labor's approval of a
1994? grant to implement a competitive One-Stop Career Center system throughout
the State, has awarded contracts to private-for-profit entitles to deliver labor exchange
services in several local areas under that grant. Other States such as Montana, Utah,
Pennsylvania, and Iowa are on the threshold of requesting similar approval.

IV.   ORGANIZED LABOR RESPONSE

The Departments of Agriculture and Health and Human Services have received
numerous letters from employee unions about the TIES proposal, including the
American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO), the
American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) and the
Service Employees International Union. The unions assert that a waiver of the merit
system would result in a decline of client services, including access to program benefits
and client confidentiality. The Department of Agriculture received over 1,000 letters
from employees in Wisconsin objecting to the W-2 project.

In the case of the Texas workforce development legislation, the Department of Labor
has received a letter from the AFL-CIO questioning the legality of privatizing
employment services.

In the Massachusetts One Stamp project, the State AFL-CIO concurred in the proposal
but current implementation problems are raising new concerns.


V.    THE TEXAS SITUA TION

A.    Food Stamp Program--Certification and Other Program Requirements

The Food Stamp Act requires certification, i.e., the application and the components of
the eligibility determination process, to be completed by merit system employees.
Certification, however, is not defined in statute. As supported by legislative history to
the Act, current regulations specify that the required interview be conducted by merit
system employees. Given the complexity and discretion that may be required in the
food stamp certification process, the food stamp interview is crucial to accurate


                                                                      DRAFT                 3
                                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion
determinations of eligibility and benefit level. It is through the food stamp interview that
the worker solicits most household information, determines the necessity for additional
verification or resolution of questionable information, and ascertains the need for
appropriate policy decisions. It is also the applicant household's opportunity to have
face-to-face contact with a public employee. Volunteers and other non-merit
employees may assist an applicant household in other actions related to certification
but may not conduct the food stamp interview or certify a household.

During recent debate on welfare reform legislation, Congressional conferees reinserted
the merit system provisions in the Food Stamp Act that a previous Senate bill had
deleted.

B.   Medicaid--Certification and Other Program Requirements

Similar to Food Stamps, the entire application process, from taking an application to
making the final eligibility determination, is performed almost entirely by employees of
the State agency responsible for administering the Medicaid program. Under Medicaid
law, States are required to establish or designate a single State agency to administer
their Medicaid program and determine Medicaid eligibility. Moreover, the Medicaid
statute requires that the State agency responsible for Medicaid not delegate authority to
"exercise administrative discretion in the administration or supervision of the plan" to
non-government entities. The regulations implementing that part of the statute also
require that other agencies which perform services for the State agency "must not have
the authority to ". substitute their judgement for that of the Medicaid agency with
respect to the application of policies, rules, and regulations issued by the Medicaid
agency."

Unlike Food Stamps, the Social Security Act also provides for "outstationing", which
allows the State to use private sector employees to perform some of the eligibility
process at locations other than State TANF offices for certain groups of applicants.
Outstationing was incorporated into the law to increase program access when the law
was amended to substantially broaden the categories of eligible individuals.

States have the option of staffing outstation locations with State employees or
non-State employees (e.g., contractors or volunteers), or a combination of both.
Because outstationing can involve the use of non-State employees to perform certain
eligibility-related functions, Medicaid regulations--but not the law--specify which
functions can be performed by non-State employees and which must be performed by
State workers.

Non-State employees staffing outstation locations can perform "initial processing" which
includes: (1) taking applications; (2) assisting applicants in completing the application;
(3) providing information and referrals; (4) obtaining required documentation; (5)
assuring that information contained in the application is complete; and (6) conducting


                                                                         DRAFT                4
                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion
any necessary interviews.

Non-State employees are specifically precluded from: (1) evaluating the information
contained in the application and supporting documentation; and (2) making a
determination of eligibility or ineligibility. Actual evaluations and determinations can be
made at the outstation location or at a State Medicaid agency office, but they must be
made by a State employee authorized to make eligibility determinations for the State
Medicaid agency.                                                           .

C. Temporary Assistance for Needy Families

Section 104 of the Block Grant for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)
specifically allows States to "administer and provide services" under titles I and II of the
welfare reform legislation through contracts with charitable, religious or private
organizations. Therefore, there are no prohibitions to privatization initiatives, such as
TIES, related to merit personnel provisions for TANF. Most States have procedures
where one generic worker may accept a joint application for food stamp, TANF and
Medicaid benefits. If a household is determined eligible for TANF, they are
automatically eligible for Food Stamps and Medicaid. Therefore if a State choose to
administer the TANF program with a private contractor, large portions of Food Stamp
and Medicaid eligibility could effectively also be privatized.

D. Waiver Authority to Conduct Demonstration Projects

The Food Stamp and Social Security Acts provide the two Departments with the
authority to waive most statutory requirements to allow the States to conduct
demonstration projects. However, because its authority for the Merit System of
Personnel Management was transferred from USDA to OPM under the
Intergovernmental Personnel Act of 1970, USDA would need to obtain concurrence
from OPM prior to approving any demonstration project that would waive the Merit
System of Personnel Management. However, HHS believes they would not need
OPM's concurrence for such a waiver.




E.   Intergovernmental Personnel Act

For decades, a Merit System of Personnel Administration was routinely established for
many Federal-State grant-in-aid programs as now codified within the Intergovernmental
Personnel Act (IPA) because it was presumed by Congress that services would be
provided directly by State or local employees who were acting in lieu of Federal
employees. The IPA is not a genuine statute; its provisions only come into play when
another law or regulation invokes it.


                                                                       DRAFT                5
                                                        HexoOump ConV\llSiOD


While the IPA is silent on whether States or local governments may contract for
services, the law does provide for maximum flexibility within the requirements for merit
principles in the administration of grant-in-aid programs by grantees. However, as the
roles of government and the relationships between the State and the Federal
government continue to evolve, a determination must be made as to whether new ways
of doing business can be carried out under existing laws, or whether change in those
laws is required. While government contracting with the private sector for commercial
products and services is not new, the Texas proposal raises the possibility of
contracting with private entities to perform functions that have historically been the
responsibility of the public sector. The proposal, as currently drafted, would require a
waiver by OPM of current statutory and regulatory provisions related to the Merit
System of Personnel Administration provision of the IPA.

Aspects of the current proposals under review by Federal agencies appear to conflict
with the general requirements of the IPA, but as noted above, the key issue is defining
precisely what aspects of program processes are in fact covered by the IPA. Although
OPM has not consulted with their General Counsel for a legal opinion, OPM is confident
that it does not have authority to waive any provisions of the statute. In fact, OPM
counsels have consistently held that OPM does not have authority to waive its own
regulations, unless such waiver is specifically provided for in the applicable statute.
The Administration could elect to seek legislative change if the determination of what
processes are covered presents the need.

This leads us back, then, to examining the Texas proposal and shredding out what is
"inherently governmental" for these programs at issue and must therefore be performed
by merit system employees, and what is commercial and can therefore be contracted
out. The OPM General Counsel has relied on OMB Circular A-76 to define what is and
is not an inherently governmental function for programs whose statute relies upon IPA
coverage. Included in the definition of governmental functions are "those activities
which require either the exercise of discretion in applying Governmental authority or the
use of value judgment in making decisions for the Government. ... Governmental
functions normally fall into two categories: (1) The Act of governing; .... (2) Monetary
transactions and entitlements .... " It would appear that some contracting is appropriate
but wholesale contracting of Food Stamp and Medicaid eligibility may raise questions of
consistency with the intention of Congress to ensure that administration of these
programs be conducted by employees covered by a merit system of personnel
administration.

G. Options for Texas TIES

1. Allow the State to fully privatize its eligibility process, requiring only that the
State itself certify the determination. Under Medicaid, implementing this option
would essentially involve an administrative decision, and possibly publishing a Federal


                                                                     DRAFT                6
                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion
Register Notice announcing the decision. For the Food Stamp program, this option
would involve approving a waiver of the Merit System of Personnel Administration. It
would also require use of the Food Stamp Program's statutory demonstration authority,
with the necessary approval of waivers of the Merit System of Personnel Administration
by OPM. The Agriculture Department's waiver authority for demonstrations is intended
to test innovations and is not intended to approve long-term operational alternatives
such as those proposed by Texas. The majority of the 15,000 employees would be at
risk of losing at least their State merit systems protections and possibly their jobs.

Approval of this option would result in additional objections from employee unions and
advocacy groups that believe State employees will treat welfare recipients more fairly
than contractors. It would be supported by States, the National Governors Association
and private corporations which have formed alliances with public agencies to respond
to the RFO.

2. Require the State to perform all eligibility functions. including intake.
processing. and making and certifying the actual determination. This option
would effectively deny the State's request to privatize its eligibility process. Even
though this is the most restrictive option, it may be the most legally supportable option
for the Medicaid program, based on a restrictive reading of statutory and regulatory
requirements involving proper and efficient administration of the program. An
argument can be made that outstationing establishes a precedent for permitting at least
some privatization. However, a legal counter argument could be made that the
Medicaid statute restricts non-government eligibility activities to specific eligibility groups
and situations and, thus, is not applicable to the TIES proposal.

For the Food Stamp Program, this option would mean denial of a waiver of the Merit
System of Personnel Administration. This option also would require the State to
continue to be responsible for the Food Stamp interview and determinations of eligibility
and benefit level. It is also important to note that during the recent debate on welfare
reform legislation, Congressional Conferees reinstated the merit system provisions in
the Food Stamp Act that a previous Senate bill had deleted.
The Federal agencies would receive serious objections from the State and private
corporations. Also, a denial may be viewed as inconsistent with the Administration's
support for allowing the private sector to be more involved in the administration of public
assistance programs.

3. Approve an information system project as a stand alone effort. This option
would allow the State to replace its outdated information systems with a new integrated
system. Once completed, the TANF program could be administered through a private
contractor using the new integrated information system, while eligibility for the Food
Stamp and Medicaid programs could be handled by State employees. This approach
would demonstrate the merits of privatization in these types of programs and not
require a waiver of the other program rules.


                                                                         DRAFT                7
                                                                   Him-Dump Conversion


This approach would require the State to fund the system development effort as it is
being developed. Under the approach outlined in the RFO, the winning vendor would
pay for the system development costs and then recoup its costs through administrative
fees charged to the State once the system was operational. This option may satisfy
the vendor community by reducing the risks associated with the up-front costs of
developing the large system and still allow a significant privatization effort associated
with TAr\1F and other State programs. If information sharing rules can be resolved, the
State may be able to satisfy its cost saving goals.

4. Allow the State to privatize its eligibility process to the same degree that
privatization is permitted under the Medicaid outstationing process. This option
would allow the State to privatize the application, interview, and information
gathering/verification process, but require the State to do and certify the actual eligibility
determination. For the Food Stamp Program, this option would require a redefinition of
 "certification". The Food Stamp statute requires certification to be completed by
merit system employees, while the Medicaid statute allows non-State out stationed
personnel to perform some elements of the application process. States want to
reinterpret the laws so that compliance could be achieved through the automated
processing of data by computers which are programmed under State agency direction
to make eligibility and benefit decisions.

A middle ground could preserve more government involvement in a complex eligibility
determination process that requires judgment. The Federal agencies could revise
regulations (Food Stamp Program) or publish an appropriate Notice in the Federal
Register (Medicaid) to require government review of applications and interview results
before eligibility for benefits is determined (a process comparable to the Medicaid
outstations, or supervisory reviews currently used by many State agencies in the Food
Stamp Program). However, this option may not allow the States to make privatization
initiatives financially worthwhile. The agencies do not have an estimate of how many
State jobs would beat stake under this option.

5. Approve small-scale demonstration projects. The Departments support
privatization initiatives that may result in improved services and/or administrative costs
savings. However, both Departments have concerns about statewide initiatives that
have not been proven to be effective and may seriously affect program access to
low-income households. For instance, TIES is a Statewide initiative in a State that
issues annually approximately 10 percent of food stamp benefits issued nationwide.
The Department of Agriculture further believes it would be imprudent to eliminate the
interview from merit employees on a statewide basis without further testing.

A demonstration limited to a small number of counties, for say 3 years, may be

benefits to all programs for contracting out on a larger scale. It is unclear how the
unions and other States would react to such a compromise.        It is estimated that an
evaluation of a Food Stamp and Medicaid demonstration would cost at least $1 million.

VI RELATIONSHIP TO THE TEXAS EMPLOYMENT SERVICE AND OTHER ES
PROPOSALS

The issue of whether an entity other than the SESA may deliver basic labor exchange
and unemployment insurance services has been raised in the context of Employment
and Training (ETA) sponsored initiatives to build new State workforce development
systems utilizing One-Stop Career Centers. This system building at the local level
involves the delivery of labor exchange services under the Wagner-Peyser Act and may
involve the unemployment insurance program for payment of benefits under the Social
Security Act (SSA). Basic labor exchange and unemployment insurance services are
funded through a dedicated employer tax, the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA).

As noted, this Administration has already permitted Massachusetts to privatize its
employment services, office by office, through competitive bidding.

Unemployment Insurance - Contracting out of benefit eligibility determination and tax
functions raise different conceptual issues. Arguably these functions involve much
more use of value judgments in Government decision making than ES. However, it
may be permissible to contract out those data gathering functions that can be broken
out in an effective, cost-efficient manner, without deterioration of services to claimants
and employers.

The Texas proposal is largely limited to Food Stamps and Medicaid, however, policy
makers should be aware that a decision for these programs may well set precedent for
other public assistance programs such as Foster Care and Child Care.

The merit system requirements remain in effect for the Title IV-E of the SSA (Foster
Care). Historically, ACF has offered the State agencies administering the foster care
program the option of contracting to private, non-profits for such administrative activities
such as licensing, recruitment, supervision and training. ACF is currently in the
process of reviewing the foster care statutory language to determine what effect, if any,
the merit system standards may have on a State's ability to contract out certain
administrative activities in the private sector.

VII Related Issues

Job Protection -- Successorship

As stated above, one of the most significant concerns of organized labor is the risk
State employees face under privatization. Thousands of State eligibility workers could


                                                                       DRAFT                 9
                                                                H~J:)lIJn{l Conversion


lose their jobs if private employees are hired to replace them. Typically, the Federal
Government has taken an interest in economy and efficiency, and recognizes benefits
from the fact that a carryover workforce will minimize disruption to the delivery of
services during any period of transition and provide the advantages of an experienced
and trained workforce.

The Clinton Administration has a clear position with regard to employees working under
Federal service contracts. In October 1994, the President signed E.O. 12933
"Non-Displacement of Qualified Workers Under Certain Contracts". The E.O. protects
workers under Federal contracts from being displaced when a successor contract is
awarded, by assuring them the right of first refusal to employment under the new
contract in positions for which they are qualified.

It is unclear whether such protections could be required of a State seeking to privatize
Food Stamp and Medicaid eligibility workers. However, wherever possible -- especially
under a waiver -- the programs could establish a requirement similar to the EO. These
non-displacement protections would require successor contracts to offer those
employees (other than managerial and supervisorial employees) whose employment
would be terminated as a result of the new contract, a right of first refusal to
employment under the contract in positions for which they are qualified. No employment
openings could be filled under the contract until such right of first refusal has been
provided. This option has not yet been explored with the program agencies.



Entitlement Guarantee

One of the Administration's key principles during the Congressional budget battles of
1995 and 1996 was that Medicaid beneficiaries should retain a legally enforceable right
to Medicaid. HCFA believes this principle could be compromised by allowing private
contractors to make eligibility determinations. HCFA staff suggest making decisions
about the eligibility of needy people for health care is one of the most fundamental
functions of government. Giving so basic a function to the private sector raises
questions about what role government legitimately serves in assuring the protection of
the most vulnerable among us.

Confidentiality

As a result of negotiations between the State of Texas and Department of Agriculture,
the RFO was revised to include language ensuring that the contractor would adhere to
the confidentiality provisions under the Food Stamp Act and that applicants and
recipients would have the right to fully understand how information would be used in
determining eligibility. The RFO currently includes language specifying that the use or
disclosure of information about applicants or clients during the screening and referral


                                                                  DRAFT                10
                                                         Kelt-Dump Conversion

and the eligibility determination and enrollment processes shall be restricted to
purposes directly connected with the administration of assistance programs.
Information supplied for the purpose of determining eligibility may not be made
available to other programs in TIES without the consent of the client. Bidders must
demonstrate how clients will be advised of their right to confidentiality and how their
concurrence would be obtained.

While these revisions ensure compliance with the Food Stamp and Social Security
Acts, the Departments continue to have concerns that wide-scale privatization and
potential loss of merit system protections may undermine the client confidentiality.
Merit Personnel systems have historically established incentives for maintaining the
integrity of public assistance programs. It is uncertain how privatization would
influence the relationship between case workers and clients.

Conflict of Interests in Policy

It should not be assumed that a public employee would be more interested in operating
public assistance programs better than a private employee on the basis of his or her
status as a merit employee. However, private employees hired to carry out the TIES
system may be affected negatively if the contractor does not realize a profit. The profit
incentive raises numerous questions regarding the effect such wide-scale privatization
would have on employees who are responsible for the determination of eligibility as well
as the effect on overall client services. For instance, the TIES RFO proposes to use
client surveys to measure the contractor's performance. Will the interest in maintaining
client satisfaction increase a caseworker's incentive to approve benefits, even if
questionable information about the applicant's eligibility exists? Would profit incentives
alter the current incentives out stationed non-merit employees have for their role in the
Medicaid certification process?

Also, a conflict of interest may be created by the increased flexibility provided to the
States through the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act
(PRWORA) of 1996. While the State of Texas retains the authority to establish
program policy decisions, the State may come under heavy influence by the contractor
to approve policies that assist the contractor in containing costs, possibly at the
expense of client services.

State/Contractor Program Responsibilities

Under the proposed TIES RFO, the State maintains responsibility for developing
program policy, conducting Quality Control (QC) reviews and fair hearings. The TIES
contractor is responsible for implementing program policy. The TIES system,
therefore, adds an additional level to the current bureaucratic structure. The FCS and
the State of Texas have negotiated revisions to the RFO to clarify Federal/State and
State/Contractor relationships. However, the Departments continue to have serious


                                                                     DRAFT                11
                                                            ftelt.JJli.rllfl Conversion
 concerns about the increased complexity of the certification process under a Statewide
 privatization initiative and whether any resulting barriers to participation would be
 created as a result of these split relationships. These relationships may become even
 further complicated if the responsibility for the certification process becomes split
 between State and contract employees.

 Risk of Loss

 The draft TIES RFO specifies the financial incentives for good performance and fiscal
 penalties for poor performance. One financial penalty to the contractor is the liability of
 QC sanctions. The Department and State of Texas have negotiated additional
 language that clarifies that the Federal Government will continue to hold the State liable
 for the QC sanctions and that the Federal and State governments would be responsible
 for negotiating the resolution of any Federal QC liability.

 The Departments have concerns that the contractor may have more interest in cost
 savings and less interest in resulting QC liabilities. Should a contractor experience a
 financial loss due to a QC liability, the potential for litigation between the State and
 contractor would appear to be great. The Departments also share concerns about the
 potential of increased litigation between the State and contractor if the certification
 process becomes a joint responsibility between State and private contract employees.
 The Departments have concerns about how these potential conflicts would affect the
 ongoing operations of the Food Stamp and Medicaid Programs throughout the State.

 Payment Arrangements

  The contract as described in the Request for Offer (RFO) draft provides for a cost
  incentive formula for payment to the supplier. The proposal being contemplated is a
  Fixed Price Incentive Fee/Performance Fee contract based on a 60/40 share ratio cost
  incentive formula for the State and the Supplier. Payment to the selected supplier will
. be monthly at 80% of the negotiated billing amount. The State will review the supplier's
  cost and performance for every three-month period throughout the term of the contract.
  In the event the supplier's incurred costs in any given three-month period are less than
  the total costs contained within the negotiated billing amounts for the same period, the
  supplier will earn and be paid an additional fee in an amount equal to 40% of the cost
  underrun of the three-month period.

 Conversely, if the supplier-incurred costs are over the total costs contained within the
 negotiated billing amounts for the three-month period, the supplier's fee for that period
 will be reduced by an amount to equal 60% of the cost overrun for that period. In
 either case, every three months, the supplier will be paid all costs not paid against the
 three monthly billings plus fees adjusted up or down to reflect its increase or decrease
 resulting from the application of the 60/40 share ratio formula, subject to an absolute
 price ceiling of 110% of the total contract price for the three -month period. In no event


                                                                      DRAFT                 12
                                                                Hek.btIn1p rnn~
shall the supplier be paid, for any given three-month period, a total amount greater
than the ceiling price established for that period.

In addition to the above cost incentive, the State will negotiate a portion of the total fees
available for performance incentives. This will be done on a quarterly basis and the
award determination is unilateral and not subject to dispute by the Supplier.

Because Medicaid and Food Stamps pay for the actual cost to the State programs of
acquiring this system, the above payment arrangement would be eligible for Federal
Financial Participation (FFP).                       .

Potential Financial Conflicts of Interest

Under CFR 45 Part 74 in Subpart E, section 74.81 (Prohibition against profit) no HHS
funds may be paid as profit to any recipient even if the recipient is a commercial
organization, and HHS feels that this could be cited as a basis for limiting the payments
in the above described situation to the costs of the State governmental agency.

The RFO may permit a situation that could give rise to a potential conflict of interest.
The terms of the RFO are such that it permits a potential supplier to be a State
governmental agency. In this situation (where the supplier is a State governmental
agency) the State shall propose an interagency contract with the supplier in accordance
with the Interagency Cooperation Act, Chapter 771, Texas Government Code. In
otherwords, the State would not pay the contractor for services to be performed by the
subcontracting State agency. Rather, the State will pay the supplier/sub-State agency
directly.

This scenario could result in payments to the supplier/sub-State agency in an amount
that would be in excess of what had been paid when the State was performing the
same functions. Consequently, the payments made could be in excess of the cost of
providing the services. This may create an opportunity for intergovernmental transfers
(IGTs) which could return a portion of the State's payment to the sub-State agency
back to the State to be re-used for the State's share of the match for additional
Medicaid expenditures.

According to CFR 45 Part 74 in Subpart E, section 74.81 (Prohibition against profit) no
HHS funds may be paid as profit to any recipient even if the recipient is a commercial
organization. Profit is any amount in excess of allowable direct and indirect costs.
This could be cited as a basis for limiting the payments in the above described situation
to the costs of the State governmental agency.
