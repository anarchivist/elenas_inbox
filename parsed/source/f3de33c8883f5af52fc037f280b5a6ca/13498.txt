TEXT:
Earlier today I faxed you a draft 'Principles Governing
Discussions" of Headwater, and accompanying draft letter to John
Garamendi from Pacific Lumber/Maxxam/Hurwitz, in which the latter
agree that any statements made during the course of Headwaters
discussions will be inadmissible in any future judicial
proceedings.  I am reviewing it, and would appreciate your
thoughts on the documents as well. Thanks!
