    TEXT:
    Dear [xl:

            Today, the House of Representatives can make a bipartisan
    breakthrough in the effort to strengthen our democracy.  The campaign
    finance reform legislation introduced by Representatives Christopher Shays
    and Martin Meehan is tough, fair, and would make a genuine difference in
    the way we pay for elections.

            Passage of this legislation would end the soft money system,
    strengthen disclosure, and curb backdoor campaign spending. Just as
    important, it would show the American people that it is possible to make
    bipartisan progress on this most difficult of political reform issues.   It
    would help make sure that our political system upholds the national
    interest, not narrow interests.

            For years, the Congress has delayed, debated, and ultimately
    denied efforts to reform our campaign finance laws.  A partisan minority
    continues to resist change. But today, the members of the House have a
    chance to change that pattern.   I strongly urge you to vote for the
    bipartisan Shays-Meehan campaign finance reform legislation.
