Question:   Why doesn't this agreement reinstate benefits to all elderly non-citizens?

Answer:     In the context of a balanced budget, we targeted assistance to the most
            vulnerable legal immigrants -- children, the disabled, refugees, and asylees.
            Since most of the elderly on SSI are disabled, most elderly non-citizens will be
            helped by this agreement.

Question:   Will future immigrants be treated differently from those already in the U.S.?

Answer:     There are still some issues being resolved in the negotiations, and this is one of
                    them. The Administration strongly supports providing assistance to
            future immigrants. We believe, however, that sponsors of future immigrants
            should be held financially accountable; thus, we propose that future immigrants
            whose sponsors have signed legally enforceable affidavits of support should have
            their sponsor's income "deemed" or counted during eligibility determination.
            The Republican leadership proposes to provide no benefits to any future
            immigrants.

Question:   Why did you agree last year to eliminate benefits for legal immigrants?

Answer:     These unfair cuts to legal immigrants were part of a much larger welfare reform
                    package which restored America's basic bargain of providing opportunity
            and demanding in return responsibility. We expected to be able to restore
            benefits to legal immigrants this year, and I am glad we have succeeded in
            assisting the most vulnerable -- children, the disabled, refugees, and asylees.
