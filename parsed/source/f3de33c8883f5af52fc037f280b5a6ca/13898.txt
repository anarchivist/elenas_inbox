TEXT:
FYI, USDA called me and also announced at yesterday's interagency
timber mtg. that an agreement in principle had been reached with
the purchaser of the Warner Creek sale. The agreement would
result in the settlement of a number of claims withe purchaser
besides the Warner Creek sale issue, and would involve payment of
about $475,000 from the government to the purchaser.   The proposed
agreement will now go to both the civil and env. division at
Justice for review. USDA is quite concern~d that unless the
agreement is approved quickly, it could fall apart.
Unfortunately, while the details of the proposed agreement remain
confidential, the fact of settlement discussions was leaked to the
media.
DOJ and the Forest Service are concerned that the settlement not
send the wrong signal about protests and the willingness of the
gov. to settle. Either or both of you may hear more about this
over the next couple of days.
