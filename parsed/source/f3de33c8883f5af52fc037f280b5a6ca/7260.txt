TEXT:
We have two requests:

1) Hatch has asked ATF to testify about smuggling next Wednesday. ATF is
awaiting word from us.  This is the same hearing that Leahy's staff asked
us for recommendations.  Bruce, you suggested we recommend Jeff Harris at
MIT -- Gruber's calling him tonight. to get a feel for his views.  FYI--
Gruber feels strongly we'd be better off with an Adminstration witness,
and he thinks he or Larry should testify; however Larry and Linda
Robertson may disagree.

2) Conrad's Democratic Task Force is having a hearing, also on Wednesday,
and they've asked Gruber to testify about bankruptcy. What do you think?
