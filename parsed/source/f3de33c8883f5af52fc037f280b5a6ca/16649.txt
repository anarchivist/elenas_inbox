TEXT:
Gil has requested a private meeting with the President when he is in D.C.
on Sept. 10, 11, or 12. He would like to meet with him reo collective
bargaining.  Personally, I think this is a good idea, and I just want to
confirm that it's ok to submit a scheduling request for this.  FYI: Gil
will not meet with Erskine.
