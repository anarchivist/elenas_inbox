TEXT:
I just got a call from Carol Kando-Tineda at the FTC.  She said they have
two announcements for tomorrow:   1. They will be dropping their Joe Camel
litigation because of the state settlement; and 2. They have asked HHS to
review the voluntary company testing FTC oversees to determine tar and
nicotine levels, and HHS is sending FTC a letter tomorrow saying they are
pleased to be involved in reviewing the science. There is a dispute over
whether low tar is safer and FTC is uncertain whether the government
should even be involved in certifying tar levels.
