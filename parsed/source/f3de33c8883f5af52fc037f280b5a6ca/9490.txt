TEXT:
Assuming we concur w/ NEC,  I think OMB may suggest unspent WTW funds.  I
think we should ask them for other alternatives (which I did once but got
no response), and WTW should only be a last resort.

Gene believes that we should try to get funding for FY99.  While Gene
doesn't think we need the full $25 million this year, he wants us to get
the program started now.

I believe the IDA money in the Senate bill is earmarked within the welfare
research account, a position which we oppose.  If it is provided on top of
the welfare research we would probably not oppose it but would need to
determine how it is financed. Another alternative is to simply support


2000 funding for IDAs and kick this issue until next year.
