TEXT:
We are proposing to get to a ceiling, not an average, of 18, so a ceiling
of 20 would be a cheaper. Unfortunately, in double checking ED's
estimates this morning, I discovered that they in fact calculated the cost
of reducing the average to 18,not the ceiling. This would have no real
cost implications if we thought that part of the local implementation
would involved raising the size of classes currently below 18, but that
seems unlikely.    They are re-running the cost estimaes now;'I should
have new information in about an hour, though if my mathematical
understanding is right, the cost estimates should jump up considerably.

 In which case, a ceiling of 20 may start to look better, though it will
take some work to get the average citizen to fully grasp the. significance
of going from an average of 22.5 to a ceiling of 20.  Perhaps the fuzzy
math crowd could help us explain it.

This glitch notwithstanding Elena, we wouldn't get much economy of scale
by adding an additional grade level. Since the major cost of class size
reductions is hiring more teachers, adding an additional grade--to get to
the same ceiling--increases the cost by about a third.  And while there
may be some economies of scale in expanding the teacher training, this
would be more than offset in most cases by the cost of the additional
space.
