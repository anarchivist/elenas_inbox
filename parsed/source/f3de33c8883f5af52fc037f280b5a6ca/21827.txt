 FYI, the two year state time limit hit in MA today.  There's been a lot of
 local press, protests etc, but not much national attention yet.  I'd asked
 ACF to prepare this Q&A just in case.

 Massachusetts Time Limit Questions & Answers
 12/1/98

 Background: Massachusetts's time limit of 2 years of assistance for
 nonexempt families began on December 1, 1996. Families can receive
 assistance for no more than 2 years within any 5-year period. There is an
 overall limit of 5 years of assistance.  Approximately 41,000 of the over
 81,000 families receiving assistance in December 1996 were subject to the
 two year limit. The state reports that over 35,000 of those families have
 since left the rolls because of parents taking a job, receiving enough
 unearned income or moving to another state making them ineligible for
 assistance.


 Q1 How many people are expected to hit the time limit today?
·

     A1 Massachusetts estimates that 5,000 families reach the two-year limit
     of assistance on December 1. Of those families, around 2,200 have applied
     for extensions while 2,800 will receive notices over the next 2 weeks that
     their benefits will be terminated.

     Q2 Who is exempt and subject to the time limit?

     A2 The State is using the exemption policies that were originally
     approved under a waiver from the Clinton administration in 1995.
     Approximately 50 percent of the families receiving assistance in December
     1996 when the time limit started were exempt. Most were exempt because
     they have a child under 2 years old. Other exemptions included child only
     cases, teen parents, parents with a disability and a parent caring for a
     child with a disability.  All other families were subject to the time
     limit.

     Q3 What exemption policy does the state have?

     A3 Massachusetts gives extensions on a case by case basis.  The state
     Commissioner will consider giving extensions to parents working full-time
     but who are earning less than the cash benefit level, a parent who lacks
     child care to take a job and a parent who has made a good faith effort to
     find but was unable to get a job. These parents must have followed all the
     state's welfare rules.  The state will also grant waivers for continuing
     benefits for children where the parent is incapacitated.

     Q4 What, if any, services will the state provide for families who lose
     cash assistance?

     A4 Massachusetts is developing formal arrangements for services to
     families who lose cash benefits. These arrangements will include outreach,
     referral and case management programs; transportation services; vocational
     evaluation and subsidized employment; and assistance for non-English
     speaking families.
