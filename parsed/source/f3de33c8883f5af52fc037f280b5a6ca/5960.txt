TEXT:
Elena,

I just spoke with Paul Yandura from the Fair Housing office at HUD.  They
may be interested in doing an event in April with the Secy and the Pres.
to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the Fair Housing Act. HUD is
putting on a series of events in April, but is interested in doing one big
one that focuses on equal opportunity; fair lending;
anti-discrimination, etc. This is still just a nugget of an idea, but I
wanted to get your initial reaction. The event could be the -President's
April race event, but would be broader to include the whole housing
opportunity agenda. What do you think?

Julie
