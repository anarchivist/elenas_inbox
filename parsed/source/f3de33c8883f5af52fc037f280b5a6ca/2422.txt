 Spoke to Damon Silvers of AFL-CIO Legal Dept.     They aren't running

 these cases, but do try to follow them.     There's something called the

 Coalition for Workers Health Funds (headed by Brian McQuade) that

 serves as a coordinating group; theConnerton and Ray law firm is

 heavily involved.



 Cases have been filed in 38 states, involving several hundred union

 funds.     If a class were certified in some cases, it could include as

 many as 2,500 plans and 30 million participants.     Some cases have been

 dismissed in whole or in part.    Other cases (Okla., Wash., Ore. W.

 Va.) are set for trial.



 AFL has no position on the cases; BCTD may have endorsed.     Most

 Taft-Hartley funds--other than those involving workers in the tobacco
I.

industry--have joined in the litigation.
