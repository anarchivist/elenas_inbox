TEXT:
FROM JUDITH WINSTON & MINYON MOORE

On Thursday, Feb. 26th at 4:00 p.m. (room tbd) the White House/PIR staff
will
begin weekly Race Initiative coordinating meetings to assess the status of
various projects as we move forward in the upcoming weeks and months. The
purpose of the meetings will be to have a central reporting mechanism for
staff members who are working on various projects relating to the
Initiative.   These meetings will also allow you the opportunity to


provide input and (red flag) any issues that might present a political
problem for the PIR or the White House.  It is extremely important that
you attend these meetings or designate a representative who can provide a
report on your assignment. The meeting will last 1 hour.   If you have any
questions, do not hesitate to call Judy or myself.    Angelique will
e-mail you with a room and send a reminder e-mail.   Thanks for your time,
energy and cooperation.

(JW & MM)
