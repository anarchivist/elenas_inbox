Fla. gov urges opposition to national tobacco deal

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. June 16 (Reuters) - Gov. Lawton Chiles on Tuesday urged
state senators to
oppose a national tobacco settlement he says will cost Florida $4 billion
in lost revenue.

Eight months after landing a $11.3 billion settlement with tobacco
companies to offset costs of
smoking-related illnesses, Chiles said in a letter that amendments to a
federal tobacco deal could
strip as much as 35 percent off the state's settlement.

Chiles said federal lawmakers, who in June 1997 reached a conceptual
agreement with the industry
on a national accord, are proposing a $514 billion settlement that funnels
money away from states to
fund federal priorities.

In addition, there are no guarantees that states that have already struck
deals will receive an amount
equal to their individual settlements.

" I am even more concerned that these amendments are not related to the
public health goals that
were a fundamental part of the June 1997 agreement and Florida's
individual state settlement,"
Chiles wrote.

Federal lawmakers are trying to forge a national settlement with the
industry, which has been
besieged by litigation and has during the past year opted for the first
time in its history to settle
claims.

The lawmakers are attempting to finalize a deal before they adjourn for
the summer.

Mississippi, Texas and Florida have each reached out of court agreements
with the industry.


Minnesota brought its case to court and in May signed a consent decree.

Though varying slightly, all states have argued that tobacco companies
should reimburse state
taxpayers for Medicaid costs incurred for smoking-related illnesses.
