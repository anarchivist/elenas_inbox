                             American Indians want their share of
                             $206 billion nationwide settlement

                             June 3, 1999: 8:17 a.m. ET



                    NEW YORK (CNNfn) - American Indian tribes
                    Thursday said they filed a lawsuit against U.S. tobacco
                    manufacturers for being improperly excluded from the
                    industry's $206 billion settlement with 46 U.S. states,
                    according to lawyers for the tribes.
                        The federal suit seeking class-action status was filed
                    in U.S. District Court in San Francisco, and alleges
                    tobacco makers stood in the way of the tribes' due
                    process and civil rights because their settlement
                    accounted for American Indian populations without
                    actually directing any of the proceeds to them.
                       A settlement between four major tobacco
                    companies and 46 states to end individual
                    health-related lawsuits unveiled last November was
                    supposed to cover all citizens' health costs. Among
                    other things, the settlement deemed that the tobacco
                    giants - R.J. Reynolds, Phillip Morris, Lorillard and
                    Brown & Williamson - fund a $1.5 billion anti-smoking
                    campaign and open previously secret industry
                    documents.
                       The Indians' suit filed late Wednesday alleges that
                    native Americans were excluded from the November
                    settlement by being tallied as part of the dollar figure,
                    but not receiving benefits from the funds directed
                    toward state regulators and other agencies. It also
                    alleges that native Americans were a specific group


                    targeted by tobacco producers, similar to teenagers
                    and women.
                        "There was simply no legal, political or moral
                    justification for failing to include the tribes in the
                    settlement process," said Bill Audet, lead attorney for
                    the tribes. "Native "Americans have been targeted as
                    tobacco consumers and Native American youth,
                    adults, and women of reproductive age have the
                    highest rates of smoking," he added.
                       Four states -- Florida, Minnesota, Mississippi and
                    Texas -- had already settled separately for a total of
                    $40 billion.
                       Tribal representatives from California, Oklahoma,
                    Colorado, New Mexico, Washington and Arizona will
                    discuss the lawsuit at a Thursday news conference in
                    Oakland, Calif. Other tribes will be allowed to join in
                    the case, which was filed on behalf of American Indian
                    tribes across the country.
                       On Wednesday, shares of Philip Morris (MO)
                    closed down 9/16 at 39, while RJR Nabisco Holding
                    Co. (RN) lost 1/4 to 31-1/8. Loews Corp. (LTR) ,
                    parent company of Lorillard, declined 1-11/16 to
                    79-11/16.
