TEXT:
1. The "civil Education" story in this morning's NYTimes: Diana will be
getting you some more detail on this; this was the Jeremy Rifkin
initiative that was offered to us as a WH event and we turned down. There
was a press conference today announcing this partnership.

2. Agular v. Felton:   Riley has an appropriations hearing tomorrow, and
will not be taking any initiative to get into this story, though his
office expects phone calls. Kevin Sullivan will be faxing us Q's and A's
and talking points; he was hoping McCurry would take this up during his
press briefing and claim some credit for POTUS on religious freedom.
However, I suspect that will be unlikely given the trip/events planned for
tomorrow.  Do you agree?
