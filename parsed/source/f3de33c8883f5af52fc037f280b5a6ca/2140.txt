Gene Sperling and Rahm Emanuel would like to compile a report of all of
the
activities undertaken as a part of the budget rollout since Friday, May 2.

Please send a reply email to me by noon tomorrow (Wednesday) with a list
of
what you, your office, and your principal have accomplished since Friday.
Specifically, your list should include a report on those activities and
calls
listed on the strategy document that was circulated on Friday as well as
any
other activities or calls that you have completed (e.g., press calls,
outreach
calls, documents faxed).

please also list the activities that you, your office, and your principal
plan
to conduct in the days ahead (e.g., constituency briefings, conference
calls,
follow-up press calls).  Following up on this effort .-- and on your
reports
we plan to hold a meeting later in the week to discuss further budget
rollout
activities.

Thanks very much, both for your timely response to this email, as well as
for
your patience and efforts on Friday.
