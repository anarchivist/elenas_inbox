TEXT:
FYI, on the 45 day comment period, the relevant section of the law
is in Title I, Section 402 (a) (4) .
In sum, it says that a state must submit a plan that includes the
following:
"a certification ... which shall include assurances that local
governments and private sector organizations--
         (A) have been consulted ....
         (B) have had at least 45 days to submit comments on the
plan and the design of such services."
I am trying to reach Anna Durand, who did HHS's legal work on
this.  I'll follow up with you.
