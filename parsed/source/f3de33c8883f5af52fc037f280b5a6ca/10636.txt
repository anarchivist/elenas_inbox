   LOS ANGELES, Jan 8 (AFP) - The Spanish name Jose became the most
popular name in 1998 in California and Texas, two of the biggest
states in the country, the Los Angeles Times reported Friday.
   The name reflects the burgeoning Hispanic populations in those
states, who are now more likely to cling to their heritage than
adopt Anglicized names as waves of previous immigrants did.


       The shift is all the more notable in a country that predictably
    rotated John, Robert, James, Michael and David at the top of the
    list of boys' most popular names for nearly a century.
       "Thirty years ago, most people would not have given their child
    an ethnic name," said Edward Callary, an English professor at
    Northern Illinois University and editor of the American Name
    Society's journal.
       "A lot of folks tried to blend in and fold into American society
    as quickly as they could," Callary told the Times.
       The popularity of the name Jose is more than just a reflection
    of a growing Hispanic population, he said. It also shows that this
    population is more comfortable with showing its ethnicity.
       Michael Shackleford, the Social Security Administration actuary
    who compiled the list, said when he saw that Jose topped the list of
    names "it was a little bit of shock," though it made sense.
       Following Jose in terms of popularity in California were the
    more traditional names of Daniel, Michael, Anthony and Jacob.
       The most popular girls' names were Jessica, Ashley, Emily,
    Jennifer and Samantha.
