TEXT:
Here is a more coherent description of today's conference calIon the big
Summit speech, with Prof. Benjamin Barber of Rutgers, Baer, Waldman, Ann
Lewis, and me today.  It didn't particularly lead anywhere. Barber kept
saying that we have to hit big citizenship themes, and avoid falling into
the trap of just making Summit commitment announcements like everyone
else.

Don hearkened back to the original goal of AmeriCorps -- to provide a
common experience of service for all young people,·as a rite of initiation
to adulthood as the military once was. He was playing with the idea of a
general call to service for all young people. Given the difficulty of
expanding AmeriCorps, people wondered whether we could expand Learn and
Serve, the Corporation's program for school age kids, but that seemed a
bit lame.

We could see how many new service opportunities we could provide for young
people -- CADCA's commitment to train 200,000 young people to be "leaders"
in anti-drug stuff; more and different academies, like police; give them
to Joel Berg/USDA to volunteer on public lands/environment or do
gleaning.    We'll discuss further at our meeting tomorrow afternoon.
