PRESIDENT CLINTON AND VICE PRESIDENT GORE UNVEIL HISTORIC LONG-TERM CARE
INITIATIVE TO SUPPORT FAMILY CAREGIVERS AND HELP ADDRESS GROWING LONG-TERM
CARE NEEDS
January 4, 1999

        Today, President Clinton is unveiling an historic new initiative
to support Americans with long-term care needs and the millions of family
members who care for them.  This four-part, $6.2 billion (over five years)
initiative takes important steps to address complex long-term care needs
through: (1) an unprecedented $1,000 tax credit that compensates, for
formal or informal costs, Americans of all ages with long-term care needs
or the family caregivers who support them; (2) a new National Family
Caregivers Support Program that provides a range of critical services for
caregivers such as respite, home care services, and information and
referral; (3) a national campaign to educate Medicare beneficiaries about
the programs' limited coverage and how best to evaluate long-term care
options; and (4) a proposal to have the Federal government serve as a
model employer by offering quality private long-term care insurance to
Federal employees at group rates.

        The President will be joined by First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton,
Secretary Rubin, Secretary Shalala, and OPM Director LaChance to unveil
this initiative at the White House. The Vice President and Mrs. Gore are
participating from an adult day care center in California, one of four
states with model statewide family caregiving resource programs.

MILLIONS OF AMERICANS HAVE LONG-TERM CARE NEEDS

More and more Americans have a range of long-term care needs.  Over five
million Americans have significant limitations due to illness or
disability and thus require long-term care. Approximately two-thirds are
older Americans.  Also, millions of adults and a growing number of
children have long-term care needs because of health conditions from birth
or a chronic illness developed later in life.

The aging of Americans will only increase the need for quality long-term
care options. The number of Americans age 65 years or older will double
by 2030 (from 34.3 to 69.4 million), so that one in five Americans will be
elderly.  The number of people 85 years or older, nearly half of whom need
assistance with everyday activities, will grow even faster (from 4.0 to
8.4 million).

MULTI-FACETED INITIATIVE TO SUPPORT FAMILY CAREGIVERS AND ADDRESS GROWING
LONG TERM CARE NEEDS.   The President is unveiling a four-part initiative
that is designed to address the broad-based and varied long-term care
needs.  It will: (1) provide immediate support and assistance for the
millions of Americans who care for family members with major long-term
care needs; (2) educate the elderly and people with disabilities about
long-term care issues and options; and (3) promote new promising strategy
directions for long-term care policy for the twenty-first century.    The
President is also asking the Vice President to host a series of forums
around the nation to raise awareness about the need to support family
caregivers and address the growing need for long-term care options.

The long-term care proposal being unveiled today by the President and Vice
President includes:

Supporting families with long-term care needs through an historic $1,000
tax credit. This initiative, for the first time, acknowledges and
supports millions of Americans with long-term care needs or the family
members who care for and house their ill or disabled relatives through a
$1,000 tax credit.  This new tax credit supports the diverse needs of
families by compensating a wide range of formal or informal long-term care
for people of all ages with three or more limitations in activities of
daily living (ADLs) or a comparable cognitive impairment. This proposal,
which supports rather than supplants family caregiving, would provide
needed financial support to about 2 million Americans, including 1.2
million older Americans, over 500,000 non-elderly adults, and
approximately 250,000 children.  It costs $5.5 billion over five years and
phases out beginning at $110,000 for couples and $75,000 for unmarried
taxpayers.

Creating an unprecedented National Family Caregiver Support Program.
Recent studies have found that services like respite care can relieve
caregiver stress and delay nursing home entry, and that support for
families of Alzheimer's disease patients can delay institionalization for
as long as a year.  This new nationwide program, strongly advocated by the
Vice President, would support families who care for elderly relatives with
chronic illnesses or disabilities by enabling states to create
"one-stop-shops" that provide: quality respite care and other support
services; critical information about community-based long-term services
that best meet a familiesD, needs; and counseling and support, such as
teaching model approaches for caregivers that are coping with new
responsibilities and offering training for complex care needs, such as
feeding tubes. This program, which costs $625 million over five years,
would assist approximately 250,000 families nationwide.

Launching a national campaign to educate Medicare beneficiaries about the
programs' limited coverage of long-term care and how best to evaluate
their options. Nearly 60 percent of Medicare beneficiaries are unaware
that Medicare does not cover most long-term care, and many do not know
what long-term care services would best meet their needs. This $10 million
nationwide campaign would provide all 39 million Medicare beneficiaries
with critical information about long-term care options including: what
long-term care Medicare does and does not cover; how to find out about
Medicaid long-term care coverage; what to look for in a quality private
long-term care policy; and how to access information about home-and
community-based care services that best fit beneficiaries' needs.

Having the Federal government serve as a model employer by offering
quality private long-term care insurance to Federal employees.   The
President will also calIon Congress to pass a new proposal that allows
OPM to use its market leverage and set a national example by offering
non-subsidized, quality private long-term care insurance to all federal
employees, retirees, and their fa~ilies at group rates. This proposal,
that costs $15 million over five years, will provide employers a
nationwide model for offering quality long-term care insurance.   OPM
anticipates that approximately 300,000 Federal employees would participate
in this program.
