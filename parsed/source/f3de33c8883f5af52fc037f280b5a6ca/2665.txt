MEMORANDUM FOR THE CHIEF OF STAFF

FROM:                    ELENA KAGAN

RE:                      $3 BILLION WELFARE TO WORK PROPOSAL


Administration Proposal

         As you know, Bruce Reed engaged in a series of conversations last week with
 Secretaries Herman, Shalala, and Cuomo regarding the $3 billion welfare to work fund
 included in the budget agreement. As a result, the attached one-page document,
 "Administration's Welfare to Work Jobs Challenge Proposal" was faxed to the Hill and other
 interested parties on Friday.

       This document reflects five key principles upon which we have Administration-wide
 agreement:

 1.        Welfare to work funds -- no less than the 50% specified in our proposal -- should go
           directly to cities, and cities should be subject to the same rules and application
           processes as states.

 2.        Funds should be awarded competitively, to promising welfare to work projects, not
           distributed based on a formula. Under this enterprise zone model, the grants would be
           awarded by the Department of Labor in consultation with HHS and HUD.

 3.        At least some funds -- 20 percent in our proposal-- shall be distributed as performance
           based bonuses, to encourage the job placement and retention of long-term welfare
           recipients living in high poverty/high unemployment areas.

 4.        Public service jobs should be allowed in high unemployment areas and on Indian
           reservations.

 5.        Strong language forbidding worker displacement should be included.

              Bruce's conversations with the Secretaries were a follow-up to an inter-agency staff
      meeting held Monday, May 19th. At that meeting, attended by senior staff from DPC,
      NEC, CEA, HHS, Dept. of Labor, and HUD, there was a strong sentiment that the Cabinet
      officials had to be directly consulted on the program structure, particularly the issue of
      which agency, HHS or DOL, would take the lead and how funds would be distributed.



                                                             Automated Records Management System
                                                             Hex-Dump Conversion

      .The President proposed the $3 billion Welfare to Work Jobs Challenge during the
1996 campaign and included it as part of his budget proposal. The $3 billion fund was
included in the final bipartisan budget agreement. Currently, House Ways and Means
Democratic and Republican committee staff are developing detailed proposals, and they
have asked for our input. Key differences among the proposals include:                '

·       Do funds flow directly to cities? Ever since the proposal was announced during the
        campaign, the mayors have expected 100% of funds to flow directly to them,
        although Bruce and Gene Sperling said they were always careful to describe the plan
        as 50% to cities and 50% to states. A key question is whether the funds will go
        directly to the cities or flow through the states to the cities. Administration officials,
        the mayors, and our union allies all feel strongly that some funds should flow directly
        to the cities -- thus our proposal sends 50% to them. The budget agreement, and the
        draft Ways and Means GOP document, distribute funds to the cities through the
        states (the budget agreement says funds are "allocated to states" and "a share of funds
        would go to cities/counties ... "). The House Ways and Means Democrats would
        provide funds to both states and communities (percentage is unspecified).

·       Are funds awarded competitively or by formula? Again, there is strong sentiment
        within the Administration and among our allies that grants should be awarded on a
        competitive basis in order to target scarce funds to successful welfare to work efforts.
         In particular, since not all cities run welfare to work programs, we concluded it
        would not make sense to provide funds to cities that do not do so. The House Ways
        and Means Democrats agree with us that funds should be awarded competitively.
        The House Ways and Means Republicans award 100% offunds to states, 80% of
        which must be distributed to political subdivisions within the state based on a
        formula determined in part by the governor. The budget agreement allocated funds
        "to States through a formula and targeted within a State to areas with poverty and
        unemployment rates at least 20 percent higher than the State average. A share of
        funds would go to cities/counties with large poverty populations commensurate with
        the share of long-term welfare recipients in those jurisdictions."

       Displacement. Our proposal, and the House Democratic one, makes specific
references to safeguards to prevent worker displacement; the House GOP document does
not.
