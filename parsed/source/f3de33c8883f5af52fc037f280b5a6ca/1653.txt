DRAFT--DRAFT--CLOSE HOLD


        As you know, Texas has asked for federal pennission to issue a "request for offers" for a
private company to operate an integrated enrollment system for Medicaid, Food Stamps,
Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, and potentially other nutrition and workforce
programs.

        We believe we must give Texas an answer immediately. The state has engaged in good
faith discussions with various agencies for more than 9 months, and state officials are now
publicly criticizing the Administration for the delay.

        We believe we have a proposal which will break the stalemate -- a proposal based on
existing Medicaid laws and regulations that allows the state to explore innovative ways to deliver
public services while ensuring beneficiaries' rights to assistance and maintaining public sector
jobs. As shown in the chart below, our plan would allow Texas to use private contractors to
obtain infonnation from applicants and assist them in completing their applications for benefits.
However, the detennination of eligibility would be conducted by public sector employees.



                                           Texas            Union         Our Proposal

                                                                          Hex-Dump COil~ersioil
Our plan would:

       ·       Protect beneficiaries by ensuring that only public sector civil service employees
               determine benefit eligibility, consider appeals, and conduct quality control
               operations.

       ·       Maintain public sector jobs associated with the determination of eligibility for
               benefits.

       ·       Allow Texas to achieve program efficiencies through a bidding process. The
               Texas legislature, in authorizing the project in 1995, required that any savings
               fund additional health and human services programs. The Bush Administration
               has not committed to how these savings would be reinvested, but their letters
               estimate, perhaps optimistically, that the savings could provide health care
               coverage for an additional 150,000 needy children.

        We would allow the state of Texas to release a request for offers based on these
principles. Once the state chooses among the bids, the state would be required to submit to HHS
and USDA the proposed contract for approval.

Background on the Texas Proposal

       The new welfare law explicitly allows states to contract with private entities to administer
Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (T ANF). Because of this new authority in T ANF, a
few states are seeking new contracting authority for Medicaid and Food Stamps as well, so they
can operate privately-run, one-stop eligibility centers. In addition to the Texas proposal,
Wisconsin has submitted a proposal which would allow 10% of its welfare caseload to be
operated by private entities. This percentage could significantly increase in later years if
approved.

         Federal agencies and the state of Texas have been negotiating since June 1996 over the
state's proposal to privatize the administration of T ANF, Medicaid, Food Stamps, and certain
other federally-funded nutrition programs. Last spring, the state legislature passed a welfare
reform plan with bipartisan support, with endorsements from Lt. Gov. Bob Bullock and other
leading Democrats. This legislation did not specifically call for privatization but authorized the
state to conduct a bidding process. Under the potential proposal, private contractors could
collect information about and make eligibility determinations. The State would retain control
over the appeals and quality control processes.

         Texas argues that it cannot proceed with plans to contract out TANF (as the welfare law
allows) unless the Administration permits private contracting for Food Stamps and Medicaid,
because maintaining separate eligibility systems for these programs would create administrative
difficulties. To take the most obvious problem, a dual system would require many individuals
to go to one location to apply for TANF and another location to apply for Food Stamps and
Medicaid.

                                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion .

       As you know, labor leaders would like us to refuse the Texas request entirely. They see
even limited privatization as a dangerous precedent and have made clear that they view this
decision as critically important to public employee unions.

Recommendation

        All the relevant agencies and White House offices agree that the Administration should
take a moderate position which would give Texas the opportunity to seek a partially privatized
integrated system. This position would draw the line on the basis of our existing Medicaid law
and practice, which would allow privatization of some but not all administrative functions.
Under this approach, the application, interview, and other information-gathering can be done by
private employees; the eligibility determination itself, as well as appeals and quality control,
must remain in the hands of public employees. In addition, the Administration should require
that any contract Texas enters into protects applicants and beneficiary rights consonant with
current privacy law protections and protects against the possibility that private firms will use
procedures that lead to inappropriate denials -- or, as OMB notes, inappropriate issuance -- of
program benefits.

       This general approach has both strong precedent and good sense behind it. The
Medicaid program already allows private hospital workers to do intake and eligibility work, up to
the point of actually determining eligibility. For the Food Stamp program, however, this
approach would require the granting of administrative waivers. Allowing privatization of these
functions, conditioned on appropriate contract incentives and safeguards, strikes the right balance
between allowing states to explore innovative ways to deliver public services and ensuring that
applicants' and beneficiaries' rights are protected. It is true that this approach will displace
some state workers (though many fewer than would potentially be affected by Texas' proposal).
We have crossed this bridge already in Medicaid and other contexts. For example, the
Department of Labor has granted a waiver to Massachusetts to contract out all employment
services and is prepared to do the same for other states as well.

        In line with this view, we recommend that we inform Texas of the principles we will
apply in reviewing any privatization contract and give formal permission to the State to issue its
RFO. Once the State accepts a bid, we will review whether the contract appropriately accords
with our principles.
