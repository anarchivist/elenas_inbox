TEXT:
At the AFL-CIO Executive Council meeting, the POTUS shopped his idea of a
broad/national labor/industry partnership re: training of technology
workforce for 21st.   Kitty Higgins and I met w/ Morty Bahr (CWA) the
morning after the POTUS visit to follow-up.   Bahr as you may know has done
a great deal of work in this area w/ Southwest Bell, Lucent Technologies
and many many others.  I also met w/ Ed Fire (IUE) who has done a lot of
work in this area w/ GE ---    Bahr is submitting a list of industry and
education thinkers and doers in this area for our consideration --I will
follow-up today withe afl-cio to see what they have -- following the
POTUS discussion, the VPOTUS had similar discussion w/ the Executive
Council ----

I thought this information .got to all of you via Kitty Higgins -- can you
please let me know the status, next steps. etc.    I will do the follow-up
w/ Kitty to see where we are on the POTUS intiative.   thanks
