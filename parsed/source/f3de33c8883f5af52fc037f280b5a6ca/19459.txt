TEXT:
Seth Harris tells me that a situation similar to the one in California has
sprung up in New York, on compliance with FLSA/minimum wage for workfare
slots. DOL hears that the state is planning to issue guidance that would
say FLSA doesn't apply to workfare.  So they plan to reach out as they did
in California by first calling the state with a general offer of technical
assistance, followed by a letter. Once they officially see the draft
guidance that is problematic, they plan to tell the state that they got it
wrong.  Seth notes the examples in the workfare series in the NYTimes that
indicate people aren't getting minimum wage.  I assume we concur with
their course of action. This could get big, since the city is already
running such a large workfare program for both TANF and general
assistance.
