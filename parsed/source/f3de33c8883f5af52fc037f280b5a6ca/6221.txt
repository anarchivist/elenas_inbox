TEXT:
Next week a joint Budget Committee/Education Committee Education Task
Force, chaired by Bill Frist, is holding a hearing; general topic relates
to direction fed gov't should take in education, and the R's are expected
to criticize existing fed programs and push for rolling existing programs
into block grants.  Checker Finn is chief Rep. witness

Dem Budget committee staff (Amy Peck Abraham) left me a message, asking me
to testify for the Dem '. s, laying out President's agenda.

I've always had the sense that DPC and NEC staff generally don't testify,
though I'm not sure if I'm right.  There are other Administration
candidates -- Mike Smith ( though ED is trying to limit his exposure as
they try to push his confirmation forward) and Gerald Tirozzi, Ass't Sec'y
for EI/Sec education.

I'm comfortable personally that I could handle testifying ok, though I'm
not sure (1) that WH staff should testify and, (2) that I'm necessrily the
most appropriate Administration witness anyway.

Any guidance before I get back to Amy, to find out more about what she has
in mind?
