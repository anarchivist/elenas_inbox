TEXT:
I learned that Riley is tentatively planning to go to California on May 18
-19 to do some Unz-related events, probably in LA and SF. They have not
determined any details yet, and Leslie Thornton told me this afternoon
that Riley wants to know what we think before he commits to go.

I'm basically ok with this, though I do see a slight downside, simply
because it draws us deeper into the fray and pushes our luck. As far as I
can tell, our recent, carefully planned announcement seems to have
successfuly threaded the political needle, opposing Unz while keeping the
advocates from going nuts and while not coming off looking like we
support the status quo.

On the other hand, if Riley does some events (including perhaps a fund
raiser if the Unz opponents still want him to do that)  he can earn some
points among Latino's and educators for the Administration if Unz passes
as expected; it will be harder--though not impossible-- for them to
complain that we didn't do enough. And if he sticks to our script, the
odds of him tripping up are slim.

I'd like to see what Karen and others think about this (Maria had already
heard about it and thinks its a good ieda) , Any problem if I float the
idea with others, or do you have a reason for killing it?
