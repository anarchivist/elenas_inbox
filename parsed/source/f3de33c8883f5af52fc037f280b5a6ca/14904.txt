I believe you spoke with Emily about the briefing for democratic
governors' staff members on the Fair Labor Standards Act and welfare.

Does 2pm on Tuesday, 3/18, in the Ward Room work for you? It's the best
time for the governors' offices and other Administration folks, but I'll
start over if you are not available. Thanks.
