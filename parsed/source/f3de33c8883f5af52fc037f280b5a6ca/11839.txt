 Update on nursing home quality and enforcement problems. In recent days, the Senate Aging
 Committee, chaired by Senator Grassley, has been releasing a series of GAO and HHS IG
 reports critical ofHCFA's nursing home quality enforcement activities. The reports indicate that
 HCF A has failed to ensure that the states are fulfilling their nursing home quality obligations.
 The reports findings include that: HCFA has failed to pursue the investigation of serious quality
 complaints, inadequately addressed problems associated with repeat offenders, and inadequately
 intervened in cases where health and safety violations resulted in actual harm to residents. Some
 of these findings have been or are being addressed by a nursing home quality imitative you
 unveiled last year. Others are new and are disturbing. In response, we have instructed HCF A to
 aggressively improve their enforcement activities by requiring states to investigate complaints
 that allege harm to residents within 10 working days, increasing the minimum fine for facilities
 violating quality standards to $50 to $1,000, and making it easier for states to impose fines of up
 to $10,000 for quality violations. We are also working on additional enforcement improvement
 provisions which are outlined below.


 Signing ceremony for the Nursing Home Resident Protection Act. Next week, you are
 tentatively scheduled to sign into law legislation which prohibits the transfer of Medicaid patients
 by nursing homes wishing to privatize their entire resident population. This legislation was
 inspired by cases in Florida in which residents actually died as they were being transferred. The
 legislation that will be presented to you explicitly prohibits nursing homes who decide to
 withdraw from the Medicaid program from evicting Medicaid patients. At this event, we are
 contemplating one or more announcements to underscore our commitment to nursing home
 quality enforcement. The first is a new legislative proposal that creates new Federal criminal (5
 to 10 years in prison) and civil penalties (of up to $1,000,000 per facility in a corporate chain out
 of compliance) for individuals, facility chains, or management companies if they engage in
 conduct that results in a pattern of physical or mental harm to residents. In addition, we are
 contemplating using this as an opportunity to criticize the Republican bill for its across the board
 12 percent cut which will result in a significant reduction in nursing home quality enforcement
 activities.

  Patients Bill of Rights (PBOR) markup. On Thursday night, the Senate Labor Committee
  completed its mark up of the Patients Bill of Rights. Senator Kennedy offered the
  Daschle-Kennedy PBOR as a substitute for the Chairman's mark and it failed along a party line
. vote. Most of the subsequent strengthening amendments were also defeated among party line
  votes. The Democrats were pleased with your statement in support of a strong, enforceable,
  PBOR at the beginning of this mark-up process and have indicated they wish to work closely
  with us to develop an amendment strategy when this legislation makes it to the Senate floor. It is
  our hope that we will find a more receptive group of Republicans on the Senate floor to these
  amendments. Senator Chafee and Senator Specter's interest in this area provides some level of
  encouragement; however, as each day passes it appears more clear that the House is likely to
  have a stronger set of provisions, which will hopefully help us in ajoint House-Senate
  conference ifthis legislation reaches this stage.

 Update on Medicare. In the wake of the Medicare Commission vote and your announcement
                        Hex-Dump Conversion

of your intention to propose your own Medicare reform initiative, we are developing a range of
options for your consideration. This work will be complicated by the March 30th release of this
year's Social Security/ Medicare trustees report, which is expected to push out the exhaustion
date of the Medicare trust fund by a number of years. Not only will this impact on our strategy
surrounding the dedication of the surplus to Medicare, it will change the scoring of many ofthe
underlying provisions of any proposal. Because it is likely that it will be much easier to reach
your previously stated goal of pushing out the exhaustion date to 2020, we believe that it is
advisable to stop using any reference to the year 2020 and/or the number of years you wish to
extend the life of the trust fund. Instead, we suggest confining our comments to statements like:
"We are dedicating 15 percent of the surplus ($686 billion over 15 years) to Medicare." This will
protect our current policy position while enabling us to potentially modify how we describe the
impact of this infusion of dollars to the Medicare program.

Update on TANF/ Medicaid guidebook. Next Monday, we have asked HCFA to release new
guidance for states to ensure that those eligible for Medicaid -- especially children -- are enrolled.
 There have been a number of reports that some states may be inappropriately preventing
families from obtaining Medicaid coverage by imposing waiting periods for issuing an
application or determining Medicaid eligibility. This guidance makes it clear that these delays
are impermissible and inconsistent with the law and underscores your long standing commitment·
to ensure that welfare reform does not reduce access to the Medicaid program. The letter and
guidebook will be issued prior to the release of a report from George Washington University's
Center for Health Policy Studies which implies that the welfare reform statute has created
barriers to receiving Medicaid. While we believe the guidance is expected to be well received by
advocates, we do not expect states to raise serious concerns about this communication.

Update on the FDA's recent action to limit the use of antibiotics in animal feed. The FDA
has increased evidence that the routine use of antibiotics in livestock to promote growth may
diminish the drugs' power to cure infections in people. As more people consume antibiotics
through foodstuffs, they appear to be more resistant to antibiotics when in need of
pharmacological intervention. In response, the FDA has released a draft of new regulations that
would require manufacturers to test new livestock drugs to see ifthey foster the growth of
resistant bacteria that cause disease in people, both before and after they are approved for use. If
they are shown to foster resistance, FDA can curtail their distribution or remove them from the
market entirely. The drug and agriculture industries say that the FDA is unnecessarily restricting
access to antibiotics, which they insist have not been proved to harm people and are essential to
producing affordable meat and poultry. Public health advocates believe that the use of these
antibiotics for animals should be severely restricted, if not eliminated altogether, in order to
prevent the further development of resistant bacteria. The new FDA proposal is consistent with
your "superbug" initiative that provides a significant increase in funding ($25 million) to finance
a new electronic disease surveillance network that facilitates the timely transmission of
information to physicians in order to ensure that new strains of bacteria are identified swiftly and
treated effectively.


Update on stem cell research. On Friday, the journal Science will publish a letter from 73
                       Hex-Dump Conversion

prominent scientists, including 67 Nobel prize winners, that supports plans by NIH to consider
financing research with stem cells that originate from human embryos. This should bolster our
efforts on Capitol Hill to push back legislation designed to repeal NIH's authority to make this
decision.
