TEXT:
It seems like there will be very few stories on the hearings: only CNN
sent a camera, the major papers weren't going to do a story -- we still
need to hear from AP. Of course, someone could still do something -- but
we put out the word to everyone that this is a story about the need for
the Adminstration's legislation and they seem to have basically stayed
away.
