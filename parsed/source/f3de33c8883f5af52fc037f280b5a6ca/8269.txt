TEXT:
The summary we have of Hatch's proposal is the one Breaux sent us on May
15th (labeled "draft 2"). Do you have a more up to date version?

 We've found nothing introduced by Hatch in Thomas or Lexis/Nexis.  I've
called Breaux's office to see if they have an updated one, but hesitate to
call Hatch or Feinstein directly.
