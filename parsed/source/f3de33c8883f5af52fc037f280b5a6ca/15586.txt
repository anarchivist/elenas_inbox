TEXT:
Ok folks, we're goin back to Texas. Virgina and Janet have the meetings
going for Wednesday afternoon at 2:15 p.m. and 3:00 p.m., back to back on
the Hill.

Erskine would like to do a prep meeting at 10:00 a.m. Wednesday morning.

Of course, if there is any new paper you think Erskine should read, I
would love to have it.


THANKS.

Jason
