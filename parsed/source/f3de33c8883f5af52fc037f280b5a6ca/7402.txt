Subject:         Tobacco Meeting - OPL

At the OPL staff meeting this morning, the OPL staff brainstormed on
tobacco and how to get our groups more invested in the issue (not just the
public health groups). We all agreed that a meeting in the Roosevelt Room
with our key opinion leaders was key.  The meeting should be a high level
meeting with Erskine. The message to the leaders:   the time is now, we
need their grassroots to get involved, this is for our kids. What do you
think?
