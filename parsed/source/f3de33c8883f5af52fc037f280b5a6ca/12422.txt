    Sorry it has taken so long to get back to you on this event, but we had to
    check on the Bumpers' schedule and with the folks at NIH.

    It appears that there are no other dates prior to the 18th that work and
    NIH feels compelled to do something on or before the 18th since there are
    so many public events planned for the anniversary of the President's
    announcement.

    Is there any chance of revisiting this? If not, we thought we would
    approach the First Lady since she any Betty Bumpers have been such
    tireless advocates for immunization.

    Let me know what you think.

    Thanks so much for your help.

    Sandy
