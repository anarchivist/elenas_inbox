TEXT:
On Wed., October 2 at 4pm, we will have our pow-wow on Medicaid
and welfare reform with HHS (Monahan, Ebeler, Sally Richardson,
etc.). OMB health branch has been invited and should come.
Emily, you may want to attend.  As to the rest of you, it wouldn't
be a tragedy if you had to miss it, but you will be a better
informed person if you attend.
(Come to think of it, Keith and Richard, we probably need one of
you because of SSI, AFDC/TANF links.)
