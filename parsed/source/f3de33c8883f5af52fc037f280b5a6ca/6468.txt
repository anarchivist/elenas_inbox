 TEXT:
 Here is what I would suggest Riley say to the LA Times if asked about UNZ:

 1.   It is very important that we help LEP kids learn English

 2. We are looking at the effectiveness of the federal bilingual education
 program, to make sure it is working as well as it should; we will be
 prepared to make changes in it if necessary. There is no one best way to
 education LEP students, but any approach that is used must be done
 effectively.

 3.  I am very concerned about any proposal that would limit local
 schools to the use of just one, unproven approach to helping students
 learn English.

 Also, in case there was any misunderstanding ... I love our staff meetings,
 and I know that Bill will miss them once he leaves!
