TEXT:
I just picked up off the machine an LRRM, directed to you, on
proposed amendments to the IDEA provisions on students with
disabilities. I've been working on this, so I'll get back to OMB.
I assume this was delivered to you in the normal course, but, if
you've been working on this too, let me know, and we can respond
together. Thanks.
