On February 25, the National Council Advisory Board is scheduled to make its final
recommendations on its appropriate schedule of mammography screening for women between
the ages of 40 and 49. The Board is likely to be more sensitive to the concerns raised by
proponents of annual screening than they were previously. (Specifically, they may weigh the
evidence on the advantage of early screening more favorably than previously and be stronger
about the need to evaluate this on a year by year, case by case basis by physician and patient).
However, it is unlikely that they will recommend that women have annual screenings.

It is our strong belief that we should defer to the recommendations made by the scientists in this
regard and avoid'any impression that we are pressuring the Department or the Board to modify
their recommendations. Having said this, we should make certain that the communication of
their recommendation is handled sensitively and in a way that ensures that women understand
that they should consult with their physician as to the advisability of having annual screenings.
Moreover, we think we should seriously consider taking the public position that all insurers,
whether they be public (Medicare, Medicaid, etc.) or private, should pay for screenings that
physicians and patients determine as medically necessary.
