waldman decided we needed to release this today since AP had a blurb on
the proposed FEC rule this morning.  He has sent it over Lockhart.   It is
a revision of the one I did yesterday.  Somewhat shorter but still to the
point.

won't care .. go for it

I strongly support action to end the soft money system raised by both
political parties. That is why last year I asked the Federal Election
Commission to ban soft money, under its current legal authority.  I am
very pleased that the agency's general counsel has proposed a new rule
prohibiting national parties from raising soft money.   Now I ask the
members of the Commission to step up to their responsibility and act,
within their legal authority, to end soft money.
