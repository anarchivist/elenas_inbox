TEXT:
This is a reminder that your comments on the subject testimony are due.
Please provide any comments no later than 4:30 p.m. today.  If I do not
hear from you by then, I will assume you have no comments and will clear
the testimony.

(Please note that on pages 7 and 8, the DOJ indicates that the Attorney
General will not use remaining FY 1997 or Asset Forfeiture account funds
to pay for the Teamsters election rerun if congress objects. This is a
more deferential posture than the Department took in its letters last year
to the Commerce-Just ice-State and Labor-HHS-Education conferees during the
FY 98 appropriations process.)

Please call or e-mail if you have any questions.   Thanks!
