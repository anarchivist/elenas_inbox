TEXT:
Hi,

Kathleen Wallman has okayed this draft, and she suggested that you should
also review it.  I've faxed you the incoming.  The draft follows for your
edits/approval:

Thank you for writing to me.      I appreciate your words of support
for my Administration.

I understand your concerns and the concerns of many members of
the labor movement resarding Sprint. As you know, I am firmly
committed to protecting the rights of America's working men and
women, and I applaud the commitment of labor unions to alert our
collective social conscience to the importance of these rights.
That is why, my Administration has worked hard to foster a pro-
worker, pro-family environment in corporate America.  We feel
that it is important to encourage good corporate practices
wherever they arise, and, while Sprint must improve its labor
record, its efforts to create jobs and move people from welfare
to work are important as we seek to foster a trend of increased
corporate responsibility and citizenship.

I value having the benefit of your perspective on this issue, and
I look forward to working with you as we continue our efforts to
protect the rights of America's workers.
