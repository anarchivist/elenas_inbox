TEXT:
For some unknown reason, Mickey told Carper that it was OK with the White
House for the NGA to adopt policy on FLSA. Not sure why he did this,
since he knows what I had to do to keep Carper/Voinivich from bringing it
up for a vote in NGA Executive Committee last week.

How bad is this? We of course will disagree with their policy.     Should I
try to get Mickey to pull back?
