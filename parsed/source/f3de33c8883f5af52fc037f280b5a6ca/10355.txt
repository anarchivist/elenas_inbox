TEXT:
Sally and Elena--we know everyone is really busy but· a meeting with NCLR
would be very helpful before we finish the initiatives process--for lots
of reasons--I've asked Leslie to set up this meeting for late next week,
if Gene can't do it, Sally will you please attend and Elenga--you're
critical.

I have been trying for over a week to get someone from NEC to meet with
NCLR without success.  In addition, Cecilia told me that you all had a
conversation about possibly Elena Kagan being a good person to meet with
them.  I have e-mailed Laura Emmet (Elena) and Sally Katzen to try and get
something set up.  I have not heard at all from NEC and Laura suggested
they meet with Julie Fernandes and would try to put it in Elena's
schedule.  I don't think Julie is the proper person for this particular
meeting on a myriad of budget issues. Time is a moving. Would you mind
sending Elena and Sally an e-mail to see if they will be willing to meet
with them, unless of course you disagree.  Thank you.
