TEXT.:
FYI. As you know, OMB has been in discussions with INS and DOJ re:
whether INS is going to meet their naturalization productivity projections
for the first quarter of FY 1999.  As of today, INS has yet to produce a
briefing for OMB that describes, in detail, where they are and how they
intend to meet their goals.  However, because the new naturalization fee
takes effect at the end of this week (Friday), Doris wants to brief the
Hill asap on the status of their naturalization effort.  OMB (Deich) and
DOJ (Colgate) are very opposed to her doing any kind of briefing on the
Hill before we have a better sense of the numbers and before we are all
comfortable with how they are telling this story.

I just wanted to give you a heads up on this in case Doris contacts you
re: this issue.
