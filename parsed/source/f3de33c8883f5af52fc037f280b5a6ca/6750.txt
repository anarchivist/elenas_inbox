TEXT:
I heard from Cassandra Butts on Gephart's staff.  They are drafting a bill
on the House side that is identical to Daschle's Equal Pay bill (which he
will be re-introducing sometime soon).  She said that they are very eager
to have White House support.  I said that we had a process in progress,
but that there were some reservations about the wage data and the
compensatory/punitative damages about which we were supposed to hear from
the agencies later today.  I think that they would very much like to meet
with us as soon as possible to discuss ways to amend their bills to make
them more attractive to the WHo
