                                          Talking Points

        As I said at the 40th anniversary of integration at Central High School in Little Rock,
racial equality has been a driving obsession in my life. That's why I created this board and
asked each of you to help me lead a national dialogue on race in our country. Today, we are
moving forward in this dialogue. .

        I want to stress to you how important the work you are doing is. I am counting on each
of you to be tireless communicators -- bringing this initiative to communities all across America,
just as you did at various conferences this weekend. And I hope you will recruit more
community leaders to embrace the goals of the initiative and to help you with your work.

          I know you have already made an important contribution by focusing your work on two
very fundamental areas, Education and Economic Opportunity. I believe that unequal access to
high quality education and economic opportunity in America is at heart of so many of the racial
divides that continue to plague our communities.

        We have a full agenda for today and for the year. First, we must study and understand
the cold hard facts of diversity in America. So this afternoon, the Commission will be hearing
from noted scientists and demographers who will share their research on America's changing
population patterns and attitudes on race.

         Second, we must have free and open dialogue in order to reach reconciliation and build
bridges of mutual understanding. Today, I am pleased to announce that I will be convening the
first town hall meeting on race relations in our country on December 2. I hope to lead
Americans of all ethnic, racial, cultural and religious backgrounds in a full and frank discussion
on the issue of race in our country. This will be the first of a series of town hall meetings led by
myself or the Vice-President

       Finally, we must take action to give all Americans the tools to make the most of their own
lives. This summer, I announced a new initiative to send more of our most talented teachers to
our neediest school districts by offering them scholarships for their own education. All children
deserve high standards and a world-class education.

        And later today, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Andrew Cuomo will
announce new efforts to end housing discrimination in America once and for all. First, HUD
will issue a S15 million grant to help 67 private, non-profit housing groups combat housing
discrimination. And second, at my direction, Secretary Cuomo will be doubling the number of
housing discrimination enforcement actions over the next four years. It's clear that housing
discrimination has kept segregation alive in too many cities and too many neighborhoods. It has

kept Americans from sending their children to the schools of their choice. Ifwe can't live
together, we will never come together.

        So I look forward to today's discussion. How we build One America -- how we deal with
the lingering problems and the limitless possibilities of our growing diversity will be one of our
greatest challenge in the 21 st century. We must find a way to embrace our vast cultural and
religious diversity while recognizing the common ideals and single destiny we all share as
Americans.

        I'd like to start off the conversation with a question. What does it mean to be an
American? Which values do you think cross all religious, cultural, racial barriers? Which
values unite us?
