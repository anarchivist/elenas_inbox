TEXT:
The budget says:

"In addition to these Medicaid costs, tobacco-related health problems have
cost the Medicare program billions of dollars each year.  To recover these
losses, the U.S. Department of Justice intends to bring suit against the
tobacco industry, and the 2000 budget contains $20 million to pay for
necessary legal costs. The Administration will propose that all
recoveries will be used to preserve and protect Medicare for future
generations."
