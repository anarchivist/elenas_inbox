TEXT:
John and I have talked to Treasury about expanding the LIHTC to permit the
tax credit to subsidize common areas within a housing credit propoerty
even if that area is made to individuals who do not reside within the
property. Michael Barr, head of Treasury's Community Development Office
likes the idea. Unfortunately, but not suprisingly, Tax Policy hates the
proposal, at least at the career staff level.

Barr is trying to move this proposal at Treasury. John O. and I believe
we can push this through later this Spring, after we get the legislation
to increase the Credit moving on the Hill. We think that an event this
Spring to combine child care and housing and use the event to force
Treasury's hand on this issue.
