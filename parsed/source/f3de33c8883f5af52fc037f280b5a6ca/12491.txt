TEXT:
ED/Ann O'Leary called to let me know that Sec Riley is planning to give
Podesta a call in the morning regarding the scheduling of the ESEA
transmittal -- namely their interest in the 5/12 date.
Riley took a call this afternoon from Sen 'John Kerry -- who asked that his
education proposal be added to our bill if it was going to be further
delayed.  After ·the call, Riley walked down to Mike Smith's office asking
where things stood in terms of a firm date for ESEA.   The Secretary is
apparently concerned that continued delays are hampering the Dept's
ability to shape the education debate on the hill.

Ann asked whether we were in a position to confirm the ESEA date, so she
could let the Secretary's office know.

On a related note,  Ann also said that the Department intends to release
the Social Promotions guide prior to the ESEA transmittal -- whether or
not they have a WH event.  ED has received very positive feedback from the
civil rights and education communities on the guide and believes it will
help them make their case on social promotions if the guide is public
prior to the bill's release.  You may want to raise this with Mike Smith
at the ED strategy meeting if you don't want them to go forward with thls
plan.
