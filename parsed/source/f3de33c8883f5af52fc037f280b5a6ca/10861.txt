                            DATE:            January 25, 1999
                            LOCATION: Presidential Hall
                                             Room 450, Old Executive Office Building
                            BRIEFING TIME: 9:45am - 10:lOam
                            EVENT TIME:      10:15am - 11:15am
                            FROM:            Bruce Reed


I.    PURPOSE

      With welfare caseloads down by nearly half since 1993 and over 10,000 companies
      committed to welfare-to-work, you will announce today a new package of initiatives
      designed to ensure that those remaining on the welfare rolls make a successful
      transition from welfare to work, with a new focus on increasing the employment of
      low-income fathers so they can support their children. Your $1 billion
      Welfare-to-Work initiative will help 200,000 more people go to work. At least $150
      million will go toward helping fathers fulfill their responsibilities to their children
      by working and paying child support. Remaining funds will focus on long-term
      welfare recipients with the greatest obstacles to employment. You also will
      announce today that your budget will contain new welfare-to-work housing
      vouchers, transportation funds, and tax credits to help those on welfare get to work
      and stay employed. Taken together, these initiatives will provide parents the tools
      they need to support their children and succeed in the workforce.

II.   BACKGROUND

      Welfare-to-Work Funds with a Focus on Fathers
      Your $1 billion Welfare-to-Work initiative will help 200,000 long-term welfare recipients
      in high-poverty areas move into lasting unsubsidized employment. It is an extension of
      the two-year $3 billion Welfare-to-Work program you secured in the Balanced Budget
      Act. The initiative, as reauthorized, will provide at least $150 million to ensure that
      every state helps fathers fulfill their responsibilities by working, paying child
      support, and playing a responsible part in their children's lives. Under this
      proposal, states and communities will use a minimum of20 percent of their formula
      funds to provide job placement and job retention assistance to low-income fathers who
      sign personal responsibility contracts committing them to work and pay child support.
      This effort will further increase child support collections, which have risen 80 percent
                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion

since you took office, from $8 billion in 1992 to $14.4 billion in 1998. Remaining funds
will go toward assisting long-term welfare recipients with the greatest barriers to
employment to move into lasting jobs. The reauthorized program also will double the
welfare-to-work funding available for tribes.

The Department of Labor will announce today the availability of $240 million in
competitive grants from the current $3 billion Welfare-to-Work program. These funds
will support innovative local welfare-to-work strategies for individuals with limited
English proficiency, disabilities, substance abuse problems, or a history of domestic
violence.

Transportation and Housing for Families Moving From Welfare to Work
You also will announce today that your budget will contain $580 million for welfare
to work housing vouchers and transportation assistance to help those on welfare get
to work and stay employed. Your budget will provide $430 million for 75,000
welfare-to-work housing vouchers, including $144 million in new funds for 25,000
additional vouchers. This is a 50 percent increase over the 50,000 vouchers you secured
last year. The vouchers will help families move closer to a new job, reduce a long
commute, or secure more stable housing so they can perform better on the job. Your
budget will also increase Access to Jobs transportation funding from $75 million to
$150 million, doubling the number of individuals and communities that can receive
transportation assistance. This competiti,:e grant program supports innovative state and
local transportation solutions such as shuttles, van pools, new bus routes, and connector
services to mass transit to help welfare recipients and other low income workers get to
work.

Private Sector Hiring from the Welfare Rolls
You will announce that your budget will include $530 million to extend for one year the
Welfare to Work and Work Opportunity Tax Credits to encourage more employers to hire
welfare recipients and other disadvantaged individuals. Already, in response to your ,
challenge two years ago in the State ofthe Union, 10,000 companies have joined the
Welfare to Work Partnership and hired, retained, and promoted hundreds of thousands of
former welfare recipients. Forty-two percent of these companies are very small
businesses (25 or fewer employees), while four percent are very large businesses (3,000
or more employees).

Welfare Rolls Decline as More Recipients go to Work
You will release state-by-state data showing that welfare caseloads are at their lowest
level in 30 years and that the welfare rolls have fallen by nearly half since you took office.
  Since January 1993, 36 states have had caseload declines of more than 40 percent and
nationwide the rolls have fallen by 44 percent, from 14.1 million to just below 8 million.
Recent information released by the Department of Health and Human Services also
shows that the percentage of welfare recipients working has tripled since 1992, that an
estimated 1.5 million people who were on welfare in 1997 were working in 1998, and
that all states met the first overall work participation rates required under the welfare
                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion
