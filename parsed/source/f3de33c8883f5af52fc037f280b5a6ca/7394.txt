Headline: TEEN BIRTH RATES DOWN IN ALL STATES
New Government Report on Teenage Birth Rates Includes State
Rates by Race and Ethnicity


     HHS Secretary Donna E. Shalala announced today that, according
to a new HHS report, the teen birth rate declined substantially
nationwide from 1991 to 1996. Secretary Shalala announced the
findings at a reception honoring the first anniversary of the
National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy.

     According to this new government report' focusing solely on
teenage childbearing, between 1991 and 1996, teen birth rates


declined for white, black, American Indian, Asian or Pacific
Islander and Hispanic women ages 15-19. The rate for black teens
until recently the highest -- experienced the largest decline, down
21 percent from 1991 to 1996 to reach the lowest rate ever reported
for blacks.

     The latest state-by-state data, from 1995, show that teen birth
rates have declined in alISO states and the District of Columbia.
Among the states with the lowest rates - under 35 births per 1,000
teens -- were Vermont, New Hampshire, Minnesota, North Dakota,
Maine, and Massachusetts. Areas with double that rate at 70 or more
births per 1,000 women aged-15-19 included the District of Columbia
followed by Mississippi, Texas, Arizona, New Mexico, Arkansas,
Nevada, Georgia and Alabama.

     "This report shows that our concerted effort to reduce teen
pregnancy is succeeding," said Secretary Shalala.  "The federal
government, the private sector, parents and caregivers are all
helping send the same message: Don't become a parent until you are
truly ready to support a child."

     Shalala also noted the important work of the National Campaign
to Prevent Teen Pregnancy and its 1998 National Campaign Honorees,
who are implementing innovative teen pregnancy prevention programs
across the U.S.

     The Campaign was created in response to President Clinton's
1995 State of the Union challenge to "parents and leaders all across
this country to join together in a national campaign against teen
pregnancy to make a difference." The honorees were recognized in
the categories of: building common ground, corporate leadership,
effective programming, male involvement, media innovation, state
leadership and teen leadership in preventing teen pregnancy.

     The new National Center For Health Statistics report, "Teenage
Births in the United States: National and State Trends, 1990-96"
brings together the latest and trend data to profile the teenage
mother. It has teen birth rates for each state by race and Hispanic
origin fo help explain some of the differences across states. While
the decline in the teenage birth rate varied among States, those
with both high and low rates succeeded in achieving significant
reductions between 1991 and 1995. The variation between states
reflects, in part, national patterns by race and ethnicity.

      Each year in America, almost 500,000 teenagers give birth.   The
 preliminary U.S. birth rate for teenagers in 1996 was 54.7 live
 births per 1,000 women aged 15-19 years, down 4 percent from 1995
 and 12 percent from 1991 when the rate was 62.1.  These recent
 declines reverse the 24 percent rise in the teenage birth rate from
.1986 to 1991. There has been success in lowering the birth rate for
 both young and older teens, with rates for those 15-17 years of age
 down 12 percent between 1991 and 1996 and the rate for those 18 and
 19 down 8 percent.

     Still, teen birth rates are higher today than in the mid-1980s
when the rate was at its lowest point, 50-53 births per thousand
teens age 15-19. The national teen birth rate was at its highest in
1957, at 96 births per 1,000 women ages 15-19.  However, most
teenagers giving birth in the 1950s and for the next two decades
were married while the vast majority of teenage mothers today are
  ..
unmarried.

     Teenage mothers are much less likely than older women to
receive timely prenatal care, are more likely to smoke and less
likely to gain the recommended weight during their pregnancy, and
more likely to have a low birthweight infant, as shown in the annual
reports from NCHS' National Vital Statistics System.

     The new HHS report on teenage childbearing is the first in a
new series of statistical summaries designed as an easy-to-read
presentation of the key data and facts on critical public health
issues. The National Center for Health Statistics is a part of the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  The new report is
available and can be downloaded from the NCHS Home Page on the
Internet at http://www.cdc.gov/nchswww. Copies are also available
from NCHS at (301) 436-8500.
