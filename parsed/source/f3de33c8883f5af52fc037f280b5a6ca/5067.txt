TEXT:
Diana and I met with Emily Bromberg yesterday to go over all the issues in
dispute in the TANF negotiations. 'She was very supportive of all our
tough on states proposals. However, after thinking about it for a day,
she now has serious doubts about whether the President would hold up under
the pressure from governors on waivers, particularly the pressure that
would come to bear if we denied caseload reduction credits and high
performance bonuses to states that continued inconsistent waivers.  She is
still supportive of our other proposals to impose tough penalties on those
that fail work rates, etc.
