As requested, quickie write-ups on potential events ...

Children Exposed to Violence Initiative:   Each year millions of children
are the victims of violent crime and child abuse, or are exposed to
domestic violence -- and many of these kids grow up and victimize others
themselves.  To help break this cycle of violence, the President could
announce the availability of $10 million for 15 cities to help launch a
new Administration initiative to improve the criminal justice system's
response to child victims and witnesses.  Led by the Deputy Attorney
General, Eric Holder, this year-long effort would focus on the following
areas:

(1) Improved Law Enforcement, including specialized training to improve
police and prosecutors' handling of child witnesses and victims; new
"Court Schools" to facilitate children's interaction with the courts and
reduce secondary victimization by the criminal justice system; more de
tailed reviews of child deaths; and the establishment of Crimes Against
Children units in prosecutors' offices.

(2) New Legislative Reforms, including changes to federal and state laws
dealing with felony murder/pattern of abuse statutes, child neglect and
endangerment, penalties for committing crimes in the presence of children,
sex offender notification, and other issues related to child victims and
witnesses.

(3) Targeted Violence Prevention/Intervention, including Child
Development/Community Policing programs that link law enforcement with
mental health professionals to focus on troubled kids; Child Advocacy
Centers to promote a community-wide response to child victims and
witnesses; and nurse home visitation programs designed to educate parents
and reduce child abuse.



(4) Increased Awareness of Child Victimization as a National Problem,
including a DOJ-sponsored National Summit on Children Exposed to Violence;
four regional forums to promote the recommendations from the Summit; and
the involvement of prominent child advocates (i.e., Oprah Winfrey, Rob
Reiner and others) .

Drug Offender Accountability:  Following up on his directive calling for
"zero tolerance" of drugs in prisons, the President could make a series of
announcements reinforcing the Administration's strong commitment to using
the coercive power of the criminal justice system to reduce drug use and
crime.  Specifically, he could make the following announcements:

 (1) The availability of up to $50 million in FY 99 for prison drug
testing/treatment. As part of the recent budget deal, the Administration
fought for and won the flexibility for states to use their federal prison
grants to drug test and treat prisoners/parolees. A state-by-state
break-out of this funding could be released, as well as the official
solicitation for funds.   Also, MD Governor Glendening or Lt. Gov.
Kennedy-Townsend -- who already plan to use these funds to test parolees
-- could attend and speak in support of this initiative.
 (2) $200 Million in additional funding for FY 2000. The FY 2000 budget
will include $200 million to support drug testing, treatment and sanctions
throughout the criminal justice system, and this information could be
leaked as part of -- or just prior to -- the event.
(3) $4 Million for Drug Detection in Prisons. ONDCP is prepared to
release $4 million in grants for 8 states (MD, CA, AZ, AL, FL, NJ, NY and
KS) to implement drug detection technologies to help keep drugs from being
smuggled into prisons.
(4) Report on Drug Testing/Treatment. Although not yet final, the Justice
Department is working on several related reports that might be ready for
release at this event.
Crime Statistics: The President could announce the release of the Justice
Department's 1997 National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), which we
expect to show a continued decrease in crime victimization rates. The
NCVS measures overall victimizations reported by households, including
violent crimes and property crimes. Last year's victimization rates were
the lowest recorded since the inception of the survey 23 years ago; if the
rates continue to decline -- as we expect -- they should hit record lows
again.   Also, we may be able to combine this with the release of $16
million in COPS grants to hire over 200 officers.    (NB: The timing for
these announcements requires further coordination with Justice.)
