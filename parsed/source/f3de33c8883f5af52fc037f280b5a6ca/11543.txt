PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
STATEMENT ON THE DEATH OF JUSTICE HARRY BLACKMUN
WASHINGTON, DC
March 4, 1999

        Before I begin, let me say a few words about Justice Harry
Blackmun, who as you may know died today at the age of 90.   It was
President Woodrow Wilson who called the judiciary D&the balance wheel of
our entire system.DB Justice Blackmun was a strong and steady hand on
that balance wheel.   In his 24 years on the Supreme Court, Justice
Blackmun served with compassion, distinction, and honor.   Every decision,
and every dissent, was as firmly grounded in the people he served as in
the Constitution he so faithfully revered. He struck that balance in the
landmark decision he wrote protecting womenD,s right to reproductive
freedom -- a decision that has stood the test of time for a
quarter-century.   He struck that balance in decisions on our legacy of
racism, and the ways to overcome it.

        One of the great honors of my public life was the opportunity
Hillary and I had to get to know Harry Blackmun and his wonderful wife,
Dotty.  I have seen up close his passion for the people of our country,


for our history, for our laws and institutions, and for the mission of
moving us forward.  On behalf of Hillary -- and the millions of Americans
whose rights Justice Blackmun protected -- I want to send my condolences
to Dotty and their three daughters.  The President and the Congress gave
Harry Blackmun the title D&JusticeD8 -- but it was Harry Blackmun himself,
in his lifeD,s work, who truly earned it.
