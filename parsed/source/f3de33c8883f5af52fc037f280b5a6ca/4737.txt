                         National Anti-Drug Media Campaign
                               Questions and Answers
                                   October 11,1997


Q.     Can you tell us more about the President's media campaign?

A.      The number one priority in the President's 1997 National Drug Control Strategy is to
motivate our kids to reject the use of illegal drugs. The President took the lead on educating our
young people about the dangers of illegal drugs by putting $175 million in his FY 1998 budget
for an unprecendented anti-drug media campaign. By signing the Treasury-Postal
appropriations bill into law yesterday, the President officially launched his media campaign.

        While television ads have been found to be among the most efficient and effective means
of reducing drug use, anti-drug public service messages and news coverage of drug issues have
dropped markedly since 1989. The media campaign will involve the use of both paid and public
service advertisements to get the message to kids and their parents about the dangers of drugs.

         We will continue to rely on the outstanding materials developed by the Partnership for a
Drug Free America and the Ad Council, as well as new messages we will develop specifically for
the initiative.


Q.     Why can't you rely on public service ads (PSAs) --used in public health awareness
       efforts for decades- instead of a paid media campaign?

A.      Public service ad time been decreasing for several years. Within the currently available
PSA time slots, it has become increasingly difficult to target specific drug related messages to
particular audiences. Virtually no PSAs appear in prime time.

       Targeting 9-17 year olds through PSAs has always been difficult. A paid media
campaign will allow us to target specific programs or times when we know young people are
watching-- making our efforts more effective.


Q.     What kinds of messages will be part of the paid campaign?

A.     The paid campaign will be limited to messages about illegal drugs. The public service
component may include a variety of drug-related messages including mentoring, underage use of
alcohol and tobacco, and other issues.

Q.     How was the $195 million amount for the campaign determined?

A.    It is based on an estimate from the Partnership and ad agencies for the level of ad
exposure necessary to change attitudes and increase risk perception. The funding level is also
                                                                       Automated Records Management System
                                                                       Hex-Dump Conversion
    similar to the market value of the public service time given to the Partnership in 1990 and 1991
    when we had lower drug use figures. It also happens to be consistent with the amounts spent by
    ad companies to support major consumer marketing campaigns for food and other products.

    Q.     Won't the paid ads dry up the public service time?

    A.     We will work with the media industry to secure commitments for commensurate
    pro-bono public service efforts to bolster our paid ads. We are currently exploring these issues
    with the broadcast and cable television industries, the Partnership for a Drug Free America, the
    Ad Council and others. We have received some encouraging responses from several major
    networks.

    Q.     When can we expect to see these ads?

    A.     The Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) has already started its initial
    planning ofthe media campaign, including a comprehensive assessment of the most successful
    media-related strategies-- from public health campaigns to marketing products to kids. We will
    work closely with Congress to move forward on the media campaign so we can air these ads as
    quickly as possible.


    Q.     Is there a role for the private sector in the media campaign?

    A.     Yes. A critical component of our initiative is reaching out to the private sector and
    challenging corporations to underwrite certain local portions of the campaign. A number of
    major corporations have already contacted ONDCP to express their interest in participating.
