TEXT:
The attached newspaper article (based on my speech yesterday in San
Francisco) incorrectly states that I have "broken ranks" with the
Administration on needle exchange programs.  It came to my attention
courtesy of an AP writer following up on the report. The AP writer seemed
to be careful and thoughtful; I suspect that his "A" wire story will get
it right.  Fact is, the Sacremento Bee got my quotes right, but I guess
they wanted a hotter story so they added the sterno on their own!   Didn't
want you to get blind-sided by the story.



AIDS czar breaks ranks, endorses needle programs

                      By Dorsey Griffith
                      Bee Staff Writer
                      (Published March 26, 1998)

SAN FRANCISCO -- The White House's AIDS czar publicly
contradicted the Clinton administration Wednesday and endorsed
needle exchange programs as an effective way to combat the spread of
the AIDS virus.

Sandra Thurman, appointed by the president last year as director of the
Office of National AIDS Policy, predicted that scientific evidence
showing that needle exchange programs work without promoting illegal
drug use will prevail in setting the administration's AIDS policy.

"Public health should be driven by science, not politics," she said,
addressing the National AIDS Update Conference in San Francisco.

Also Wednesday, renowned AIDS researcher Dr. Jay Levy told
attendees of the weeklong conference that a protein found in certain
cells of long-term HIV survivors could lead to the development of an


    AIDS vaccine. And he suggested that the triple-drug therapies now
    prescribed to anyone newly infected with HIV, the virus that causes
    AIDS, may actually harm the body's own ability to fight the disease.

    Thurman, whose remarks were interrupted by a heckler demanding
    federal action on needle exchange programs, said that every day 33
    Americans become infected with HIV as a result of drug injections. "1
    am haunted by the responsibility to use my position to do everything I
    can to stop this carnage," she said in advancing needle exchange
    programs.

    She said scientific studies have validated the view of public health and
    medical organizations -- that handing out sterile syringes to people who
    inject illegal drugs reduces the spread of AIDS without leading to more
    illegal drug use.

    Last year, the National Institutes of Health reported that "there is no
    longer any doubt that these programs work" and urged immediate
    action on them.

    About 100 cities and counties throughout the country have needle
    exchange programs, including San Francisco. In Sacramento County,
    supervisors have opposed a needle exchange program.

    The federal government prohibits the use of federal money to pay for
    the programs and Clinton's drug czar, Barry R. McCaffrey, wants it to
    stay that way.

    Both McCaffrey and Thurman have said they would leave it to Donna
    E. Shalala, secretary of health and human services, to make the
    decision about funding.

    "Hopefully, as our nation's top public health official, Secretary Shalala
    would consider science first and foremost in determining any public
    health policy," said Derek Gordon, communications director of the San
    Francisco AIDS Foundation. "Sadly, up until now it would appear that
    politics and not science has been leading the decision-making in the
    president's administration."
