TEXT:
Just was t'alking to Gary Claxton about another matter and he asked me to
forward on a message to you guys. When Gary met with Governor Chiles'
staff today, they made a pitch for us to use the Governor to help push the
tobacco bill.   I asked if the Governor was now in the position of strongly
pushing for a Federal bill and Gary said the Chiles' staff said yes.

At any rate, Gary just wanted to make sure you guys knew this. Just
making another one of my major contributions to the tobacco bill ...
