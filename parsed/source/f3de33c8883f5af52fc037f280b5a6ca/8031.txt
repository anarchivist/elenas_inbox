Attached is a slightly revised and shortened version of the memo I sent
Elena over the weekend. Please have her look at this instead of the draft
she received Friday.

This memo makes clear that we will have an Administration bill ready to
transmit by the end of the week--and that we think it is premature to do
so.  Karen, Maria, Janet and I think we should hold off.

It is important that we get this to POTUS today, so that we know if we are
introducing the bill this week or not.  The outside groups and the
Hispanic Caucus know that there is a chance we could introduce our
alternative within the week, and their pressure on us will grow as every
day passed. Riley is meeting with the CHC on another issue tomorrow, and
it would be helpful if we had a sense of direction before he goes up there.

Janet Murguia has requested that this memo come from Bruce and Larry,
given the large role that Congressional strategy plays in it.

I have not shared this internally, though Janet, Maria, Karen, et. al.
have asked to see what we are going to ·send.  If you are not going to get
to this for a while today, do you have a problem if I circulate it.=================

 DRAFT

                                             June 5, 1998


 MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

 FROM:

 SUBJECT:       Bilingual Education


        On June 4, the House Education and Workforce Committee reported H.R. 3982, the
 English Fluency Act, introduced by Rep. Frank Riggs. This bill raises many of the same
 programmatic issues and political dynamics as the Unz Initiative in California. The purpose of
 this memo is to update you on our strategy for addressing this bill.

 I.      Overview of Riggs Bill

          The bill would eliminate the existing Bilingual Education and Emergency Immigrant
  Education programs and would (1) distribute funds through a block grant that is not targeted
  toward school districts with the highest quality programs and greatest funding need; (2) require
  states to withdraw funding from local programs in cases where students do not master English
  within two years and set a 3-year limit for serving any individual student, though it would not
  provide any extra help for students or corrective action for programs that need it; (3) not require
  States to maintain their own efforts; and (4) eliminate professional development programs
  designed to prepared qualified ESL and bilingual education teachers. The bill also seeks to
  sharply curtail the enforcement powers of the Education Department's Office of Civil Rights by
. voiding existing voluntary compliance agreements between OCR and local school districts with
  regard to educating LEP students and by requiring OCR to publish -- and the Congress to ratify --
  new guidelines and compliance standards for Title VI enforcement. These provisions would
  weaken enforcement of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and result in increased litigation.

 II.     Development of Administration Alternative

         We are on track to have an alternative bill based on the principles you approved and
 Secretary Riley articulated in his statement of opposition to the Unz Initiative completed and
 ready for transmittal to Congress by the end of this week. This bill would amend (rather than
 replace entirely) the existing bilingual education program. Specifically, it would require (1)
 school districts to establish a goal of preparing LEP students to enter successfully regular English
 classrooms in not more than three years, (2) annual assessments of student's English proficiency;
 (3) additional help for students not on track to English proficiency; (4) a corrective action plan, to


                                                   1
meet the 3-year goal. The bill would also guarantee local flexibility by removing the existing
cap on programs that do not use the students native language.


III.   Congressional Dynamic

       H.R. 3892 was reported out of committee on a straight party line vote (22-17).
Notwithstanding the success of the Unz Initiative, Committee Democrats did not feel compelled'
to offer an altemative to Riggs's bill during committee markup. Moderate Committee
Democrats (e.g., Reps. Romer and Kind) as well as the four Members of the Hispanic Caucus on
the Committee (reps. Martinez, Romero-Barcelo, Hinojosa and Sanchez) decided to vote against
the Riggs bill even without a Democratic alternative.

        It is not clear when the bill will be scheduled for House floor consideration, although it
could well be scheduled before the end of June. There is no hint of movement in the Senate. It
is quite possible that House Democrats will feel compelled to offer an alternative when the bill
hits the floor so that they can vote for reform of bilingual education. Leaders of the Hispanic
Caucus, including Caucus Chairman Becerra and Education Committee Member Hinojosa, have
quietly acknowledged that, for the greater good of the Democratic Caucus, such a floor
alternative might become necessary. However, up until now they have been adamantly opposed
to a floor alternative, and remain to be convinced that one is necessary for a successful floor
strategy. Moderate Democrats themselves are not yet clear if one is needed. In addition to their
own apprehensions, Hispanic Caucus members are under substantial political pressure from
bilingual advocates to steer clear of an alternative.

         We could be ready to transmit an Administration alternative to Riggs in concert with the
Portland State commencement address or any time thereafter. While announcing your own
legislation in this short time frame would clearly demonstrate your commitment to reforming
bilingual education, we believe such an approach would have very serious drawbacks in the
Congressional arena.

        In particular, introducing an alternative within the next week or so would be perceived by
the Hispanic Caucus as jumping the gun strategically, and preempting meaningful consultation
regarding the substance of an alternative. It would generate a hostile reaction from the Caucus,
and is likely to recreate the same divisions among House Democrats we saw last year on national
testing. The prospects that the Black Caucus would ally itself with the Hispanic Caucus and
Republicans in opposition to your bill are high

        The alternative course of action, which we recommend, would be to proceed immediately
to consult with members of the Hispanic Caucus and other Democrats on the shape of an
alternative bill, using the Administration bill as the starting point, and making our 3-year goal
and strengthened accountability as nonnegotiable principles which must be incorporated into any


                                                2



  legislation we would support. While there is no guarantee that Democrats in general and the
  Members of the Hispanic Caucus in particular will endorse our approach, we can gain leverage in
  these negotiations by making clear that a veto threat remains dependent upon the introduction of
  an alternative consistent with our principles. Since no bilingual education bill is likely to pass
  this year, we can also make clear that we will transmit a reauthorization bill next year that is fully
  consistent with these principles.

          If we determine together with House Democrats that an alternative is strategically
  necessary when the bill comes to the floor, we could then introduce a bill consistent with our
  principles that would unite, rather than divide Democrats. If, as the bill comes to the floor,
  House Democrats either do not want an alternative, or will not support an approach based on our
  principles, we can reassess our position at that time and either send up our own alternative or
  choose to wait until next year's reauthorization.                  .

PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
D&THE NEW IMMIGRATION:
BUILDING ONE AMERICA IN THE 21ST CENTURYD8
PORTLAND STATE UNIVERSITY
JUNE 13, 1998

            Acknowledgments: TK

        I am delighted and honored to be here to address the Portland State
University graduating class of 1998.  You opened your doors at the end of


 World War II, when the G.I. Bill gave thousands of Americans an
 unprecedented opportunity to go to college.  Since then, you have
 broadened your mission to reach out to all kinds of students who might not
 otherwise have a chance to go to college -- older students, minority
 students, students from struggling families and foreign lands. And I thank
'you.

        At its heart, Portland StateD,s mission is the mission of America:
to widen the circl~ of opportunity for all our people, to deepen the
meaning of our freedom, and to form a more perfect union.    Our history can
be understood as a struggle to live up to those ideals in changing times,
and to make the promise of America real for generations to come. Today,
at the dawn of a new century, at a time, of 'great prosperity and even
greater change this is still our greatest challenge -- and it will be up
to all of you to help us meet it.

        Last month I spoke to graduates at the u.s. Naval Academy about what we
must do to defend American interests -- and American principles -- against
the threat of terrorism. Last week, I challenged students at MIT and all
Americans to make sure that the Information Age expands opportunity for
all of our people, not just a privileged few.

        One year ago tomorrow,I called on Americans to embark on a serious
examination of the lingering problems and limitless possibilities of our
growing diversity.  Today, I would like to continue that conversation by
talking about the driving force behind our growing diversity --
immigration -- and our shared responsibility to make sure that it
strengthens our nation in the 21st Century.

        More than any other nation on earth, America has drawn its
strength and its spirit, from a constant flow of immigrants. For more than
two centuries, America has attracted the most restless, the most
adventurous, the most industrious people of the world to our shores. We
have been held together, above all else, by a shared faith: we are all
created equal. We believe that all our people, whether their ancestors
came here in slave ships or on the Mayflower; whether they landed on Ellis
Island or LAX; whether they arrived at the dawn of this decade or have
been here for thousands of years, are born with the spark of possibility
and an equal right to strive and work and rise as far as they can go.

        Each new wave of immigrants -- of strangers -- has tested the
strength of these ideals. And out of two centuries of testing, we have
built the strongest, most prosperous, and most diverse democracy the world
has seen.

        Now, these ideals are being tested again -- by a new wave of
immigration, larger than any since the turn of the century, more diverse
than any in our history. More than 700,000 people come legally to our
nation each year.  Nearly one in ten people living here was born in
another country.  For the first time since 1850, immigrants and their
children account for half of New York CityD,s 8 million residents.

        And todayD,s immigrants come from every corner of the globe, especially
Asia and Latin America. Fewer than one in five come from Europe. Within
[xl years, largely because of immigration, there will be no majority race
in California -- and within fifty years, no majority race in America.

        Demographic change this large, this sweeping, can have profound
consequences for any nation.  Fundamentally, it forces us to ask: what can
we do to hold our nation together?



        Let me state unequivocally: I believe the new immigration is good
for America.  It is revitalizing our cities.  It is building our new
economy, and strengthening our ties to the global one.  It is energizing
our culture and broadening our view of the world.  It is renewing our
values. And it is reminding all of us what it truly means to be an
American.

        Among the the people here today are three members of the same immigrant
family: Mago, Oscar, and Eddi Gilson. Twelve years ago, Mago Gilson came
to this country from Mexico.  She didnD,t have a high school diploma. But
she not only went on to get a GED, she graduated from college. Today she
will receive a Masters in Education so that she can begin teaching. Her
son Eddi joins her here as a graduate today, after working full time for
nine years to put himself through college. And her son Oscar will soon
receive his own Masters Degree.

        We look at the Gilsons, we look at the child from Korea who does
his homework at the cash register at his familyD,s store '"  or the
teenager from Jamaica who rushes home after school to babysit so her
mother can work the night shift '"  or the father from EI Salvador who
takes his daughter to the public library everyday to practice reading.
When we look at all these new immigrants, we see the spirit that built
America -- the drive to succeed, the commitment to family, the hope for a
better life. When we look at these new immigrants, we see our
grandparents ... we see ourselves ... we see Americans.

        But too many people do not.  They see the change around them, they hear
new accents on the street, the new faces in their classrooms and they are
unsettled. They worry that the new immigrants come to our shores not to
promote our prosperity but to live off our largesse. They are afraid the
America they love is becoming a foreign land.

       This is understandable.   But it is wrong, profoundly wrong.

         No American should tolerate illegal immigration that flouts our
laws and strains our tradition of tolerance. We must strictly enforce the
immigration laws, and we have acted to bring the rule of law to our
borders.

        But we should remember: four out of five immigrants are here
legally. And in every measurable way, the new immigrants give more to our
society than they take.  They have moved strong and stable families into
neighborhoods that were all but abandoned.   On average, immigrants pay
$1,800 more in taxes than they receive in government benefits. And legal
immigrants are paying into Social Security at record rates [ckJ, helping
to offset the millions of Americans who will be retiring in the next 20
years.

        And they benefit our nation in ways that are not as easily
measured.

        We should all be proud that a person in an isolated village in a
far corner of the world recognizes the Statue of Liberty. We should be
honored that America -- whether it is called the D+city on a hill,D, the
D+old gold mountain,D, EI Norte -- is seen around the world as a land of
freedom and opportunity and new beginnings.

        My fellow Americans, it is simply wrong for people whose ancestors
passed through the portals of Ellis Island to lock the door behind them.


And it is wrong for those who were denied the rights of citizenship simply
because of the color of their skin to deny them to others because of the
country of their birth. We should treat these new immigrants as we would
have wanted our own grandparents to have been treated.

        I believe that every American is honor-bound to share our country
with immigrants, not to shun them or shut them out. But even as we
celebrate our differences, we cannot be blind to the fact that demographic
change of this sweep and scope can undermine our unity.  Around the world,
we have seen what can happen when people who live on the same land put
ethnicity before country.  If America is to remain the worldO,s most
diverse democracy, if immigration is to strengthen America as it has
throughout our history, then all Americans must recommit to ourselves to
the common values -- common heritage -- common culture -- that are
essential to our common future.

        We are part of a dynamic culture and a civic tradition that any
person who comes here from any corner of the world can shape and possess.

        So we must recommit to the civic duties that are at the heart of
true citizenship. We want all immigrants to seek to become citizens; but
all Americans, wherever they were born, must act as citizens, taking full
responsibility for the greatest nation on Earth. It is right ~nd
appropriate that new citizens learn the Declaration of Independence, the
structure of our government, the history of our nation.  But it is wrong
that all citizens donO,t share that obligation.

         We must recommit to the principle that our public schools are not only
places where our children learn to read, but where they learn to be
American, where they make American heroes -- from George Washington to
Abraham Lincoln to Rosa Parks -- their own. But today, too many Americans
-- and far too many immigrants -- attend crowded, failing inner city
schools.   Too many young people -- and far too many Hispanic young people
-- drop out of high school altogether.

        So we must all work together to renew our public schools, with
high national standards of academic excellence, smaller classes,
well-prepared teachers, computers in every classroom. We must keep
schools open after school to keep children off the streets while their
parents are at work. And we must continue to expand college opportunity,
with tuition tax credits, more scholarships, more work-study slots, and
expanded IRAO,s to help families save for college.

        And we must support our public school sO, efforts to ensure that
our children master English.  One out of five children in our nationO,s
schools are immigrants, or the children of immigrants.   They come from 150
different countries and speak more than a hundred languages -- languages
their parents have every right to want their children to remember.    But
unless these young people learn English, they will never make the full
contribution to American life we know they are capable of. But let me be
clear: meeting this challenge does not mean adopting rigid bilingual
education programs that fail to take into account the fact that our
children learn at different rates.  It means adopting sensible, flexible
bilingual education programs that are tailored to help our children to
succeed, not to set them up for failure.

         [Finally, we must recommit to the idea that in America, what counts is
not where we come from, but where we are going.   Last winter, the U.S.
Olympic Team roster, read something like this: Kwan, Lipinski, Rodriguez,
Ruggiero, Jones, Street, Moseley -- names from all countries all around
   ,.

the world. Names that on the eve of the 21st Century are as American as
Washington, Adams; and Jefferson.

        We must build one America.  ThatD,s why I launched the Race
Initiative last year.
        If we donD,t speak frankly about who we are and how we see each other, if
we ban certain topics from our conversations out of fear of giving
offense, if we fail to listen to each other with open minds, then we only
deepen our divisions. We must use dialogue to debunk the false
stereotypes, to move past the old resentments, to discover what we still
need to do to build One America. MORE TK

        That is the America you must aspire to build; that is the America you
must have the conscience and the courage to create; that is the America
that is within our reach.]

       Thank you, congratulations, and God bless you.
