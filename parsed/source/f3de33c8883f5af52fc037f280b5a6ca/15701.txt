Subject:         Today's WTW meeting on the Hill

           I just spoke with Bill Kamela about the meeting.   He told me:

* Gary Fisher.    Works for Ballenger and Fawell on the House Education
committee. He's been around a long time; is a mover and shaker on the ED
committee. However, his influence over WTW policy probably is not
strong. Fisher advocates formula over competitive grants because he
believes the latter preclude the money going through the workforce
development system.   He did not [cannot!) substantiate this assertion.

        The following is based on Kamela's gut feelings (he attended both
meetings this morning on the Hill).

*   Responsible Federal agency.     House Republicans will give DOL the money.

* City-State split. While they discussed an 80-20 split, Bill's best
guess is that R's will endorse 70% formula grants to cities; 30%
competitive grants to States. R's are uncomfortable with the Secretary
doling out the competitive grants. Instead, they probably will give this
authority to Governors.

* Performance bonuses. R's aren't too enamored with this aspect of
WTW.   If there is a performance pot, it probably would be permissible in
the 30% competitive grants.


* Timing.   Bill thinks W&M will have a draft on Monday or Tuesday. The
subcommittee will mark up on Friday, June 6th. Full committee markup will
occur the following week. Archer wants to move a bill quickly to preclude
groups from organizing opposition and taking pot shots.
