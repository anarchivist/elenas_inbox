TEXT:
Thanks for the explanation on the city/suburb.   Katie and I think alike ...

Here's a thought on the race initiative that probably has been
considered.  the first thing observers/critics are going to ask about
after a good rhetorical speech are the basics. In addition to the backlog
at the EEOC, they'll also ask why there's no staff director at the Civil
rights Commission and why the President hasn't appointed someone to run
the civil rights division.    Its a point made in today's USATODAY and
elsewhere already ... the need for EEOC reform was also made on the Sunday
chat shows.
