                                    The Value of Diversity in Higher Education

                    Colleges and universities that promote diversity can greatly contribute to
            improving race relations in the 21Sf Century and to creating a stronger, more just, and
            more united American community. Minority participation in higher education has
            increased dramatically in the last several decades, though disparities still remain.
            Studies indicate that this increased racial diversity can yield substantial educational
            benefits for all students. By bringing together students of different backgrounds,
            colleges and universities are teaching students critical lessons about how to live and
            work together, and they are exposing students to new perspectives that enrich the
            learning environment. Increased minority participation in higher education can
            also help overcome racial disparities in society by providing quality education to

          traditionally underserved groups. There are many colleges and universities across
          America that have developed and are continuing to develop policies and programs
          that can foster these benefits of diversity. At its November 19 meeting, the
          Advisory Board will discuss the value of diversity in higher education and will
          identify existing programs, policies, and partnerships that are promoting the value
          of diversity on campuses across America.
