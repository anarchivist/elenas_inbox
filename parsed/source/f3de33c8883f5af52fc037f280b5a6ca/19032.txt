TEXT:
I heard on the Hill that we    were planning a Tobacco Message for April 2.
Just wanted to remind folks    that if all goes as we" hope and we get an
Equal pay message appro"ved,   April 2 is the day the VP's office is thinking
we'd announce.  Just wanted    to make sure this was on your radar screen.
thanks
