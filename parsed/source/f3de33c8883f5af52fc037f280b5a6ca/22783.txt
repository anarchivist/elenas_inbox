Subject:         G-8 Paper

Education has called to see if Elena has any edits.  NSC told ED that they
needed paper back by tomorrow morning (Fri) at the latest.  I've told them
that Elena does want to read it before they send it in.

The lead on this issue at ED, Kent Pekel, may call you if he gets any more
calls from Steinberg's office asking for the G-8 paper.
