FROM:      OMB LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS

DATE:      SEPTEMBER 11, 1997

SUBJECT:           LEGISLATIVE REPORT


Administrator Sally Katzen will testify tomorrow, September 12, before the
Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs regarding S. 981, the Regulatory
Improvement Act of 1997.

Representative John Boehner, Chairman of the House GOP Conference,
announced his intention to introduce the Taxpayer Dividend Act, designed
to prevent future budget surpluses from being spent.    The bill would
"create a fund for all revenues over the next five years in excess of
budget act targets. This money would only be available for tax cuts or, if
no tax cuts are passed, would automatically go to deficit reduction."
Abraham has a companion measure in the Senate.    (Along the same lines,
Rep. Mark Neumann earlier introduced a bill attempting to require that
additional revenues and any subsequent budget surplus be used to reduce
the federal debt.)

CONGRESS TODAY (9/11)

SENATE
passed (92-8) S. 1061, Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and
Related Agencies FY 1998 Appropriations bill
[SAP sent 9/2: senior advisors veto threat for controversial amendments

national testing initiative, 2) prohibit funds for supervising the
TeamsterO,s election, 3) provide that   welfare recipients in
workfare can be paid at rates below minimum wage, and 4) direct approval
of State plans that privatize the administration of public assistance
programs, in addition to O&other concerns raised in the SAP.OB]

While under consideration, the Senate took the following action on S. 1061:
  o     Rejected (49-51) motion to table the Gorton amendment which
block grants most education funding to local elementary & secondary
education agencies.  The amendment was then approved on voice vote.  The
amendment eliminates administrative spending caps, and provides no
requirements on the spending of block grant funds.
