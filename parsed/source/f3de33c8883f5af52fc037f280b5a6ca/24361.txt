DRAFT -- NOT FOR RELEASE
July 27, 1998
(House)

H.R. 872 - Biomaterials Access Assurance Act of 1998
(Gekas (R) Pennsylvania and 133 cosponsors)

The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 872 in the form of the
manager's amendment which would protect certain biomaterials supplier from
liability for harm caused by an implant. This protection would not apply
to suppliers:  (1) who are registered manufacturers of the implant; (2)
who are sellers of the implant and who held title to the implant at the
time of sale (or is related by common ownership or control to such a
seller); (3) who furnish raw materials or components that fail to meet
applicable contractual requirements or specifications; or (4) whose
negligence or intentionally tortious conduct was a cause of the harm, if
the manufacturer's liability should be reduced because of that negligence
or intentionally tortious conduct or the manufacturer is insolvent.
