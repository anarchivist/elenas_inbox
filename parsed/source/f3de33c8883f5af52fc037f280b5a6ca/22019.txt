TEXT:
Chris asked for our reaction to a possible release of FY2000 AIDS numbers.
To make a long story short, we do not think that is advisable.


Ryan White
Our Ryan White number is $100 million when last year's increase was $260
million.   Part of our response was going to be the demo program related to
Jeffords-Kennedy, which will not be available for announcement so it won't
be helpful in impacting advocates' responses.

Prevention
The prevention number at CDC is better, with $10 million going to a new
"get tested" campaign requested by the President's AIDS Council.  However,
given that we've taking a lot of heat on our prevention funding, this may
not be enough to overwhelm our difficult constituency.

International
USAID estimates that it will reduce international AIDS funding from $125
million to $122 million based upon their anticipated budget amount (level
from last year). This is not consistent with the President's statement
last Friday to the Council that he would "put some money in there" when
asked about our international AIDS funding.


please don't confuse this with our dissatisfaction. We know how tough a
year it was and we're very grateful for the increases.  However, the
community is not going to have the context of the whole budget - they're
4




only going to see the AIDS numbers, and our guess is that we'd have to bust
our humps to get a mediocre (at best) response.   With some more work, and
a more complete picture to present, I think we can improve the response.

If you need me, page me through signal.

Todd
