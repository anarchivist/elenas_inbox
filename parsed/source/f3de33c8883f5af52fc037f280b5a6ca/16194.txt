in 2174 Rayburn.  He can't do it later in the day because he is leaving
town.
I can do it; it sounds like Janet can; and I think the agency folks can.
Virginia -- will you confirm Janet's participation and page me? We can't
do this meeting wjo her.
Bruce    it sounds like you'll be at tobacco talks.
Elena ??
