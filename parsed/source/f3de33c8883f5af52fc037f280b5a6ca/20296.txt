TEXT:
The current letter may be as strong as we are going to get it - in that
the $ 196B may be moot, but I want to give it a final push. If we are
going to lean on Governors to stay committed to the bill, we need to stay
with the deal we cut ourselves. Further, I think we need to stay loyal to
the states anticipating a conference committee.
