TEXT:
Bruce/Elena:
Yesterday, Peter and Ceci met with Abraham's staff to discuss our proposed
changes to his bill.  There continue to be several points of disagreement,
essentially about who is covered by the attestations (Abraham's bill has
huge exemptions) and what triggers a DOL investigation.
It looks like Gingrich has decided to introduce Abraham's bill (which
hasn't changed at all) on the House floor on Thursday. Peter recommends
that we send our veto letter if the bill goes to the floor.  Gene is less
sure and wants to decide that tomorrow.  Given that, Gene is likely to
bring this up tomorrow morning.
