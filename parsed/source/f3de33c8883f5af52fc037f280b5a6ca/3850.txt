TEXT:
David Beaubaire called -- wanted to know who in DPC was working on this
and whether they had connected up with folks in the appropriate agency.
Is there a contact I could steer him to?   He said he had been contacted
by the FLOTUS' office who indicated they had been working with OMB.

Thanks.
