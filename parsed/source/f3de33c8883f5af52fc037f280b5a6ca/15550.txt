TEXT:
Angus will be getting this same message to you -- I wanted to make sure
everyone got an e-mail copy as well .....

Because of ongoing budget meetings on the Hill, this afternoon's Texas
prep meeting has been moved to this evening at 8:00 p.m.

Sorry for the late hour.    We still need everyone to attend.

Thanks.

Jason
