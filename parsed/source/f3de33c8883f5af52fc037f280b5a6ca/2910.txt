TEXT:
I worked up this draft, which is pretty bare bones. Diana and I can't
figure out what to add, because everything we might add precludes future
possible compromises.,  What do you think?

     DRAFT LETTER TO HOUSE RULES COMMITTEE AND SENATE FINANCE
     COMMITTEE

            We are writing to urge you not to include in the reconciliation bill the provisions on the
     minimum wage and welfare work requirements reported out of the House Ways and Means and
     Education and the Workforce Committees.

            These proposals would undermine the fundamental goals of welfare reform. The
     Administration believes strongly that everyone who can work must work -- and that those who
     work should earn the minimum wage, whether they are coming off of welfare or not.

            These proposals do not meet this test. They effectively create a subminimum wage for
     workfare participants. And they weaken the welfare law's work requirements.

           These issues were not addressed in the budget agreement between the White House and
     Congress. Therefore, they should not be includedin the reconciliation bill.




                                                                      Automated Records Management System
                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion
