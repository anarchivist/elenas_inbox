     Attached is the revised tobacco letter.  Please get comments back by noon,
     Monday (6/15) for delivery to the Hill Monday afternoon. Senate floor
     debate begins around 5pm.  Thank you.

     Dear Mr. Chairman:

             You asked for our views on a series of possible amendments that
     may be offered to S. 1415 that would undermine the present structure
     and/or uses of the State Litigation Settlement Account. The
     Administration opposes such changes.  In its current form, S. 1415
     represents a careful balancing between the states and the Federal
     government, advancing the public health and other goals we share.  Further
     changes to this agreement would harm the goal of passing historic
     comprehensive, bipartisan tobacco legislation.


             This legislation would not have been possible without the
     leadership of the states. States have earned and deserve recognition of
     their efforts through protection against amendments that further reduce
     the amount that states receive in the Account.

             We also recognize the importance of the carefully constructed
     balance between restricted and unrestricted funds, and the menu of uses
     that would be supported by the former.  It is for this reason that we also
     oppose additional amendments that would change the parameters for or uses
     of the restricted funds.

             Holding the line on additional changes to the State Litigation
     Settlement Account is necessary to assure that the bill represents a fair
     balance between flexibility and accountability, and helps protect the
     states very legitimate interest in this legislation. As always, we look
     forward to continuing working with you, and look forward to favorable
     action on a bill that will make a major contribution to public health, our
     children and our nation.

                                                             Sincerely,




                                                            Jacob J. Lew
                                                            Acting Director

     cc:     The Honorable Ernest F. Hollings
             The Honorable John F. Kerry
