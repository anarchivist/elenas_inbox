Measure sought to end federal job protections

by Lou Chibbaro Jr.

In an action considered a crushing defeat for the religious right, the
House of Representatives on Wednesday voted 252 to 176 to kill an amendment
seeking to overturn President Clinton's May 28 executive order banning job
discrimination against Gay federal employees.

The vote came after moderate and conservative Republicans joined Democrats
in speaking out on the House floor against the amendment, which had been
introduced by Rep. Joel Hefley (R-Colo.).

The vote also followed what officials with Gay political groups called an
unprecedented collaborative effort to lobby against the Hefley amendment by
a group of conservative Republicans and Democrats who rarely, if ever,
agree on any issue, let alone an issue on Gay civil rights.

The Human Rights Campaign, a national Gay political group, and Log Cabin
Republicans, a national Gay Republican group, credited openly Gay Reps.
Barney Frank (D-Mass.) and Jim Kolbe (R-Ariz.) with putting together the
bipartisan effort to defeat the Hefley measure.

Both Frank and Kolbe spoke out against the Hefley amendment, saying it
would overturn an executive order that seeks only to ban discrimination
against civilian federal employees who happen to be Gay. Frank served as
the Democratic floor manager during the debate over the amendment. In an
unusual development, Frank - who normally locks horns with Republicans
·

during House debates - called upon mostly Republicans to speak out against
the amendment. Some of them were conservative Republicans who, in the past,
have been at odds with Frank and who have spoken out against Gay civil
rights.

Among them were Reps. Tom Bliley (R-Va.) and Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.),
both of whom condemned the Hefley amendment as unfair and discriminatory
and urged their House colleagues to vote against it.

"The real story in this vote is that   a growing segment of the Republican
Party is emerging," said Rich Tafel,   executive director of the Log Cabin
group. "They are no longer afraid to   draw the line on bashing Gays and they
are putting the leadership on notice   that it will not work."

Hefley and other House members supporting his amendment argued that
Clinton's executive order would lead to hiring quotas and affirmative
action programs for Gays. Hefley also argued that the Clinton order was an
improper attempt to circumvent Congress by using presidential powers to
create "special set-aside or carve-out [program] for homosexuals."

Rohrabacher, considered one of the most conservative members of the House,
took the lead in refuting Hefley's claim.

"[A]fter close examination, I have determined that the Clinton executive
order will not lead to quotas or affirmative action plans for
homosexuality, nor will this executive order give homosexuals any special
rights or a protected status under the civil rights acts," Rohrabacher
said.

Kolbe is credited with playing a key role in defeating the Hefley amendment
by taking steps to counter an attempt by Hefley to link the Clinton
executive order pertaining to Gay federal workers with another, highly
unpopular Clinton order addressing the interaction between the federal and
state and local governments. Hefley's amendment called for overturning both
Clinton orders, with the aim of garnering more support for the anti-Gay
portion of the amendment from House members who disliked the section
pertaining to the other Clinton executive order, referred to as a
"federalism" order. To the dismay of Gay activists, House GOP leaders
approved Hefley's request to link the two orders in one amendment and
pushed through a House rule barring opponents from separating them.

Kolbe responded by introducing his own amendment calling for repeal of the
Clinton order on the federalism question, thus giving opponents of the
federalism order a way to vote against that order while also voting against
Hefley's amendment. The Kolbe amendment passed by a lopsided margin.

In the vote on the Hefley amendment, 188 Democrats and 63 Republicans voted
against it while 15 Democrats and 161 Republicans voted for it. The House's
sole independent voted against it.

Among D.C. area House members, Rep. Frank Wolf (R-Va.), was the only one to
vote for it. Reps. Steney Hoyer (D-Md.), Albert Wynn (D-Md.), Connie
Morella (R-Md.), James Moran (D-Va.), and Tom Davis (R-Va.) voted against
it.
