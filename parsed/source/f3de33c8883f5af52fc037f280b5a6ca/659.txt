TEXT:
CEQ, DPC and NEC staff have been working with agencies to finalize the
policy for the executive order on protecting kids. After some negotiation
with OMB and EPA we plan formally to circulate a draft that requires
agencies to analyze the effect on kids of all significant health, safety
OR environmental regulations on kids.  (Significant as defined under the
reg review executive order.) Two issues for your attention:

1. The expansion of scope, which staff (White House, OMB, EPA) agreed to
today, will bring agencies that have not been at the table into the fray.
They will be surprised and perhaps unhappy, and you might hear about it.
The only reason to rush this through is to have it ready for the State of
the Union, and it is by far the best piece with an environmental
connection for the State of the Union.

2. NEC staff have raised the possibility of convening a deputies or
principals meeting in the next couple of days to hammer out any issues.
Given that we have worked jointly on this over the past few months, you
may want to talk to Gene about a jointly convened meeting.  This is
clearly not principally an economic issue. NEC feels they have the lead
here because Browner's original proposal was brought up to an NEC meeting
and NEC took on the task of resolving the disagreements.
