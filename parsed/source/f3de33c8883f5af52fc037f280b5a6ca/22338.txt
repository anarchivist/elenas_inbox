Largest increase in Family Planning Grants in 15 Years. The President's FY 2000 budget
proposal will call for an increase of $25 million in Title X Family Planning grants, which helps
provide women with vital services, including contraception, pregnancy testing, STD screening
and treatment. This proposed increase would bring total Title X funding to $240 million -- a
12% increase over last year. The President' proposed $25 million increase is the largest request
in fifteen years, and would cap a 60% increase in Title X since 1992.
