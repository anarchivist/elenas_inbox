TEXT:
I just spoke to Tom Cochran, the executive director of the US Conf. of
Mayors. I spoke to their Leadership Conference last Friday evening. Tom
indicates that thier education task force chairs Mayor Menino of Boston
and Mayor Daley of Chicago are proposing a WH Conference on Public Schools
be held this winter. They believe the WH Conference on Drugs serves as a
model they would like repeated. I will have paper on this soon to share
with you. We can discuss how best to respond then. Tom is hoping to meet
with us on ~his proposal sometime next week.
