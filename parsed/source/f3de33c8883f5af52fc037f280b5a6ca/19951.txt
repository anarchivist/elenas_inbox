Heads up -- We have not yet received Justice's input for a SAP on this
bill, which is scheduled for House floor action tomorrow. We understand
that Justice's Office of Legal Counsel is developing constitutional
arguments that will be the basis for opposition. We will most likely
circulate a draft SAP this afternoon with a very short deadline for
comments.  See the attached article for background.

Justice advised informally that they want to oppose this bill and are in
the process of putting
together a SAP for our circulation later today.

                 SOCIAL POLICY: EARLY PRISON RELEASE

By Russ Freyman, CQ Staff Writer

     The House is expected this week to consider a measure (HR37l8),
introduced by Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, that aims to stem early
releases of felons from federal prisons.

    The bill has already been offered on the House floor, and was
adopted 367-52 as an amendment to broader judicial overhaul legislation
(HR1252) in April. It is scheduled to be considered tomorrow under
suspension of the rules, an expedited floor procedure usually reserved
for non-contentious legislation.

    The measure would essentially eliminate the power of federal judges
to release convicted felons because of the facility's conditions. On the
House floor, DeLay blamed activist judges for allowing the average
violent offender to serve only 40 percent of his or her sentence.

    Some Democrats objected to the DeLay language, saying it was too
broad and would not allow non-violent felons to be released and that the
measure would eliminate judicial discretion on a prisoner's early
release because of abuse by officials.

    Democrats also objected on the floor that the measure would abrogate
consent decrees reached between courts and prisons. Such agreements
usually occur to correct civil rights violations in federal prisons due
to poor conditions and overcrowding. Democrats say the bill would
restrict already agreed-upon remedies.

    Despite the Democratic criticism, a GOP leadership aide said he was
not worried about any waning of minority support because to oppose the
bill would be "an indefensible vote back home."
