TEXT:
BREK:

Attached is an AP story on a DOJ report that provides some good spin for
next week.
DOJ has also been sitting on a Use of Force study that is pretty positive
about citizens
cotacts w/police.     The civil rights folks don't want it to be one of the
deliverables because
its "off message," but it seems to me that simultaneously putting out this
report and signing
the directive may actually work pretty well .... most cops do the right
thing ... 90% of citizen/police
contact involves no use of force ... but that's not enough ... we need to make
sure we take the
extra step and get the info/data we need to make sure the system works for
everybody ... etc.

                     Local Police Ratings Vary by Race

                     By Pete Yost
                     Associated Press Writer
                     Thursday, June 3, 1999; 11:45 a.m. EDT

                     WASHINGTON (AP)   -- Ninety percent of white city
residents and 76
                  percent of blacks expressed satisfaction with their
local police in a survey
                  of 12 cities last year, Deputy Attorney General Eric
Holder announced
                  today.

                     The release of the survey conducted by the Bureau of
Justice Statistics
                     comes amid controversy that some police departments


around the country
                  engage in racial profiling, the practice of stopping or
searching motorists
                  based on race.

                  The Justice Department has investigated racial-profiling
allegations against
                  New Jersey's state police. Similar accusations have been
made in Florida,
                  Maryland, Connecticut and elsewhere.

                     Blacks' dissatisfaction with police varied widely
according to city.

                     Law enforcement agencies and communities must work
together to break
                  down "the barriers of mistrust,"      Holder said in a
meeting with reporters at
                  the Justice Department.

                     Holder said there is a perception among some people in
the black
                     community "that they are treated differently."

                  Overall, 85 percent of residents surveyed in the 12
cities said they were
                  satisfied with local police. Three percent said they
were very dissatisfied
                  and 12 percent said they were dissatisfied.

                  Hispanics were included in both white and black
categories of the survey
                  based on their individual preference.

                     In Knoxville, Tenn., 37 percent of blacks said they were
dissatisfied with
                  police. In Chicago, the figure was 31 percent. In
Washington, D.C., it was
                  25 percent; in New York, 23 percent; in Los Angeles, 18
percent.

                  The figures for black dissatisfaction with police in
other cities: Springfield,
                  Mass., 24; Spokane, Wash., 21; Savannah, Ga., 19; Kansas
City, Mo.,
                  14; San Diego, 11; Tucson, Ariz., 9; and Madison, Wis.,
3 percent.

                  Among whites, the level of dissatisfaction with local
police ranged from 3
                  percent in Madison to 19 percent in Washington. The
level of
                  dissatisfaction among whites in other cities surveyed:
San Diego, 5
                  percent; Knoxville, 9 percent; Kansas City and
Springfield, 10 percent;
                  Chicago, New York and Los Angeles, 11 percent; Tucson,
Savannah and
                  Spokane, 12 percent.
