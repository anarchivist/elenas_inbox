     Subject: Gore on racial profiling --



     Maria & Chuck:

     These are paragraphs from Gore's speech Sunday night in Detroit. He's
     against racial profiling, period. (Doesn't mention data collection,
     though. )

     I urge you to have a communications strategy to reconcile the DPC/DOJ
     recommendation with Gore's position.

     And -- before I get attacked by everyone -- let me stress that I did not
     have a hand in this section of the speech. As you know, I tried to get you
     to resolve the executive order issue in time for Gore to say something
     about it; when Maria said it was impossible, I relayed that to OVP staff.

     *********

     "Now, I am proud of our nation?s law enforcement.  I?m proud of the
     100,000 new community police we are putting on our streets, and the work
     they are doing to protect all of our families.

          But I want to be perfectly   clear: the strong arm of justice must also
     respect justice.  I am outraged   by recent reports of "racial profiling."
     DWI is a crime in this nation.    DWB shouldn?t be.  It is wrong to
     pigeon-hole and punish innocent   citizens on the basis of race.    It is
     wrong to stereotype somebody as   a suspect simply because of the color of
     their skin.

          Let be very clear: I believe we should abolish racial profiling in
     America. And any police department in America that is using it should stop
     right now.

     Right now, our administration is exploring this issue -- to see what we can


     do to help end this hateful practice, once and for all."

     ***********

     Quite obviously, it would be a bit legalistic to say that "police
     department" does not apply to Federal law enforcement.
