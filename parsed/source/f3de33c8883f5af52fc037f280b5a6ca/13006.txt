TEXT:
I know that Eli has been calling people regarding the August WTW
Convention in Chicago.  I spoke with Stephanie Streett, and while she
knows the President will participate in some way, she does not want to
confirm until we have figured out the format a little more specifically.

At any rate, apparently the Partnership is going to print invitations, and
asked Scheduling whether they could put the President's name on it.  She
is going to call the Partnership and tell them that while we will
participate in some way she is not comfortable having them put the
President's name on it this far out.

Please call or page me with any questions.
