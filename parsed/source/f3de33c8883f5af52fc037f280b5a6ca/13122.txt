TEXT:
We've had separate discussions about this issue and the AMA's
apparent decision to get involved on the wrong side. Today, I
spoke with Karen Guss, who used to work here with us but now is in
NARAL's legal department. She indicated that what happened is
this:  the AMA legislative committee, which includes several
members who used to work for conservative republicans, met
recently and decided they wanted to take a position on this
bill--apparently at the request of its sponsor.   The committee
then met with the bill's sponsor and voted last week to support
the bill. The AMA itself has not yet taken a position--but Kate M
and NARAL are afraid they will do so this week, when the AMA Board
has a meeting.   (No one knows what day the meeting is).  Kate M
has spoken with the Board chair, who is sympathetic to the
position that the AMA should not support Congressional involvement
in medical decisions made by doctors, to say nothing of
criminalizing doctors' decisions.,   She has written a letter
making these points to the Board, which Karen is sending to me
(and I'll share with you). Also, apparently the California
Medical Association is opposing the AMA taking this position--but
Karen said that based on NARAL's reading of it, if they took a
poll among all the state AMAs, we would lose.
Bottom line: the AMA Board is meeting to consider this, and NARAI
thinks it is likely they will adopt the AMA Legislative
Committee's recommendation.
