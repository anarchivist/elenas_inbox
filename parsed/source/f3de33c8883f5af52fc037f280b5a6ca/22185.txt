MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:                  Bruce Reed
                       Mike Cohen

SUBJECT:               Reaction to Education Issues in Chris Edley's Memo


        The attached. memo from Chris Edley argues that our ESEA proposals do not go far
enough. At the same time, he complains that our proposal to require states to end social
promotion will alienate progressives. At your request, we have developed a new performance
incentive proposal to help ensure that we demand and reward results. In keeping with your
principle that future increases should be contingent on improved performance, we recommend
that performance incentives only be given to communities that are making progress with the
federal education funds they already receive. This is different from Chris's proposal, which
would create a whole new funding stream and leave Title 1 untouched.

         Our ESEA proposal demands results in other ways as well. It requires states to set
standards, measure student performance, end social promotion, issue school report cards, identify
and reward outstanding schools and intervene to tum around lowest performing schools. If these
schools don't improve, the state must reconstitute the school and make wholesale staff changes,
or by close it down altogether and reopen it with new staff or as a charter school. States must
adopt and implement these practices as a condition of receiving any funds under ESEA. If they
fail to do so in a serious and effective fashion, the Secretary of Education will have the authority
to withhold funds from the state.

         Our proposal to end social promotion may well be controversial in some quarters, but it is
sound and will be effective. We do not share Chris's view that ending social promotion is "a
distraction" from your education reform agenda. On the contrary, it is a central part of holding
schools, teachers and students accountable for results, as you demonstrated with the eighth grade
test in Arkansas and as Chicago, Boston, and other communities are demonstrating today. Our
approach requires states to phase in, over five years, an end to social promotion, thereby
squarely focusing the attention of students, teachers, parents and the entire school system on
getting kids to meet standards. The phase-in period will help ensure high quality
implementation, prevent the abus!,!s that Chris fears, and enable states to comply with civil
rights laws addressing use of high stakes tests.

       For those who oppose the use of tests to hold students accountable for performance under
almost any circumstance, this requirement will indeed be controversial. The best way to deal
                                Hex-Dump Conversion

with the concerns of the civil rights community is to advocate ending social promotion the right
way -- by coupling it with other steps to strengthen learning opportunities in the classroom,
provide extra help to students who need it, end the use of unqualified teachers, and hold schools
and teachers accountable. Done right, this policy will help rather than harm students. Our
requirements are designed to foster help for students who need it, and thereby increase the
percentage of students promoted on time, rather than increase retention rates. This would track
your own experience with the eighth grade test in Arkansas, where passing rates from 1985 to
1988 increased in reading from 85% to 96%, and in math from 82% to 95%.
