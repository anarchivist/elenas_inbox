TEXT:
Attached is ED's revised draft Title XI language on social promotion,
including a new subsection 11204(d) SPECIAL RULE, which specifies that a
State receiving assistance must have a policy not to withhold promotion
 (at the 3 transition points) from LEP students solely because of a lack of
English proficiency. The new language is in bold, if you "launch" the
document (It is the very last paragraph.)   ED reports that this has been
agreed to by Barbara Chow, Elena Kagan and Bruce Reed.   Please confirm
that this language is consistent with your understanding of the
agreement.

with this change, there are no outstanding issues,       and we are prepared to
clear the bill unless advised otherwise.

Thanks.

receives assistance under this Act shall, at the time it

submits its accountability plan under section 11208, have

in effect a State policy that is designed to-

                    "(A)       ensure that students progress through

school on a timely basis, having mastered the challenging

material needed for them to reach high standards of

performance; and

                    "(B)       end the practices of social promotion

and retention.

             "(2)    As used in this part, the term-

                    " (A)      'social promotion' means the unsound

.educational practice of promoting students who have not

demonstrated mastery of challenging State academic

standards; and

                    " (B)      'retention' means.the unsound

educational practice of requiring students who have not

demonstrated mastery of challenging State academic

standards to remain in the same grade, without the specific

educational interventions they need to master those

standards.

     "(b)     POLICY.        In order to ensure that students will

progress through school and graduate having mastered the
                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion

challenging material needed for them to meet high standards

of performance, a State policy under subsection (a) shall-

          11   (1)        require-

                     11   (A)   its local educational agencies to

implement continuing, intensive and comprehensive

that all students can meet the challenging academic

performance standards required under section 1111 (b) (1) (A)

of this Act; and

                     11   (B)   all students to meet those

challenging standards before being promoted at three key

transition points (one of which shall be graduation from

secondary school), as determined by the State, consistent

with section 1111 (b) (2) (D) of this Act;

          11   (2)        require the State educational agency to

determine, through the collection of appropriate data,

whether local educational agencies and schools are ending

the practices of social promotion and retention;

          "(3)            require its local educational agencies to

provide to all students educational            opportunities in

classrooms with qualified teachers who use proven

instructional practices that are aligned with the State's

challenging standards and who are supported by high-quality

professional development;

          "(4)    require its local educational agencies to

use effective, research-based prevention and early

intervention strategies to identify and support students

who need additional help to meet those promotion standards;

          "(5)    provide, with respect to students who have

not demonstrated mastery of challenging State academic

standards on a timely basis-

                 "(A)   for continuing, intensive, and age-

appropriate interventions, including extended instruction

and learning time, such as after-school and summer programs

that are designed to help students master such material;

                 "(8)   for other specific interventions, with

appropriate instructional strategies, to enable students

with limited English proficiency and students with

disabilities to master such material;

                 "(e)   for the identification of the

knowledge and skills in particular subject areas that

students have not mastered, in order to facilitate

remediation in those areas;

                 "(D)   for the development, by schools, of

plans to provide individualized attention to students who

have not mastered such material;

                 "(E)   for full communication between the

school and parents, including a description and analysis of
                                                      Automated Records Management System

     the students' performance, how it will be improved, and how

     parents will be involved in the process; and

                      "(F)   in cases in which significant numbers

     of students have failed to master such material, for a

     State review of whether corrective action under section

     1116 of this Act with respect to the school or local

     educational agency is needed;

               "(6)    require its local educational agencies to

     disseminate widely their policies under this subsection in

     language and in a format that is concise and that parents

     can understand; and

               "(7)    ensure that any assessments used by a

     State, local educational agency, or school for the purpose

     of implementing a policy under this subsection-

                      "(A)   are aligned with the State's

     challenging content and performance standards and provide

     coherent information about student progress towards

     attainment of those standards;

                      "(B)   include multiple measures, including

     teacher evaluations, no one of which may be assigned

     determinative weight .in making adverse decisions about

     individual students;

                      "(C)   offer multiple opportunities for

     students to demonstrate that they meet the standards;

      purposes for which they are used and must fairly and

      accurately measure what students have been taught;

      accommodations for students with disabilities and students

      with limited English proficiency; and

                         "(F)    provide that students with limited

      English proficiency are assessed, to the greatest extent

      practicable, in the language and form most likely to yield

      accurate and reliable information about what those students

      know and can do.

           "(c)    PLAN CONTENT.     A State shall include in its

      accountability plan under section 11208 a detailed
