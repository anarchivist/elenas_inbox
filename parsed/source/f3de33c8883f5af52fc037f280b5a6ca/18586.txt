                                    February 3, 1998



Q:   What steps is the Administration taking to improve food safety?

A:   Last year we launched a new Presidential food safety initiative, and added more than $40
     million to the FY '98 budget. With that money we started putting in place new
     science-based preventive systems to improve the safety of seafood, meat and poultry and
     began work on a new early warning system to help detect and respond to outbreaks of
     foodborne illness. This year, our budget seeks an even more substantial increase in
     resources, $101 million, to improve food safety. The resources will go to a variety of
     initiatives, including: giving FDA authority to prevent the import of produce from
     countries without safety pre.cautions equivalent to our own; hiring FDA inspectors to
     improve the safety of our nation's fruits and vegetables, both domestic and imported;
     developing new ways for federal inspectors to detect food-borne illnesses in meat and
     poultry and determine the source of contamination; improving educational outreach on
     proper food handling; and further expanding our early warning system and strengthening
     state surveillance activities for foodborne illnesses.



Q.   A recent story revealed that USDA did not close down a plant despite 1,700
     violations. What are you doing to make sure our meat and poultry are safe to eat?

A.   We have to keep improving our food safety systems. And I am committing more
     resources than ever to the problem, and modernizing food safety for meat and fruits and
     vegetables and the water we drink. There are several important facts to remember in
     regard to this specific story. First, although the inspectors did not close the plant -- and
     in my view that was a wrong decision -- they did take actions to correct the plant's bad
     practices and to prevent all unsafe food they found from reaching the public. Second,
     those events occurred in 1996 -- before my Administration began implementing the
     Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (RACCP) system for meat. Under this
     system, inspectors will document food safety violations; they will shut down the plant
     where there are repeat failures; and they will insist that the plant take a wide range of
     measures to prevent any future contamination before the plant can reopen. Finally, the
     Administration has asked Congress for additional enforcement authority to fine
     companies for violations of food safety standards. Currently, USDA can't fine
     companies that violate food safety standards.
