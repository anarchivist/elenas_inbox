TEXT:
Pursuant to our affirmative action meeting yesterday, I will try to
convene the working group on higher education reauthorization next week
some time. The immediate tasks include assessing the Congressional
situation and discussing a strategy to counter an amendment prohibiting
affirmative action in admissions. Who should be in the group? Besides you
(or your designees), how about leg affairs, Bob Shireman, Sylvia'S office
(Peter) and someone from PIR (Scott Palmer?) Anyone else?
