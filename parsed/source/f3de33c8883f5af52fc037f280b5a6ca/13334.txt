          SALVAGE-LOGGING LAW:   IMPACTS SPREAD ACROSS THE COUNTRY
             Much of the debate over the salvage-logging law has centered
        on old-growth stands freed for logging in the Northwest, but the
        law has "created a patchwork of logging cuts, frustration and
        rage" stretching to Michigan, Alabama, Kentucky and North
        Carolina. Salvage logging is planned or underway in 35 of the 37
        states where national forests exist; about one-fourth of the
        logging will occur east of the Rocky Mountains.
             Enviro groups say the US Forest Service, under pressure from
        Congress to "get out the cut," has used the law as a pretext to
        sell off healthy trees. They have filed 16 lawsuits in six
        states, accusing USFS of reclassifying timber sales in pristine,
        sensitive areas as "salvage" solely to get around enviro laws.
        Federal judges have heard eight cases so far and have tossed out
        all eight, citing the salvage law's broad exemptions.
             Congress defined salvageable. timber as trees that were dead,
        dying, sick or tilting, threatened by disease or insects, or
        "associated" with other trees that met the definition. The Dept.
        of Justice's Peter Coppelman, whose office defends USFS in enviro
        lawsuits:   "You could probably cut down every tree in the
        national forests under that definition. But is the Forest
        Service taking advantage? The answer, I believe, is no."
             The timber industry, on the other hand, accuses the gov't of
        dragging its feet, making logging uneconomical.   Sen. Slade
        Gorton (R-WA), "the law's main backer," believes it has failed to
        do what he intended:   create more jobs and end enviro disputes.
                            GORTON IS FIRM: NO REPEAL
             Gorton aide Heidi Kelly said a Senate bill to repeal the
        law, expected to be introduced soon (GREENWIRE 2/9), would not
        get past Gorton, who chairs the Senate Interior Cmte.:   "There


     will be no repeal of the salvage rider -- not in this Congress."
     But she added:  "There probably will be some changes made.
     Otherwise, the rider is not going to do what Congress intended it
     to" (Knight-Ridder/Colorado Springs GAZETTE TELEGRAPH, 2/21).
