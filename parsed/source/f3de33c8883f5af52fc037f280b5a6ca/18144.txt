TEXT:
Folks--I'm assuming I'm responsible for the briefing here, although help
will be greatly appreciated, particularly for providing background
information for the participants.  If Michael, Janet and Ann would
coordinate research on our participants and would provide a couple of
paragraphs on each participant that would be great.   Thoughts on what else
should be in the briefing memo please send forward; thank you.

Subject:         Friday's "PIR" meeting

I think it is critical that we touch base with the groups, and make sure
we give everyone a chance to vent before Friday.  I suggest that the two
of you pull together a small WH staff meeting to go through the politics
of the Friday meeting, and to do some scripting for it as well. The VP
will participate, and i can do some of this myself, but I don't think that
's the right way to do it. Also, I think we need to have in mind some very
clear objectives for this meeting, and it would be helpful for me, in pr


eparing the VP for this. to talk through them with you and others. (VP is
likely to miss the POTUS prebrief because of foreign policy scheduling
requirements so we will need to brief him separately on Thursday. and I
hope you can participate in that.)  Finally. Maria. who will be doing the
briefing material for this. and how extensive will it be? Is someone
summarizing the writing of some of these folks? I think the VP and POTUS
will want and will benefit from something more extensive than the regular
format. thanks!
