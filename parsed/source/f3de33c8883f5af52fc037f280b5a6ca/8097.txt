TEXT:
Attached is a slightly edited answer for the voucher question --clarifying
that the President opposes using federal funds for vouchers:

Q.      The Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled today that the private school
voucher program in Milwaukee is constitutional.  In light of the
PresidentO,s opposition to school vouchers, what is his view of this
decision?

A.      The President has not had a chance to review the Court
decision.  However, the President is opposed to using federal funds for
school vouchers because he believes that we must use public funds to
strengthen our public schools.  We must raise standards, increase
accountability, expand public school choice, and invest taxpayer resources
in the steps that will make a difference, such as reducing class size,
improving teaching, and modernizing our school buildings. He is opposed
to diverting federal funds away from the public schools, which serve 90%
of the students, when the needs there are so great.  The Wisconsin Supreme
Court decision does not changes these views, nor the PresidentO,s
opposition to private school vouchers.
