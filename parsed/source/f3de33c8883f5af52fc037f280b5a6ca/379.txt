TEXT:
 (I) The Florida ietter is going out today.   Issue is settled to
everyone's satisfaction. Note: this locks HHS into the position
that the 45 day period can in fact be a process prior to the
passage of the new bill.    Interesting how these things work out.
 (2) We have draft answers to the NGA/APWA questions from last week
on issues such as how to determine completeness.    I have sent
those around to all of you (not Bruce or Carol - unless you want
to see them) .. Please review and let me know if you see problems.
We would hand these out tomorrow - in writing!
(3) It seems like a good idea to have Olivia come over and talk us
through the process they are using to go over state plans.      I'd
like to set some time for that next week.    I'll assume you all
want to come and will invite you - no need to attend if you don't
want to.   (Carol - I will try to set this at a time you are
available) .
