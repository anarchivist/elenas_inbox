FEDERAL AGENCY ACTIVITIES

    Department of Treasury

    Building Economic Self-Determination in Indian Communities Conference. At the
    conference, Treasury held a working meeting with interested tribal representatives and
    announced that it would hold a Business LINC meeting in Indian Country during the next
    fiscal year. Also, the OCC released its Guide to Tribal Ownership of a National Bank,
    and the CDFI Fund discussed its planned Native American study and action plan.

    Department of Justice

    Motor Vehicle Excise Tax. On August 10, DO] intervened in a private Federal lawsuit
    brought by the Rosebud Sioux Tribe against the State of SD. The tribe brought the suit
    in order to declare that ND's motor vehicle excise tax is invalid as applied to tribal
    members who live on their reservation. The Eighth Circuit has already declared that ND
    does not have authority to impose the contested tax on vehicles owned by Indians living
    on their reservations. DO] is intervening in the Rosebud Sioux case so that tribal
    members can receive reimbursement for any invalidly collected vehicle excise taxes.

    Department of Interior

    Animas-La Plata Water Rights.     On August 11, Secretary Babbitt unveiled the
    Administration's proposal to implement the Southern Ute and Ute Mountain Tribes'
    water rights settlement, enacted in 1988. Secretary Babbitt discussed the proposal with
    CO Governor Romer, the Tribes, and non-Indian participants. The plan calIs for
    building a down-sized, off-stream reservoir. Water in the reservoir would be dedicated
    to municipal and industrial uses.

    The CO Ute Tribes have rights to the bulk of the water, with some water also reserved
    for the Navajo Nation, the City of Durango and the Farmington, NM area. While
    non-Indian irrigators would not have rights to water in the reservoir, they would obtain
    indirect benefits from the project because their access to current water rights would not be
    subject to a legal challenge by the Tribe. The Administration plan also proposes to

reservations. This visit allowed Secretary Cuomo the opportunity to meet with tribal

some cases - have been described as some of the worst housing conditions in the nation.

This year HUD is distributing $590 million nationwide to over 575 tribes under the
Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Detennination Act (NAHASDA).
NAHASDA gives tribes more authority to determine how to use HUD assistance and
directs HUD assistance to areas with the greatest needs.

funds Secretary Cuomo presented them to develop up to 200 homes for rent and
homeownership opportunities in partnership with other federal agencies, such as the
Bureau of Indian Affairs and USDA, and non-profit organizations, such as the Lakota
Fund and Habitat for Humanity. In addition, a downpayment assistance program will be
developed to help tribal members become homeowners. Funds will also be used to
maintain and modernize existing housing.
