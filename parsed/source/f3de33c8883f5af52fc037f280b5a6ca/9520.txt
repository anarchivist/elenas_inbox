TEXT:
Chuck's civil rights memo seemed OK, I guess. Chris's new book outline is                [uotJ
better than it was ,I       PS/(b)(S)      ~  I can't seem to find the
section on how the best way to achieve racial progress is to expand
opportunity for everybody.   (Or is that what Chris means by "Toward a new
Federal role to redress a national legacy of color-coded disadvantage and
unequal opportunity"?)
