We should also release the guide to after-school programs sometime soon,
but it doesn't seem to fit well with the town hall, either.

Subject:         Re: Charter Schools Study

Don and others -- including me -- had been thinking of national testing as
the focus of the town hall meeting; the charter schools study would push
the meeting in a different direction.  RIght now we are focusin on KY or
WVA for the meeting.  If we shifted to charters, we would probably have to
go someplace else.

As an alternative, they are holding May 13 and 14 open for POTUS, trying
to preserve some flexibility for him.  If a couple of days before we see
we need a message event, we could try to put something together around
charter schools.  If that window passes, we probably would have to tell
the Education Department to go ahead and release the report without us.

What do you think?
