                                     STATEMENT BY THE PRESIDENT         Hex-Dump Conversion


                I commend the Sentencing Commission for moving forward with recommendations to
         Congress to reduce the disparity between crack and powder cocaine penalties. My
         Administration will give them very serious consideration. I have asked Director McCaffrey and
         Attorney General Reno to review the recommendations and to report back to me in 45 days. I
         look forward to working with the Congress on this issue.

                In October 1995, I signed legislation disapproving the Sentencing Commission's
         recommendation to equalize penalties for crack and powder cocaine distribution by dramatically
         reducing the penalties for crack. I believe that was the wrong approach then, and would be the
         wrong approach now.

                Current law creates a substantial disparity between sentences for crack and powder
         cocaine. This disparity has led to a perception of unfairness and inconsistency in the federal
         criminal justice system.

                 The sentencing laws must continue to reflect that crack cocaine is a more harmful form of
         cocaine. The Sentencing Commission's new recommendations do so. Trafficking in crack, and
         the violence it fosters, has a devastating impact on communities across America, especially
         inner-city communities. Any change in penalties must ensure that more dangerous offenders
         receive tougher sentences.

                 As I have stated before, however, some adjustment to the cocaine penalty structure is
         warranted as a matter of sound criminal justice policy. Federal prosecutors should target mid-
         and high-level drug traffickers, rather than low-level drug offenders. An adjustment to the
         penalty scheme will help ensure this allocation of resources and make our federal efforts in
         fighting drugs more effective. That is why the legislation I signed directed the Sentencing
         Commission to undertake additional review of these issues and to report back with new
         recommendations.

                I am also pleased that the Sentencing Commission has increased penalties for
         methamphetamine offenses pursuant to the legislation which I signed into law last year. This
         law asked the Commission to toughen penalties on this emerging drug to prevent the kind of
         epidemic we saw in the 1980's with cocaine use. We will carefully study these new penalties.

                 My Administration has fought to stop drug abuse and its destructive consequences.
         Overall, drug use in the United States has fallen dramatically -- by half in 15 years. And cocaine
         use has dramatically decreased since the high point in 1985 -- the number of current cocaine
         users is down by 74% over the last decade. While these are encouraging figures, I am fully
         committed to doing more to keep bringing drug use down - - particularly among our children.
