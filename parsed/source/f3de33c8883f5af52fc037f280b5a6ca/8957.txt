TEXT:
We expect Riggs to come up this afternoon, probably around 3:00.    Here's
the latest:

1. Democratic whip count looks pretty solid: no one has said they will
vote for Riggs, only 4 are leaning toward Riggs, 8 undecided.  I'm not
sure how many no responses there are now, but Broderick and others think
we are in solid shape on our side.

2. Riggs has a manager's amendment he is expected to introduce.  It would
free district's from complying with Lau guidelines if the state has a law
that is inconsistent with it, and would prohibit districts from receiving
federal funds if they are not in compliance with state law.  Well suited
for CA--but an interesting legal theory that allows state ballot
initiatives to supercede Supreme Court decisions.  Dems are hoping he
proceeds with this amendment.

3. We don't have a good handle on Republican defections yet, though we
know there are some from New Mexico, and anticipate some from Texas and
Florida as well. Expect Riggs to pull the bill if he's in danger of
loosing.
