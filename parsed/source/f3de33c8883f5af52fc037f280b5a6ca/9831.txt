I wanted to forward to you this exchange I had with Dan re implementation
of contraceptive coverage in FEHBP.    OMP is moving quickly!

This is consistent with their usual operating procedure.  I have spoken
with them to urge them to approve all FDA approved methods and to act
quickly.  If you want to reach for the actual documents, we can do that
c/o Lisa Fairhall, our branch chief for OPM.  In addition, I got a call
from planned parenthood -- they will be sending a letter specifying some
concerns in implementation [Gina -- please make sure that Lisa and Cynthia
have a copy of this letter when it comes in.]

     I know that the omnibus bill hasn't even been signed into law yet, but
     that didn't stop me from calling Abby Bloch at OPM to find out what the
     next step would be regarding contraceptive coverage in FEHBP.   She said
     that there isn't any formal regulatory process regarding OPM benefits.
     Instead, she simply sends out a contract modification (which she has
     already drafted) which will go to plans shortly after the bill is signed,
     notifying them that they have to cover all FDA approved prescription
     contraceptives starting January 1, 1999. The plans will be required to
     sign the contracts by November 20.   I was pleased to learn that the
     provision will go into effect in the 1999 plan year (rather than 2000,
     which would naturally occur if they didn't modify the contracts that have
     been negotiated for 1999) .

     I asked her if I could get a copy of the draft contract/letter, and she
     declined because she (understandably) wants to see the legislative
     language signed by the President before she distributes it, and OPM
     contracts do not go through any formal clearance process anyway.   She did
     answer my questions regarding specific provisions in the contract -- she
     said that the letter will require plans to cover "the full range" of FDA
     approved prescription contraceptives, but it will not specify them by name
      (this sounds fine); she also said that the letter will not be sent to the
     5 religious plans specifically mentioned in the language, and other plans
     will be told to contact OPM if they believe they qualify for an exemption
     for religious plans (it will then be up to OPM to determine if they do in
     fact qualify); also, she said that plans will be required to notify
     enrollees regarding the change in benefits, but she hadn't decided whether
     they would be required to notify folks by a particular date or through
     specified materials, or whether they could just rely on the regular means
     of communicating with beneficiaries (which means the notification could
     get buried in the annual benefits manual sent out to beneficiaries).   I
     didn't ask her what OPM would communicate to plans regarding the
     conscience clause for providers (on moral and religious grounds), but I
     would be interested in finding this out.

     I wanted to give you the heads up on this, since OPM appears prepared to
     move rather quickly.    While I am very, very pleased that OPM is acting so
     expeditiously, I was surprised that we would not get to review what they
     are sending to plans (given how politicized the issue was and how
     difficult it was to get the legislative language just right).    I have not
     dealt with OPM very much, so I do not have a good sense of how independent
     their actions are.   FYI.
