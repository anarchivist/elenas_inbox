       PRESIDENT CLINTON HAILS SUCCESS OF WELFARE REFORM ONE YEAR AFTER
                         SIGNING REFORM BILL INTO LAW
                       August 12,1997 DRAFT 1: 8/11/979:00 am

    Today, the President highlighted the success of welfare reform nearly one year after signing the welfare
    law, announcing that caseloads have declined by almost 3.4 million or 24 percent since he took office and
    sharing how the new balanced budget will continue this progress. The President also noted the
    continuing success of the Welfare to Work Partnership, which now includes over 500 businesses and
    today launched a toll-free hotline and web page to help companies all across the nation hire people off
    welfare. Finally, the President praised the pUblic-private partnership growing in St. Louis, where over
    [200] companies have accepted his challenge to hire welfare recipients.

    One Year Later: We1fare Reform is Working
    In August 1996, President Clinton signed the welfare law. Today, one year later, the President
    announced new statistics showing that the welfare caseload has fallen by 1.4 million recipients since last
    August and by almost 3.4 million recipients since January 1993. The decline from 14.1 million recipients
    in January 1993 to 10.7 million in May 1997, a drop of24%, is the largest decrease in the welfare rolls in
    history, resulting in the lowest percentage of the population on welfare since 1970. Forty-eight out of
    fifty states have seen their caseloads decline, with eleven states reducing their rolls by 40% or more in the
    last four years. This progress started even before President Clinton signed the welfare bill, with the
    waivers he granted to 43 states to require work, time-limit assistance, make work pay, improve child
    support enforcement, and encourage parental responsibility.

    The New Balanced Budget will Help Us Do More
    Because of President Clinton's leadership, the balanced budget includes a $3 billion Welfare to Work
    Jobs Challenge and an expanded Work Opportunity Tax Credit to help move long-term welfare recipients
    into jobs and meet the President's goal of moving a million more people from welfare to work by the year
    2000. The new balanced budget also makes good on the President's promise to restore disability and
    health benefits to legal immigrants, continue Medicaid coverage for disabled children, and provide funds
    for workslots for unemployed food stamp recipients -- thereby reversing the provisions of the welfare law
    that had nothing to do with real welfare reform.

    The Welfare to Work Partnership
    The Welfare to Work Partnership, the sponsor oftoday's activities, is the national business effort to hire
    people from the welfare rolls which was launched in May 1997 at the urging of the President. The
    Partnership is a nonpartisan, non-profit organization of over 500 businesses committed to hiring former
    welfare recipients. The Partnership is committed to providing information, technical assistance, and
    support for businesses so that they can successfully meet their commitment to hire and retain welfare
    recipients without displacement.

    Today in St. Louis: Underscoring the Critical Role ofthe Private Sector
    Today in St. Louis, President Clinton will underscore the critical role of the private sector in welfare
    reform, praising the [200] St. Louis companies that are committing to hire and retain welfare recipients.
    At today's event, the Partnership will unveil several new tools to help companies that want to hire workers
    from the welfare rolls: a toll free hotline (1-888-USA-JOB 1) and a web site (www.welfaretowork.org) to
    link companies to public and private sector welfare reform information; a guide for companies hiring
    welfare recipients, Blueprint/or Business: Reaching a New Work Force, prepared with the National
    Alliance of Business; and a public service campaign that highlights the benefits to companies of hiring
    welfare recipients and encourages companies to join the Partnership.

                                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion
