                           MARYLAND EDUCATION EFFORTS


Standards: As a result of state education reform initiatives over the last five years, Maryland
has become known for having high standards. Education Week's report card gave Maryland in
Standards and Assessments a 100% rating. Part of the state's education reform efforts included
developing a test called the Maryland School Performance Assessment Program (MSP AP),
which measures how well students are meeting these standards by testing their reading, writing,
language, math, science, and socia!" studies skills. The Administration's proposal for national
voluntary tests in reading and math is very compatible with the MSPAP.

Charter Schools: There are no serious charter schools bills pending in the legislature, although
there are advocates for charter schools legislation in the legislature and on the State Board of
Education. Chris. Cross, the President of the Maryland State Board of Education and several other
Board members have been attempting to promote charter schools legislation for the past year.
However, this proposal ran into opposition from the Public School Superintendent's Association
of Maryland and the Maryland Association of Boards of Education. A Task Force appointed by
the State Board of Education concluded that local school boards already had sufficient authority
to establish charter schools -- and several have been established in Baltimore City.
Consequently, there are no current proposals in the legislature to authorize charter schools,
though most advocates of charter schools believe legislation is needed in order to see any
widespread development of new charter schools.

Hope Scholarship: Governor Glendening introduced legislation to create the Maryland Hope
Scholarship which will provide tuition, mandatory fees, and a book allowance to students who
graduate from a Maryland high school with a "B" average and whose family income is below
$60,000.



NOTE:

Baltimore City funding controversy: The state legislature will soon have to decide whether to
approve a proposed settlement of a suit brought by Baltimore against the State, alleging unlawful
disparities in school financing. Under the terms of the settlement, Baltimore will receive an
additional $40 million per year from the state in each of the next five years. In exchange,
Baltimore will accept a new school board, which will be jointly appointed by the Mayor of
Baltimore and the Governor of Maryland from a pool of candidates recommended by the State
Board of Education. Legislators from Montgomery and Prince George's Counties have objected
to the proposed settlement, arguing that it gives too much money to Baltimore. It is currently
impossible to predict whether the state legislature will approve the settlement.
