TEXT:
I just sent on to you USDA's response to us on the Arizona privatization
proposal.  It's basically OK.  You'll recall we have a deadline of a week
from tomorrow for USDA to act.  Since our next step is to see what people
here think, I just wanted to throw out the possibility that we could raise
this with Podesta tomorrow, as long as we have him trapped on FLSA.
