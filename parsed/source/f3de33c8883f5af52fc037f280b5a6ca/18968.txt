        Quick q&A on single-sex educaiton study.  I wasn't sure whether we needed
        to state the adminstration's position on the legality of the schools, I
        assumed it into the answer.

        McCurry's office said he's briefing at 1pm today.==================== ATTACHMENT     1

                           AAUW STUDY ON SINGLE-SEX EDUCATION



        Question:   Today's New York Times reports that the AAUW has released a new study on
                    single-sex education that finds no overall evidence that single-sex education was
                    better for girls than coeducation. In light of these findings, does the
                    administration continue to support the establishment of single-sex schools, such
                    as theYoung Women's Leadership Academy which is currently the subject of a
                    complaint filed with the U.S. Department of Education?

        Answer:     We agree with the AAUW on the point that single-sex schools are not a silver
                    bullet -- and that challenging standardse essential elements of good education.
                    And that's why the President has been fighting to get these crucial reforms into
                    every school in this Nation. The President also belives that parents ought to have
                    expanded choices in the public school system, including the option to have their
                    children attend single-sex schools.
