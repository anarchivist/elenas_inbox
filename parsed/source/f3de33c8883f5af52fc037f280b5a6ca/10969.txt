WILLIAM J. CLINTON
REMARKS AT JACKSON MANN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL
BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS
Tuesday, February 2, 1999

     I have often said that every problem in education in America has been
solved somewhere in America. The challenge is to spread proven solutions
to
other public schools.  In my State of the Union address last month, I set
out
an ambitious plan to do just that.  It is a plan that calls for more
investment in our public schools, but also for changing the way we
invest-to
stop rewarding what doesn't work and to start investing more in what does


works.

What works is precisely what you are doing in this state, in this city,
and in
this school. Better-trained teachers.   Reasonable discipline codes.
Issuing
report cards on all schools and turning around those that fail.  Setting
high
acade~ic standards for students and ending social promotion, but also
giving
students the support they need to meet those standards-with after school
and
early childhood learning programs, with reading tutors, with better trained
teachers, and with outreach programs to get parents more involved.   The
rising
test scores here at Jackson Mann elementary school show that you are on the
right track.  Now, we must make sure that all of our schools are on that
right
track.

   I believe that in the 21st Century that we as a nation must say: No
child
in America should be passed from grade to grade without having mastered the
materialD?no child in America should be taught by an unprepared
teacherD?no
child in America should be trapped in a failing school. There is no higher
priority for our nation than making certain all our children receive the
world's best education.  For as I have said many times before, the
information
age is really the education age.

I believe the federal government has a responsibility to help in this great
endeavor. That is why, over the last six years, we have made education a
new
and urgent priority for our national government. We have balanced the
budget-
moving from a deficit of $290 billion when I took office to a surplus of
$70
billion last year. But as we shrank government and balanced the budget, we
nearly doubled our investment in education and training.

We have helped every state adopt tougher academic standards. We've helped
hundreds of school districts crack down on drugs, gangs, and violence, and
the
percentage of students who report being threatened or injured at school
nationwide is down.  We've cut regulations in our elementary and secondary
education programs by two-thirds, and granted dozens of waivers so that
states
and school districts can have the flexibility to try new approaches. We've
begun to organize an army of tutors to help elementary school children
learn
to read and middle school and high school students to prepare for
college-and
I know that some of our America Reads tutors are doing a great job right
here
at Jackson Mann. We've dramatically increased our investment in early
childhood learning through the Head Start program.

All these efforts and others are beginning to payoff. SAT scores are up.
Math scores have risen in nearly all grades nationwide. But you know and I


know that we still have a long way to go. Reading scores have hardly
budged.
And while our 4th graders outperform their peers in other developed
countries
in math and science, our 8th graders are around average, and our 12th
graders
rank near the bottom.  Clearly, we must do· better

I believe the time to try is now, with our nation strong, our economy
prosperous, our budget in surplus, and our people confident. Yester9ay, I
released our new balanced budget for the year 2000.   It is a budget that is
both prudent and progressive.  It preserves the fiscal soundness that has
been
key to our prosperity.  Yet it also calls for vital new investments in
education--to build or fix 5000 schools; to hire 100,000 new, well-trained
teachers over the next seven years to bring down class sizes; to connect
every
classroom and library to the Internet; and to help all schools put in place
the kind of educational changes that work so well here at Jackson Mann.

 Every five years, the federal government revisits the terms on which it
invests $15 billion in our nation's schools.  1999 is such a year.  This
gives
us a golden opportunity, and a solemn responsibility, not only to invest
more
in our schools, but to change the way we invest. In my State of the Union
address, I announced that later this year, I will send to Congress a plan
that, for the first time, holds states and school districts accountable for
progress and rewards them for results. My Education Accountability Act will
require every state and school district receiving federal help to take the
following five steps.

First, all schools must end social promotion. When we allow our children to
pass from grade to grade without mastering the material, we doom them to
fall
further and further behind.  Every year, hundreds of thousands of students
graduate high school with such poor academic skills that they cannot
balance a
checkbook or draft a letter explaining a mistake in a credit card bill.
Social promotion short-changes not just low-achieving students but all
students, because it sends a message that results and effort don't matter;
that learning brings the same reward as not learning; that there is no
reason
to pay attention when the teacher says "listen up".  If we want classrooms
in
which all children work harder and aim higher, we must end social
promotion.

 But we must end social promotion the right way.  It is not fair to label
students as failures when the schools are failing them.  The goal of ending
social promotion must be to boost more students up, not hold more students
back. Under my plan, states and school districts will have to show how they
will provide the help students need to meet higher standards. That means
catching children's academic weaknesses in the early grades, before they
fall
too far behind.  It means offering smaller classes and better-trained
teachers, and my new balanced budget contains substantial new resources to
recruit and train teachers and bring class sizes down. It means purchasing
new
instructional materials that are proven to work, and there is new money in


my
balanced budget for that. It means offering after school and summer school
classes to students who·need help passing end-of-the-year performance
exams.
My balanced budget triples funding for after school and summer school.  It
means acting on the belief that every child can learn, and no child should
fall through the cracks.

Second, all states and school districts must identify their
worst-performing
schools and take responsibility for turning them around-as you have begun
doing here in Boston.   That means auditing each school for educational
weaknesses and providing resources that might help, such as reading tutors,
training for teachers, or an outreach coordinator to get parents more
involved.  If that doesn't work, a new principal must be brought in, with
road-tested curricula and better-trained teachers. My balanced budget
contains a new $200 million pool of flexible Title One funds that school
districts can use for all these purposes and more.   If none of that works,
then the school must be shut down--and perhaps reopened as a charter
school.
My new balanced budget continues our commitment to help more communities
launch charter schools.    It is simply wrong to consign children year after
year to schools that fail to help them learn their way out of poverty.

Third, all states and school districts must take responsible for the
quality
of their teachers, as the state of Massachusetts has done and Jackson Mann
has
done with its teacher development efforts. The great majority of our
teachers
do a fine job. But in too many schools, teachers don't have college majors
--or even minors -- in the subjects they teach. New teachers should be
required to pass performance exams, and all teachers should know the
subjects
they're teaching.

Fourth, all parents should be provided with report cards on their
children's
school, as the Boston schools now do.  Picking a school is perhaps the most
important choice a parent can make for a child.  But in too many
communities,
it's easier to get information on the quality of the local restaurants
than on
the quality of the local schools.  That must change.

Fifth, to assure that our classrooms are truly places of learning, and to
respond to what teachers have been asking us to do for years, all states
and
school districts must both adopt and implement sensible discipline
policies-
like the kind you have in Boston schools [ckl .

We know these five steps are the right steps, because they are working
here.
They are working in Chicago. They are working in North Carolina. They can
work all across America, and we must make that happen, for the sake of our
nation and our children. The federal government must not try to
micro-manage
our public schools. Accountability and flexibility can and must work hand
in


hand.  But we can work in partnership with states and school districts, to
invest more in our public schools, and to make common sense solutions
common
practice in all our public schools

 Thank you and God bless you.
