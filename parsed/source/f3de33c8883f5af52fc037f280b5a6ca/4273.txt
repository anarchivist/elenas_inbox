J.   u.s. Leadership in Global Tobacco Control
Settlement Provisions
The settlement does not include any provisions that address global tobacco control, and therefore
has been widely criticized by the U.S. and international public health communities. Most
recently, a resolution was passed at the 10th World Conference on Tobacco or Health in Beijing
calling for any national settlement to take into account international tobacco control concerns.

Proposed Administration Position
Three principles should guide Administration policy in this area:
o Tobacco products should be treated in both the domestic and international arenas consistent
with their known harmful health effects;

o U.S. embassies and missions should act consistent with domestic policies. e.g., U.S. officials
overseas will not engage in activities intended or likely to increase overall consumption of
tobacco or which would interfere with a foreign government's efforts to establish and maintain
sound public health practices; and,

o U.S. government will support efforts to ensure U.S. companies are not unfairly discriminated
against.
                                                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion
IV. Administration Strategy

The Administration wants to give momentum to a legislative package that will effectively put in
place a national tobacco control policy for the 21 st Century that will have as its primary focus the
protection of our children's health. From this point today to the passage of such legislation and
the President's signing of a bill, the road is filled with uncertainties. It is increasingly clear that
Congress will not act on such legislation until 1998. The public health community wants a
legislative solution but is very skeptical of the details of the settlement. Many parties -- most
noticeably tobacco farmers -- were not at the table for the negotiations on the settlement and how
to involve them and keep them involved are still matters for discussion. The disclosure of
industry documents -- whether in state lawsuits or in potential DO] criminal actions -- may
radically change the shape and tenor of public debate. Finally, while many have weighed in on
the settlement, there are still other potential critics such as the FTC whose statements may also
substantially affect congressional and public views of the settlement.

While the settlement takes the nation another step down the road to legislation, it also presents
substantial obstacles to passage oflegislation. First, the process by which the settlement came
to be is troublesome. As noted above, substantial stakeholders -- such as farmers -- were not
involved and furthermore the process did not provide for congressional ownership and action on
legislation. Second, on a substantive level, the settlement is seriously flawed as the previous
analysis sections show, e.g., limiting FDA authority, inadequate disclosure and financial
provisions, lack of real accountability on part of industry to reduce youth smoking, and overly
broad anti-trust exemptions. Thus, if the Administration uses the settlement as the basis for
moving legislation, the Administration becomes the target of all those criticisms. Given the
additional criticisms still to come of the deal (e.g., congressional hearings, FTC analysis) and the
need for flexibility in a protracted congressional debate, the settlement finally does not advance
the Administration's goal of getting solid and effective tobacco control legislation for the 21st
Century.

The primary goal of a Presidential statement must be to give momentum to the legislative process
by describing what the Administration wants, by forcing Congress to take responsibility of
acting, and by giving the Administration maximum leverage in those negotiations. On issues
that the Administration cares about, the statement should set specific bars but always with an eye
to maintaining negotiating leverage. The Administration also wants to involve relevant
stakeholders in the process and keep them committed to the process.

Here are the principles that the President could use to layout his vision for a
legislatively-mandated tobacco control policy for the 21 st Century.

o Provisions oflegislation will be ultimately measured by how well they protect the nation's
children and adolescents.

o Preserve FDA's authority over tobacco products, unencumbered by procedural or substantive
criteria that may diminish that authority
- No restrictions on factors Agency must consider, types of actions Agency may take or statutory
                                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion
classifications that Agency must follow
- No altered standards of judicial review
- No treatment for particular types of products or claims

o Ensure that FDA remains flexible to meet the future health challenges of tobacco
- Able to impose additional requirements on marketing and manufacture and to expand Agency's
jurisdiction based on changing marketplace or new science

o Hold each tobacco company accountable for reducing the use of tobacco by youths, and ensure
that penalties provide real economic incentives

o Achieve maximum disclosure of documents possible
- Public health agencies must have complete and ready access to documents to do their jobs
- Public has right to know and burden should be on industry for proving otherwise

o Recognize that reduction in tobacco use will have major impact on farmers and the economies
of their areas and they must be involved in the legislative process

o Provide sufficient financial resources to meet public health goals and address the industry's
past behavior
-Money must be additive (not substitute for existing appropriations)
- No tax deductibility

o Create an intemational strategy that puts the u.s. in a leadership position on tobacco control
and mirrors domestic efforts to reduce tobacco use among young people

o Express willingness to discuss other issues, such as civil liability, but only in the context of
comprehensive legislative solution that is consistent with principles described above

If the proposed settlement -- even "fixed" -- is enacted into law it will not accomplish what the
principles stated above aim to achieve. But if Congress crafts a legislative package that is
consistent with these principles, and places public health considerations above all others, then a
comprehensive solution and a tobacco control policy for the 21 st Century are within our reach.
                                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion
List of Recommendations:

FDA Authority: "Preserve FDA's authority over tobacco products, unencumbered by procedural
or substantive criteria that may diminish that authority, and ensure that FDA remains flexible to
meet the future health challenges oftobacco."

Penalties: "Hold each tobacco company accountable for reducing the use of tobacco by youths,
and ensure'that penalties provide real economic incentives."

Farmers: "Recognize that the reduction in tobacco use will have a major impact on farmers and
the economies of their areas and that they must be involved in the legislative process."

Funding: "Recommendation: Provide sufficient financial resources to meet public health goals
and address the industry's past behavior. Options: .... "
