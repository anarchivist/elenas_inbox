TEXT:
On page 21, the bill deletes a section that was in the Senate bill "that said
that the statute of limitations was tolled if there was a stay or injunction
against an action. This is CRITICAL in cases where the defendant goes bankrupt,
e.g., breast implants, dalkon shield, asbestos, where a stay WILL be issued
against the suit, and the bankruptcy case may take years and then dies, by which
time, of course, the statute will have run.  Ellen
