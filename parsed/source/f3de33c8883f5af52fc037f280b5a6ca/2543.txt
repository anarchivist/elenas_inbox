         STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS: NEW EDUCATION INITIATIVES
                          DRAFT -- January 23, 1998

President Clinton is proposing new initiatives that will dramatically strengthen elementary· and
secondary education. These proposals will help ensure that all students start out in a small class
with a good teacher, in a safe, modem school. They will also help ensure that students,
especially in high poverty urban and rural areas, attend schools where high standards are taken
seriously and kids are given the help they need to succeed. The President's proposals will
dramatically expand access to safe havens for after-schoolleaming, and ensure that low-income
students receive the support and encouragement to finish school and continue on to college.

Small Classes with Qualified Teachers to Improve Reading in Grades 1-3. President
Clinton is proposing a $12.4 billion initiative over 7 years ($7.3 billion over 5 years) to help
local schools provide small classes with qualified teachers in the early grades. This will help
ensure that every child receives personal attention, learns to read independently and gets a solid
foundation for further learning. The new initiative will reduce class size from a nationwide
average of 22 in grades 1-3 to an average of 18, providing funds to help local school districts hire
an additional 100,000 well-prepared teachers. The initiative will also provide funds to states
and local school districts to test new teachers, develop more rigorous teacher testing and
certification requirements, and train teachers in effective reading instruction practices. Schools
districts will be accountable for demonstrating gains in reading achievement. These steps will
help ensure that first through third grade students are receiving high-quality reading instruction in
smaller classes from competent teachers.

Modem School Buildings to Improve Student Learning. In order for students to learn and to
compete in the global economy, schools must be well-equipped and they must be able to
accommodate smaller class sizes. To address these and other critical needs, President Clinton is
proposing Federal tax credits to pay interest on nearly $22 billion in bonds to build and renovate
public schools. This is more than double the assistance proposed last year, which covered half
the interest on an estimated $20 billion in bonds. The tax credits will cost the Treasury $5
billion over 5 years, and more than $10 billion over ten years. Of the $22 billion in bond
authority, nearly $20 billion is for a new School Modernization Bonds. Half of this bond
authority will be allocated to the 100 school districts with the largest number oflow-income
children, and the other half will be allocated to the States. In addition, the President is
proposing a more than $2.4 billion expansion of the Qualified Zone Academy Bonds,
school-business partnerships that will include funding for school construction and renovation.

Education Opportunity Zones: Helping Students in Poor Communities Reach High
Standards. This initiative will strengthen public schools and help students master the basic and
advanced skills where the need is the greatest: in high poverty urban. and rural communities
where concentrated poverty, low expectations, too many poorly prepared teachers, and
overwhelmed school systems create significant barriers to high achievement. The Education
Department will select approximately fifty high poverty urban and rural school districts with: (1)
a demonstrated commitment to use high standards and· tests of student achievement as tools to
identify and provide help to students, teachers and schools who need it; (2) a strategy to prevent
                                                                           Hox-Oump Conversion
students from falling behind by ensuring quality teaching, challenging curricula, and extended
learning time; (3) programs to end social promotion and turn around failing schools; and (4)
evidence of improved student achievement. Added investments in these communities will
accelerate their progress and provide models of successful, standards-based reform for the nation.
 The President's initiative will invest $200 million in FY99, and $1.5 billion over 5 years, in
raising achievement and sharing lessons learned with school districts around the country.

Expanding Access to Safe After-School Care. To help create safe, positive learning
environments for American school-age children who lack adult supervision during a typical
week, the President has proposed to increase the 21st Century Learning Center Program by $800
million over five years. The program will support school-community partnerships that expand
or establish programs providing after-school care for up to half a million children a year.

Early Intervention to Promote College Attendance. President Clinton will soon announce a
long-term effort to bring college opportunity to children in high-poverty areas by providing their
families with early information about financial aid and the best courses to take to be
well-prepared for college, as well as support services to help the children stay on track through
high school graduation and into college.
