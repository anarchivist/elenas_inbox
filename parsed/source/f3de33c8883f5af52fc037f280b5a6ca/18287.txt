TEXT:
Extensive briefings are taking place on the child care plan, as you know,
between this evening and tomorrow's event.  As I understand it, the Hill
beginning at 7:00 tonight, governors at 9:00 a.m., groups later in a.m.

Melissa Skofield has suggested, and I agree, backgrounding the wires early
during this process to avoid it being defined by others.

Can one of you, or another appropriate person, background our wires (and
maybe CNN) in the a.m. if we set it up? If so, what times would be
possible?
