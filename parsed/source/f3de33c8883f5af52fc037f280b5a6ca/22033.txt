TEXT:
I wanted to weigh in on having an explicit family agenda articulated in
the SOTU.  I think it's important for two reasons: 1) We need a piece
which will appeal to women's groups (I haven't been made aware of another
section which will do that); 2) The women's community won't be very happy
if we embrace a privatization component to social security reform. Let's
front load those policies supported by the President which do appeal to
them.

Let me know if I can be of help in organizing a preview meeting with key
groups. We should also think about a preview meeting with the Democratic
Congresswoman. I'll raise the latter with Larry and Janet.
