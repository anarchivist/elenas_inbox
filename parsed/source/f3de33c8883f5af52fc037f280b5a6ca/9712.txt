Attached are the test fallbacks.  I've kept in the "no implementation
without authorization" option in case we need that as a last resort.

I'll forward a draft memo to Erskine within the next few minutes.===================

Restriction on Pilot Test With Individual Scores
Sec. _     Notwithstanding any other provision of Federal law, no funds provided to the
       Department of Education or to an applicable program in this Act or in any other Act in
       fiscal year 1999 may be used for a pilot test that would yield individual student, school,
       school district, or state scores as part of the development of any federally sponsored
       voluntary national test in reading, mathematics, or any other subject, or to field test,
       implement or administer any such test; Provided, That the National Assessment

5. NAS Study on Embedding NAEP Items in State and Local Tests
The National Academy of Sciences shall conduct a study of the technical feasibility of including
      items from the National Assessment of Educational Progress or other tests in state and
      district assessments to provide a measure of individual student performance against
      National Assessment of Educational Progress standards in 4th grade reading and 8th
      grade mathematics and the quality of the information about a student's performance that
      would be provided to parents and teachers. The National Academy of Sciences shall
      report the results of the study to Congress by June 1, 1999.

No State or Local Implementation Without Quality Assurance
 No State or local educational agency receiving financial assistance from the Secretary of
Education may participate in any national test in 4th grade reading or 8th grade mathematics that
is supported by the Secretary and that measures individual student performance against
standards of the National Assessment of Educational Progress unless the State or local
educational agency, as the case may be, certifies to the Secretary that it has developed, and has
begun to carry out, a plan to--
        (1) ensure that teachers have the knowledge and skills they need
to teach students to meet those standards;
        (2) provide all students with access to a challenging curriculum
that can prepare them to meet those standards; and
        (3) provide additional assistance to students and schools that do
not make progress toward meeting those standards.

 No Implementation Without Authorization & NAGB Develops Plan for Test
Implementation and Use
Sec. _     Notwithstanding any other provisions of Federal law, funds provided to the
Department of Education or to an applicable program may not be used to implement or
administer any federally sponsored national test in reading, mathematics or any other
subject that is not specifically and explicitly provided for in authorizing legislation enacted
into law. The National Assessment Governing Board shall develop a plan for the
continued development and implementation of national tests that measure individual
student performance against National Assessment of Educational Progress standards in 4th
grade reading and 8th grade mathematics. The plan shall include policies for the
administration and use of national tests. In developing this plan, NAGB shall consider
the feasibility of including items from the National Assessment of Educational Progress or
other tests in state and district assessments to provide a measure of individual student
performance against National Assessment of Educational Progress standards in 4th grade
reading and 8th grade mathematics. NAGB shall present a written plan to the Committee
on Education and Workforce of the House of Representatives, the Committee on Labor
and Human Resources of the Senate, and the President for their consideration by _ _
(prior to reauthorization of the National Assessment of Education Progress).

        Propose reducing the appropriations for test development from $16 to $8-10 million.
        These funds have been requested in the Education Department's Fund for the Improvement of
        Education (FIE) account. (Keep 10 million if we do both NAS studies)
