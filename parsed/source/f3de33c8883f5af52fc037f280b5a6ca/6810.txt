TEXT:
Yesterday, the American Public Welfare Association passed a resolution
supporting the two Administration budget initiatives related to welfare
reform: welfare to work housing vouchers and Access to Jobs.  I understand
they also expressed concern about the funding source for Access to Jobs,
i.e. they do not support funding it out of cuts in other human service
programs (they are particularly concerned about further cuts in Title XX
and food stamp administration).  I'll pass around the resolution as soon
as I get it.
