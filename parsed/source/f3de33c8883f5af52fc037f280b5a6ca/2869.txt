 TEXT:
 The next meeting will be from 2:30 to 3:30 on Friday, in room 231.
 Everyone will be cleared in. Topics are: (i) negligent entrustment; (ii)
 small business exceptions; (iii) misuse and alteration; (iv) workers
 compo We'll move quickly.

 What follows are the options currently extant.   Please be careful.

 Joint and several
 Proposal 1 - Reallocation
         00      Joint and several if the plaintiff is fault-free
         00      If the plaintiff is at all at fault, liability is
 several, but if the plaintiff cannot collect from one or more defendant
 after a specified period of time        the plaintiff can petition the court for
 reallocation of damages not attributable to the plaintiff among the
 remaining defendants, but no defendant less at fault than the plaintiff
 may be charged with more than twice his proportionate share of damages
         00      This would be two-way preemptive
 Proposal 2A - Guaranteed recovery, two-way preemption
         00      Joint and several liability of any defendant is than 30%
 at fault (taking into account the fault of the plaintiff and settling
 defendants)
         00      If any defendant is less than 30% at fault, that
 defendantO,s responsibility would be limited to a maximum of twice the
 defendantO,s proportionate share of non-economic damages except where a
 greater multiplier was needed to ensure the plaintiff recovery of at least
 50% of the assessed non-economic damages.
 Proposal 2B - Guaranteed recovery, one-way preemption
         00      Joint and several liability of any defendant is than 10%
 at fault (taking into account the fault of the plaintiff and settling
 defendants)
         00      If any defendant is less than 10% at fault, that
 defendantO,s responsibility would be limited to a maximum of twice the
 defendantO,s proportionate share of non-economic damages except where a


 greater multiplier was needed to ensure the plaintiff recovery of at least
 60% of the assessed non-economic damages.

 Punitive damages
 Proposal 1 - Procedural changes only
         DO       Support the provisions in S.648 providing for uniform
 federal standards of clear and convincing evidence and the right to
 request bifurcation.
         DO       Support a uniform federal liability standard for
 punitive damages that would not include recklessness, .but (i) would not
 require that the conduct that is the subject of the punitive damages is
 the D&proximate causeD8 of the plaintiff D,s harm and (ii) would explicitly
 permit circumstantial evidence of intent or malice.
         DO       This would be two-way preemption, except that it would
 not require states that currently do not allow punitive damages in
 products cases to allow such awards
 Proposal 2 - Personal cap plus allocation of remaining punitive damages to
 state
         DO       Authorize the jury to impose punitive damages without
 any cap
         DO       Vest the plaintiff in a 25% share of the total punitive
 damages, which amount will be assumed to include attorneyD,s fees (i.e.,
 no additional attorneyD,s fees will be payable out of the punitive award)
         DO       The remainder of the award would be payable to the state
 whose substantive law applies to the determination of punitive damages.
         DO       States would be forbidden to intervene in the
 prodeedings at any stage.
         DO       Combine this with the procedural reforms outlined in
 Proposal 1
         DO       This would be two-way preemptive except (i) it would not
 require states that do not allow punitive damages in products cases to
 allow such awards and (ii) states would explicitly be allowed to opt out
 of the allocation to the state, in which case prior state law with respect
 to caps and allocation would apply
 Proposal 3 - Advisory jury opinion with judicial determination
         DO       The jury would render a solely advisory opinion on
 punitive damages
         DO       The actual deterimination of punitive damages would be
 made by the judge
         DO       The judge would be required to consider the factors in
 5.648, and would be required to explain why the judgeD,s award differs
 (either higher or lower) from the juryD,s advice
         DO       Combine with procedural changes from proposal I
 proposal 4 - Cap with easier breakthrough
         DO       Cap punitive damages at the greater of $250,000 or twice
 compensatories (the lesser of the two for small businesses)
         DO       Do not tell the jury of the cap
         DO       Allow the judge to award punitive damages above the cap
 without an additional proceeding and on a simple finding that the capped
 amount is D&insufficient to punish or deter,D8 the standard in 5.648, with
 no consideration of specified factors
         DO       Insist that there be no legislative history suggesting
 this authority is to be used any more sparingly than implied by the
 statutory standard
         DO       Couple this with the procedural changes described in
 proposal 1
         DO       This would be two-way preemptive, except with respect to
 states that do not allow punitives in products cases at all

 Statute of repose


         DO       Two-way preemption of state law (as in 8.648)
         DO       18 year statute of repose (as in 8.648)
         DO       Which a plaintiff may overcome by clear and convincing
 evidence that the product had a longer useful safe life (not included in
 8.648, and responsive to the victim of the hay-baler accident cited in the
 veto message and to accidents involving products clearly intended to be
 longer-lived, such as elevators)
         DO       Covering only durable goods in the workplace (narrower
 than 8.648, retaining plaintiff rights concerning consumer goods in states
 without any statute of repose and responding to your concern about
 handguns)
         DO       With further exceptions for toxic substances, vehicles
 used in transportation for hire, and express warranties (as in 8.648)
         DO       And with a provision that extends the statute to allow
 full benefit of the two-year statute of limitations after injury or
 discovery of harm in, for example, year 17 (not in 8.648, but not expected
 to be a problem)
