TEXT:
NSF has asked the CEA to cosponsor a workshop on "The Development of Human
Capital through Families and Communities" It would focus on the role that
families and communities play in helping children become productive citizens,
what the critical stages are in a child's development, why some children are
more resilient when faced with family and social problems, etc. WH Counsel has
signed off on it.   Please let me know if you have any problems from the
substance/ message point of view.
