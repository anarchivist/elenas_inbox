TEXT:
HHS has produced a long list of federal licenses granted by 14 agencies,
but -- without going to each agency -- we haven't yet been able to find
out how many people hold these licenses and whether through executive
action we could deny them to those who owe child support.

Thus,   I'm afraid we need to go to the agencies.

Cabinet affairs has suggested I make this pitch at the next Chief of
Staffs breakfast.  I would probably thank them for their federal hiring
efforts too.  Does that sound okay to you?
