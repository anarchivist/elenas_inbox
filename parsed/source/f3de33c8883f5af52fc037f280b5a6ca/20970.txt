                                                     H-IB Legislation
                                                      August 5, 1998

               Q:   Why has the Administration not embraced the Republican compromise on H-IB
                    legislation?

               A:   Although the Republican agreement includes a training provision and limited protections
                    for U.S. workers, it falls short in several respects. The attestations are weak and too
                    many employers are exempt from their obligations. Also, the training provision would
                    not generate sufficient funds.

               Q:   Some Republicans and hi-tech executives claim that the Administration keeps
                    moving the bar on what it would consider an acceptable bill. What has been going
                    on?

               A:   Our position on this issue is unchanged: in order for the President to sign a bill that
                    increases the cap on H-lB visas, it must contain both a significant training component
                    and meaningful reform to the H-IB program to ensure that American companies recruit
                    U.S. workers and not lay-off U.S. workers in order to replace them with H-IB workers.

                    The Republican agreement that was unveiled late last week falls short in several respects.
                     It would generate inadequate training funds and would exempt large numbers of
                    employers from the attestation obligations. We have had a series of detailed discussions
                    with the sponsors of the bill and have suggested changes that would increase the funding
                    for training and strengthen the protections for U.S. workers.

               Q:   The House leadership is threatening to bring their bill to a vote tomorrow. Will
                    you veto it?

               A:   It is unclear at this point whether this bill is scheduled for tomorrow. However, if the
                    Congress passes this.bill and it is presented to the President, his senior advisors will
                    recommend that he veto it. While the President is willing to sign a bill to raise the caps,
                    he also wants to make sure that we protect and provide training for U.S. workers. We
                    want to work with the Congress to develop a balanced bill that addresses the growing
                    demand for highly skilled workers.
