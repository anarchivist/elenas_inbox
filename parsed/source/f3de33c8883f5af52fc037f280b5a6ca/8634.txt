TEXT:
Gingrich and Pete Hoekstra are doing a press conference at 1:00pm on
Thursday, release a report from the House Education and Workforce
committee--"Education and a CrossRoads." The report, a biased summary of
a year's worth of hearings on what works and what doesn't primarily in
K-12 education, calls for block grants, vouchers, Coverdell IRA's and more
accountability.  Education Committee Democrats are organizing a press
conference for later in the afternoon; they are trying to get Gephardt to
come. Riley is out of town and Brod Johnson just called to tell me that
they are requesting a "high level White House official" to participate.

While the details of this are still a bit fuzzy,   I think it would be good
to have someone there--Bruce, Gene, Paul???

I'll have a copy of the report first thing in the morning, and can work on
talking points for whoever needs it.
