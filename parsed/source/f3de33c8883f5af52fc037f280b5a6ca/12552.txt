TEXT:
FINALLY ...

I spoke with Chris Lehane and indicated that the VP and Oprah missed each
other. Although Chris isn't optimistic, the VP still has intentions on
inviting her.  I alerted Maya and let her know the staff wasn't quite as
optimistic has she was.


Just rec'd a call from Andy Spahn reference the Spielberg Statement. Andy
thought the statement was kind of weak.   He read it to me by phone.   I
thought it was fine.  I informed him that they should feel free to beef it
up.
WHAT TIME DO YOU NEED THIS STATEMENT BACK?    Andy wasn't sure when he
would be able to catch up with Spielberg.
