TEXT:
Its on the top of my list, and will do asap.  I haven't gotten any
feedback yet from you or Bruce on the Erskine memo on conference strategy.
-- cancel that--Allison is going to pick up Bruce's right now. Any
comments from you?

Also--the conference strategy is to Erskine, not POTUS. Doesn't that
suggest that I ought to repeat stuff in the weekly?
