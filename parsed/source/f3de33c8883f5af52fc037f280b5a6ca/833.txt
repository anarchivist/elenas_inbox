TEXT:
Last night, I faxed you a copy of the proposed OMB passback on the HHS
(Golden) testimony on the Administration's welfare and adoption
proposals. This testimony will be delivered on Thursday before the House
Subcommittee on Human Resources.    I have received an additional edit to
this testimony:.

        p. 3, third paragraph, 7 lines down.  Currently reads:  "We will collect
all the information we can on how the states are using their dollars and
we will take all the administrative actions in our power to ensure that
state policies focus on work and do not result in costs to the Federal go
vernment due to the loss of child support collections."

        Proposed edit from IM in bold:      "We will collect all the information
we can on how the states are using their dollars and we will take all the
administrative actions in our power to ensure that state policies focus on
work, and, if necessary, we will work with the states and Congress to
develop legislation to ensure that this flexibility does not result in
costs to the Federal government due to the loss of child support
collections.

Is this edit OK?     Please let me know as soon as possible.    Thank you.
