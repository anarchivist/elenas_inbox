Subject:         Did you see this?

From today's McCurry briefing:


             Q    On welfare, there'S a new study out today that says
that jobs exist for only about half of the displaced welfare workers
and there are protests being planned tomorrow in 50 states. Does the
'. "
President have any plans or ideas to find jobs for these displaced
workers?

             MR. MCCURRY: We've been working ceaselessly on that, as
you know.  From the efforts that we've made to encourage a response
by the private sector to the works that we're doing with state
governments to assure that there are services, training, placement
services available -- there's a considerable amount of effort both in
the public sector and the private sector to get the kind of response
we need and we need -- we have an economy, remember, that's now
created almost 14 million jobs in the last five years, so the jobs
are there.  Matching people who we're formerly dependent on welfare
to the job opportunities that exist has to be part of the effort, but
also encouraging private sector employees to take a chance on someone
who has been welfare-dependent has been a major part of the
President's effort.  He's worked on this, done lots of events.  I
think you've all been at some of those events.

             Q    Does that mean that he's done everything he can and
it's up to the private sector now?

              MR. MCCURRY:  Well, he's has not done everything he can
because he plans to do more and has been doing a great deal to
stimulate that kind of response. We've been working on this I think
-- I don't think anyone can challenge the notion that the President
has devoted a considerable amount of time. to making sure that this
transition that has to occur in our economy away from a model of
dependency through the cycle of welfare that existed prior to reform
-- we'.ve made it clear that we've got to change the whole culture and
the ethic of how employers and those who are welfare-dependent
approach their own responsibilities as we implement welfare reform.
