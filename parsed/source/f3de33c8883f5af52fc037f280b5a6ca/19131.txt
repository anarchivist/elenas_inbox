 TEXT:
 Here is a draft of the veto letter. I've sent a copy to ED for quick
 comments, to make sure I haven't screwed anything up.

 A couple of points, small and large:

 1.  I dont' know who we send the letter to--Gingrich, Goodling/Jeffords
 and ranking members?

 2. You know I'm not big on process, but it seems appropriate to get OMB
 and Leg Affairs into this. will staffing out the letter accomplish this,
 or is there some other steps I should take?

  3. There are some key items in or about the overall Higher Education Act
  that need to be sorted out before we send this letter. Chief among them:
  We expect an anti-affirmative action amendment from Riggs when this bill
  reaches the floor.   Does a veto threat on this bill at this point change
  the dynamics on the affirmative action vote, by giving people a "free"
  vote since the will think the bill will be vetoed?
  The bill as reported out by committee includes our High Hopes mentoring
  initiative--passed over Goodling's objections.   POTUS and others should be
  aware of this before sending the letter.
  The bill adopted the Administration's proposal to reduce interest rates on
  student loans, but also increased profits to banks at a cost of $2.7
  billion (I think over 5 years). This is one of the most hotly contested
  items in the bill--we are strongly opposed to the committee's move on
  this.   I didn't want to cloud this particular letter up with additional
  issues, so I put in a general sentence about "reservations about a number
. of provisions in the bill" to give us room to come back to this later.
  Others may see this differently.
  There is also another major higher education issue we are fighting with
  the R's about- regarding accountability provisions and the treatment of
  guarantee agencies in the student loan program. As on the above issue, my
  concern is that we not look like we are ignoring central issues to the
  student financial aid programs which are at the heart of this bill.   I
  think we can address this concern through statements and other actions
  outside this letter, but everyone needs to be on board on that approach.

4.  I have been working very closely with the National Board staff over
the past few days, and am scheduled to meet with them at 3:30 today.  They
have the best handle on a legislative strategy.  I would like to talk this
step through with them before we act.

In general, their sense of things is that (1) they don't want a floor vote
in the House because they don't have enough support to win and don't want
a recorded vote; (2) their conversations with Jeffords and others on the


Senate committee lead them to believe they will not face a similar move in
mark-up next week, though could when the bill comes to the floor; (3) they
would in general prefer to keep things low key until they get through
Senate mark-up, and would probably prefer saber-rattling from the White
Hous"e after that point; (4) Jim Hunt is still the key guy for the Board,
would love the President's support in this fight, and will gladly take it
whenever it comes. ==================== ATTACHMENT    1 ====================

DRAFT:

Dear- - - -

        Last week when the House Education and Economic Opportunities Committee reported
out the Higher Education Act, it included a provision that prohibited continued federal support
for the vital work of National Board for Professional Teaching Standards. The National Board
is a nonprofit, nonpartisan and nongovernmental body devoted to strengthening teaching by
developing rigorous professional standards. The Board has been at the forefront of bipartisan
efforts at the national and state level to strengthen teaching in America, and has received
bipartisan support in the Congress and in two Administrations.

        The recently released results of the Third International Math and Science Study confirm
that one of the most important steps the nation can take to improve student achievement is to
strengthen teaching. The National Board for Professional Teaching Standards is an essential
tool for our nation's efforts. By defining standards of excellence for experienced teachers, the
National Board helps to focus and upgrade teacher training, recognize and reward outstanding
teachers, and keep our best teachers in the classroom where they are needed the most. National
Board certification helps our best teachers test themselves against the toughest standards for
teaching ever developed.

       By ending federal support for the Board's research and development, the House
Committee action jeopardizes the scheduled completion of the development of professional
standards within the next 3 years. This is the wrong step to take at precisely the time when we
must work to help every school in America have at least one board-certified master teacher who
can help lead the effort to strengthen teaching throughout the school.

        The Office of Manageinent and Budget is coordinating a review of the Higher Education
Act as reported by the Committee. I have serious reservations about a number of the bill's
provisions, but I am very clear now that the provision ending funding for the work of the
National Board is unacceptable. It will move our efforts to improve teaching backward when
we must instead move forward more rapidly. It is early in the legislative process for the Higher
Education Act, and there is still time to correct this unfortunate step. However, if the Higher
Education Act eliminates continuing support for the National Board for Professional Teaching
Standards when it reaches by desk, I will veto that bill.


Sincerely,
