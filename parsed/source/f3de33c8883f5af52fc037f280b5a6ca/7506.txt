TEXT:
The event is Thursday from 1-2 p.m. in room 450.   Program includes: HHS
Asst Secretray Olivia Golden, Secretaries Alexis Herman and Rodney Slater,
Senator Specter, and Congressman Danny Davis.   Two Congressional
participants were chosen in consultation with Jeff Forbes -- Specter is
key appropriator and offered Senate amendment (along with Santorum and
Moseley-Braun) to increase Access to Jobs; Davis offered House amendment.
Olivia will open and frame issue for 5 minutes, everyone else as 10
minutes to speak.   Main goal is to raise visibility for the appropriations
process. There not be Q&A during the program, but press will be able to
speak to agency officials informally afterwards.   We should have about ioo
people attending including about a dozen Hill staff, lots of state and
local organizations representing welfare, workforce, and transportation
issues, community-based organizations, representatives from a number of
state and local agencies.

Handouts will include: one-pager on Access to Jobs (what it is, why we
need is), one pager summarizing two welfare to work transportation
examples which show the need for transportation and how Access to Jobs
could' help (1. former welfare recipient who now runs· a business operating
a van to transport other welfare recipients in Anne Arundel and 2. bus
link from Camden, NJ to UPS facility at Philadelphia airport).    Former
recipients from each place, representative from UPS, and asst director of
Anne Arundel will also be in the audience and available for press to talk
with afterwards.
