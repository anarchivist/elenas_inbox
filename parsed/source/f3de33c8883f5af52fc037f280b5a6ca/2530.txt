I am very concerned about the "fry" factor among DPC staff.        Many of you

work

ridiculous hours, all weekends, and do not take time for yourselves to

cool

down.      Well, you are about to be presented with an historic opportunity.

From

approximately December 23rd until January 4, the President, Bruce Reed,

and

Gene Sperling will all be on vacation.        That hopefully means no events,

little
      /.




budget work, etc.     There will not be an opportunity like this until next

August.    Therefore, I am asking all of you to take some significant time

off

this holiday season in order to preserve your       mental sanity, physical

health,

and family ties.



This request is in my own interest.     If you take a vacation, then you

won't

burn out and quit.     In addition, you will come back hopefully recharged.



Please go away.     Take a week off at a minimum.   Don't force me to have to

lock

you out of the office over the holiday break.
