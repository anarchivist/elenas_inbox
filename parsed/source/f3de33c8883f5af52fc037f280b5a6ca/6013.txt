I sent the attached question to OMB and was told that you were working on
this w/Josh Gothbaum at OMB.  I've asked because ONDCP is making calls to
the Hill saying that OMB is considering including different/new language
on needles. Biden's office called me to recommend that we not start off
the year on the wrong foot by making needle exchange an issue.

Kevin:

Where are we w/respect to "needle exchange" language in the budget.  Folks
at the AIDS office tell me that we're simply transmitting the same
language from appropriations bills past, but several folks on the Hill
have called to express concern that our budget will include new/different
language that might be controversial to some.
