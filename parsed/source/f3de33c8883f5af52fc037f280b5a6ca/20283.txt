Q.   How is the early warning guide different from the annual report on school safety
     that you've already announced?

A.   The early warning guide will be specifically tailored to help school officials and teachers
     identify the signs of troubled youth and provide recommendations on how to intervene
     before violence occurs. It will contain well-established research about the various
     signals troubled youth send before they engage in violent or aggressive behavior. The
     Attorney General and the Secretary will consult with a wide variety of experts on the
     guide, with the National Association of School Psychologists actively involved in the
     process.

     The annual report on school safety is a much broader document than the early warning
     guide. The report will be released at the beginning of every school year for principals,
     parents, and local officials to address their school crime problems. The annual report on
     school safety will include: an analysis of all existing national school crime data and an
     overview of state and local crime reporting; examples of schools and strategies that are
     successfully reducing school violence, drug use, and class disruption; actions that
     parents can take locally to combat school crime, including a local safety checklist; and a
     description of resources available to schools and communities to help create safe,
     disciplined, and drug-free schools.
