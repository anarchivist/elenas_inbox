Mayors prefer fewer strings to more money

                       As the U.S. Conference of Mayors got ready for its
meeting last
                       weekend in New Orleans, USA TODAY's Richard Benedetto
discussed
                    urban issues with five mayors. Their conversation,
below, was edited for
                    length and for clarity.

                       Webb:   'I have never heard a mayor say,   'Don't hold me
accountable. '

                       Richard Benedetto: Mayor Menino, you are concerned
about what is
                       going on in Congress right now with regard to budget
cuts. And you have
                    expressed a desire to have money with fewer strings
attached to it. Talk a
                    little bit about that.

                       Thomas Menino: Well, there are budget caps we have
down in
                       Washington now. I'll just tell you,   if these budget
caps stay in place,
                       Washington will lose $15 million in aid to our cities,
all the way from job
                       training to summer jobs to welfare-work, all those
programs that are so
                       necessary to make a city work.

                       Let's not have a cookie-cutter approach to money
coming into cities.
                    Every city here, five different cities, we are all
different. Let's give us the
                    flexibility in that money that comes to the cities
directly. Why does it have
                    to go to the state? Then when it goes to the state, it
becomes political. You
                    know, Mayor Webb's in good shape with his governor
today, and gets
                    some money. Mayor O'Neill, she's in terrible shape.
She won't get the
                    money. Let's stop the politics.

                       Benedetto: But lawmakers would say that they want to


give a lot of
                              flexibility to the local governments. Do you see it in
action?

                              Menino: I don't see it in action. I don't see any
coming back to us.

                    Michael Guido: But for all the pandering and the
wailing about Congress,
                    probably if you ask most mayors, to a T they'd say,
"Oh, I like my
                    congressman. It's the other congressman that is the
problem. "

                              Benedetto: Mayor Webb, you're the incoming president
of the
                              organization. You're going to have to work a lot with
Washington's White
                              House and Congress. What do you plan to do in terms of
making them
                              more responsive to what you see as the needs of the
city?

                     Wellington Webb: I'm going to try to.redefine the
paradigm that cities are
                     <ellipsis> the 67 urban districts. The cities are the
economic engines of
                     metropolitan areas. We have to talk about helping
working families. We
                     have to talk about helping the people who have been
left behind with
                     policies that have come out of Washington.

                              We have to give mayors and local governments less
strings, hold us
                              accountable. I have never heard a mayor say,   "Don't
hold me
                              accountable." What I've said and what I've heard them
say is   I   "Don I t   say
                              you are going to give it to us and then actually give
us more strings with
                    less resources to do it." In some cases, I would
rather have less money
                    and more flexibility to use what I have.

                              Menino: In the 1980s, when we had record deficits, we
were told we
                    had to take cuts in urban programs. Well, in the
1990s, for the record
                    surpluses, we're told again, "You have to take cuts."
I mean, it doesn't
                    make a lot of sense. The 1980s, I can understand that.
But 1999, we've
                    got surpluses allover the place.

                              Sharon Goldsworthy: I would go back to the tax issue.
Some of us
                              believe that if you leave more money in the pockets of
people, then they
                              will support local needs rather than sending it all to


Washington, but that's
                    philosophical.

                       O'Neill: I think that the perception of mayors needs
to be changed
                       because we are not what we were. We are not what we
were where we
                       were accepting things and saying,   "Thank you." We are
actually working
                    and being very aggressive in trying to revitalize the
cities. And we are right
                    there with the people, I think probably more than we
have ever been.

                       Benedetto: Let me get to a specific problem. The
Littleton, Colo.,
                    shootings really galvanized the attention of the
nation, the concern of the
                    nation. And I am sure that all of you have had to
react in some way or do
                    something in your own communities.

                       Menino: We have had counselors in schools, working
with some of the
                       kids that needed the help. But, we are continually
advocating: Where do
                       the kids get the guns? How does a lS-year-old get a
gun? We know they
                       brought them out of their homes. Why wasn't there some
controls on those
                       guns? Guns should only be for hunters, and if you need
it for personal
                    safety. But the problem you have is they're too
accessible. We took a
                    survey in Boston just recently where 60% of the
youngsters said if they
                    needed a gun, they could get one on the streets. The
police -- there's more
                    visibility. But, you know, there are a lot of copycats
right now.

                     Guido: I think it gets to letting kids know that you
actually care. I spend a
                     lot of time in the school either reading to elementary
school kids or going
                     to talk to the high school kids.

                       Goldsworthy: We all do.

                       Guido: It's a therapy session for a mayor, I think. We
are telling everyone
                       we are out educating, but we were there just to be
loved.

                       But those kinds of programs, just to let kids know
that you want to be
                       engaged with them and that you care, and you're trying
to bring families
                       into the school programs, and making sure parks are in
working order so


                    that they have diversions for their energies, to have
other extracurricular
                    activities for them -- I think that is really
important.

                     Benedetto: Mayor O'Neill?

                     O'Neill: Specifically, we have done a couple of
things. One is that each
                     high school had student groups that worked together at
having discussions
                     on what is going to make them feel safe. And it was
really interesting.
                     Some say, "There are too many people here watching
us," and others say,
                     "There aren't enough." So you just ran the gamut. But
it was a session
                     where they discussed the things that would make them
feel safe, and many
                     things were done as a result of that.

                     The second thing is -- and this had been actually
planned before the
                    Littleton incident happened -- we had a day, a planned
day of listening that
                    was going to be on a cable station. It went for five
hours, which was a little
                    too long -- it probably should have been three -- but
safety was the
                    biggest issue. It was very interesting hearing them
speak and the attitudes
                    they had about safety.

                     I asked them one question. I said, "Is there one
person at the high school
                     that you could go to and feel comfortable with, one
adult?" And they all
                     raised their hand. Now that helps, because they at
least feel that they can
                     relate to somebody.

                    But we are trying very hard to bring the awareness
that it is safe. We have
                    a dog that goes through the schools, and rather than
have them look as
                    though he's checking up on people, they love to see
him come. So that's a
                    nonthreatening way of looking at this. But we did have
a young man that
                    had made threats, and he was taken out of school. And
that calms some
                    fears, that you know we are doing something about it.

                     Benedetto: Mayor Webb?

                    Webb: Some of our schools were the closest,
geographically, to Littleton,
                    to Columbine. Those schools were all let off for a few
days. We .had a
                    series of sessions in other schools. We increased the


police presence to
                      deal with some of the kids. And we did a lot of
talking with kids.

                      It also had an interesting effect on a gun debate that
was going on in the
                      Legislature .. The Legislature was going through a real
debate on guns,
                     repealing local ordinances, preventing cities from
suing gun manufacturers,
                     repealing most of Denver's ordinances that say that
you can't carry assault
                     weapons, you can't have gun shows in the city and many
of these things. I
                     took out a four-page ad in both papers talking to the
people in Denver
                     about what was about to happen to them in the
Legislature and they
                     should call the Legislature, the governor. And they
weren't real happy
                     when I printed their name.

                      And then Columbine happened. And then all the bills
were killed. And I
                    don't think they're going to come back next year,
either, because now the
                    debate is no longer that these issues are only in
urban city problems with
                    minority kids and poor kids. Now the debate is being
raged in areas that
                    are predominantly white areas, upper-income areas, and
suburban areas.
                    And it's really taken the community apart.

                      Benedetto: Why are mayors taking a greater role in
education than they
                      used to?

                      Menino: I think mayors today realize that education is
a key to all
                    successful cities. If you don't have an education
system that works, you
                    don't have a city.

                     It's not just the five hours that a kid spends in
school, it's before school,
                     and it's after school. And mayors can create those
programs. And that's
                     how the mayors want to go get involved, because they
understand that
                     support system. In an urban school system, you know,
you might have 25
                     or 30 different cultures. It's tough for a teacher to
teach all those kids the
                     same. That's why these after-school programs are so
necessary.

                    Webb: I believe very strongly that the two major goal
posts or pillars for a
                    city that mayors have to be involved in is, one,


public safety. The second
                    one is mayors normally get blamed for what goes on
with education,
                    whether they have control of the school board or they
don't have control.

                     But I also believe, regardless of the political
inferences, that what happens
                     to the kids in our schools in our cities has a direct
correlation to the vitality
                     of that city. You cannot have a great city without
having good schools.
                     And I believe that in order to have good schools,
there has to be a
                     relationship between the city and the school board.
People will move out
                     of your city if they do not believe that the quality
of education their children
                     is receiving is adequate.

                     Goldsworthy: I came to politics through PTA, and
that's not an unusual
                     thing to happen for women. I have always, had a
commitment and a
                     passion for public education. As a mayor, I'm not
responsible for our
                     city's schools. We are part of a county school system.
Nevertheless, from
                     City Hall, we support financially and in many other
ways -- we have
                     school-resource officers, which were godsends in the
aftermath of some of
                     the school violence episodes. We desperately need more
money for our
                     public schools in Shelby County; we also have a
Memphis City school
                     system. And in January, several of us came together, a
large committee
                     that I co-chaired , and proposed an initiative to
promote the equivalent of
                     a 7S-cent property-tax increase across the county.

                      Menino: The business community says, "Hey, we have to
educate those
                      kids. If they're not educated, who is going to work on
our banks? Who is
                      going to work in the financial-service industry?"

                      Goldsworthy: You have collaboration between the
business community,
                      the city government and the school system that I think
is unprecedented.
                      And, you know, it's everything from the after-school
programs, youth and
                      athletics, and now increasingly the arts. Kids are
busy. We know that
                      when school lets out for Christmas vacation, vandalism
in the parks goes
                    like that (pointing up). And so we see the
connections. <ellipsis> It's


                    helping the entire community.

                    Guido: I think that education, arts and culture,
public safety; all of those
                    things tie together as the environment that we try to
create as mayors.
