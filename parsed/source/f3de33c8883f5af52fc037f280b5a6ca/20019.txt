TEXT:
Julie, OMB, and I are opposing INS and the State Department actions that
are endangering our efforts to sign up as many children for Medicaid as
possible and to restore food stamps and other benefits to legal
immigrants.   A formerly obscure feature of immigration law requires the
INS or State to bar people from the U.S. who are likely to be a "public
charge." Because of crackdowns by INS/State since welfare reform passed,
word has spread in immigrant communities that signing up yourself or your
children for Medicaid or other benefits puts you at risk with the INS --
and while these fears are exaggerated, they are not crazy.  For example,
legal immigrants with green cards who leave the country for more than 6
months are not permitted to re-enter the country if they are currently on
Medicaid.

The INS wants to' issue guidance that current receipt on SSI, TANF,
Medicaid, or sometimes food stamps automatically makes you a public charge
-- even though you're legitimately eligible for benefits -- preventing you
from adjusting your immigration status or leaving the U.S. for more than 6
months.   (They say this is current policy, but that's quite murky.)  The
advocates are starting to jump on this issue. We have enlisted Rob Weiner
of WH counsel and James Castello at DOJ to help us figure out whether the
law will allow us to rescue just Medicaid or whether we can go even
further to say the INS shouldn't consider receipt of benefits in
determining public charge, but simply look at income, assets, etc.   The
further we go, the more we will enrage Lamar Smith. The INS is fearful of
provoking him, and feels that some of the 'options we're considering fly in
the face of the common sense meaning of the term "public charge." The
State Department appears baffled that we are concerned about this issue
and dug-in to their position.

Just wanted to make sure you're aware and on board.   Chris, Bruce Bullen
of Massachusetts has written you on this issue.
