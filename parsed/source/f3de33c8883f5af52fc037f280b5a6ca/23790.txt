               21st Century Law Enforcement and Public Safety Act Event
                                Questions and Answers
                                    May 12, 1999

100,000 COPS

Q:    Today you announced the funding of 100,000 officers_ How many of these officers
      are actually on the street? And why the discrepancy between how many are on the
      streets as opposed to how many are funded?

A:    Of the 100,000 officers funded, more than 50,000 officers are already on the beat helping
      to fight crime. The rest will join them shortly: recruiting, screening, hiring and training
      new officers takes between 12-18 months, and many officers we've funded are currently
      in the pipeline.


Q:    Isn't it true that some police departments have misused their COPS funds and not
      used them to hire new officers?

A:    Over 11,300 state and local law enforcement agencies across the country receive COPS
      funding. Only about one percent of these jurisdictions have been found to misspend the
      money, and the COPS Office is working with every local agency to resolve outstanding
      issues to make sure that funds are spent properly. Also, it should be noted that use of a
      portion of COPS money for purposes other than hiring new officers -- such as buying new
      technology to allow current officers to get out on the street -- is completely appropriate.


Q:    How do you know that the COPS Program is actually helping to drive down the
      crime rate?

A:    There is no question that the COPS Program is helping to reduce crime and improve
      public safety across the nation. Numerous police chiefs can attest to the positive impact
      the COPS Program has had in helping them fight crime and bring the violent crime rate
      down to its lowest level in a quarter of a century. Crime is down in all categories and in
      every region of the country. And community members, mayors, and other elected
      officials will tell you the same thing: COPS has made a difference.

      And while the COPS Program is certainly not the sole reason for the drop in our nation's
      crime rate, it has been an important part of our overall crime strategy -- along with
      keeping guns off the street and out of the hands of criminals, tougher punishment for
      hardened criminals, and smarter prevention for our young people to avoid crime in the
      first place.


21st Century Crime Bill
                                                                    .     Hex-Dump Conversion ·

Q:    Can you explain how the President's 21st Century Policing Initiative is different
      from the current COPS Program?

A:    The Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) program created in the 1994 Crime
      Act authorized $8.8 billion over six years to help communities hire and redeploy 100,000
      officers to our nation's streets and to promote community policing in other ways. To
      date, COPS has awarded over $5.9 billion in grants to more than 11,300 state and local
      law enforcement agencies -- helping to fund more than 100,000 officers. As these
      numbers suggest, for the most part the current COPS program has focused on hiring new
      officers and redeploying veteran officers to the streets.

      The President's bill builds on the success of the original COPS program, but it also takes
      a giant step forward by giving law enforcement the tools and partners it needs to keep
      crime coming down well into the 21 st Century. First, the 21 st Century Policing Initiative
       will help communities to hire, redeploy, and retain police officers. Second, the
      initiative provides significant new funds to give law enforcement access to the latest
      crime-fighting and crime-solving technologies -- improved police communications, crime
      mapping, laptop computers, crime lab improvements, and more. And third, the initiative
      makes an unprecedented commitment to engage the entire community in the hard work of
      preventing and fighting crime -- by funding new community-based prosecutors, and
      partnerships with probation and parole officers, school officials, and faith-based
      organizations.


International Crime/Bioterrorism


Q:    The provisions you are proposing to crack down on bioterrorism sound pretty
      tough. Will implementing these provisions to control dangerous biological agents
      have a "chilling" effect with respect to ongoing research?

A:    While the bill significantly tightens controls over dangerous biological agents to prevent
      them from getting into the wrong hands, it also preserves the scientific community's
      ability to conduct legitimate research with certain biological agents so that we can
      continue to develop new vaccines and more. The President has made scientific research
      to protect against biological and other public health threats a high Administration priority,
      and we will continue to consult with the scientific community on this matter.


Drugs/Zero Tolerance Drug Supervision

Q.    You've talked about a "zero tolerance" policy for prisoners and drugs before, as
      well as requiring states to drug test and treat offenders. What does the proposal in
      your bill do that is different?
                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion -

A.    The President's crime bill will take us a step further in accomplishing comprehensive
      testing and treatment for offenders in two significant ways. First, the bill authorizes a
      new $100 million initiative for states to carry out their own plans to test and treat
      prisoners and parolees. And second, these funds can be used, for the first time, to begin
      to test and treat the over 3 million adult probationers -- two-thirds of which have serious
      substance abuse problems.


Victims/Elder Crime

Q:    What will the bill do to address nursing home abuse?

A:    The President's bill will provide the Departments of Justice and Health and Human
      Services with new authority to impose civil and criminal penalties on substandard
      nursing home facilities and chains. This includes new criminal sanctions for
      organizations or individuals who knowingly abuse or neglect residents; civil
      penalties that could be imposed on individuals, facility chains, or management
      companies if they harm residents; and new injunctive authority that will allow the
      Federal government to order facility chains and individual nursing homes to put an
      immediate stop to neglectful or abusive behavior.

Q:    Can you cite examples of problems that justify this legislation for nursing homes?

A:    Most nursing homes do an excellent job and provide high quality care to their
      residents. However, recent reports by the General Accounting Office and the HHS
      Office of the Inspector General indicated that almost 2S percent of the nation's
      nursing homes have severe quality infractions that often go unpunished, even
      though the conditions jeopardize the health and safety of residents. For example,
      one nursing home chain was cited for violations in Washington, Maine, Missouri,
      Texas, and California -- and only received a rme. We feel strongly that these new
      actions are necessary to protect the vulnerable elderly who depend on these homes
      for their daily care.


Miscellaneous

Q:    Why aren't there any gun proposals in this bill?

A:    Two weeks ago, the President unveiled his comprehensive gun legislation, the Youth
      Crime Gun Enforcement Act. The President's proposal expands the successful Brady
      Law, extending Brady background checks to all gun show sales, as well as to the
      purchase of explosives. Second, his proposal further restricts youth access to guns
      by raising the age of the current youth handgun ban from 18 to 21 years of age, and
      banning youth possession of all semiautomatic assault rifles and large capacity
                                                                       Automated Records Management System
                                                                               Hex-DiJmp Conve:-siOil

              ammunition clips. And fmally, the President's legislation cracks down on illegal
              gun traffickers by limiting handgun sales to no more than one per month per
              person, helping law enforcement to trace more crime guns to their source, and
              creating new tools to go after gun dealers involved in illegal gun trafficking. So,
              while these provisions are technically separate from the crime bill introduced today, the
              President's gun proposal is an important part of his overall anti-crime strategy -- and we
              expect Congress to act on both of these bills.


         Q:          The Senate is currently considering juvenile crime legislation. Do you have
              a position on the Senate Republican bill?

         A:   The Congress has an historic opportunity to ensure community safety into the 21 sl century
              by continuing and expanding on the successful programs put into place by the 1994
              Crime Act. While we commend the Senate for addressing the important issue of juvenile
              crime, we believe the legislation fails to address a number of other areas critical to
              addressing the overall crime problem. We support a broad-based approach to crime, and
              would support Senate passage of S. 254 if it were to provide a more comprehensive
              strategy to fighting and preventing crime, such as common sense measures to keep guns
              out of the hands of kids and criminals, and resources to improve overall public safety
              through more police and community crime prevention efforts -- to deter and combat both
              adult and juvenile crime.


         Q:   The Senate Democrats held their own crime bill event earlier today. Are your bills
              similar? Do you support their legislation?

         A:   The Senate Democratic crime bill contains many of the same provisions as the President's
              bill, and it certainly emphasizes the same crime-fighting priorities. For example, both
              bills: (1) extend the COPS program; (2) reauthorize a series of successful initiatives from
              the 1994 Crime Act (Violence Against Women, drug courts, prison funds, etc.); (3)
              incorporate key provisions of the President's Anti-gang and Youth Violence Strategy; and
              (4) include measures to boost our international crime control efforts. The most
              important point, however, is that congressional Democrats generally agree with the
              President on the key elements of 21 st Century crime legislation -- and that we will be
              working together to pass these measures into law.
