 TEXT:
 The Council for Agricultural Science and Technology (CAST) will release on
 Oct 29th its latest recommendations on how to improve the food safety
 system.  They will brief Hill staffers from 1:00-2:00 and would like to
 brief the EOP from 3:00-4:00 on the 29th.  I'll send out the embargoed
 press release once I get it later this morning.  Please let me know if you
 would like to attend.  I'll find a meeting room once I know the level of


    interest.   Cliff
