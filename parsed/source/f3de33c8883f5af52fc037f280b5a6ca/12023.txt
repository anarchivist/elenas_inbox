 TEXT:
 To: Team that discussed a departure/driveway/I'm-here- and- working for-
 you statement by POTUS on Monday (If I left anyone out I'm sorry)
       This statement suggest that there might be a way to package signing
 the ag bill , plus restate the $30 million, plus a recommitment to
 importance of farmers and need to move forward on supplemental . Should be
 topped by statement on action in Kosovo.
       I realize it may not be a great or even large bill, but it does
 offer a way to show Presidential action (bill signing) on an issue that
 most people think is a good thing to do ( help farmers)

 Friday, March 26,

 STATEMENT BY VICE PRESIDENT GORE
 ON ADDITIONAL FUNDS FOR AMERICA'S FARMERS

 Last month, President Clinton and I called on Congress to provide
 additional funding for the thousands of productive family farms in America
 that continue to face severe economic pressures. Unfortunately, congress
 did not fully act before leaving for a two-week recess.

 I am pleased however that our Administration is taking action, action that
 will provide additional funds in time for the spring planting season.

 Today, President Clinton instructed Secretary Glickman to provide
 additional resources to help our nation's hurting farmers and ranchers.
 This action will make more than $300 million in loans available to
 America's farming community, the heart of our country.

 Let me be clear, however: this is only a temporary measure and I urge
 Congress upon its return to act on our earlier request and provide more
 lasting relief for our nation's farmers.
