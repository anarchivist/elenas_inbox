     TEXT:
     I attended the Gallup press conference this morning, which was quite well
     covered by the press.  This survey is the first of a $10 million corporate
     commitment to study black/white race relations over the next decade.
     Their survey results present both current findings and trends over time
     since the 1950's.  For our purposes, people were asked (as the Census
     bureau does) to identify which racial category they identified with. As
     such, Hispanics and other groups (which are technically not racial groups)
     were included in the white/black race groups. Only about 6% of the
     respondents (over 3,000) were classified as other and where included in
     the national numbers.   The survey results are very informative; the major
     findings were:

     * persistent gaps in perceptions of blacks and whites,   through with areas
     of substantial change over time.

     * significant decrease over time in white expression of. unfavorable
     attitudes towards blacks and such situations as interracial marriage and
     voting for a black presidential candidate.

     * Whites say they have little prejudice against blacks, that the they
     desire mixed race environments, and don't object to mixed race settings to
     live in and for their children's schools.

     Substantial gaps between blacks and whites remain in the amount of
     prejudice, discrimination and equal opportunity seen in the community
     around them.

     * From the white perspective, there are fewer race problems, less
     discrimination, an abundance of opportunity for blacks, and only minimal
     personal prejudice.  Blacks feel the opposite, even though there
     satisfaction levels have risen over the years.

     * When controlling for income and education, there is much less divergence
     in the attitudes between whites and blacks.

     * Young black males feel discriminated against more than any other groups
     and within the last 30 days, blacks experienced more discrimination
     shopping than other situations, e.g., encountering the police, riding
     public transit, etc.
