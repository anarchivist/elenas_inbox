,.   '..
The purpose of the 5:00 meeting on Thursday is to prepare for the meeting
with LeeR on April 17. At Thursday's meeting we will discuss the topics
that LeeR would like to discuss with us and we will assign
responsibilities to folks to prepare our response to those issues.
Initial intelligence indicates that Wade, et al., will want to discuss
black farmers, reparations for Asians from Latin America that were put in
Internment camps during WW2, and the expected negative budget effect that
the large transportation (ISTEA) bill will have on programs like food
stamps. Maria will provide a more complete report on Thursday.    [Note:
given this proposed list, is there anyone not already invited to this
meeting that should be -- like someone who can talk about the budget or
our position on reparations? Please let me know.]

In addition to responding to their issues, we need to develop a short list
of agenda items that we will want to pursue with them (for example,
assistance with the anti-affirmative action initiative in Washington
state, Bill Lee).  please send me whatever ideas you have for topics that
we should raise with LeeR, assistance we should seek.   I will compile the
list and bring it to our meeting on Thursday· for discussion.

 Thank you.
