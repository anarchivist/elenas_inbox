TEXT:
Tonight is the HUD 2020 forum on race featuring the Vice President and
Assistant Secretary Cuomo, as well as a distinguished panel.  It will take
place at the HUD cafeteria at 6:30 pm.

HUD has called to offer the distinguished members of the race initiative
working group special seating for tonight.  The show starts promptly at


    6:30 pm, because it will be televised live on CSPAN.   Therefore, special
    seating will be reserved only until 6:20 pm.

    Please let me know ASAP if you want a seat reserved.

    (Already sitting in this section are such notable working group members as
    Judy Winston, Minyon Moore and Lynn Cutler.)

    There will be plenty of seating for those who cannot make it at 6:20 pm
    and there is no need to inform me if you plan to go later.

    Thanks.
