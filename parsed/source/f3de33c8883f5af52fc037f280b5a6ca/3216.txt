TEXT:
oops . . . The issue that is being debated by the NAACP is not integration.
It is whether or not busing should be used as a means for integration.

Guess who called me today ... yes that's right Kweisi Mfume. I informed him
that we are working out some internal details and should have a definite
decision on the President's participation sometime today or tomorrow. We
walked through the conference schedule and themes. Thursday is education
day for their conference. Sec. Riley has already confirmed for
Thursday.
I also have some additional details on where the debate on integration
stands within the NAACP.   It appears, based on my conversation with
Kweisi,   to have been blown way out of proportion by the New York Times.
I will update you all in person. Let me know where we stand.     Thanks

FYI:   KWEISI WILL BE THE PRESIDENT'S GUEST TOMORROW AT THE ORIOLES GAME.
