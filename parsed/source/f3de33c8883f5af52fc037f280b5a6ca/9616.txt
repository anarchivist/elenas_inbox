TEXT:
My updates are just updates of   my note yesterday:

1.   The Administration has officially said we will veto the ago approps
bill, passed yesterday,  because the disaster provisions are "totally
inadequate."

2.   Rep. Etheridge's (D-NC) staff is still pushing the idea of lifting
the ban on US government involvement in promoting exports of tobacco
leaf. They say Etheridge is still planning on calling Erskine very soon.
He will likely ask Erskine for the Administration to at least stay
neutral.  They continue to say they are faxing the language they are
asking Glickman to agree to, Dallas has said Glickman wouldn't do it
without WH sign off.
