TEXT:
Elena: I spoke to both Carolyn Huntoon and Jack Gibbons about our
conversation on the wording of the NSTC recommendation to establish an IWG
and the potential overlap with the task force created by the EO.  Their
suggestion, and I agree, is to leave the language in the NSTC report
alone, since it has already gone through interagency clearance and
doesn't exclude the possibility that the EO task force be charged with
addressing the broader set of priorities outlined in the NSTC report.
This can be done at the time of release.  We can provide you with the
necessary language.  I assume this will be a POTUS announcement?   Cliff
