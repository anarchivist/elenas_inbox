TEXT:
Medicare Commission Update. Today, Stuart Altman and Laura Tyson sent a
list of suggested changes to Chairmen Breaux and Thomas on their reform
plan. They have informed us that it is their belief that these changes
are not negotiable but, rather, are what would be minimally acceptable for
them to even consider voting to report out a Commission plan.   Their
recommendations are generally consistent with the principles for reform
that you outlined. For example, they suggest including the surplus or an
analogous proposal, adding an optional prescription drug benefit
accessible and affordable to all beneficiaries, ensuring guaranteed
benefits, and allowing 62 to 64 year olds to buy into Medicare.

However, the list also includes controversial elements such as raising the
age eligibility from 65 to 67 so long as there is a subsidized Medicare
buy-in and adding an income-related premium beginning at $50,000 (which is
twice as high as recommended by the Commission but much lower than most of
the Democratic base would contemplate).  Although consistent with their
past statements, the document reiterates their openness to premium support
that meets the goals that they outline (e.g., adequate government payment,
defined benefits) .

This paper was sent confidentially, but we would be surprised if it
doesnO,t soon become public.  If it does, Senator Daschle, Congressman
Gephardt and others can be expected to be critical on both substantive and
political grounds. They will be particularly upset that your appointees
continue to negotiate with Senator Breaux and Congressman Thomas at a time
when they feel they have disregarded Democratic concerns. Having said
this, it is unlikely that Senator Breaux will be able to obtain Republican
support for all of Stuart and LauraO,s recommendations.  If this is the
case, then the Co~ission will likely report out with 9 or 10 votes, not
the supermajority (11 votes) needed. We will. keep you posted on any news.
