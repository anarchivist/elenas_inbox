TEXT:
You will recall that at our last NGA, etc., meeting we had a long
list of their questions without answers.   John Monahan tells me
that HHS will get us draft answers by cob today; and asks that we
get them our comments by cob tomorrow.   If everyone is comfortable
with the answers, this will give us a handy agenda for Wed. at 1.
So you should expect to get these late today or early tomorrow.
