TEXT:
The House bill has two provisions which seem, in part, aimed at scaring
the higher education community so that they will fight to keep what they
have rather than fighting to get what the Administration has been pushing
in terms of tax cuts for higher education.

The strategy, unfortunately, has worked to a degree, generating grassroots
e-mail traffic like this one.

Treasury is on top of this, and will oppose imposing the new taxes on
graduate students and eliminating the tax-exempt status of TlAA-CREF (the
pension plan used by many colleges and school districts). We don't yet
know how serious Archer is about these provisions, so we have not yet
reached the question of whether any compromises should be considered (the
graduate student provision also affects tuition waivers granted to faculty
and their children, which in some cases may be harder to justify) .
