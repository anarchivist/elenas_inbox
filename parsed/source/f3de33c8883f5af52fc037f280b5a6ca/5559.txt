FYI -- Secretary Herman is meeting with reporters Wednesday at 11:30 as
part of her on-going welfare reform campaign.  I'm getting their entire
press packet -- so far I've seen their Q&As which are surprisingly on
message.

They are also preparing a publication for release in January which I need
to talk to them about.

Bruce/Elena:

Here are my reactions to OMB's passback/appeals. Please let me know your
reaction.  I've shared some of these thoughts w/Deich's folks on a
preliminary basis.

1.   DPC priorities.

Community-Based Prosecutors and Justice. There are currently no funds for
our community prosecutors initiative, so it will have to come from the PPR
(President's Priority Reserve). Originally, DOJ had $25 million for
compatible items in its budget submission (a $3 million community justice
initiative and $22 million for a block-by-block program) that, I believe,
can be rolled into what we're trying to do with the Community
Prosecutors. However, it looks as if DOJ has given up on these items
or tucked them elsewhere in the budget.  If so, this is all new money that
we need to find.

Juvenile Justice. The budget retains the funds we proposed last year and
adds $30 million for Indian country -- that means $100 million for·
prosecutors, $60 million for courts (includes $10 million increase for
Indians), and $95 million for at-risk youth (includes $20 million increase
for Indians). Even though Congress appropriated $250 million for a
juvenile justice block grant ($110 reserved for prosecutors and courts), I
think -- with one exception -- that we should reiterate what we had in
last year's budget until a juvie bill passes. Here's my controversial one
exception: we should drop the $95 million for an at-risk youth initiative
and consider using that money for prosecutors.

Here's my reasoning: (1) we have not and are not likely to get this money
in the CJS bill. The CJS appropriators and Judiciary Committee continue
to resist our efforts to use any significant number of crime/juvie funds
for such broad-based/undefined prevention; (2) Rahm continues to make the
case to the Hill leadership that our prevention message needs to be
school-focused, yet this initiative is anything but school-focused. And
(3) DOJ's budget is also not where the real money or battle is at anyway.
Safe and Drug-Free Schools already has the district-by-district support
Rahm craves and involves serious money (nearly $600 million) that is at
risk in the budget process. More importantly, we DPC are getting ready to
launch a $200 million per year after school program that should be the
focus of our message and legis·lative efforts.
"


    Indian Law Enforcement. DOJ remains opposed to OMB's proposal and, with
    the exception of OMB's $40 million earmark in prisons and $30 million
    earmark in proposed juvie funds, is appealing for some $102 million out of
    the PPR for Indian Law Enforcement. This includes: $4.657 million for 50
    investigative positions (30 agents) at FBI; $3.352 million for FBI
    victims/witness coordinators and support staff; $3.466 million for 35
    positions in USAs offices (26 AUSAs); 12 new grant administrators to
    manage the proposed prison/juvie earmarks (my personal favorite, in light
    of Ron Klain's e-mail ~arlier today); and $90.405 million for BIA law
    enforcement (part of the Interior, not DOJ, budget allocation).
    Personally, I think its ridiculous that DOJ -- for such a "high crime
    priority" -- can't find even part of mere $11 million in their FBI or USA
    budget, or cover the costs of administering earmarks that essentially
    already exists!  I leave to the Interior folks whether or not BIA's $90
    million should come out of their base or the PPR.

    Hate Crimes. While I don't have a # for what it will take in terms of FBI
    and USA resources to implement the Hate Crimes enforcement initiative, DOJ
    is asking for these funds to come out of .the PPR. And as with the Indian
    Directive, we should support DOJ finding at least some of these resources
    in house.

    2.   Other Crime Issues

    Byrne Grants. The current OMB passback includes two hits to the Byrne
    program that I believe are sure to lose on the Hill and get us maximum
    grief from the Govs:  (1) a $100 million earmark in Byrne ($553 million
    overall in formula funds to states) for non criminal justice drug
    treatment. This is not one of Byrne's authorized purposes, and would seen
    as taking funds from drug enforcement and putting them into treatment -- a
    "false choice" we have tried to avoid. And (2) a $25 million earmark for
    Indian Country law enforcement.

    VAWA. VAWA funds for FY 1999 are currently just below last year's
    appropriation. Given our record on this issue -- and strong Hill support
    -- we should at least fund VAWA at least year's level. This is only about
    another $21 million.

    Drug Testing/Treatment and Courts. OMB and I had discussed consolidating
    some of the drug testing/treatment dollars, so that the President had a
    larger initiative to point to ($200 million, instead of 4-5 different
    programs). Justice is opposed and thinks this will reduce overall funding
       OMB and I have backed off.

    Safe Start Initiative. DOJ is asking for $10 million from the PPR to
    launch a Safe Start initiative for kids exposed to violence. Frankly,
    unless this is something we or FLOTUS are committed to, I am not inclined
    to push for it. First, DOJ has discretionary funds to do this (s6 it
    shouldn't get bumped up), and HUD has been authorized since '92 to pursue
    a similar initiative in public housing (about $4 million). Second, DOJ
    originally proposed a $100 million per year initiative -- and none of the
    numerous and "supportive" agencies have kicked any dollars into the
    kitty. To me, this initiative looks a lot like "Pulling America's
    Communities Together (PACT)," "DAWN" (Denver, Atlanta, Washington,
    Nebraska), "Model Intensive Grants" and "At.-risk Youth," and DPC shouldn't
    adopt another multi-disciplinary prevention initiative unless we're really
    committed to it (Besides aren't we getting ready to adopt the AG's
    communities project and link it to our after school effort?)   Third, DPC
    already is proposing a $200 to $400 million per year initiative for early
    learning, and increasing funds for Early Head Start (0 to 3).   I know


these initiatives aren't the same, but they've got to be better
vehicles/opportunities than DOJ's budget.

Local Law Enforcement Block Grant (LLEBG).   DOJ has asked that the
President fund this $523 million law enforcement block grant for cities
from the PPR.  It's strongly supported by the Hill R's, Mayors and police,
and is considered by some as part of the deal that preserves COPS funding
at the 100,000 level -- or 1.4+ billion per year.   Though we have not
supported the LLEBG, it has been faithfully included in the CJS approps
and DOJ is now pushing to have it included in our budget.   I've suggested
to OMB that, if we are really going to consider funding it, we should give
the President some options on how to better target the LLEBG.   For
instance, when the Mayors were here last spring for the Drug Summit, one
of their primary beefs was access to direct funds to fight the drug war
locally. Maybe we should consider embracing the LLEBG, but.asking Mayors
to dedicate it to a balanced local drug strategy. Maybe we should look to
use these funds for COPS-related' initiatives -- technology, retention and
other things that they're probably using it for now anyway.

Race. The COPS budget include $1 million for police recruitment. Also,
the Civil Rights budget includes a $2 million increase for police
brutality and misconduct, and the NIJ budget includes $500,000 for a
police use of force study.  I asked for the recruitment funds; I take the
police brutality and use of force funds to be a DOJ request.

Youth Crime Gun Interdiction (gun tracing, or YOGI, as I call it). I'm
going to double check the #s on this tomorrow, but I do know that Treasury
is appealing for some additional funds for this initiative (maybe $4
million more).  We -- including Rahm -- should be supportive.   We
promised to support Treasury's efforts to fund more ATF agents to work on
this and to crack down on illegal gun traffickers.

3.   Drug Budget

I asked to see the drug cross-cut, but was unable to get my hands on it.
I hope to get it tomorrow and pass along some further comments.    Several
issues have already surfaced. These include: (1) cutting Safe and
Drug-Free Schools in half and sending the money to HHS (ouch! Nuff said);
 (2) cuts to Custom's personnel budget (this speaks to border drug
enforcement issues and is likely to be criticized by some on the Hill);
 (3) McCaffrey's push for another $100 million in interdiction funds at DOD
 (I'm uncertain as to whether or not this is close to being resolved); and
cuts to Byrne (mentioned above) .

Forgive the length of this e-mail, but I hope this info is useful.

Jose'
