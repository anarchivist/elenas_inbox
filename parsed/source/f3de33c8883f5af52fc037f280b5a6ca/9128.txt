                                 THE PRESIDENT'S REpORT ON RACE
                           CHAPTER ON ADMINISTRATION ACCOMPLISHMENTS

     Goals
     1. Convey Administration's key principles (e.g. opportunity, responsibility, community, etc.)
        and describe successes, occasional missteps, and hard choices in carrying them out.
     2. Use this chapter to tell a compelling story rather than provide a comprehensive list of every
        accomplishment. Resist making every Administration accomplishment a race
        accomplishment.
     3. Act as a bridge between chapters on our past history and our future direction. Organizing
        themes need to be consistent with chapters which precede and follow.
     4. Be honest rather than excessively celebratory.
     5. Show the right level of detail without being boring.

     Organization of Chapter
     This chapter would be organized chronologically by looking at the key themes of the Clinton
     Administration beginning with the campaign and following each year in office. For each year or
     logical period oftime, we would describe the values that were at the core of the policy-making
     decisions, such as opportunity, responsibility, and community. We would also examine the key
     struggles and hard choices made, especially those which have an impact on race issues. Finally,
     we will describe the outcomes ofthe policy decisions and how they affect race issues. Resource
     documents will include State ofthe Union addresses and supporting documents, speeches,
     DPCINEC accomplishments documents, and personal interviews with staff.

     Personal Stories
     In addition to the historical narrative, this chapter could contain some short anecdotes, set offin
     separate boxes, of people or organizations whose lives were transformed by Clinton
     Administration policies and initiatives. For example, one story might describe a revitalized
     urban community which was turned around by a series of policies such as Empowerment Zones
     and increased lending to minority businesses. Another story might describe a high school with a
     large Latino population which has benefited by increased Title I funding, bilingual education
     programs, after school initiatives, and school to work programs. A third story might describe a
     middle class family's search for housing and the increasing opportunities for home ownership
     made available by Administration policies. A fourth story might describe a mother's chance to
     get off welfare, obtain job training, and start a new job.

     Content Issues
     1. Bipartisanship. This should not be simply a self-congratulatory document. Rather it should
        include a discussion of difficult issues and of successes and failures. It is important to
        appeal to a bipartisan audience so all of America is interested in the issue or at least in the
        document. We might consider a report on the nation's accomplishments rather than solely

                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion




        the President's accomplishments.
     2. Role ofgovernment. The chapter should discuss the role of government in addressing races
        Issues
     3. Macro policies. We will need to decide whether to include macro policies such as the
        impact of economic growth on race issues.
     4. Race-neutral policies. Should we include policies which are intended to be race neutral but
        which have a disproportionate impact on minorities, whether negative or positive, in areas
        where disparities exist? Policies of this type would include: the EITC, minimum wage
        increases, increased funding for Head Start.
     5. Race-targeted policies. It seems obvious that we would include policies that are
        specifically- designed to assist minority groups. This might include policies such as the
        Hispanic Education Initiative, loans to minority businesses, eliminating ethnic health
        disparities, etc.
