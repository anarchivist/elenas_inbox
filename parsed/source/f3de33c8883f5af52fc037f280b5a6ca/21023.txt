TEXT:
Elena--somehow this seemed like more progress at the end of our meeting
than it does in the retelling below.  Inasmuch as we don't yet have either
an assurance of Riley's comfort with this approach (though I suspect he
will be just fine with it) or, more importantly of Rudy Crew's, I tried
not to oversell what we accomplished.  And I didn't think it wise to spell
out in detail that the main part of our accomplishment was agreeing to
save ourselves from carrying various possible interpretations of Title IX a
nd the Constitution to absurd conclusions.

Young WomenD,s Leadership Academy in NYC: The Education Department has
been working for the past six months with the NYC schools to develop a
rationale and evidence to support the continued operation of the Young
WomenD,s Leadership Academy.  DPC, WH Counsel, and the Education and
Justice Departments initially believed that the most promising approach,
consistent with prevailing interpretations of Title IX and the Equal
Protection clause, would be to find evidence supporting a D&remedialD8
rationale for the school. However, the Department has concluded that the
necessary evidence to support this approach does not exist for this school.
  Nonetheless, DPC, WH Counsel, Education and Justice Department staff all
agree that our policy goal is to allow continued experimentation with
single sex schools, and that no enforcement or other steps should be taken
to close the school, force it to admit boys, or force NYC to open a boys
school.  Instead, our goal now is to work cooperatively with the NYC
schools to provide evidence that both boys and girls in coed schools are
afforded learning opportunities comparable to those in the all girls
school, while at the same time continuing to evaluate the effectiveness of
the Leadership Academy.
