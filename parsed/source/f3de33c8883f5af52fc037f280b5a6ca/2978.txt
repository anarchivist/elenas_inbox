TEXT:
Further evidence of the decline in quality control that occurs in your
absence, which argues strongly for keeping you in charge of the weekly.
The answers as best I know them:

1. yes,    your description of the 30 vs 25 is correct, although the 25 in
current    law is somewhat ambiguous since the statute doesn't track with the
intent,    and having explained it one way to the President, I didn't want to
have to    explain it the other way.

2. privatization amdts were added Thursday in House Ag (for food stamps)
and Commerce (for Medicaid) .

3. the ban after 12 years is on nicotine, not cigarettes -- although the
way it will be described in laymen terms is no ban on cigarettes.   I am a
professional layman.   The deal is permanent, but $300-350 billion is the
estimate for 25 years.   (I asked Matt Myers about the idea of sunsetting
the agreement, as we discussed with Kessler.   He said the industry had
initially proposed such an idea, but he rejected it because he didn't want
to give up the gains in the agreement.)
