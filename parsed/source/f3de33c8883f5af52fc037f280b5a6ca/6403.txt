TEXT:
Attached is the first draft of the H1-B memo to the POTUS.
Please let me know if you have any comments -- and whether
anyone else needs to look at it.  I tried to keep it short and sweet
and not elaborate the "pro-con" on raising the cap -- since we
are not asking for a decision.

I am currently scheduled to meet with ITAA to discuss follow-up
on the Berkeley conference on Wednesday at 3:15 p.m.
I scheduled this meeting well before the H1-B flap.

I planned to use this meeting to discuss the next steps on the
issues raised by the conference (training incumbent workers,
closer partnerships between industry and higher ed, science and math
K-12, women and minorities in the IT industry, etc.) and not on the
H1-B issue.    I will go ahead with this meeting as planned unless
anyone thinks it is a bad idea -- people are welcome to join
if interested.==================== ATTACHMENT     1 ====================

MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:          GENE SPERLING, BRUCE REED

RE:            ADMINISTRATION POLICY ON SKILLED TEMPORARY FOREIGN
               WORKERS

We are providing you with this informational memo on the "HI-B visa" issue because the New
York Times recently ran a story on the basis of a leaked internal Administration options memo,
and because this is an important topic to Silicon Valley companies. You will be interacting with
high-tech CEOs during your California trip later this week, and may get asked about this. A
suggested Q&A is attached.

Current U.S. law permits 65,000 HI-B visas each year for skilled temporary foreign workers.
The computer and health care industries are the primary users of the HI-B program. The annual
65,000 visa cap was met for the first time in FY 1997, and is likely to become a legislative issue
in this session of Congress. We expect to reach the limit again in Mya or June, several months
before the end of the current fiscal year.

The information technology (IT) industry, along with Senator Abraham, Representative Zoe
Lofgren, and other members of Congress, support either the removal of or a significant increase
in the HI-B cap. Unions, other worker organizations, Senator Kennedy, Congressman Dingell,
and other members of Congress are likely to oppose any increase.

A DPCINEC working group with representatives from Labor, Commerce, State, and INS has
started to meet to develop Administration policy on:

I.      Steps we can take to work with industry and institutions of higher education to address
        the shortage of workers with IT skills;

2.      Reforms of the HI-B program (e.g. a prohibition against laying off U.S. workers to
        replace them with foreign workers); and

3.      Whether or not to increase the H I-B cap from its current level of 65,000.
skills of American workers, and not on proposing an increase in the cap at this point. As part of
an overall package -- industry commitments to upgrade worker skills and reform of the HI-B
visa system -- the interagency group is willing to consider an increase in the H 1-B cap if it is
truly necessary. However, we do not think that it makes any tactical sense to start with this as
our publicly stated position. Furthermore, even a 20,000 to 35,000 increase in the H-IB cap is
not likely to solve the problem, given the projected growth in demand for workers with IT skills.

Our next step is to meet with high-tech industry executives to develop an "action plan" that
builds on a series of announcements that the Departments of Commerce, Education and Labor
made at a January 1998 conference in Berkeley, California.

Q. Mr. President, will your Administration grant more visas to high-skilled foreign
workers who are in demand by high-tech industries?

We h~ve made no decision on this issue. In reviewing our options, my Administration's first
priority will be to ensure that American workers have the skills they need to fill these jobs, and
that they have priority over any foreign workers with similar training. The growing demand for
workers with high-tech skills shows how critical my agenda for life-long learning is -- HOPE
scholarships to open the doors of college, tax credits for employer investment in life-long
learning, and making sure that all of our children are technologically literate.
