TEXT:
I have a team of PIR staff helping me with the book, and Michele Cavataio

has agreed to be the "project manager" for this little part of the

exercise. But DPC, NEC and OMB are, obviously, the real contributors here.

What I envision is that Michele will help me make sure that the help w need

from those offices doesn't fall through the cracks in the press of ordinary

business. I'm looking to you, however, as the senior person to be most

involved in ensuring that the White House story is developed. Make sense?



If so, then the question is, with whom in your shop should Michele work as

a point of contact? (And will you instruct that person accordingly,    if it

isn't you.) Can you also please identify an appropriate person at NEC?

But I'd really rather just work with you on this.



AS a first step, Michele is going to (a) put together a couple of options

for how the accomplishments chapter might be structured, and (b) build a

file of existing Administration Accomplishments documents. When she's

completed the options (in a couple of days), perhaps the three of us should

have a conference call to discuss the right structure, and then strageize

about a production process?




Also -- how would you feel about involving my dear friend Josh? He has lots

of horses at his disposal, and might be feeling an bit underutilized.
