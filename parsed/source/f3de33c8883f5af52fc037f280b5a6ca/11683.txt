TEXT:
As you recall, HHS insisted on adding to the summary of the NAS response
that the Council evaluation of structural models will keep in mind "that
the primary goal is food safety and public health not expanded bureaucracy.


I've told O'hara that this was unacceptable, yesterday he said he would
take it up with the Secretary. This morning he said the COS said that
HHS's position was that this reflects their position, the Secretary has
used this language and should not "retreat."

There is some chance that if one of you calls them, they may relent.
Their argument is weak.  This Response document is promising an objective
review of alternatives, it is not the proper venue for HHS to indicate the
matter has been pre-judged. We included language in the text of the
Response that indicates factors mitigating against a single food agency.
HHS will have plenty of opportunity to appropriately weigh in against a
single food agency when we evaluate options in the strategic plan.

As I mentioned, Reuters has already run a small item indicating that we
are not endorsing a single food agency in the Response. We want to
emphasize that this is a positive next step in the process of making sure
the food safety system is unified and speaks with a single voice.
Caroline Smith Dewall, the chief advocate of a single food agency, has
agreed to put out a release saying the Response is a positive step.
