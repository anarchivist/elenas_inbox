                         Livable and Clean Communities Bonds
                                                                          draft 12/18/98

        This proposal recommends the creation of a new financing mechanism -- Livable
and Clean Communities Bonds (LCCBs) -- to raise funds to finance environment-related
public projects. Modeled on the school construction proposal, this bond initiative would
provide new resources to local and state governments seeking to preserve open space,
cleanup and redevelop brownfield sites, and restore community parks and important
historic civic spaces. Like qualified zone academy bonds, this program would allow state
and local governments to issue zero interest bonds to lenders who could claim a tax credit
for the life of the bond in lieu of interest. The issue makes no principal or interest payments
on the bond until maturity (13 years). The overall program would be capped at xx million
annually over five years. [Note: requiring the issuer to pay some amount of interest would
increase the amount of bonds that could be issued for the stated revenue cost; the maturity
could be extended to 15 or 20 years to stretch out the time the issuer has to raise funds to
payoff the bonds).

        Sprawl and efforts to manage it -- loosely termed smart-growth -- are quickly
emerging as a national issue. Over 75 percent of the 224 "livable communities" ballot
measures voted on in the 1998 elections were passed. Many of these initiatives, such as the
"Clean Michigan Bond Proposal", included funding for bonds to promote more livable
communities and protect open space. This continued the trend of support for such bonds that
has increased dramatically through the 1990s.

       The availability of LCCBs would encourage actions that recognize the relationship
between land conservation and clean water, and development. (As an aside, note that 70 of
the Nation's 75 largest cities were founded on a significant body of water.) LCCBs would
be available to finance projects that create environmental amenities in urban, suburban,
and rural areas that would encourage long-term economic investment (providing the
long-term benefit of job creation), enhance the quality of the local environment, and
provide an attractive and functional setting for urban revitalization.

       The allocation of the limited amount of LCBS issuance authority would be made
through an open competition, with State and local governments submitting plans for use of
the bond proceeds to an inter-agency evaluation panel, chaired by EPA in consultation
with the Departments of the Interior, Housing and Urban Development, Agriculture, and
Treasury. The pool of available bond issuance authority would be divided in half, with
one part reserved for a competition among the Nation's 100 largest cities and the other part
reserved for a competition among the fifty States (the States, of course, could then use the
bond proceeds to support projects sponsored by local governments). This division would
ensure that large cities, particularly those with many environmentally impaired
neighborhoods, will receive appropriate attention and treatment in the allocation process.
The annual competition among cities would ensure that the bonds went to support plans
that best met the goals of promoting livable and clean communities while promoting job
creation and business development. Additional preference would be given to those cities
                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion

whose applications included the participation and involvement of several adjacent
communities. EPA would monitor compliance with the plans.
       The portion of bond authority competitively awarded to the States would be
administered by State environmental agencies and distributed among local communities
according to the submitted plans that indicated how the bond issuance would support
environmental improvement projects. Like the competition among cities, the plans selected
would be those best meeting the goals of promoting livable and clean communities while
promoting job creation and business development. Additional preference would be given
to those states whose applications focused on sustainability and metropolitan planning and
coordination. Again, EPA would monitor compliance with the plans.

        The green bonds proposal would encompass both public, governmental activities and
private activities that promise substantial public benefits. The virtue of a mechanism that
encompasses activities from both the private and public sectors is largely one of efficiency and
efficacy. For example, the cost to a developer of adding an environmental amenity with
significant public benefits (e.g., extra pollution control features) may be far less than if a
government entity had to implement the same measure independently at a subsequent time.
Similarly, the total environmental benefits from a concerted strategy featuring actions by private
companies and local governments could easily be far greater than the benefits if each took
independent action.

        To allow greater flexibility to localities in electing between private or public approaches
to the same "green infrastructure", public entities would be permitted to use the new bonding
authority to capitalize revolving funds that in tum could be used by private entities meeting the
qualified use definitions. This would help ease the understandably daunting enforcement burden
identified by the Internal Revenue Service. In addition, projects would be certified as being in
compliance with the plan and other legal requirements by the State environmental agency.

        A requirement for green bond issuance would be that 95 percent of the proceeds from sale
of the bonds must be used for the purposes outlined in this proposal and in accordance with the
plans submitted by the qualified applicants within 3 years of issuance of the bonds.
Administrative expenses would not be considered in meeting this 95 percent test.

       Under the proposal, a menu of projects would be eligible for assistance. Projects
available for assistance would include:

· Open Space (Including Farmlands and Wetlands) -- Governmental acquisition or conservation
of open space, including parks, important historic civic spaces, and wetlands. Governmental
acquisition or the facilitation by private, non-profit enterprises of qualified easements to preserve
these open spaces would be included as an eligible activity. Over the life of the bonds, the
property must remain an open space -- no change in use would be permitted;

· Water Pollution -- Eligible activities would include the following: (1) Government-initiated
passive infrastructure to control polluted runoff, such as settling ponds, and greenways
(specifically, this would not include capital-intensive treatment plants funded under other
                                                                       Hex.-Dump Conversion

mechanisms); (2) Enhancements to private development projects that add significant pollution
runoff control features (again, this would not include capital-intensive treatment plants funded
under other mechanisms); (3) Public resources used to finance water pollution reductions from
sources not captured by regulation (e.g. small businesses and farmers);

· Brownfield Redevelopment. This includes governmental assessment, cleanup, and
redevelopment of brownfield sites for community supported parks, playgrounds, open spaces, or
for the redevelopment for industrial or commercial enterprises that would reduce sprawl in
outlying communities.

Cost: the revenue cost would be limited to $700 million over 5 years by setting the annual
cap appropriately. This program would permit the issuance of $XXX million of green bonds
each year for five years. The present value of the thirteen years worth of tax credits generated
issued in each of the five years would be $XXX million, based on a discount rate of AFR + 2
percent.
