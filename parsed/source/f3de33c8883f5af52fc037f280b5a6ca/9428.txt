TEXT:
Harkin's staff has confirmed our understanding of the Riley/Harkin
conversation.  Next steps are proceeding along two tracks.

1. We learned from Kennedy's staff the there is now an effort to
preconference this bill. They expect to see the House offer this
afternoon; if it is close to the Senate bill, Kennedy will join the effort
and work to get a preconferenced version done ASAP.  We suspect the House
will indeed come close to the Senate version, but don't know for sure.

2. At the same time, Coats is prepared to go to Lott and try to get the
bill up for a vote this week.  If it "looks like a preconference agreement
is possible, he will wait until that is done; if not, he's likely to try
to push for a vote sooner rather than later and then deal with conference
afterwards.

I'll keep you posted on developments as they occur
