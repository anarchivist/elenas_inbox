1. This language is politically more conservative than I thought the
Hispanic caucus would agree with.   I am only raising a red flag.  I am
not proposing we loosen the "3 year" rule, unless Janet, Mickey, or Maria
think that we will generate substantial criticism. It seems to me that we
might have led folks to believe this is a position we were not going to
take.  Is that wrong?

2.  If we keep the "3 year rule," I advise a broad outreach plan to the
Hispanic caucus, especially Xavier, Boxer, Feinstein, and the advocates,
before we make the rule public. The last thing we want to do is surprise
folks with a position we basically denied having in earlier discussions.

3. Can we add the "English plus" principle: bilingual for Latinos and
for Caucasions is important for the 21st Century.
