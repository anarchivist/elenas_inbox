TALKING POINTS BY VICE PRESIDENT AL GORE
TOBACCO EVENT WITH CHILDREN
VICE PRESIDENTD,S CEREMONIAL OFFICE
Thursday, September 18, 1997

 ID,m pleased to be joined by Dr. Kessler, Dr. Koop, and Matt Myers,
Executive Vice President of the National Center for Tobacco-Free Kids
as well as so many parents, teachers, and children who are leading the
charge against underage smoking.

 Yesterday, the President outlined a series of tough measures to improve
the tobacco settlement that was reached last June -- to take dramatic
steps to reduce underage smoking, and protect the public health.

 The President asked me to lead the charge in rallying both public and
Congressional support for the President plan.

 This is day one -- and weD,re here because we need to kick-off a
nationwide, grassroots effort to support the PresidentD,s plan.

 The President and I will be inviting key members of Congress to the White
House this October ____ , to begin serious, high-level, bipartisan talks
about the legislation that is needed. WeD,re eager to get to work, and
pass tough legislation to protect our children from nicotine addiction and
disease.

   In the coming weeks, 10,11 also be meeting with representatives of
. industry, the state attorneys-general, and the many health and childrenD,s
  organizations that have a stake in this crusade.

 But we also have to get a message across to AmericaD,s families: weD,ve
all got to rally behind the PresidentD,s plan, and do more to prevent our
children from smoking as well. The fact is, smoking rates among children
are going up -- and weD,ve got to reverse that dangerous trend.

 Now weD,re going to talk to some of the children, parents, and health
advocates who have joined in the fight against smoking -- to see what they
can tell us about why children smoke, and what we can do to make
cigarettes less appealing to young people ...
