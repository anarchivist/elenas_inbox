RE:            LA W ENFORCEMENT IN INDIAN COUNTRY


The current conditions for public safety and law enforcement are dire in Indian Country.
Whereas violent crime has been on the decline nationwide, it has increased on Indian lands. On
many American Indian reservations, public safety is even less secure than the most
crime-plagued inner-cities. Since the federal government has primary responsibility for law
enforcement on Indian Country, this Administration has an opportunity to make a meaningful
difference to improve public safety on Indian lands.

The attached Executive Memorandum directs the Attorney General and Secretary of the Interior
to analyze the law enforcement problem and develop a comprehensive proposal for improving
public safety and criminal justice in Indian Country. The proposal would be submitted to you by
November 14, 1997. The memorandum was proposed by and has the strong support of both the
Attorney General and the Secretary of the Interior.

[The Executive Memorandum must be issued immediately so a request to the House
Appropriations Committee to reprogram funds to pay for the interagency group-- which will
develop the proposal to respond to the directive -- may be sent this week.]


BACKGROUND

Since 1992, violent crime has dropped nationwide by approximately 17 percent and the homicide
rate fell by 22 percent. During the same time period in Indian Country, violent crime increased,
and the homicide rate grew by over 80 percent. This has had a devastating impact on many of
the 1.2 million American Indian citizens who live on lands governed by federally-recognized
tribes. Nearly all of these lands are under the jurisdiction of the federal government.

The federal government has the singular responsibility to remedy this escalating crime problem.
Federal law enforcement is the only protection for the victims of violent crimes in most areas of
Indian Country and the United States generally has exclusive jurisdiction over major crimes
committed on Indian lands. Moreover, federal law enforcement jurisdiction in Indian Country
has been growing: the 1994 Crime Act's expanded list of drug, gun, and domestic violence
provisions all apply to Indian Country.

As violent crime and federal jurisdiction over crime have increased in Indian Country, federal
resources have been shrinking. This has severely compromised public safety and the safety of
law enforcement officers; diminished the number of investigators so that many violent crimes in

                                                                   Automated Records Management System
                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion
are neither safe nor secure.

The Bureau ofIndian Affairs (BIA) at the Department ofInterior has primary responsibility for
enforcement and detention. But since 1992, the total BIA law enforcement budget declined by
5.1 percent to $74.6 million. This decline stands in contrast to increased funding for all other
federal law enforcement agencies.

Possible solutions include consolidation of criminal investigative services of the BIA and FBI
into a new service created by the Justice Department, or simply transferring BIA's major law
enforcement programs to Justice.

While no consensus has yet been formed on how to improve the existing situation, there is
universal recognition that the current structure needs to be fixed and that the federal government
has the responsibility to act.

RECOMMENDATION

We recommend that you sign the attached Presidential directive to the Attorney General and
Secretary of the Interior to analyze the criminal justice problem in Indian Country and develop a
comprehensive plan for ensuring improved criminal justice and law enforcement in Indian
Country. Consistent with the Presidential Memorandum you signed in September 1994 on
govemment-to-government relations with tribes, the memorandum explicitly states that tribal
leaders would be included in the development of solutions to this problem.

The Attorney General and Interior Secretary will respond by appointing a IS-member Executive
Committee for Indian Country Law Enforcement Improvement. The Committee will be
comprised of representatives from pertinent federal agencies, tribal leaders, and experts. The
Committee can engage in a dialogue with the appropriate parties and develop a consensus
solution on the best way to address criminal justice problems in Indian Country.
