TEXT:
Is the Administration signaling its support for tax credit approaches to
making health insurance more affordable?

A:  The President has always expressed a willingness to consider any
proposal that has the potential to increase coverage for the over 40
million Americans who have no insurance. Having said this, any proposal
needs to be evaluated on the basis of its effectiveness, affordability,
administratability, and overall impact on existing sources of coverage.
Most independent studies of tax incentive proposals suggest it is
difficult to use the tax code to efficiently and cost effectively target
the large subsidy needed to ensure significant expansions in coverage.   In
addition, such approaches would need to be accompanied by necessary
insurance reforms to the unstable and costly individual market to ensure
that Americans obtaining a credit have access to affordable
insurance.
