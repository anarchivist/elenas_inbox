TEXT:
The Senate just adopted the Gorton amendment on lawyers fees,   49-48, with
two Senators voting "present."

Under the amendment, attorneys fees would not exceed:

 $4000 per hour for actions filed before 12/31/94


$2000 per hour for actions filed between 12/31/94 and 4/1/97
$1000 per hour for actions filed between 4/1/97 and 6/15/98
$500 for actions filed after 6/15/98

The amendment sets the maximum fee per hour; the actual amount could be
less, and would be set by the courts based on a set of a dozen criteria
including novelty of legal issues, results obtained, expenses incurred,
etc.

Our position on Gorton was the same as our position on all attorneys fees
amendments:

Q.      What is your position on the Gorton amendment on attorneys fees?

A.      The PresidentD,s overriding priority is ensuring that tobacco
legislation promotes the public health.  He does not view the issue of
legal fees as central to this effort, and he has not made a specific
proposal on how the legislation should handle legal fees.  In general, he
believes that the lawyers who brought the tobacco suits should be fairly
compensated, but that they should not be paid out of proportion to the
work they actually did and the risks they actually undertook.
