TEXT:
Revised per your instructions.  Note that I made one additional change--it
now says the measure "has not yet qualified for the ballot", rather than
"has not yet even been introduced," which originated with the press
office.  I made this change because the initiative has been filed with the
California AG and the signature drive got underway this month.  It is
still reasonable for us to say that questions about our plans are
premature.

I have forwarded this on to the press office.==================== ATTACHMENT     1

Background

        In June, Californians may face a new ballot initiative to abolish bilingual instruction
for public school children in the state, requiring that most instruction be conducted only in
English. The idea has support from many conservatives and some in the Latino
community, as well as other minority groups, who are frustrated with what they see as an
ineffective approach to learning English. However, the ballot initiative is vehemently
opposed by many other Latinos, who strongly support bilingual instruction and see the
initiative as an attack cut from the same cloth as Propositions 187 and 209.

       The Administration has strongly supported the federal bilingual education
program, which funds local programs designed to provide help to kids so they can become
proficient in English. The program permits a variety of different approaches to helping
students master English, including both bilingual and English immersion instruction. To
help ensure that resources are available to help children learn English well, we proposed a
27% increase in bilingual education, and succeeded in including it as one of the areas
protected in the balanced budget agreement.

Q's and A's

Does the Administration support bilingual education?

        The Administration strongly supports the federal bilingual education program,
which funds local programs designed to help kids become proficient in English. The
program permits a variety of different approaches to helping students master English,
including both bilingual and English immersion instruction. To help ensure that
resources are available to assist children to learn English well, we proposed a 27% increase
in the program, and worked successfully to include bilingual education as one of the
protected areas in the balanced budget agreement.

Does the Administration plan to intervene in California or campaign on behalf of bilingual
education?

        The measure has not yet qualified for the ballot so this question is premature. We
will be getting more information on the initiative as events develop. However, the
Administration supports the approach of the federal program, which permits a variety of
different strategies for English language instruction, and thinks that a range of options for
meeting the needs of children should continue to be available to local communities.
