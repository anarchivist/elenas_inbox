                          PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
                         RADIO ADDRESS ON FAMILY LEAVE
                              Saturday, February 1, 1997

        As a parent, I know how important it is to take responsibility for our children when
they need us most -- when they are sick, when they need to go to the doctor, or when there
is a parent-teacher conference at school. Fortunately, Hillary and I have never had to
risk our jobs to be there for our daughter. We have never had to make the choice between
being good parents and good workers. Today, I want to talk with you about what we have
done, and what more we must do, to give that same assurance to every American family.

       One of the things that I most wanted to do when I became President was to help
parents succeed both at home and at work. That is why I was so proud to make the
Family and Medical Leave Act the first bill I signed as President, exactly four years ago
this Wednesday.

       Family and Medical Leave allows people in companies with 50 or more employees to
take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave -- to care for a newborn or newly-adopted child, or to
be with a family member who is sick, without fear of losing their job.

       Today, over half of all American workers share this important benefit. People like
Christie Sens, a first grade teacher from Fairfax, Virginia who is here with me today.
Christie was among the first Americans to make use of the new Family Leave law in 1993,
when she and her husband were expecting their first child. Christie thought she would be
forced to choose between the six weeks her school allowed for new mothers, or taking a
whole year off without pay. Because of our new law, she was able to spend 12 full weeks
at home -- recovering from her pregnancy, and spending precious time with her new
daughter. Christie used the benefit again in 1995 for the birth of her second child.

        Family leave is not only family friendly -- it is employer friendly as well. Also with
me today is Stan Sorrell, President and CEO of the Calvert Group, an investment firm in
Bethesda, Maryland, and two of his employees who have used Family Leave. The Calvert
Group started a Family and Medical Leave program three years before it became the law
of the land. Like more than 90 percent of participating companies, they found that Family
Leave is good for business, adding little or nothing to their costs. After all, in the four
years since I signed the Family Leave law, American business created 11.2 million new jobs
-- more than any four-year term in our history.

        We must make it even easier for parents to take responsibility, and live up to their
obligations to their children and their employers. Today, I call on Congress to expand the
Family Leave Law, to give parents an additional 24 hours of time off each year -- to take a
child or an elderly relative to a regular doctor's appointment, or to attend parent-teacher
conferences at school. In doing so, we will make our families stronger and our workers
more productive -- building the kind of country and economy we all want for our children.

                                                             .· -- :-(: , ........ J,_._

                                                                         Ht)x-i)ump ConV0ision

                We must also address the fact that too many workers are not taking advantage of
        the Family Leave law, because they are not even aware of it. That is why I am pleased to
        announce that the Department of Labor is launching a multi-media public education
        campaign, to spread the word about Family Leave; to make sure employers and employees
        have the facts; and to make sure everyone knows how to make this law work for them.
        It's not enough to help people have the tools to succeed; we must make sure they know
        what those tools are. The centerpiece of this campaign is a new BOO number that any
        American can call to learn about Family and Medical Leave: I-BOO-959-FMLA. You can
        also get information through our Labor Department's website: WWW.DOL.GOV.

                By expanding Family Leave to cover children's doctor's visits and parent-teacher
        conferences -- by helping more Americans learn about Family Leave, and the ways they
        can succeed both at home and at work -- we will create more opportunity, take more
        responsibility for our children and families, and build a stronger community for us all.
        That is how we must prepare America for the 21st Century, and help everyone have the
        tools to make the most of their lives.

               Family and Medical Leave embodies one of our country's most basic goals: building
        stronger families as we enter a new century, full of new promise. Ralph Waldo Emerson
        once said, "It is one of the most beautiful compensations of this life that no man can
        sincerely try to help another without helping himself." Family and Medical Leave is
        helping millions of American families -- and in so doing, it is helping us all. Now is the
        time to expand it, and make it available to even more of our citizens.

              Thanks for listening.
