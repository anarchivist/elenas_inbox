                                          Options



1)   Funds in 1999-2002 to help long-term recipients in high unemploymentlhigh poverty
     areas go to work and keep jobs. Funds would be added to T ANF but earmarked for
     work.

2)   Funds in 1999-2002 to help long-term recipients in high unemploymentlhigh poverty
     areas go to work and keep jobs. Funds would be available only if majority of states did
     not meet work participation rates in prior year. Funds would be added to T ANF,
     earmarked for work.

3)   Enhanced tax credit for firms that hire long term welfare recipients--fund would pay
     firm's share of FICA taxes for individuals hired and retained.

4)   Funds for vouchers for training, job creation, and job placement to help long-term
     recipients in high unemploymentlhigh poverty areas go to work and keep jobs. Funds
     would be added to TANF, earmarked for vouchers for individuals.

5)   Funds in Title XX Social Services block grant, which states could use for work or child
     care.

6)   Child Care:

     a)     Make Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit refundable. Cost: bet. $2-$5 billion.
            (Mark Mazur costing specific options by 4/15.)

     b)    Increase the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit amount to $3,600 for one child
            and $5,400 for two. Increase could be phased in over time. (Mark Mazur costing
            specific options by 4/15.)

     c)     $1.4 billion through 2002 for working poor families that CBO says is needed to
            keep them from getting short-changed by welfare reform (Dodd-Daschle). (This
            week, CBO is redoing its analysis of the shortfall -- dollar amount would change
            accordingly.)

     d)     Tax credit to companies for costs of building, renovating and/or operating child
            care centers (50% credit for eligible activities up to $150,000 per year per
            business). Cost: $2.6 billion (Kohl). (Because this proposal would subsidize
            already operating centers, Mark Mazur is developing an option that would
            subsidize only the expansion or creation of new centers, which would cost less.)

     e)     Loan forgiveness tax credit in President's budget which could be used for

                                                                                           4/14/97

individuals becoming child care workers. Cost: minimal.
