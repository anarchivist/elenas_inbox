TEXT:
        As you may have read, a district court struck down the NCAA's
academic standards (at least the way they relied on the SAT) on the basis.
of the Title VI regulation, which prohibits policies that have a
discriminatory impact unless there is an adequate justification and there
is no equally effective less restrictive alternative. The United States is
not a party but we could in theory file an amicus when it goes to the
court of appeals. This is a difficult case, which will require some
review. It raises the difficult question of when the civil rights laws
should be used to overturn academic standards. At the moment, I believe
our comment should only be that the Department of Justice is reviewing the
opinion. Any thoughts?
