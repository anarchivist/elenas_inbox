New York Provider Tax Issue. On Monday, DPC, NEC, OMB, and HHS will be briefing
Erskine on our plans for opening discussion with New York about their provider taxes that may
be out of compliance with current law. This meeting is to prepare for the scheduled HHS
meeting with Governor Pataki's office next Wednesday. At this meeting, HHS will advise
New York that we can administratively release a regulation that effectively eliminates two-thirds
(over $1 billion) of their provider tax liability by clarifying that their regional provider tax is
legal. Although this is good news for New York, there is little doubt that the state will want its
entire liability waived. As a result, the delegation's public response can be expected to not be
overly positive. We will try to mitigate their immediate reaction by stressing that this is just the
beginning of a negotiations process.

Because of the political sensitivity of this issue, our roll-out on the Administration's position on
provider taxes in New York (and all other 36 potentially affected states) must be carefully
implemented. In order to assure that we treat all states unifonnly, we plan on releasing our
interpretation of the status of pennissible taxes in all. states. We will be submitting a
memorandum on the status of our plans early next week.

Satcher Confirmation Hearing. The Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee will be
holding Dr. Satcher's confinnation hearing next Wednesday. The day before, a major coalition
of medical groups will hold a press conference to highlight the broad-based support Dr. Satcher
enjoys. As of this point, there appears to be no major hurdles facing the CDC Director, although
there is little question that Committee Members will raise questions about needle exchange, the
ethics of the AIDS trials in Africa, and our proposal to combine the Office of the Surgeon
General with the Assistant Secretary of Health. We will be conducting prep sessions early next
week, but even now we feel fairly confident that Dr. Satcher will perform exceptionally well.

FDA Reform. Next Tuesday, the House will is scheduled to take up (and pass) their version of
the FDA reform bill. We anticipate the bill they pass will be extremely close to something we
can recommend that you sign.
