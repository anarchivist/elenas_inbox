                 5 years. (See Table 6 of the eBO document) This is only the second time in 17
                 years that a budget submitted by a President reaches balance based on both
                 Administration and Congressional estimates. (The first was President Clinton's FY 97
                 budget)




The President Has Fulfilled His Commitment to Present a Budget that Balances Under Both
Administration and CBO Estimates. The bottom line is that CBO certifies that the President's budget
reaches balance in 2002. So now both the Administration and CBO have concluded that our budget
balances in 2002. The only remaining difference is whether or not we must undertake special measures --
such as a trigger mechanism to cut mandatory (except Social Security) and discretionary spending -- to
achieve that goal.

No Special Measures Will Be Necessary if Our Conservative Economic Assumptions Prove to Be Accurate.
 We have a strong record on this front. For four years in a row, the deficit has been lower and growth
has been higher than we had predicted. Since we took office, the actual deficit has on average been about
$50 billion lower than we had projected the year before. CRO has been less accurate: they have
overestimated the deficit by $59 billion on average. Furthermore, our current assumptions are equally
prudent and conservative. Our estimates of GDP growth and inflation over the next 5 years are precisely the
same as the Blue Chip private-sector consensus.

Even CBO Concedes "Slight Differences" Account for Almost Entire Gap Between Administration and
CBO Baselines. To quote CBO: "Although the Administration's economic projections are similar to CEO's
projections that incorporate the effects of balancing the budget, slight differences in economic outlook essentially
account for the entire $60 billion difference in the baseline projections of the deficit in 2002. " [CBO, 3/3/97]

Yesterday, CBO Certified That Special Measures We Have Identified Would Indeed Bring the Deficit
Down to Zero. If our assumptions do not prove correct, we will pursue an expedited process with
Congress to agree on how to close any budget gap. If that process breaks down, we have identified
contingency measures to reach balance by 2002. Those measures include the sunsetting of most of our tax
provisions in 2001 and an across-the-board reduction in spending (except Social Security). The
discretionary spending reductions would start in 2001 and the reductions in mandatory programs would
begin in 2002. Today's CBO study shows that these measures -- which we believe will be unnecessary --
will work to bring the deficit down to zero.

Look How Far We Have Already Come. Two years ago, the President and Congress were embroiled in a
budget battle that lasted straight into the next year. And unlike any other year since 1981 when the
opposing party controlled the Congress, the President's budget has not been deemed "dead on arrival."
Now, CBO has certified that the President's plan reaches balance by 2002. The President's 1993 plan
made the task of balancing the budget easier. That year, President Clinton inherited a record $290 billion
deficit. Four years later, the deficit has been cut 63% and is a smaller share of GDP than any other major
economy in the world. Now, it's time to finish the job.

We Have Put a Real, Credible Plan on the Table. The President has submitted a balanced budget plan
this year that even CBO certifies as being in balance by 2002. If some in Congress want to criticize that
their tax cuts, what programs they would cut, how much they would invest in education, and how much
they would cut Medicare and Medicaid.
