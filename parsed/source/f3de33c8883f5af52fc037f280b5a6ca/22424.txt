Subject:           Worker Re-Training event site ideas

Listed below are the potential sites for next Wednesday's worker
re-training event.  Please take a look and have these sites vetted through
NEC, DPC and Dept. of Ed.  Also, let me know which of these sites (two or
three) are peoples favorites on paper. An advance person will be looking
at the top candidates tomorrow.

1. University of the District of Columbia, Skills Development Institute,
Adult Education

UDC is the official state /adult education office for DC.  It just took
over these responsibilities this year to help turn the programs around.
They have a Skills Development Institute for adult learners. The SDI lab
has computers, occupational training courses, adult basic education and
GED prep courses. POTUS could tour the Skills Development Center and then
make remarks.

2. Martin Luther King Library - - DC State Literacy Resource Center     (9011
G St., NW)

Literacy Resource Center classes offered, GED prep etc ... a YWCA (located
next door) also has literacy programs for women and they work w/ MLK
library on programs/events. MLK library is hosting a DC Family/Worker
Literacy Conference on Feb. 25.



    3. Academy of Hope (1501 Columbia Rd, NW)

    Excellent service provider organization - adult education courses day and
    night for levels of learning. Computer assisted training. This is where
    Miss America Tara Holland launched her literacy platform and program

    4. DC Link & Learn     (401 M St. SW)

    Computer and information technology training center. Parent company is the
    Foundation for Educational Innovation which seeks to implement strategies
    for creating and sustaining skilled technical manpower across America's
    rural and urban communities.     Center is open for everyone and has
    programs in many high-tech computer skills. It has partnerships with
    Roosevelt High School, Garfield Terrace Public Housing Complex, Shiloh
    Family Life Center, Woodson High School and Ballou High School. Many
    corporate sponsors to this program such as: Microsoft, Nationsbank,
    Freddie Mac, Bay Networks etc .....  Sounds like a great place and Jay Dunn
    has much more detailed info.
