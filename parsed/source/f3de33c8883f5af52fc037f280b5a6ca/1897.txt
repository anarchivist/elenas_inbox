TEXT:
On Friday, POTUS is going to have a press conference with Hashimoto.
Please email me the top Qs&As that might come up at the press conference
by Thursday morning so Mike can review and we can put them in the POTUS
briefing book.  Thanks.  Please call me with any questions (x62712).

 (Kristen - you might want to route yours through NSC/David Johnson so
there aren't any duplications.)
