TEXT:
There will be a meeting at 10:00 am in the Roosevelt Room on Thursday,
September 10 to begin discussing candidates to recommend to the President
for the 1998 "class" of Medal of Freedom recipients.

Next week I will circulate a list of potential names.  The purpose of the
meeting will be to discuss these names and come up with ideas of some
others -- we are particularly in need of women and minority candidates.

My goal is to have an East Room event prior to Thanksgiving.
