         INTERVIEW WITH JEFF GOLDBERG, NEW YORK TIMES MAGAZINE


Q: How do you explain the shifting moral climate with regard to cigarettes and the tobacco
industry?

A: I would point to a few things:

          . 1. The release of the company documents, showing that the tobacco industry
            has been targeting their addictive and deadly product to our children.

            2: The aggressive advertising campaigns, such as the one around Joe Camel,
            which so obviously was geared toward children.

            3. The growing consciousness of Americans of the need to care for their own
            health and that of their children.


     Q: How do you explain the fact that the companies have lost aU their friends in
     Congress?

     A: Well, they clearly have lost some friends in Congress.

            I would point to a few things:

                   1. The release of the company documents, showing that the tobacco
                   industry has been targeting their addictive and deadly product to our
                   children.

                   2. The aggressive advertising campaigns, such as the one around Joe
                   Camel, which so obviously was geared toward children.

                   3. The growing consciousness of Americans of the need to care for
                   their own health and that of their children.

     But I'm not sure they have lost aU of their friends in Congress.

            There are many in Congress who do not believe we need legislation to reduce
            youth smoking and have spent weeks trying to defeat it.

            Otherwise, we would already have a bill in place.
                                                                       Hex-Dump Conv~~%~nt Sysrer
       I think the tobacco industry is still very powerful.

       In fact, they have spent more than $50 million in the last couple of months on
       advertising on television to try to kill the tobacco legislation.


Q: What do you think was wrong with the original settlement?

A: The main problems are that:

       1. It did not raise the price of cigarettes enough to result in a real and
       dramatic reduction in youth smoking (the settlement would only raise the
       cigarette price by 62 cents a pack),

       2. It weakened the FDA's authority to regulate tobacco products, and

       3. It did nothing to protect tobacco farmers and their communities.


Q:. What do you think the country will look like, in terms of smoking, in 10-15
years?

A: We expect that tough legislation will be enacted this year and will result in a
dramatic downturn in smoking, especially among young people.

      With a significant per pack price increase, tobacco advertising restrictions,
      and further efforts to enforce youth access to tobacco products, we expect to
      cut youth smoking nearly in half in five years.

       Therefore, I expect there will be far fewer smokers, especially young smokers
       in 10-15 years.

I hope that as a result of the advertising restrictions, and a new sense of activism
among young people, there will be a shift in attitudes among young people away
from the idea that smoking is cool and toward the position that smoking is an
addictive and deadly habit.


Q: What impact do you think the Administration had on the debate?

A: I think we have had an enormous impact.

      President Clinton was the first President to take on the powerful tobacco
      industry and take a tough stand to protect our nation's young people from
      the dangers of tobacco.
                                                       Hex-Dump Conversion

      In 1995, the President announced a new FDA rule to restrict
      advertising, promotion, distribution and marketing of cigarettes to
      teenagers.

      Last year, the first phase of this rule went into effect, making it the
      law of the land that no one under 18 can buy tobacco products and
      that retailers must check the ID of anyone under 27.


      Following the release of the tobacco settlement, the Administration
      pointed out the flaws in that settlement (see above), and the President
      outlined the five guiding principals that must be present in any
      tobacco legislation.

             It was these principals that formed the framework for the
             debate in Congress.

      Now, the President is calling for comprehensive tobacco legislation
      that will reduce youth smoking by nearly half over the next five
      years --stopping almost 3 million young people from smoking and
      preventing almost 1 million premature deaths by 2003.

This Administration continues to work closely with Congress.

      Following the Senate Commerce Committee vote of 19-1 on the
      McCain bill, we sought the following improvements to the bill:

             1. Strengthen the penalties, by including a company-specific
             component and increasing the industry-wide surcharge cap
             above $3.5 billion.

             2. Eliminate the "opt-out" provision that allows states to adopt
             weaker environmental tobacco smoke ("second-hand smoke")
             laws.

             3. Eliminate or narrow the antitrust exemption.

             4. Ensure spending on research, public health, and farmers,
             and press for spending on child care and education (or at least
             a menu including these programs).

Due to this Administration's leadersh"ip and commitment to reducing youth
smoking, we are on the brink of improving the health and well-being of a
generation of children and reversing the dangerous practices of the tobacco

     industry.
