TEXT:
The Corporation has just brought to my attention a study that Learn and
Serve America is about to release that shows benefits from well-structured
service learning programs.   They think it may be something to add to the
radio address, and it might be.

Conducted by Brandeis and Abt, it looked at 1,000 participants in high
quality Learn and Serve programs in 95-96 at 17 sites.  It says that
participants scored "significantly higher" than the comparison group on
math, science, and social studies grades, "core" GPA,  "school
engagement," and desire to go to 4 year college.  They also did better on
civic attitudes, time spent on service, etc.

I will send you the summary.   What do you think?
