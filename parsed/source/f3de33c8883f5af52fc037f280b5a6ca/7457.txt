TEXT:
Thanks for your help at the organic meeting - - you did a nice job trying
to move the ball forward on everyone's behalf, while various parties
around the table were trying to kick it backwards, sidewards, upwards,
downwards. We have had difficulty trying to figure out how to get a
purchase on this issue - - it refuses to be simply a commodity marketing,
ag practices, food safety, general health and nutrition, or environmental
issue.  Its not even clear whether we are dealing with Commerce, Science,
or Religion.    In any case, as we listened to Ag and FDA, I thought it
was a good example of why we need an EOP to look further and wider afield
than do individual agencies.

Cheers (and watch what you eat tonight.)
