                    Qs and As on NBAC's Report on Cloning


Q.   What did the Commission recommend?

A.   The Commission recommends legislation to prohibit anyone in either the
     public or private sector from attempting to create a child using the
     technology that made possible the creation of "Dolly" -- so-called "somatic
     cell nuclear transfer" technology. The Commission also supports a
     continuation of the current moratorium on federal funding of creating a
     child by cloning while the legislation is pending. NBAC is also asking the
     private sector to comply with the voluntary moratorium President Clinton
     called for in March, pending the legislative prohibition. Finally, NBAC also
     called for continuing public dialogue on these issues to further understand
     the ethical and social implications of this technology.

Q.   What exactly does the President's legislation ban?

A.   The President's legislation prohibits the use of somatic cell nuclear transfer
     to create a human being (specifically, "with the intent of introducing the
     product into a woman's womb or in any other way creating a human
     being").

Q.   How will the prohibition be enforced?

A.   The legislation gives the Attorney General authority to seek injunctive relief,
     impose civil fines up to $250,000 or twice the profit from a violation of the
     Act (whichever is greater), and seize any and all property used in violating
     the Act (including entire laboratories).

Q.   Why doesn't it make cloning a criminal act and impose jail time?

A.   We think the penalties in the bill provide an effective deterrent. In
     particular, they make it clear no one will profit from this activity. Its
     appropriate to be cautious about criminalizing any activity, and at this point
     we don't have any indication that we need the threat of criminal sanctions to
     deter this activity.

Q.   But what if Congress wants to impose criminal sanctions?

A.   We have seriously considered this option and would be willing to look at it
     again.
                                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion



Q.    Why is there need for a "sunset" provision?

      NBAC recommends -- and the President supports -- a sunset provision,
      combined with review by an advisory body prior to the sunset date. There
      are several reasons to take this approach. First, a sunset provision
      provides a strong incentive for Congress and the Administration to renew the
      national debate on cloning within several years, ensuring continued attention
      to the ethical questions; second, there has been little time to fully consider the
      moral issues, and it is possible that convictions may evolve; and third, there
      is a high probability that we will simply get the legislative language wrong
      the first time around, given our limited understanding of the science, the
      difficulty of defining terms, and the vagaries of the legislative process.

Q.    But if you think cloning is morally wrong now, won't it be morally wrong for
      all time?

      Even if one thinks cloning is morally wrong, a sunset provision still makes
      sense. As I just noted, it will force a renewed national debate within several
      years and will keep the ethical issues squarely in view. A sunset provision
      will also make sure we revisit how we've defined the ban and ensure we have
      done it exactly right.

Q.    Why ban the cloning of humans?

A.    It is morally unacceptable for anyone in either the public or private sector to
      attempt this type of cloning. NBAC found it is simply unsafe; knowing that
      "Dolly" was the only successful case in 277 attempts, there is no doubt that
      there would be substantial risk to the potential child. And the possibilities
      that we could replicate ourselves raises other ethical and religious concerns
      about the implications of this technology for our society. These issues need
      further discussion before the technology is used.

Q.    Why not ban all cloning? What are the potential benefits of cloning
      research?

A.    There are legitimate and beneficial applications of cloning cells, DNA,
      tissues, and animals: including the development of medicines, and therapies
      for diseases such as cancer, cystic fibrosis, and diabetes. Cloning also

         furthers our knowledge about developmental biology that may one day lead
         to such advances as regeneration of tissue in severe burns and spinal cord
         injuries.

    Q.   Why is any additional legislation necessary? Why not extend the
         President's moratorium?

    A.   The President's moratorium covers only federally funded activities. In
         March, President Clinton called for a voluntary ban on privately funded
         activities. Legislation is necessary, however, to ensure that the privately
         funded research and clinical centers comply with the proposed prohibition
         on cloning of human beings using the somatic cell nuclear transfer technique.


    Q.   With the proposed legislation, are we interfering with people's reproductive freedom?

    A.   No. We don't think people should have the "freedom" to do this activity. It's
         unsafe and ethically objectionable.

    Q.   How will the recommendations and legislation affect research?

    A.   NBAC found that a ban on human cloning will not impede any important
         research at this time. Basic research in such areas as animal husbandry and drug
         development will continue. Similarly, basic research using somatic cell nuclear
         transfer technology to study, for instance, the potential for regenerating tissues and
         organs will continue.     However, under current federal restrictions, human
         embryo research using federal funds will remain prohibited.

    Q.   Why would you (or the Commission) support a total ban on cloning people,
         but not on creating embryos using cloning technology for research?

    A.   The issue of embryo research is an important but separate question. NBAC
         found that the technology that created Dolly doesn't raise new questions
         related to embryo research. By contrast, the use of somatic cell nuclear
         transfer technology to create a child raises a host of new and different ethical
         issues relating to safety, individuality, and family integrity. The President's
         legislation is directed at these concerns. Further, the President has
         prohibited the use of federal research funds to create an embryo for research
         purposes -- whether created through cloning or other means.

    Q.   If human embryo research is bad, why not ban it in the private sector as
         well?

                                                                          Hex-Dump Conv8rsi:J~
A.   Whether to ban privately-funded embryo research is a question that needs
     careful deliberation, as such research may offer medical benefit,
     particularly with respect to treating infertility. We simply need further
     discussion about regulation of this activity in the private sector before
     pursuing legislation.

Q.   Does the Federal Government have any jurisdiction over privately funded
     research with human embryos?

A.   If the research is part of an effort to develop a drug, biologic, or medical
     device, the research is subject to regulation by the Food and Drug
     Administration. Otherwise, it is unregulated.


Q.   What happens to human embryos created for research? If they are not
     implanted, isn't that tantamount to abortion, or even murder?

A.   Creation of human embryos for research is a prohibited use of Federal
     funds. The extent of such research under private sponsorship is unknown;
     therefore, we have no reliable information on the fate of human embryos
     used in this way.

Q.   How will this affect childless couples who see doning as their only chance to have
     genetically related offspring?

A.   Prohibiting this technology will have little practical effect on such couples.
     Currently neither the science base nor safety considerations make it possible to
     produce a child by somatic cell nuclear transfer.

Q.   Is the United States acting unilaterally on this issue? Are we treating this
     issue any differently than other countries?

A.   Some European countries have already established legal prohibitions on the
     cloning of humans. To the extent that there are common aspects to our
     respective policies, we will certainly cooperate with these nations regarding
     enforcement.
