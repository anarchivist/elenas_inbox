Subject:         Phthalates

I don't know if I told you, but I've been receiving updates from ENDS (a
European environmental policy journal) on the EU's actions on this issue.
It's probably easiest if I just email this to you. If your interest (or
that of Europe's ... ) has waned, let me know and I'll cease and desist.


Here's today's update:



EU phthalates ban back on the agenda
ENDS Daily - 30/11/98

The potential for children to be harmed by phthalate
softeners used in PVC toys remains a cause for concern, an
EU scientific committee said on Friday. The opinion is
expected to lead to renewed pressure on the European
Commission to propose an emergency ban on the use of two
phthalates in PVC toys.

The EU committee on toxicity, ecotoxicity and the
environment gave its first opinion on phthalate migration
from toys to children's saliva in April (ENDS Daily 29
April). EU consumer protection commissioner Emma Bonino then
pushed unsuccessfully for the EU to institute an emergency
ban on phthalates (ENDS Daily 12 June).  She failed to
..
     achieve the backing of other commissioners by just one vote,
     Commission sources now say.

     The committee's revised opinion will strengthen Ms Bonino's
     hand if she proposes emergency action once more, according
     to sources.  "The review is definitely showing that this
     stuff is not safe," one told ENDS Daily.

     Requested as an update on new evidence, the committee's
     opinion is not radically different from its earlier one.
     However, it continues to suggest that children could ingest
     quantities of two phthalates above the main safety threshold
     of one-hundredth of the "no observed adverse effects level"
     or NOAEL.

     For DINP - the main phthalate used in PVC toys - the
     committee has revised its assessment to give a greater
     margin of safety - 75 compared with just 8.8 in its April
     opinion. The finding "still raises some concern" since it
     remains below the threshold of 100, the committee stresses.

     The committee has revised its opinion the other way for
     another phthalate, DEHP.  Following publication of a study
     suggesting that the substance can cause testicular cancer in
     mice and rats, the committee assesses the margin of safety
     for DEHP at 19, compared with 67 in April. Margins of
     safety for another four phthalates - BBP, DNOP, DIDP and
     DBP, were between 380 and 26,000, and therefore not a cause
     for concern, the committee added.

     Reacting to the committee's opinion today, Greenpeace called
     on Emma Bonino to "urgently propose an EU-wide emergency ban
     on soft PVC toys for children under three".  An increasing
     number of national governments were taking action,
     Greenpeace said, as well as toy manufacturers and retailers.
     Ms Bonino would show that she was "politically ruined" if
     she did not take action now.

     Toy industries of Europe, however, suggested that the
     committee's opinion revealed "nothing new," and that there
     was therefore no more evidence for banning phthalates now
     than there had been in the spring. The association also
     stressed that DEHP was almost never used to soften PVC toys.
