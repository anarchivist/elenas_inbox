RE:               URGENT -- Budget ConfereesD, Letter


        Enclosed is the draft conference letter. Unfortunately, we need
you to turn this around
        in short order.   Congress has requested that we deliver it as soon
as possible, and we
        want to do so by mid-day.   Please provide us with any mark-ups of
hard copy by 9 a.m.
        tomorrow (Wednesday) -- at the latest.   Unfortunately, we wonD,t
be able to use electronic
        comments.   Larry is in Room 253 or at fax 5-6818. Lisa is in Room
249 or at fax 5-3729.

        We apologize for the short turn-around, but our staffs have been
crashing all day just
        to get this draft done for your perusal and, for many reasons, we
believe it will help our
        efforts to deliver our views as specifically and as quickly as
possible.

          Thank you for your help.
