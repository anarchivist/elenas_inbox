TEXT:
Thanks to lots of hard work from Andrea and Eric we are wrapping up the
Workforce Investment Act rule with OMB and DOL which will put in place the
interim rules for the One Stop employment centers (final rule expected in
December after a comment period).  None of the issues are ones I think you
need to focus on, but we will submit a weekly item Thursday with more
information.
