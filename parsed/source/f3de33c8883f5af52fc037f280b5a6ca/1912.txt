Subject: E.O. 's

Susan Page is working on a piece on how we use Executive Orders to
accomplish things given Republican control of Congress and other factors.
She would like to peg the story on an upcoming E.O.  Is anything corning
down the pike next week or the week after that would be helpful to her and
to us?
