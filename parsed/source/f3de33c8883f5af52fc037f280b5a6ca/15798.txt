Weekly Item on Ways and Means Subcommittee Markup                      Hex-Dump Conversion
Cynthia Rice 6/6/97

On Thursday, the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources reported out welfare
legislation with many provisions inconsistent with the budget agreement and to which we have
strongly objected. The Subcommittee bill does include a $3 billion welfare-to-work proposal,
which we have praised for meeting many of our priorities.

The Subcommittee's immigration provisions are clearly contrary to the negotiated, bipartisan
budget agreement policy to restore a minimum safety net for disabled legal immigrants. The
Subcommittee's proposal would restore SSI and Medicaid benefits only to immigrants already
receiving benefits prior to August 23, 1996; by contrast, the bipartisan budget agreement policy
would restore SSI and Medicaid benefits to any immigrant in the country as of that date who is or
becomes disabled. The Ways and Means Subcommittee proposal would protect 75,000 fewer
immigrants than the budget agreement by the year 2002. The disability and aging groups
support our position, not Ways and Means'. The Leadership Council of Aging Organizations
and the Consortium of Citizens with Disabilities sent a letter saying that while they would still
like to cover even more legal immigrants than the budget agreement, they will not support "any
reductions in benefits to immigrants with disabilities in order to provide them to other groups of
immigrants." The states (NGA, APWA, and NCSL) sent a generic statement saying they
strongly believe that the termination of benefits to legal immigrants who were in the U.S. before
enactment of the welfare law should be rectified -- essentially taking no position on the
differences between the budget agreement and the Ways and Means proposal.

The Subcommittee narrowed even further the provisions of the budget agreement by adding at
markup a provision which would deny SSI benefits to any legal immigrant whose sponsor has
income higher than $40,000. Because in the past sponsors did not sign legally binding affidavits
of support (last year's immigration law changed that) we have opposed proposals like these
because they would leave many legal immigrants without assistance if their sponsor refused them
help.

We also strongly opposed the Subcommittee's proposal which would amend the welfare law so
that welfare recipients engaged in workfare would not be employees for the purposes of the Fair
Labor Standards Act or any other federal law. Although requiring the minimum wage for hours
worked, the proposal would permit states to count child care, Medicaid, and housing benefits in
their calculation ofthe minimum wage. It would also allow states to count additional hours of
job search, education, and training toward the welfare law's work requirements. We argued that
this provision is clearly outside the scope of the budget agreement, and that it creates a
subminimum wage for workfare participants and weakens the welfare law's work requirements.

We are pleased with the Subcommittee's $3 billion welfare-to-work proposal. As a result of our
extensive discussions with the Subcommittee, their new legislation directs a substantial portion
of the money to the 100 cities with the most poor people. Most of the money given to the states
will automatically be passed through to areas of high poverty and high unemployment and
long-term welfare dependency (primarily cities), and spending will be controlled by PICs

     appointed by mayors. Needless to say, the states strongly oppose directing funds to local
     agencies. They strongly believe the funds should be provided directly to the states, which
     should have the flexibility to determine how and where to use them. On our two other priorities,
     performance and displacement, the Ways and Means Subcommittee is still open to some form of
     performance bonus, but adamantly opposes nondisplacement language.
