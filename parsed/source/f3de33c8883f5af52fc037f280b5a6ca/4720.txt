So far, this is just Education's general counsel weighing in.   I will
bring in DOJ and WH counsel, as you suggest.

I guess I have a reaction, which is that we're making the President look
like a liar. Who's been giving the legal advice? Education? Justice?
Is our own counsel's office involved?    (If not, it should be.)  It seems
to me that we have to give people a very strong signal that we need to
find some way of including people 'who are doing service activities under
the auspices of church programs.   (You should show them what the President
said. ) At the very least, we should be able to 'include participants in p
rograms that aren't "pervasively sectarian." But don't suggest this as a
solution -- it would be nice to find language that stretches the envelope
still further.
