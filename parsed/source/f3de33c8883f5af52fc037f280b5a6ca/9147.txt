                            DATE:                   August 27,1998
                            LOCATION:               Mechanics Hall
                            EVENT TIME:             10:45 am - 12:00pm
                            FROM:                   Bruce ReedlElena Kagan

I.    PURPOSE

      To highlight the importance of safe schools and partnerships with law enforcement by
      announcing: (1) the release of the Early Warning Guide for teachers and principals to help
      identify and respond to violence in schools; and (2) the availability of $30 million in
      Police Corps funds for states to provide college scholarships to aspiring law enforcement
      officers in return for a commitment of service.

II.   BACKGROUND

      Early Warning Guide

      In response to the tragic school shooting at Thurston High School in Springfield, Oregon,
      in your June 13 radio address, you directed Secretary Riley and the Attorney General to
      develop a guide to help teachers, principals, and parents respond to the early warning
      signs of troubled youth that can lead to school violence. You will announce the release
      of the Early Warning Guide by the Departments of Education and Justice at the event.
      The the guide will be posted on the Education Department Website tomorrow, and on
      September 1, a copy will be sent to every school in the country.

      The Departments worked extensively with school psychologists, teachers, principals,
      parents, law enforcement, and youth in developing and reviewing the guide. They also
      consulted with school districts such as Jonesboro that have recently been confronted with
      school violence. The guide, based on research and experience in schools around the
      country, gives school communities information on how to:

             (1) Identify the early warning signs that relate to violence and other behaviors,
             including a list of specific signs to look for in troubled youth, such as:
             uncontrolled anger; patterns of impUlsive and chronic hitting, intimidating, and
             bUllying; detailed and specific threats to use violence; gang affiliations; feelings of
             persecution; and past history of violent and aggressive behaviors such as cruelty to
             animals or fire setting. Trained staff can use these early warning signs, together
              seek help for individual students and to prevent violence.

              (2) Take action steps to prevent violence, intervene and get help for troubled
              children, and respond to school violence when it is imminent or has occurred. The
              guide instructs schools how to develop a violence prevention and response plan
              and form a school-based team to oversee the plan's implementation. It provides a
              crisis procedure checklist, a step-by-step plan to follow once sudden violence
              occurs. The guide also lists actions students can take -- such as listening to
              troubled friends, involving trusted adults, and asking law enforcement to conduct
              school safety audits -- to help create safer schools.

       Also on Thursday, the Vice President and Mrs. Gore will also hold a listening session on
       school safety in San Francisco. Their session at Lincoln High School will include parents,
       local law enforcement, and community leaders and will help to prepare for the
       upcoming White House Conference on School Safety this October 15th.

       Police Corps

       You will announce the availability of a total of $30 million for 23 states to participate in
       the Police Corps program created in the 1994 Crime Act. As you know, the Police Corps
       program encourages young people to become law enforcement officers by providing
       college scholarships of up to $7,500 per year for four years for students who agree to
       serve on a state or local police force for an equal length of time. Police Corps also
       provides policing agencies $10,000 per participant for each year of required service.

       Tomorrow's announcement marks a six state expansion of the Police Corps program.
       Massachusetts is one of the new states. The six new states will receive $14.3 million to
       award scholarships for 330 students -- which will bring the total number of students
       funded by Police Corps to over 1,000. The remaining funds will support the ongoing
       expenses of Police Corps participants already approved to date.

       The 23 participating Police Corps states are: AR, CO, eN, FL, GA, IN, IL, KY, MA,
       MD, MI, MS, MO, NY, NM, NC, OH, OR, OK, SC, TX, UT, WA and the Virgin Islands.

TEXT:
A quick query -- one of our message events for next week (the week POTUS
is in Russia) is on the verge of falling through, and we're looking for
any strong announcements -- perhaps something POTUS has to pass on because
of his trip -- for either the 3rd, the 4th, or both.

Any ideas?
