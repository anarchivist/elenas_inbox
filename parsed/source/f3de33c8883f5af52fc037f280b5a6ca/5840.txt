TEXT:
You asked about the status of pay equity (Ann Lewis was interested in how
it could work with the civil rights enforcement intitiave.)  We had done
some work on it, trying to come up with things that didn't involve
comparable worth and have a few things-- including the hotline idea and a
renewed enforcement emphasis. Ann Lewis agreed that the message would be
confused as part of a civil rights announcement-- it doesn't involve race,
but that if we can get a couple of pieces like those it would be boffo.
(There are also several bills floating around but not moving in the House
and Senate-- some involving comparable worth-- which we are trying to
take pieces from).  Mary is sitting down with some folks from the women's
office and a couple of administration allies who are into the issue to vet
where they are on the issue. Anyway, we should have some results to talk
about this week.
