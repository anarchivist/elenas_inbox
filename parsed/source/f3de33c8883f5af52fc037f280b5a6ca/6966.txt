    MEMORANDUM FOR THE CHIEF OF STAFF

    FROM:                   Bruce Reed

    SUBJECT:                Monday's Meeting with Birch Bayh

    Fonner Senator Birch Bayh has wanted to meet with you for some time to discuss tobacco. In
    his initial letter, he said that he believes that "men and women of good faith in both political
    parties are prepared to make the compromises necessary to secure an accord. This will require
    the willingness to 'take a risk' politically to accomplish such a major break-through. Trust and
    reliance are fundamental ingredients in this regard. It is toward how best to ensure these
    elements that I believe a conversation between the two of us might prove helpful."

    You should know the Senator Bayh's finn, Bayh, Connaughton & Stewart, have worked since
    last November as lobbyists for Richard Scruggs, the plaintiffs' attorney from Mississippi who
    worked with Mike Moore to launch the attorney generals' suits against the tobacco industry.
    (Scruggs is also Senator Lott's brother in law.) The attorneys' general worked hard to help get
    legislation moving on the Hill. As you know, they are partial to the deal they negotiated last
    June. Several times during our Commerce Committee negotiations, they raised concerns about
                                                                                        °
    whether the industry would walk away from legislation that raises prices by $1.1 per pack and
    imposes penalties on companies that continue to sell cigarettes to children. IfBayh raises these
    concerns, you may want to say:

    ·        The McCain bill represents a dramatic progress. It shows that we have real momentum
             in both parties to pass comprehensive tobacco legislation this year.

    ·        As the President said in his radio address on Saturday, we're not trying to put the tobacco
             companies out of business; we want to put them out of the business of selling cigarettes
             to kids.

    ·        That's why we need to increase the price per pack by at least $1.10, put in place tough
             penalties that will cost the tobacco industry if it continues to sell cigarettes to young
             people, provide the FDA full authority to regulate tobacco products, and ban advertising
             aimed at children.
