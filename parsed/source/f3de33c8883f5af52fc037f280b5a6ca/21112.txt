TEXT:
Education: We are planning an education event for Monday August 31 at an
elementary school in virginia. We expect that you will make brief remarks
and participate in a roundtable discussion with the school principal"
teachers and parents,   before an audience of teachers and parents from the
school.  Students will not return to the school until the following week.
The purpose o.f the event is to allow you to frame the education agenda for
Congress as it returns, and to challenge Congress to enact legislation for
your education priorities (school modernization and class size reduction,
charter schools, early literacy, and the Higher Education Act, including
your proposal to recruit and prepare 35,000 teachers fo'r high poverty
communities and yout High Hopes mentoring initiative) and to appropriate
the funds you have requested.   The Senate appropriations subcommittee will
mark-up the Labor-HHS-Education bill on Tuesday, which is expected to
restore many of the cuts made in the House. Therefore, it will be
particularly timely for you to challenge the Senate on Monday to restore
these cuts.
