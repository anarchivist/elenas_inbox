TEXT:
Haskins is pushing HHS to follow up on their agreement to meet about
family formation measures in the high performance bonus. Haskins'
proposal to Mary Bourdette is to meet with him, Census, OMB, CBO, CRS, and
Robert Rector.  HHS is concerned about meeting with Rector without a
balanced representation of advocates.   They want to propose instead 2
meetings:  one with the above list minus Rector, and a second meeting with
Rector and other folks at different points along the spectrum. HHS feels
it would be unwise to tell Ron that they don't even want to meet with
Rector. Mary says HHS will make it clear that the decision on the NPRM
rests with HHS, and these meetings are not negotiations.

Let me know today if you have any concerns about this, since Mary needs to
call Ron back.  I assume it doesn't make sense for us to be there.
