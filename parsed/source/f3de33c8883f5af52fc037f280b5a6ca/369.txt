TEXT:
OMB is calling to find out where we stand with Justice, i.e., should they expect
(i) nothing; (ii) a meek protest; (iii) a demand that the President be told
there is a constitutional problem with one minor provision; or (iv) a veto
threat, and should they expect it (i) on time or (ii) late.
Can you help? The OMB contact person in Ingrid Schroeder, on 53883.
P.S.  Ingrid, I suspect I'll end up writing the signing statement unless OMB
wants to.  However, I'm going to try to get some input from Treasury and the
SEC, as well as the budget side of OMB. And of course, we may have to deal with
Justice.
