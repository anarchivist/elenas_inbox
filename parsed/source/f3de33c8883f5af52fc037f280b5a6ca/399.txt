TEXT:
Upon my return today to the office I had a copy of the memo the
President received from Frank Raines and myself on welfare reform.
I am copying each of you as I feel his comments give us all
validation for the approaches we are taking.
Jeremy, please note the President's one question on food stamps on
page four and let's do a quick follow up FYI memo to him in the
next couple of days.
Thanks, folks!
