 Presumably, what he really means is
 that "Dole is for capping punitive damages
 assessable against
 [corporate) defendants in product liability cases but Clinto
 n,
 U! zK
  at
 the behest of the trial lawyers, is
 U!zK
 opposed to capping.")

Response:   Contrary to Senator Dole's assertions, there is no
 punitive damages
 explosion. A recent Rand
U! zK*
 Institute for Civil
Justice
U! zK*
 study stated: "Despite the attention they have received
 from policymakers and f
 rom the media, punitive damages are rarely
'awarded." The same study found that
  punitives are most
U! zK3
often
awarded in intentional tort and


 U! zK5
 business cases, not in product
 liability cases.

 President Clinton has consistently opposed caps on punit
 U! zK>
 ives not
 only because there is no need for one, but also because
 punitives, whe
 n they are awarded, constitute an effective means
 for a jury of citizens to det
 er egregious misconduct that has put
 at risk the lives and health of 0

 ther American citizens.

 Issue: "Dole is for changes that would make it more difficult for
 shareholders
 to file securities fraud lawsuits."

 Response:   President Clinton believes that our capital markets
 will operate mor
 e efficiently if corporations make the maximum
 amount of information available
 to investors and do so without
 fear of frivolous lawsuits. The President there
 fore agrees that
 it is appropriate to make it more difficult for lawyers to fil
 e
 frivilous securities lawsuits, including in particular suits
 filed on behalf
 of solicited plaintiffs. Many of the provisions
 in last year's Securities Liti
 gation Reform Act should have this
 effect, and the President has asked the SEC
 to monitor the law to
 determine whether it effectively deters frivolous while a
 t the
 same time protecting the effective access of defrauded investors
 to the c
 ourts.   President Clinton has recently stated his
 opposition to California Prop
 osition 211, which would increase
 the likelihood of frivolous securities lawsui
 ts being filed.

 Issue:  "Dole is for a clearer definition of independent
 contractors."

 Response:   The Small Business Job Protection Act, which President


 Clinton signe
 d into law on August 20, contains an improved
 definition of independent contrac
 tor.  However, this is a complex
 issue, implicating questions far beyond simply
  taxes, including
 worker protections (such as under the Fair Labor Standards Ac
 t)
 and benfits (under ERISA). Allowing employers simply to choose
 whether thei
 r workers will get the benefit of these statutes, as
 some of the proposed "clea
 rer definitions" would do, is bad for
 workers and, ultimately, bad for business
  and for the economy.================== END ATTACHMENT   1 ==================
