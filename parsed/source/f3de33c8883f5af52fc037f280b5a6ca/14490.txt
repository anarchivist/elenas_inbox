TEXT:
Elena, I just wanted to make sure that we follow-up with Justice on the
questions that were raised last week about next steps. There mayor may
not be appropriate steps, but I think it merits an examination. What do
you think is the right next step? Do you know who is now handling for the
counsel's office? Thanks.

I told Rubin about how wonderful you are and the next time you are both in
the same place, I will make sure that I introduce you all.
