TEXT:
DO       For $15 million within CDFI, we could fund the first year of
the PRIME Act. Treasury has requested that this not be taken out of the
$100 million in passback, but be included within any increase in CDFI.
That means you could seek a $35 million expansion of CDFI -- last year we
got $90 million, but we requested $125, the $35 million would make the
President's request again $125 instead of the $100 million OMB has
recommended -- and fully fund the PRIME Act.  The PRIME bill has a real
focus on very low-income clients and has strong support from
microenterprise community and on Capitol Hill (especially, Kennedy and
Domenici). Over four years, the legislation provides $105 million over 4
years for training and capacity building.

PRIME authorizes the CDFI Fund to establish a microenterprisetechnical
assistance and capacity building grant program that would award grants on
a competitive basis to eligible enterprise development organizations and
programs.  PRIME is not intended to provide funds for lending, but rather
to make money available for training both for entrepreneurs and for'
microfinance institutions.
