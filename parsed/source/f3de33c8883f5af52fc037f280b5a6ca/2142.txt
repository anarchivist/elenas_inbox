 FROM:      OMB LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS

 DATE:      MAY 6, 1997

 SUBJECT:           LEGISLATIVE REPORT


 The Senate continues to debate the Bosnia/Disaster Supplemental, though no
 significant progress was made on the most contentious issues. Meanwhile,
 the House Rules Committee today postponed their consideration of the bill
 until next week at a time to be determined.

 Senator Lott asserted that the Democrats are delaying disaster assistance
 to needy victims by filibustering the bill, pending resolution of the


 automatic continuing resolution.  Senator Daschle denied that any such
 filibuster was underway and that, in fact, it was DemocratsD, desire to
 expedite consideration of the bill. Senate Democrats are circulating a
 letter to the President saying they would vote to sustain his veto if he
 vetoed the supplemental because of the automatic continuing resolution.
 The letter currently has 37 signatures.

 CONGRESS TODAY (5/6):

         [SAP sent, 5/5: D&Based on the Senate Committee bill, which included
         the automatic   continuing resolution, the President had
