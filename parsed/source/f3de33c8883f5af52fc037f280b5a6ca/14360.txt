Elena --

Thanks for sending down the Proposition 211 draft.  Just before I got your
letter incorporating Bruce Lindsey's comments, I received some suggestions from
Jennifer O'Connor on the language. Her comments are represented in red, within
and following the text below. Should we amend the letter or can we leave it
the way it is?
************************************************************************************
Thank you very much for writing to me about Proposition 211, the California
ballot initiative regarding securities lawsuits.

I opposed this Proposition because I felt it would undermine the balance
between the federal and the state governments with respect to the regulation of
widely traded securities. As my veto of last year's Securities Reform Act
attests, I believe strongly in the need to protect the rights of defrauded
investors. But after careful consideration, I determined that Proposition
211's creation of a novel cause of action, broader than any now recognized,
would have gone too far in the other direction, deterring companies from
providing useful information and thereby harming American investors.

Thank you again for giving me your views.
Needs something addressing preemption. ( I believe we didn't ever do anything
and we should say so.)
