           According to HUD (Ginny Terzano), Jack Lew and Secretary Cuomo agreed
           today to
           let HUD leak its entire budget tomorrow for Friday's paper -- apparently
           to
           make up for a mistake that OMB made on the HUD budget in the actual budget
           paper.

           Anyway, HUD suggests that we laek the budget (along with the rest of the
           President community empowerment agenda) to a wide array of papers    NY
           Times,
           Post, USA Today, LA Times, WSJ, NY Daily News, and Knight Ridder.  This
           would
           certainly make Sec. Cuomo happy and probably get us a little lift going


into
the speech.  It we agreed to do this (and someone should check with jack
to
make sure that we did), we would coordinate with HUD to make sure that
stories
did not simply reflect HUD budget but also broader agenda for America's
cities.

Sugget we work out at Joe's 8:15 a.m. mtg but Gene may need to vet with a
couple of people beforehand at senior staff (Lew, Goody, Podesta.)
