TEXT:
I'm proceeding to try and get   country of origin to be ready for the
Wednesday event.

USDA is very concerned and Glickman says he would like to talk to Bruce
today (720-3631). Their best arguments will be that it raises more
foreign policy concerns (trade war, POTUS goes to South America in April)
and that it will lose on the Hill/upset Daschle who wants to label meat.
We are setting up a meeting with all relevant players (including
USTR/State) for 5 pm today.

On the 90 day report    We've talked to the VP staff about featuring the
90 day report Wednesday and that should be fine.
