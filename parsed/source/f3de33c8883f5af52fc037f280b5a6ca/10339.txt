TEXT:
Access to Jobs: I understand from DOT that they may have found a way to
fund the full $150 M for FY 2000, but I'm trying to verify w/ OMB.
Apparently OMB provided $200 M in passback for other transit· purposes, and
the Department has indicated they want to use $75 M of that to add to the
$75 M in guaranteed funding to reach the $150 Mlevel.

Substance Abuse: A study in the November issue of the American Journal of
Public Health found that substance abusing welfare recipients were much
less likely to leave welfare for jobs than other welfare recipients -- 30%
of substance abusers exiting welfare did so because they got a job,
compared with 52% of other welfare recipients existing the rolls (not a
surprise,but it's always nice to have data).   This was based on a
longitudinal sample from 1989-1995, so it's pre-welfare reform. Overall,
the study found about 15% of AFDC recipients in the· sample were substance
abusers (generally consistent w/ other studies).  The data illustrate that
individuals w/ subst. abuse problems can work and do work, but that they
face an extra challenge.   It's nice support for having made substance
abuse one of the factors that qualifies someone as 'hard to serve' for
purposes of being eligible for the $3 B WtW grants, for continuing this
focus, and for highlighting this popUlation in competitive grants.
