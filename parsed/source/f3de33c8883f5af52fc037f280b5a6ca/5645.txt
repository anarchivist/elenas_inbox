5. Technology Teacher Training ($130 million in new funds, $222 total for
initiative): This initiative dedicates 30 percent ($142 million) of the
Technology Literacy Challenge Fund (which is being increased from $425
million to $475 million) to ensure that at least one teacher in every
school receives intensive training in the use of technology for education,
so that they can train their colleagues. An additional $80 million will
begin an effort to train every new teacher in .the latest technology.
