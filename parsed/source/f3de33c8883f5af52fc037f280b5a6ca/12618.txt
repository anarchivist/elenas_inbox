PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
RADIO ADDRESS ON VIOLENCE AND
THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY
SEATTLE, WASHINGTON
May 15, 1999

        Good morning.  In the past few weeks, ever since that terrible day
in Littleton, people across America have searched their souls and searched
for solutions to prevent this kind of tragedy from happening again.   Last
Monday, at our white House strategy session on children and violence,
representatives of every sector of society agreed on one fundamental fact:
making progress requires taking responsibility.

        That responsibility begins at home.  Parents have a duty to guide
children as they grow, staying engaged, staying involved in their lives.
The most important influence on a child is a parent.

        Here in Washington, we have a responsibility to keep guns out of
the hands of criminals and children.  There is a broad national consensus
on that point -- everywhere, it seems, except the u.S. Senate.  Last week,
the Senate t~ice passed a phony proposal instead of a real law that would


close the deadly gun-show loophole, through which tens of thousands of
guns are sold each year without background checks.   Even worse, the Senate
bill is riddled. with new loopholes -- permitting convicted felons to get
guns at pawn shops, no questions asked; and making it harder, not easier,
for law enforcement to trace guns used in crimes.

         If the Senate says it wants to fix the problem, it should fix the
problem.   It should not make the problem worse. The American people
deserve -- and have demanded -- better. They know that law-abiding
citizens donD,t need loopholes in our gun laws. Only criminals do.    I
strongly hope that in the coming weeks, the Senate will step up to its
responsibility and do the right thing by our children.

        I have always said that the entertainment industry must also do
its part.  In 1993, shortly after I became President, I traveled to
Hollywood and spoke to members of the community about their
responsibility.  I said: D&¥ou have the capacity to do good -- to help
change the way we behave, the way we think of ourselves . . . Examine what
together you might do to help us rebuild the frayed bonds of community, to
give children nonviolent ways to resolve their frustrations.DB

        Today, the entertainment industry is helping parents limit
childrenD,s exposure to violence -- working with the administration on a
voluntary ratings system for television and parental screening for the
Internet. But there is still too much violence on our nationD,s screens,
large and small. There are too many creators and purveyors of violence
who say there is nothing they can do about it. And there are too many
vulnerable children who are steeped in this culture of violence --
becoming desensitized to it and, as studies show, more capable of
committing it themselves. By age 18, the typical American will see 40,000
dramatized murders. All in the name of entertainment.

        Those who say they can do nothing about this are wrong.   By
changing the way they do business.   . by making movies, music, TV
programs and video games as if their own children were watching . .
members of the entertainment industry can make a big difference. And
today, I want to issue three specific challenges to the entertainment
industry.  First, the whole industry should stop showing guns in any ads
or previews children might see. Second, I challenge theater owners across
America to enforce more strictly the age requirements on the movies they
show. Theater owners should check IDs, not turn the other way as a child
walks unchaperoned into an R-rated movie. And third, I challenge the
movie industry to re-evaluate its entire ratings system -- especially the
PG-13 rating, to determine whether it is allowing gratuitous violence in
movies viewed by children. Our administration is fighting to do all we
can to protect our children.  The entertainment industry should do
everything in its power, too.

        Across America, people are coming together and saying, yes, we can
change this culture of violence.   I believe that we can -- and that we
will    build in its place a culture of values which we will be proud to
pass on to future generations.   Thank you.
