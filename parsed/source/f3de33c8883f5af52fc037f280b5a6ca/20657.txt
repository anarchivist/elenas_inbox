TEXT:
I get the sense that we are not really focusing on    when to do the
Coverdell veto.  I don't have a particular opinion    -- other than, if we do
it as an event, we don't do it at the AFT eve·nt or   any other union-related
event.  But you might want to adjust the timing to    avoid those events.
Deadline is July 25.

Is somebody thinking about this?
