TEXT:
Jim:  The House Rules Committee meets tommorrow to consider a rule for floor
consideration of the product conference report in the House.  It is not clear
however, whether this means the House will take up the report this week.  The
floor schedule is very full already and there is some thought that proponents of
the conference report wouid like to use the recess to whip up support for the
veto override. Alternatively, the House Democratic leadership staff is somewhat
apprehensive about the conference report coming up late in the week when Members
are trying to get out of town and the Democrats needed to oppose the bill are in
relatively short supply.
I will keep you posted as things develop.
