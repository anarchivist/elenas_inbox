TEXT:
Justice is willing to accept your edits to page two.  They would,
however, like to replace the former final sentence of the former
second full paragraph, which you deleted, with the following:  "We
would be happy to work with you to craft a provision of this sort
which would meet constitutional standards."
If you can live with this, we are ready to clear the letter.
Thanks.
