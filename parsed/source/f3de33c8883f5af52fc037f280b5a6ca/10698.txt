                           PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
                  REMARKS ON THE NEXT GENERATION COPS INITIATIVE
                               ALEXANDRIA, VIRGINIA
                                  January 14, 1999

            Acknowledgments: AG Reno; Dep. AG Eric Holder; Assoc. AG Ray Fisher; Alexandria
     Chief of Police Charles Samarra [sa-MERR-a]; Joe Brann, director of COPS program; official
     TBD; Arlington police officer TBD; and the representatives oflaw enforcement organizations
     who are here today.

             For years, police, families, and the victims of violence waged the fight on their own for
     safe streets and safe homes. Washington sat on the sidelines. Six years ago, we moved to the
     frontlines -- joining the law enforcement officials we have here today in the fight against crime.

            Today I want to talk about the progress we've made in our country's fight against crime
     and the steps we must take to build on that progress. When I became President, I committed my
     administration to recovering our nation's streets from crime and violence, to providing security
     for America's families. It required a new, comprehensive strategy oflaw enforcement, based
     simply on what works: on community policing, strong anti-gang efforts, and targeted deterrence;
     on tougher penalties and smarter prevention.

             Our strategy -- from the Crime Bill to the Brady Bill to the assault weapons ban -- is
     showing remarkable results, as the Attorney General has noted. Since 1993, all across America,
     crime rates overall have dropped to a 25-year low. Property crime is down; and, as you can see
     [point to chart], the number of violent crimes has declined 20 percent in the last six years and
     continues to plummet. The murder rate, too, is down dramatically, to its lowest level in 30
     years, mostly due to the dropping number of youths wielding guns. We can take pride and
     comfort in this steady progress. Neighborhoods are safer; families are more secure; Americans
     have a new feeling of freedom.

              There are many reasons for the drop in crime in our country: Stricter penalties ...
     Stronger efforts to get guns out of the hands of criminals. .. The burning out of the crack
     epidemic, as the terrible human toll of that destructive drug scares more and more young people
     away. And, perhaps most important to the peace of mind of our people, the substantial, visible
     increase in the presence of police on our streets. Across America, you are stepping out of squad
     cars, joining our communities, protecting our people. To those of you who are out there, putting
     your lives on the line, America owes you a tremendous debt of gratitude. And I'm pleased to
     report that ahead of schedule and under budget, we've helped fund more than 92,000 of 100,000
     community police -- making us all partners in the fight against crime. I used to say that the
     number of police had not gone up as the number of crimes had gone up; but now, with more
     police on the streets and fewer violent crimes, we are turning that around.

            America is pressing its advantage in the fight against crime. But no matter how low

                                                      1

                                                                             Automated Records Management System
                                                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion
      crime rates go, we can never stop and say they are low enough. There are still too many
      neighborhoods in America where crime has not fallen as far or as fast as it should. There are
      still too many officers in the line of fire, where 155 of your colleagues lost their lives in the past
      year. There is still more work to do, even though the funding for our community policing effort
      is set to expire after the year 2000.

              We know what works in the fight against crime, and it is working in communities
      across America. But now, we have a chance to focus our efforts on any stubborn pockets
      of resistance where the criminal culture holds sway. Today, I am announcing that my
      balanced budget will include nearly $1.3 billion -- an increase of more than $6 billion over
      5 years -- to renew and redouble our community police program. That will help hire and
      re-deploy an additional [50,000] community police officers over that same period. We
      should refocus our resources -- and the energies of our men and women in blue -- on the
      high-crime, high-need neighborhoods where we know they can make a difference.

              But community policing is not just about putting more officers on the street. It is also
      about giving our police the 21st Century tools they need to do the job -- crime-fighting,
      crime-solving, crime-preventing tools. Today, drug dealers communicate by cell phones and
      pagers. .. Scam artists work the Internet. .. Gangs carry cutting-edge weaponry.

              Criminals have the best technology. Police should, too. That is why, today, I am
      proposing that we devote $350 million, paid for in my balanced budget, to put
      crime-fighting technology into the hands of our police officers. For too long, we have seen
      some criminals go free because the methods used to gather evidence were not up to date. But
      when police can report from their squad cars, rather than return to the station to fill out
      paperwork, they can spend more time on the beat. When officers can track crime as it happens,
      using innovative crime mapping technology, they can respond more quickly and effectively.
      ChiefSamarra [sa-MERR-a] has told us what a difference these new tools make.

              Police carry a heavy burden; but we know they cannot carry it alone. There is more we
      must do to engage the entire community in the fight against crime -- to help win the fight police
      have been waging so successfully. My balanced budget targets additional funds for
      community-based crime-fighting -- everything from neighborhood DAs who work closely with
      police and residents, to faith-based organizations that help prevent juvenile crime.

               I have put these programs in our budget; now, I want to do what we did on the Crime Bill,
      which is to sit down with law enforcement officials and talk about the best ways to make this
      initiative work. Because together, we can and will make it work.

             America is grateful for the hard work of our men and women in uniform. Every day, you
      make our streets and schools safer, our homes more secure, our people more free. Still, we
      know you cannot do it alone. By working together and giving you the tools to do your job, we
      will make this a better and a safer nation in the 21 st Century.
