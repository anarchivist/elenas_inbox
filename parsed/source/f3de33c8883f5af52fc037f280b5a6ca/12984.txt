         Below is a letter Education is sending in to the NYT in response to the
         Thernstrom op-ed about ED's draft test use guide.·

         ED is asking for comments ASAP to meet the publishing deadline.

         Jon and I have reviewed and are suggesting that they add a sentence that
         would express the administration's strong support for the appropriate use
         of tests and other measures in a number of ways, including for high-stakes
         purposes.

In her commentary, "Testing, the Easy Target," Abigail Thernstrom makes a
number of erroneous conclusions regarding the u.S. Department of Education
Office for Civil Rights (OCR) draft resource guide regarding test use.

Our effort is to help policymakers and educators understand the foundations
for legal and educationally sound testing policies-to avoid controversy and
litigation. with citations to over sixty federal court opinions and test
measurement standards of the American Psychological Association, this is
nothing new.

Ms. Thernstrom's equation of racial gaps in test performance with
discrimination (and conclusion that tests are, therefore, "guilty until
proved innocent") reflects a misreading of the draft, just as it reflects a
gross misunderstanding of the settled legal principles upon which it is
based. Differences in students' test scores may result from a range of
factors, including, lack of preparation for or motivation to do well; poor
skills or knowledge related to what is being measured; or problems with
the
use of the test itself. The guarantee under federal law is for equal
opportunity-not equal results.

Thernstrom also accuses the u.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil
Rights of seeking to ban all standardized testing.  That outrageous
assertion is squarely refuted by the draft, as well as by our numerous
policy statements and resolutions of discrimination claims. Our guiding
principle is that anti-discrimination standards give substantial deference
to sound educational judgments. As a result, tests that are used in
educationally appropriate ways and that are valid for the purposes used are
very important instruments to help educators do their job. Our resolutions
of discrimination claims recognize clearly that the solution to many such
problems is not to eliminate the very tools that help provide a meaningful
picture of the educational opportunities provided to students.
