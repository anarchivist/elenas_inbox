TEXT:
Hasn't Secretary Glickman known all along that we were aiming to have this
directive released before he goes out to the Pacific Northwest this week? Why
didn't we know beforehand of his desire to not release anything that will step
on his already-planned message?
I'm not advocating that we rush forward with an announcement for the sake of
doing so, but I agree that with both Secretaries and Katie out in the region,
this may be the best time to go forward so that we (the administration) can
control the "spin" of the directive.
I'm just suddenly confused as to why the timing is an issue with the Secretary
when we have been working towards this for several weeks now ...
