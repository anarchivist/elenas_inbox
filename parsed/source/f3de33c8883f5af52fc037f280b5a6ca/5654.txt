TEXT:
The Post has positive article on the front page of the Metro section
discussing Baileys Elem. school.  It 'discusses in brief (not many details)
the problems initially faced by the school when English speaking parents
were zoned to the school, and the limit on the number of "outside
boundary" students admitted to the school in its "magnet" incarnation, but
on the whole treats it all as a success.   Two good points included as part
of the formula for success: reduced student-teacher ration in the first
grade and less "ability grouping" than in other schools (with a school
policy of high expectations for all kids, and that "mixed ability" classes
produce success for all) .

Though we still have to prepare for land mines in the case study, this
coverage is encouraging.
