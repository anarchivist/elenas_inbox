     Subject:         Where we are w/tomorrow

     We are on our way to look at Chesterbrook Elementary School in McLean,VA.
     It is either in Davis or Wolf's District (which Leg is confirming which
     one).  It has 8 trailers, 2 of which are used for normal classes, 2 for
     afterschool programs and a few for disabled students. There is also
     school construction going on at the site so NEC thought we could tour the
     trailers as well as the construction site before making the statement.
     Gephardt's office found this school through their contact.  I have talked
     with the principal who welcomes·the possibility of a presidential visit.
     Gephardt's office also spoke with the Superintendent Dan Dominch who is
     the same guy Mike Cohen tried, but could not, reach. The superintendent
     welcomes the visit as does the Chairman of the School Board who they also
     spoke with. Hill leadership does not want to do Maryland b/c of the messy
     politics on this issue. Also, Counsel's office has ruled that if we go to
     Maryland the event is political so a campaign entity would have to fund
     this which is another reason to see if this VA school works b/c it would
     be an official event that Education could pay for.

     I could not reach everyone so that is why I sent this update around. We
     will not confirm until the advance team returns from the site. Thanks.
