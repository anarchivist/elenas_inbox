I will be away on business from Wednesday evening through Saturday
evening in Florida.   If you need to reach me you can contact Jill
 (62249) or Claudia (65392) or have the operator SkyPage me.
I will be reading computer messages late on Wednesday evening and
late on Thursday afternoon and possibly late that evening. After
Thursday I will very likely not read email again until Sunday
afternoon or Monday morning when I return to the office. Messages
can always be left on my home answering service which I check
frequently when I am out of town
Thank you.
