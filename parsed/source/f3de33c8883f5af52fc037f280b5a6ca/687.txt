     Welfare to Work Corporate Challenge

     Eli Segal has committed to organize the corporate welfare to work effort. From a policy
     standpoint, we are ready to make the announcement for the SOTU. We would announce the
     following: Three CEOs (to be named) have agreed to lead an effort to mobilize the business
     community around your challenge to put 1 million welfare recipients to work by the year 2000.

     We are in the process of choosing the two or three CEOs who would head the effort. Right
     now, those being considered are: United Airlines, UPS, Burger King, and Rachel's Bus
     Company in Chicago. Monsanto and Sprint would likely be Vice Chairs. Cheri Carter in
     public liaison is working to finalize this piece.

     Once you reiterate the welfare to work challenge and announce which CEOs will lead the effort,
     Eli will continue his work outside the White House to organize the effort.

     Corporations involved in the challenge would directly hire welfare recipients; those without
     available jobs will encourage and motivate different businesses to hire; others might fund specific
     programs, offer leadership, call on contacts, or recruit other corporations and their employees to
     the effort.

     Faith Community Challenge

     We are working with Flo McAfee and Linda Lader to organize this effort. We are waiting for
     the religious community to come to us with a proposal. As you know, you have a Congressional
     prayer breakfast scheduled for next week. This will be one of several topics the faith
     community will discuss. Flo McAfee believes the faith community will approach us with a
     proposal in a couple of weeks at which point we will begin work with them.
