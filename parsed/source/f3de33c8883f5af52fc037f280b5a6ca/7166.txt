          Before we meet with Partnership staff to begin planning this event, wanted
          to just run past you what it might look like, given the announcements you
          indicated below.

          Eli could open and talk about how much·progress they've made.  He could
          announce 5,000 partners and approximately l35,000 hires by business.
          partners--or save this for POTUS?    Eli would then introduce CEO from one
          of the retention success stories the Partnership is gathering, who would
          talk about what they're doing and encourage others to do the same.   CEO
          would introduce former welfare recipient/retention success story from
          his/her company.  She would introduce POTUS, who would announce caseload
          decline, WtW competitive grants (highlighting a few that focus on
          retention), and go through what's been accomplished in the past year, and
          what's ahead.  He could reference federal hiring success, VP coalition
          (which will hopefully be meeting in mid-May), SBA initiatives for small
          business (which would be released at VP coalition event), and put in plug
          for welfare to work housing vouchers and transportation initiatives.

          Bruce, Eli, and Secretary Herman could do press briefing before or after
          the event--this would give Herman a speaking role and a chance to go into
          more detail on the grants without taking time on the panel.

          For the WTW event, I would like to release l) the DOL grants; 2) caseload

   "
numbers that put us over 3 million for the bill (and 5 million for the
term); and 3) whatever Eli has on business hires.
