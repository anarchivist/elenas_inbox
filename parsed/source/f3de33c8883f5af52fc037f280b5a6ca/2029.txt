TEXT:
I am trying to get all the pending state legislature opportunities
straight in my head.
As I understand it, Missouri is the only state that has a}
endorsed our standards and b) is still in session.  Correct?
Are there other states on the horizon that might endorse (like
West Virginia) -- whether or not they are in session?
thanks.
