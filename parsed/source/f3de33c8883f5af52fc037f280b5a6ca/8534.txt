TEXT:
The President could direct the AG and the Sec'y to establish a task force
to assist states with their Medicaid suits. The interdisciplinary task
force would be capable of providing legal and scientific assistance, and
it would study past suits to determine winning strategies.

BTW ... Now that tobacco legislation is stuck, we need to revisit the
Medicaid Federal share issue.   Strategically, pursuing our share might add
pressure to states to help resurrect comprehensive legislation.
Politically, you probably don't need my advice.
