TEXT:
Peter Kilborn of the NY Times is writing a story painting a fairly
devastating picture of the problems faced by 55-65 year olds in accessing
affordable insurance. His story will conclude that this problem is
getting worse and will only continue to do so b/c of the demographics and
new practices by insurers to move away from community rating. This story
builds on a recent Washington Post story discussing the large premium
increases Kaiser and other insurers are contemplating (or.have announced)
for this population this year.   I expect it to get pretty good placement
in the paper and' will probably run either tomorrow, Sunday or Monday.

He desperately wants a quote from me or someone else.   I have said no, but
he keeps on pushing.   (My primary concern was that virtually anything from
us would box us in on this year's budget decisions.)   Having said this, it
is a very good opportunity to highlight the President's proposal this
year, illustrating that he has recognized and responded'to the problems
that will be outlined in Kilborn's article.

If we want a quote, we could perhaps think of things that are more
oriented to this year's proposal -- not the upcoming budget discussions.
Here's one idea, if we are interested

        "These problems [underscore the need for] [served as the rationale
behind] the             President's Proposal to provide more
affordable insurance.options for this population."

What you think/say?   Need guidance as soon as possible.   Thanks.
