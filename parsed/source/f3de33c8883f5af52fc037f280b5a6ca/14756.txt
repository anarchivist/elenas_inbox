TEXT:
I talked to the reporter with Our Sunday Visitor. She said Doug Johnson,
National Right to Life Committee, was making his remarks based on what
Leon said in December.

What I said,   as you advised, was that the President has never said that
needed to be   in the bill. He has said many times that he would sign this
bill,  if it   contained an exception in cases where the procedure is
necessary to   save a woman's life or prevent serious harm to her health.

Thanks for the help.
