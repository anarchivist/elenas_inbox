        TEXT:
        Regarding Thurs. 's FMLA anniversary, the following events seem to be
        planned:
                 1. Women's Legal Defense Fund reported that Senator Dodd was
        having a press conference to celebrate the anniversary and announce more
        about the expansion . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (I have not confirmed with Dodd's
        office, however, Labor told me the same thing)

                2. Carolyn Moloney is having a press conference at noon in
        conjunction with the Congressional Women's Caucus . . . . . . . . . . . . (I did not
        confirm, but this sounded more vague than the Dodd event )
                **1 can call folks Wed. a.m. to get the information on these 2
        events.

        AS of late this afternoon, it was not clear as to what Labor would do, if
        anything. After our discussions this morning, they were possibly going to
        wait and just do the POTUS event.

        Regarding states with lower thresholds as possible sites, for an event
        outside DC, Women's Legal Defense Fund reported the following:
                DC ......... threshold is 20
                Maine ......... threshold is 25
                Minn ....... threshold is 21, but law is not as broad as FMLA
                Oregon ..... threshold is 25
                Vermont ...... threshold is 10 for new born and newly adopted; and
        15 for others, also allows 24 hours for dental care, etc.

        Clearly, Vermont is the best state with alot of small business, but it
        doesn't appear the POTUS is headed anywhere near there over the next
        couple of weeks.
.'

           please advise . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . we'd love to see this come together in the
           District or out!

           Thanks
