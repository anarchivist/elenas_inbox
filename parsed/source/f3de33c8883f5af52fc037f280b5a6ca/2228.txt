Subject:         Shays Hearing

FYI

Congressman Shays has scheduled a hearing for this Thursday regarding HHS
and their informed consent procedures. Testifying for HHS will be Harold
Varmus (NIH), David Satcher (CDC) and others.  Shays will touch upon
different studies, such as the recent news regarding ethical concerns
raised by Public Citizen over the use of AZT.

The Committee will brief HHS later this week.  At this time, HHS does not
have major concerns with the hearing. However, they will watch it closely
to report if it has any negative implications for the President's Tuskegee
announcement scheduled for May 16.
