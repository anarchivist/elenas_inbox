TEXT:
Here are the comments on the Native American riders to the Interior bill

1.   Pro-rata Allocation fo Contract Support Costs/Indian Health Service.
High priority -- this provision would reallocate the way Indian Health
Service funding is given to tribes with the result that many tribes will
lose hundred of thousands of dollars.

2.   Bureau of Indian Affairs and Indian Health Service Tribal Contract
Moratorim.  High priority -- this provision would interfere with tribal
self-determination by prohibiting tribes that want to contract to provide
their own health services or other services from doing so (which they are
permitted to do under current law) .

3.  Sen. Enzi/Sessions Amendment on Indian Class III Gaming (BIA).  High
priority --this provision would prohibit the promulgation of the Indian
gaming provisions from the Gaming Commission.

4.  BIA-Tribal Priority Allocations (TPA) Funding.  This is a non-issue at
this point. Senator Gorton had wanted funding to be provided to tribes on
a means testing basis.  Interior worked out a compromise that would permit
a study to be done first.

5. BIA-Prohibition of Taking Land into Trust Status for. Tribes.  High
priority.  wil this specific provision only affects the Shakopee Sioux in
Minnesota, the effect of this provision would be to prevent BIA from
taking lands into trust status for the tribes.
