TEXT:
EEOC will come back to us by early afternoon with an estimate of how much
it would cost to do ADR for everyone who wants it immediately, or if we
ramped it up in three years. They say that it is really guesswork
figuring how many people would want it-- they've hope to have done only
400 cases by the end of the first year of the program.   I said figure it
so that everyone could have the option.   (Incidently, they'did have a
succesful million settlement recently.)
