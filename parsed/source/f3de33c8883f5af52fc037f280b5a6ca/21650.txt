initiative to address violence against providers of reproductive health services. This initiative
will better coordinate information on clinic violence in order to track down perpetrators, better
protect clinics and providers, and respond more effectively to the needs of clinics to ensure
minimal interference with this constitutionally-protected right once violence has taken place.
First, the Department of Justice is announcing on November 9th the formation of a National Task
Force that will also establish a central location for information related to clinic violence, and
provide training to federal, state and local law enforcement personnel. Second, we propose
additional funds for security measures at clinics identified to be at risk of violence as well as
stepped up U.S. Marshal support. Third, we propose federal guarantees ofloans by clinics that
must rebuild after they've been attacked. Cost: Unknown at this time.
