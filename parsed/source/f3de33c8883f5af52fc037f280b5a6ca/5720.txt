    Please let me know by COB today if you would like to submit. any requests
    for Presidential videos to be taped during the month of January.

    Also, there will be a short term scheduling meeting tomorrow at 4pm.
    please let me know if there are any events we are ready to propose. Keep
    in mind that January 8 and 9 the President will be in New York and
    McAllen, Texas and there are openings for message events in each city.
    Any ideas?
