OMB is recommending funding the Social Services Block Grant (SSBG) at the fully authorized
level of$2,380 million, an increase of $471 million over the FY 1999 enacted level. Last year's
President's Budget assumed a similar reduction in FY 2000. OMB proposes to offset the cost of
restoring SSBG in FY 2000 by: (1) capping TANF transfers at the level set by TEA-21; and (2)
advance funding a portion of the Head Start program year 2000 - 2001 budget authority in FY
2001. The cap on TANF transfers produces estimated outlay savings in FY 2000, without
reducing TANF budget authority. Advance appropriating Head Start provides the budget
authority needed to restore SSBG, without reducing the number of children that can be added by
Head Start in FY 2000.

Need for SSBG. SSBG funds child and adult protective services, child care, family support and
preservation, home-based services and special services for the disabled. It serves low-income
children, families, the disabled and the elderly--individuals with significant, documented needs.
The inherent flexibility of the SSBG block grant enables States to support a wide range of
programs serving diverse groups of individuals. The types of services provided and groups of
individuals served vary considerably among States. A wide range of groups have presented
evidence that SSBG cuts will seriously restrict State efforts to serve low-income individuals.

TANF Transfers. In FY 2000 States may shift up to 10 percent of the $16.5 billion Temporary
Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) grant to SSBG for services provided to children and
families below 200 percent of the poverty line. Beginning in FY 2001, TEA-21 caps the amount
of funds that a State may transfer from T ANF to SSBG at 4.25 percent.

During the first three quarters ofFY 1998,24 States transferred over $600 million (3.6 percent)
from TANF to SSBG. Although final transfer data will not be available until January, we
estimate that total transfers could be as high as $1 billion (6.1 percent) for FY 1998 and that in
FY 2000, most States will take full advantage ofthe transfer authority. It is likely State transfers
increased in the final quarter ofFY 1998 because Appropriation Committees in both the House
and Senate proposed to cap State transfers of FY 1999 T ANF funds at the FY 1998 actual levels.
 At Administration request, the Omnibus 1999 Appropriations Act restored the 10 percent
transfer cap for FYs 1999 and 2000.

The Administration opposed capping transfers at the actual FY 1998 levels because the SSBG
reduction created a void in services that TANF transfers could help fill. If we restore the SSBG
reduction in FY 2000, and cap TANF transfer, we believe that the net effect would be increased
service levels in SSBG.

Head Start Advance Funding. Because the T ANF transfer cap provides only outlay savings, it
is necessary to find additional BA savings to support the SSBG restoration. We propose to do
this by reducing Head Start BA in FY 2000 by advance appropriating $.5 billion of the FY 2000
BA in FY 2001. While this BA is needed to support program year 2000 - 2001 Head Start
activities, delaying the availability of funds until the beginning of FY 2001 will have no effect
on Head Start service levels. During the FY99 appropriations debate, the Senate proposed to

                                                                   Automated Records Management System
                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion


    meet its BA shortfall by advance appropriating 29 percent of program year funds ($1.365 billion)
    for Head Start after having set its program year level and thus committing the outlays for FY99.
    Head Start operates on a school year basis, causing a large portion of money to outlay in the
    second year. Because that form of advance appropriation would have no effect on outlays, HHS
    agreed that it would not harm program operations. The OMB proposal would advance
    appropriate approximately 10 percent of the total program year funds.
