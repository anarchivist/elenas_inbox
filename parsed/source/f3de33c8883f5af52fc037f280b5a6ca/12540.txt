TO THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES

       I am pleased to transmit today for your immediate consideration the Educational
Excellence for All Children Act of 1999, the Administration's proposal for reauthorization of the
Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA) and other elementary and secondary
education programs.

       This reauthorization comes at a critical turning point in American education. We face
tremendous challenges as we draw near to the new millennium, and I believe education holds the
key to meeting those challenges. We now have more students in our schools than ever before.
We have a technology-driven, information-based economy that requires well-prepared, adaptable
workers to ensure continued growth and prosperity. And we have a world that is knit ever-closer
together and demands the diverse talents of every American to support the peaceful expansion of
freedom and democracy.

        To meet these demands and secure our Nation's economic strength, the new millennium
must bring with it the dawn of an Education Age, in which we work together to make every
school in America a good school that helps all of its students reach high academic standards. We
also must work together to close the persistent achievement gap based on race, ethnicity, and
family income by lifting up all of our students and improving the achievement of both our
lowest- and our highest-achieving students. My ESEA reauthorization proposal would move the
Nation toward these goals through a comprehensive strategy focused on early intervention,
teacher quality, and real accountability for results.

         My proposal builds on the positive trends achieved under current law. The Improving
America=s Schools Act of 1994, which reauthorized the ESEA five year ago, and the Goals
2000: Educate America Act gave States and school districts a framework for integrating Federal
resources in support of State and local reforms based on high standards. In response, 48 States,
the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico have adopted State-level standards. States are now
developing and implementing curricula, assessments, and professional development aligned with
their standards, and early research suggests these efforts are improving educational outcomes.

        In particular, recent results of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP)
show improved performance for the economically disadvantaged and other at-risk students who
are the primary focus of ESEA programs. NAEP reading scores for nine-year olds in high-
poverty schools have improved significantly since 1992, while mathematics achievement has also
increased nationally. Students in high-poverty schools and the lowest-perfonning students-the
specific target populations for the ESEA Title I program-have registered gains in both reading
and math achievement.

        These gains in student achievement are due in part to changes in the 1994 Act that made
clear that all students should be pursuing the same high standards and that gave recipients of
funds more flexibility in exchange for greater accountability for helping students to reach those


                                                                                   517199 DRAFT
                                                                         Hex-Dump C       . anagement System
                                                                                    on versIOn

standards. This approach prompted States and districts to make changes in instruction and
policies to help all students reach high standards. The new flexibility included expanding the use
of schoolwide programs to restructure entire schools in high-poverty areas, encouraging
consolidation of program plans and administrative funds to better support comprehensive
reforms, and granting waivers of statutory and regulatory requirements to encourage local
innovation to improve student achievement.

          I am encouraged by these positive trends and results, but we must do more if we are to
give every child the opportunity to achieve to high standards. Too many children are still taught
by teachers who are not well qualified or are teaching "out of field." Too many children still are
attending schools that are not safe and drug-free. Too many schools fail to create the supportive
environment of caring adults that all students need to learn and grow. The educational system
still is insufficiently accountable to parents and the public. And educational results, for many
children, remain far below what they should be. My reauthorization bill addresses these and
other continuing needs and problems.

       The development of my proposal to reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education
Act was guided by four crosscutting themes reflecting both lessons from research and the
experience of implementing the 1994 reauthorization.

        First, we would continue to focus on high academic standards for all children. The
underlying purpose of every program within the ESEA is to help all children reach challenging
State and local academic standards. States have largely completed the first stage of standards-
based reform by developing content standards for all children. My bill would support the next
stage of reform by helping States, districts, schools, and teachers use these standards to guide
classroom instruction and assessment.

       My proposal for reauthorizing Title I, for example, would require States to hold districts
and schools accountable for student performance against State standards, including helping the
lowest-performing students continually improve. The Educational Excellence for All Children
Act of 1999 also would continue to target Federal elementary and secondary education resources
on those students furthest from meeting State and local standards, with a particular emphasis on
narrowing the gap in achievement between disadvantaged students and their more fortunate
peers.

        Second, my proposal responds to research showing that while qualified teachers are the
most important in-school factor in improving student achievement, far too many teachers are not
prepared to teach to high standards. In fact, about one-third of new teachers lack full
certification, and a similar percentage of teachers teach "out-of-field," or in subjects for which
they have neither an undergraduate major nor minor. Teacher quality is a particular problem in



                                                                                   5/7/99 DRAFT
                                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion
Page 3 - ESEA Transmittal Letter

high-poverty schools, where it is often exacerbated by the use of paraprofessionals in
instructional roles.

         My bill addresses teacher quality by holding States accountable for stronger enforcement
of their own certification and licensure requirements, while at the same time providing
substantial support for State and local professional development efforts. The new Title II
initiative, Teaching to High Standards, would help move challenging educational standards into
every classroom by providing teachers with sustained and intensive high-quality professional
development in core academic subjects, support new teachers during their first three years in the
classroom, and ensure that all teachers are proficient in relevant content knowledge and teaching
skills. The Technology for Education initiative under Title III would expand the availability of
educational technology as a tool to help teachers implement high standards in the classroom,
particularly in high-poverty schools.

        Title VI would extend the Class-Size Reduction initiative, which aims to reduce class
sizes in the early grades by helping districts to hire and train 100,000 new teachers over the next
seven years. The Title VII Bilingual Education proposal would help ensure that all teachers are
well trained to teach limited English proficient students, who are found in more and more
classrooms with each passing year. The bill also would create a new competitive grant program
to increase the number of teachers qualified to teach foreign languages to elementary students, in
support of the goal of helping at least half of public elementary schools to offer high-quality
foreign language programs by 2010.

        Third, my bill would increase support for safe, healthy, and disciplined learning
environments for all students. Though recent data show that school crime rates are declining, the
recent tragedy at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado reminds us that we must be ever
vigilant against the risks of violence and other dangerous behaviors in our schools. Our
reauthorization bill includes several measures to help mitigate these risks.

        My Secondary School Reform initiative would help support and expand the connections
between adults and students that are necessary for effective learning and healthy personal
development. Particularly in our large high schools, students too often feel nameless and faceless
due to a lack of regular contact with a caring adult in the school. This new initiative would
provide resources to help transform 5,000 high schools into places where students receive
individual attention, are motivated to learn, are provided with challenging courses, and are
encouraged to develop and pursue long-term educational and career goals. My reauthorization
proposal also would permit schools to use up to 5 percent of their ESEA funds to improve access
to the social, health, and education services needed for all students to succeed in school.

       We would strengthen the Safe and Drug-Free Schools Communities Act by concentrating
funds on districts with the greatest need for drug- and violence-prevention programs, and by


                                                                                    5/7/99 DRAFT
                                                                          Hex-Dump Conversion
Page 4 - ESEA Transmittal Letter

emphasizing the use of research-based programs of proven effectiveness. In addition, all States
would be required to hold districts and schools accountable for developing and implementing
consistent and fair discipline policies.

       My proposal also would require districts receiving ESEA funds to prohibit the use of
tobacco in any form on school grounds or at school-sponsored events. The Gun-Free Schools
Act would be modified to require an assessment of any student who brings a gun to school to
determine if the student poses an imminent threat, and to ensure that students expelled under the
Act continue to receive educational services in a stable, supervised environment. And a new
School Emergency Response to Violence (SERV) program would provide rapid assistance to
school districts that have experienced violence or other trauma that disrupts the learning
environment.

        Fourth, there is a strong emphasis on accountability throughout the Educational
Excellence for All Children Act of 1999. This emphasis, which I signaled in my State of the
Union address in January, appropriately reflects two key developments in American education.
The first is the clear evidence, including strong academic gains among poor children in States
like North Carolina, that the kind of standards-based reform encouraged by the 1994
reauthorization works best when States have strong accountability systems in place. The second
is the growing demand by parents and the general public for greater accountability in our
education system. The American people have made education their number one priority, they
have agreed to make new investments in our schools, and they want to see results.

        My reauthorization proposal responds to these demands. The bill would help all students
reach challenging State academic standards by supporting early intervention strategies, research-
based approaches to strengthening teaching and learning, high-quality professional development,
smaller classes, and extended learning time. In exchange, the new Education Accountability Act
in Title XI would require States to end social promotion and traditional retention practices, to
phase out the use ofteachers with emergency certificates and the practice of assigning teachers
"out-of-field," and to implement sound discipline policies in every school. The bill also would
require State, district, and school-level report cards that will help parents evaluate the quality of
the schools their children attend.

        The Educational Excellence for All Children Act of 1999 provides a solid foundation-
based on high standards for all students, high-quality professional development for all teachers,
safe and disciplined learning environments, and accountability for parents and taxpayers-for
raising student achievement and narrowing the achievement gap between disadvantaged students
and their more advantaged peers. More importantly, it will help prepare all of our children, and
thus the Nation, for the challenges of the 21 51 century. I urge the Congress to take prompt and
favorable action on this proposal.
