 TEXT:
 I just wanted to give everyone the event basics for Monday's    addres~   to
 the International Association of Fire Fighters.

 3:15pm -                Briefing
 3:40pm                  Oval Office

 3:45pm                  Depart WH en route Hyatt Regency Hotel

 4:05pm -                 Remarks to 17th Annual Legislative Conference of
 the International 4:55pm                         Association of Fire
 Fighters

                         Alfred Whitehead, General President of the IAFF,
will make remarks,                       present the President with a
gift (a bronzed ax     this is still tentative),
                         and introduce POTUS

                         POTUS makes remarks, works a ropeline, and departs.

I believe the press plan is for Chris to leak this Sunday for Monday to
the New York Times.  Bruce -- Jen just confirmed this with Joe, but she
said she hadn't checked back in with you on it.

There will be 700 people in attendance, all participants in the IAFF
Conference. We're still trying to confirm whether Shalala or James Lee
witt will attend (Reno is definitely not able to attend). We are also
still waiting to hear whether Chris Field (the firefighter from the


Oklahoma City bombing who was in the photo holding the baby -- he's a
member of IAFF) will be in attendance. He is currently mentioned in the
speech.

The stage will be set with a podium and two tables on each sides with
seats (set up for their whole conference).  The back drop will be the IAFF
seal and logo for their 17th annual conference.

 please let me know if anyone has any questions.   Thanks!
