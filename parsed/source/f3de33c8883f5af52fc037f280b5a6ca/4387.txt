TEXT:
As I understand it, our next minority issues meeting is tentatively
scheduled for next Tuesday morning (June Gayle will confirm time and
place). Many of the items that we did not get through this week will be
addressed next week, but please submit any additional agenda item requests
to me by noon on Monday, as I will be out for most of Tuesday.

Thank you.
