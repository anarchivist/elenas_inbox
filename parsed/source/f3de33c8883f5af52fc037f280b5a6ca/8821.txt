TEXT:
Doris called.  She thought through our proposal and decided not only to
embrace it, but to strengthen it in ways I think you'll all like.  She
sent over a draft organizational chart and talking points that looked
good.  She will rework them tonight; I'll forward them in the morning.   We
will have a complete package as soon as we resolve the issue of when the
fees should go into effect.
