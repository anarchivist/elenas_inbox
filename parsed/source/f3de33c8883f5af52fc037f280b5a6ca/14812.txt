TEXT:
North Carolina - There will be an education clutch and then the speech to
the N.C. State Legislature.  If communications wants a visual of the DOD
announcement hopefully it can just be a meet and greet at the airport with
some students and military folks from a DOD school nearby.  The advance
team is looking at the possibility of dropping by a DOD school, but per
Mike, they're not in very good condition.  It would be a lot easier to
just do a photo at the airport.

Florida -- Still no decision on whether the message event will be on
school construction.or medicare fraud.   Don will hold meetings on Monday
to reach a decision.
