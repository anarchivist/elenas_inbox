his working groups up to speed '"  his working groups are supposed to
bring proposals to caucus by next Tuesday, and settle policy by end of the
week.  If you can't find your packets, Cynthia Dailard can give you a new
set!

Bill said he'd like to get together with us tomorrow morning ... talk about
what's happened in the four working groups (all except law enforcement and
antitrust) ..... he's going to call me or Elena later today to discuss.
