WHAT NEW RESEARCH ON THE BRAIN TELLS US ABOUT OUR YOUNGEST CHILDREN
                                                                                     Automated Records Management System
 "Learning begins in thefirst days of life.  Scientists are now discovering how young childre~t;;~~~~X,";;;;~ti;;~'ally
 and intellectually from their very first days, and how important it is for parents to begin immediately talking, singing,
 even reading to their infants.... We already know we should start teaching children before they start school. "

                                                                                    --President Bill Clinton, State of
 the Union Address, February 4, 1997

On April 17, the President and First Lady will host The Wlrite House Conference on Early Childhood
Development and Learning: Wlrat New Research on tire Brain Tells Us About Our Youngest Children. The
day-long conference will highlight new scientific findings on brain development in very young children and
point to the importance of children's earliest experiences in helping them get off to a strong and healthy start.

Applying New Findings on Brain Development in the Earliest Years. New scientific research shows that
experiences after birth -- particularly in the first three years of life -- have a dramatic impact on brain
development. That means that nurturing, talking to, singing to and reading to our youngest children will
improve their ability to learn and develop throughout their lives. The White House Conference will focus on the
practical applications of the latest scientific research on the brain, particularly for parents and caregivers. The
conference will also be a call to action to all members of society -- including the health, business, media and
faith communities, child care providers and government -- to use this infonnation to strengthen America's
families.

Clinton Administration Commitment to Young Children. This conference builds on the Clinton
Administration's investment in children and families. The Administration has invested heavily in
research to help us better understand the importance of the first few years of life to child development
and learning. Between 1993 and 1997, funding for NIH children's research increased 25%, from $1.3 billion
to $1.6 billion.

President Clinton has also strengthened efforts to support families with young children. To take just a
few examples, the Administration raised funding for Head Start -- providing low-income children and their
families with comprehensive education, health services, and nutrition -- by 43% over the last four years and
created the Early Head Start program to support families with children ages zero to three. The President's FY
1998 Budget further increases participation to reach 122,000 more children in FY 1998 than when he took
office. The Administration also dramatically increased participation in the WIC Supplemental Nutrition
Program, providing 7.4 million pregnant women, infants, and children with nutrition packages and infonnation
and health referrals -- 1.7 million more than when President Clinton took office. And his FY 1998 Budget
would achieve his goal offull participation in the WIC program by the end ofFY 1998.

Conference Program and Participants. During the morning session of the conference, leading researchers
and child development experts will discuss the new research and what it means for parents and caregivers. The
panelists for this session are: Dr. David Hamburg, Carnegie Corporation of New York (moderator); Dr. Carla
Shatz, University of California, Berkeley; Dr. Donald Cohen, Yale Child Study Center; Dr. Patricia Kuhl,
University of Washington; Dr. Ezra Davidson, Drew University of Medicine, Dr. T. Berry Brazelton, Harvard
University; and Dr. Deborah Phillips, National Research Council. The afternoon session will highlight model
community efforts to support parents and enhance early childhood development. The panelists include: Avance
Family Support and Education Program, San Antonio, TX; the CEO and Chainnan of the Board, The Kellogg
Company, Battle Creek Michigan; and Ounce of Prevention, Chicago, IL.

Broad Participation Across the Country. The morning session of the conference will be broadcast by
satellite to over 50 locations across the country. The satellite conferences will be co-hosted by regional federal
agencies, local officials, and children's and other organizations.
