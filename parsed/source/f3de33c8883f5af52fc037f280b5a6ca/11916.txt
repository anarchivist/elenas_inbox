TEXT:
OMB has now signed off on the proposal plus an authorization of up to $2
million. (I had to talk to Diech, Chow and Gottbaum).  Ida and her stats
person said they can be happy with that figure. I added it to the
description of our proposal below:


 The legislation would charge the existing office of research at EEOC
(ORIP) with two tasks, EEOC is authorized with up to $2 million to
complete:


        1.      Within one year and six months evaluate the current
        knowledge and sources of data available to federal government
relating to the gender pay gap; identify gaps in the available data; and
consult with relevant agencies including Departments of Labor, Treasury,
and     Commerce.


                2.      Implementation
        The EEOC would report results of above evaluation of what pay data
is available; and also
        within 1 year and 6 months from passage of the legislation
identify the best method for collecting necessary data for enforcing the
Equal Pay Act and EEO considering factors including:

* Enforcing relevant laws;
* Imposition of burden on business to enforce law;
* Use of appropriate data collection vehicles and preliminary techniques
to identify businesses from which the data is most likely to be useful to
EEOC and/or OFCCP.

3.      Utilize pilot studies, sampling, and/or other means as
deemed necessary by EEOC in implementation period.
