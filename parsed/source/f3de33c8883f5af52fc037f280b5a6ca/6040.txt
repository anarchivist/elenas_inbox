TEXT:
I am following up on the interest by Lifetime Television in helping to
organize/demonstrate support for the child care inititaive. Beginning with
SOTU,
 ( they hope to air a PSA with Mrs Clinton) they would use airtime ,an
#800 number and their web site to encourage messages to Congress and then
continue through the year. Kathy Bonk and Andrea Camp have helped develop
their proposal.
      Nicole, I think you've seen a copy of their letter. Should we get
together this week to discuss ? I thought we could include OPL and Press
as well .
      (If you did not get the letter, Lifetime is 4th among basic cable
networks; reaches 3x as many women 18-19 as CNN,etc.)
