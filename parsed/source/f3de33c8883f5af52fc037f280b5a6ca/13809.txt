TEXT:
Here's the schedule for Monday, June 24.   They are all in town, so
I told them the interview would be in Kathi's office (I hope you
don't mind, Elena):
1:30    Chris Franks
2:00    Joe Fanaroff
2:45    Staci Coleman
If the 1:30 time is too early to accomodate your lunch plans, let
me know and I'll re-schedule with Chris.
Elena - did you get the copies of the applications for these guys?
Again, let me know if this works for you ...

Marna
