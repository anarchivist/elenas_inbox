TEXT:
Just to give you the decision reo refreshments for Friday ....
I'm going to order drinks from the Mess, so we don't have to think
about that. But for food, I thought it would be best to just
have us bring snacks to share.  Since we have a number of people
coming, we should have plenty of food if people "doubled up" on
what they bring (e.g., two people could bring one bag of chips).


So get ready to bowl! In case you've forgotten, it's at 6:30pm in
the OEOB bowling alley (in the basement near the Framing Shop) .
