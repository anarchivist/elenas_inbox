TEXT:
I expect Gov. Thompson will want to talk about kids health as well as
welfare because:
         a) he's bringing his health secretary (Joe Leean) as well as his
welfare secretary;
         b) he's been pushing hard for kids health waivers which he sees as
integral to the
                 implementation of W-2, his Wisconsin Works welfare
program.

Thus, I think both Chris and I should attend the meeting.

Jeanne Lambrew is writing up a summary of the kids health situation.

You already have a general 'background memo Andrea wrote about the
Wisconsin Works welfare program (I dropped it off last night) .

lam right now putting together for you a history of Wisconsin's waiver
requests relating to W-2. As you know, we turned down their Medicaid
request and we still have pending their Food Stamp privatization request.

There has also been some tension between the state and locals on the
implementation of the
$3 billion welfare to work grants -- I'm getting more information on that.
