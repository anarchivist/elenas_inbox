TEXT:
As a reminder: we agreed, in theory, in our last Gang of Four that the
President should do an on-the-record interview with Susan Page of USA
Today on Thurs. to run on Friday, May 22 (which reaches 3.3 million
readers since it's available from Friday through Monday, Memorial Day).
Susan would like to talk with the President about tobacco (and I'm sure
other issues). Just fyi.
