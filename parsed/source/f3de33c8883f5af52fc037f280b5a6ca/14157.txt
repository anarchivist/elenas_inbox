You should have everything    I think Matt faxed it over this morning. Please
call (57757 or Matt 57760) if you haven't gotten it. We'd like to wrap this up
pronto.

Matt's note said USDA was OK with the construction as it was but wanted to talk
alternative constructions. At this point I'd rather just stick with what you
and they are OK with.
