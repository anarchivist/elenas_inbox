Following is Gary Black's stock market analysis for tobacco.    He tends
to be pro-tobacco, but his analyses are interesting .....

> FDA Ruling:     Emperor Has No Clothes - Industry Should Just Say No.
> Outperforms.
>
>
>   HIGHLIGHTS
>   1. Tobacco stocks should continue to rally in the aftermath of last
>   week's
>   ruling by a 4th Circuit panel that the FDA cannot regulate tobacco as
>   a
>   drug. We see little chance that the full 4th Circuit will take this
>   case
>   on appeal, although the U.S. Supreme Court may review it in 1999. We
>   see
>   no chance of congress taking up the issue of FDA jurisdiction before
>   it
>   adjourns for the year October 9.
>


> 2. The ruling increases chances of a new settlement between the
> industry
> and the states, since it gives the AGs heavy cover to stand up to the
> public health crowd, who continue to push for ever tougher marketing
> and
> access restrictions. We expect the industry to retain the use of
> humans in
> its advertising, which, by sustaining its brand equities, could offset
> the
> risks of renegade discounting.
>
> 3. The AGs have to be concerned that the wave of pro-tobacco rulings
> that
> have swept the courts over the past several months may liberate state
> judges, who are elected officials, to go against the political tides
> and
> review the merits of the states' cases, which is likely to lead to
> increased dismissals and weakened claims.    This reversal of tobacco
> legal
>   sentiment is analogous to 1986-1987.
>
>   4. While many in the anti-tobacco crowd say the 4th Circuit ruling
>   will
>   prompt Congress to pass narrow legislation that gives the FDA
>   jurisdiction
>   over tobacco, Congress has neither the appetite nor the time left in
>   this
>   session to pass any tobacco legislation once it returns from summer
>   recess.
>   Congress must still pass 13 separate appropriations bills to keep the
>   government running.
>
> 5. The   4th Circuit court's decision was very broad, striking down the
> FDA's
> regulations on three fronts:
> 1) Tobacco does not fit any of the classifications of drugs or devices
> in
> the 1938 Food Drug and Cosmetic Act used by the FDA.  Because tobacco
> is
> not safe or effective, it would have to be removed   from the market -
> which
> is clearly not Congress' intent.
> 2) The court shot down the FDA's argument that the   manufacturers have
> shown
> intent to affect the structure of function of the body -- the core
>   definition of drug in the 1938 FDCA -- in the absence of health
> representations by the manufacturers;
> 3) Congress has had plenty of legislative opportunities to grant    the
> FDA
> authority over tobacco, but has consistently not done so.
>
> 6. On the heels of the FDA defeat, it is no coincidence that the
> Administration is again talking up a federal Medicare recovery action
>   against the industry (potential damages $500 billion) - we presume to
>   pressure the industry to negotiate with the Administration on both FDA
>   jurisdiction and the ongoing DOJ criminal investigations. We believe
>   it
>   would be foolish for the industry to sign a new deal with the AGs
>   unless
>   the states give the industry credits for like payments made to the


>   federal
>   government (same counsel) .
>
>   7. The federal government, unlike the states, cannot claim ignorance
>   about
>   the dangers of tobacco, having published at least a dozen surgeon
>   generals
>   reports on smoking since the first one in 1964, and requiring federal
>   warning labels on packs since 1966. Any claim to recover Medicare
>   expenditures must be filed in federal court, which has shown a
>   penchant for
>   tossing out these claims.
>
>   8. With the litigation tide clearly turning, many investors with whom
> we
>   speak say the industry should end the AG settlement talks - i.e.,
>   finish
>   this war in court. We disagree with this thinking, since the endgame
>   for
>   the industry is to separate tobacco from non-tobacco operations,
>   permitting
>   sum-of-the-parts multiples.  In the absence of a new AG settlement,
>   spin-offs would not be possible; Republicans would not have the cover
>   to
>   simply ignore tobacco, and unpaid plaintiff counsels would file
>   thousands
>   of new claims.
>
>   INVESTMENT CONCLUSIONS
>   We reiterate outperform ratings on Philip Morris (price target $60),
>   RJR
>    ($40), and UST ($40).   While tobacco stocks are not yet responding to
>   what
>   is developing into a tidal wave of favorable exogenous developments,
>   sentiment is likely to change quickly - as it did in 1986-1987 when a
>   series of favorable developments extinguished the second litigation
>   wave.
>   We look for the following:    1)  New attorneys general settlement
>   likely
>   before September 14, when the Washington Medicaid trial is set to
>   begin; 2)
>   the Maryland and Louisiana highest courts should decertify the
>   Richardson
>    (any day) and Scott (Fall) class actions, respectively;; this should
>   persuade investors that the Engle class will also be decertified by
>   the
>   Florida Supreme Court in early-1999;   3) Congress adjourns Ocotober 9,
>   after which all companies are likely to declare it all clear to resume
>   strategies that maximize shareholder returns (MO share repurchase
>   program;
>   UST recapitalization; RJR sale of international tobacco business) .
>   We
>   see only about 5% downside if the new AG settlement falls apart, given
>   our
>   perception that Washington's AG case is particularly weak, and the
>   industry
>   could negotiate an even stronger AG settlement after a win in
>   Washington.

> ADDITIONAL DETAILS


>
>   1. Standing up to public health.    Friday's ruling by a 4th Circuit
>   appellate panel that the FDA could not regulate tobacco as a drug,
>   based on
>   the court's interpretation of the 1938 Food Drug and Cosmetic Act,
>   should
>   give the attorneys general negotiating with the industry broad new
>   cover to
>   stand up to the public health officials clamoring for ever tougher
>   marketing restrictions.     with Congress having already killed
>   legislation
>   that would have implemented the sweeping marketing restrictions found
>   in
>   the June 20 accord, and with the courts now having effectively struck
>   down
>   the less onerous marketing restrictions found in the FDA regulations,
>   the
>   new AG settlement may increasingly be viewed as the last chance for
>   the
>   Administration to secure meaningful access and marketing restrictions
>   from
>   the tobacco industry.    Over the weekend, many in the public health
>   community expressed confidence that Congress would now step in and
>   pass
>   narrow legislation that gives the FDA jurisdiction over tobacco, or
>   that
>   the U.S. Supreme Court would find that the FDA, under the 1984 Chevron
>   ruling that government agencies can assert their
>   Congressionally-mandated
>   powers broadly, will ultimately be allowed to regulate tobacco.      Our
>   perception is that most of the Attorneys General, on the other hand,
>   have
>   come to the realization - as did Senator McCain, albeit too late
>   that
>   the public health community has overplayed its hand, and now
>   represents the
>   single biggest obstacle to tobacco regulation, since it wants tobacco
>   banned, which is not practical.   We believe he 4th Circuit is highly
>   unlikely to hear the FDA case en banc (by all 14 members, which
>   collectively are known as one of the most conservative circuits in the
>   country).    We point out that the panel's decision does not conflict
>   with
>   other panels in that circuit, or with U.S. Supreme Court precedent.
>   Appellate courts are also highly unlikely to sit en banc in cases
>   where the
>   U.S. Supreme Court is likely to step in, as it is here.
>
> With the demise   of the FDA regulations, the attorney generals in the
> 46
> states who have   not settled now face the grim reality that the best
> they
> can do in terms   of marketing restrictions is the Minnesota settlement
> -
> elimination of billboards and transit signs, complete ban on branded
> merchandise, ban on product placements in films - plus anything that
> the
> industry is willing to concede at this late stage to get a deal
> embraced by
> 40 or more states.   Our sources say that the two restrictions that
> the AGs


> are pushing for, and at which the industry is presently balking, are a
> national ban on sponsorships, and the elimination of cartoons and
>   people in
>   advertising.    If the industry gets its other conditions - money at
>   $190
>   billion ($230 billion including the four states that have already
>   settled);
>   renegade provisions with teeth (payments that are adjusted for
>   discount
>   volume taken by non-signatories as well as the base volume
>   adjustment);
>   credits if payments result from local or federal government actions
>   against
>   the industry - we believe the industry would agree to concede brand
>   sponsorships.   Since no brand uses cartoons in its ads anymore, the
>   industry would likely cede this marketing restriction as well.
>   Getting rid
>   of people in ads is another story, however, since the brand equities
>   of
>   Marlboro, Newport, Virginia Slims, Kool, Doral, and other brands
>   would, in
>   the long-term, suffer more if people were banned in ads than they
>   would if
>   adequate renegade provisions were not secured.   We also believe it
>   would
>   be prudent to hold onto this and other huge marketing bargaining chip
>   in
>   case the Administration decides to take a leadership role in passing
>   new
>   tobacco legislation next year.
>
>   Public health officials continue to push the AGs toward demanding no
>   less
>   than the marketing restrictions found in the FDA regulations, which
>   would
>   include, in addition to the Minnesota restrictions, no sponsorships,
>   no
>   in-store signage except black and white ads; only black & white ads in
>   magazines where the youth readership is more than 15%; no continuity
>   programs (premium merchandise for proofs of purchase), no self-service
>   displays, and no vending machines except in adult only locations.
>   Some
>   public health officials have instructed the AGs to demand provisions
>   that
>   the manufactures wouldn't sell cigarettes to wholesalers who supply
>   retailers who continue to allow self-service; although this too cannot
>   work
>   in practice, since manufacturers can't always track which wholesalers
>   a
>   retailer is buying from.     These demands likely went out the window
>   with
>   Friday's ruling.
>
>   2. Administration's threats to file Medicare claim: More smoke than
>   fire.
>   The Administration again is dropping hints that it is considering a
>   claim
>   against the industry for recovery of federal Medicare, Medicaid, and
>   Veterans' moneys paid on behalf of sick smokers.   The rumors over the
>   weekend were that damages sought could total $500 billion.   Once


>   again, we
>   suggest that this is a thinly-disguised threat to get the industry to
>   negotiate with the Administration on FDA jurisdiction and the ongoing
>   DOJ
>   criminal probe, which continues to move at a snail's pace.  In return
>   for
>   no federal economic recovery claim, and a nominal settlement on the
>   criminal charges, the industry would agree to drop its lawsuit against
>   the
>   FDA, which now moves to the appeals stage.
>
>    In theory, the United States government can sue to recover
>   Medicare
>   expenses under 42 USC 52651 - otherwise known as the Federal Medical
>   Care
>   Recovery Act of 1962. According to 42 USC 5 2651, in any case where
>   the
>   U.S. furnishes medical care "under circumstances creating a tort
>   liability
>   upon some third person to pay damages, Sthe United States shall have a
>   right to recover from said third person the reasonable value of the
>   care
>   and treatment." Cases interpreting that law have said that the United
>   States has an independent right to recover the costs of treating a
>   sick
>   person if the illness is attributable to a third party's negligence,
>   and
>   the government would not be subject to defenses that the tort feasor
>   might
>   have used against the injured party.
>    The statute goes on to explain that the United States' right to
>   recover shall be subrogated to any right or claim that the injured or
>   diseased person has against the tort feasor to the extent of the
>   reasonable
>   value of the care and treatment. Federal cases interpreting 42 USC 5
>   2651
>   say the United States government has three ways for recovering medical
>   and
>   hospital care:   (1) by subrogation; (2) by intervening or joining in
>   any
>   action brought by an injured person; and (3) by instituting such
>   action
>   itself or in conjunction with the injured person.    Another case says:
> I1In
> construing    the Medical Care Recovery Act, the Courts have uniformly
>   held
>   that the united States is not merely subrogated to the injured party's
>   claim, but has an independent cause of action under the Act."    In
>   that
>   case, a woman suffered injuries while riding as a passenger in a car
>   driven
>   by her husband. Under the law of Arkansas, where the accident
>   happened, a
>   passenger cannot sue the driver of the car in which she was riding.
>   But
>   the United States was allowed to sue the husband because the court
>   found
>   that the united States was not subrogated to the wife's claim.
>
>     Other cases explain that when the United States pays a victim'S


>   medical expenses, the injured person is not entitled to recover the
> amount
> of those expenses from the tort feasor - only the United States has the
> right to recover that money.  The purpose of 42 USC 5 2651 was to
>   prevent
> injured people from double recovery - once from the government and
> once
> from the tortfeasor.  One federal case focused on this issue,
>   ultimately
>   finding:   "42 USC 5 2651 is clear - the Federal Medical Care Recovery
>   Act
>   gives the United States an absolute, direct right of action to recover
>   the
>   reasonable value of medical expenses provided by law to anyone injured
>   through the tortious conduct of a third party."
>
>      We believe it will be far more difficult for the federal
>   government
>   than the states to succeed in their claims for recovery of expenses
>   for
>   tobacco injuries.   Unlike the states, the federal government has a
>   long
>   paper trail of documents showing awareness to the dangers of tobacco
>    (1964
>   Surgeon General's Report and everyone since then; federal warnings
>   labels
>   on packs of cigarettes since 1966). Moreover, any claim filed by the
>   Department of Justice on behalf of the federal government would have
>   to be
>   filed in federal court, which has demonstrated a penchant for tossing
>   these
>   type claims out.  Over the past nine months, five separate federal
>   courts,
>   most recently in Oregon (others in PA, CA, FL, and MD) have thrown out
>   union health care recovery actions brought against the tobacco
>   industry.
