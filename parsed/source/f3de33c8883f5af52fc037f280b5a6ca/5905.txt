TEXT:
Barbara Chow says she's trying to get in to see Frank to show him a
version of the budget description she wants us to review.  She decided to
do one version instead of two to move closer to us and says she's going to
try to sell Frank on language that does not take a position.  Bottom line,
though, is that we don't have language yet.

We are closer to having a substitute $300 million saver, though -- there
are discussions back and forth between HHS and OMB about the savings
estimates for HHS' proposal to require mandatory, rather than optional,
review of child support orders every three years.

Elena's response was:

we should see their paper first; that seems the courteous thing to do.

Subject:         Raines reaction re: yesterday's. child support budget meeting

I spoke to Barbara Chow, who said Raines asked her to draft two versions
of the budget description:

Version #1: expressing concerns about the problem and expressing a desire
to work on it (the version we were urging yesterday);
Version #2: outlining in general terms the modified proposal we discussed
yesterday, that would let states keep all child support collections in
exchange for a lower match (the version Raines still prefers) .

I told her that since the President's senior advisors still seem to
disagree, that it appears we will have to bring them together to discuss
and decide whether we need to send a memo to the President for him to
decide.

Shall I go ahead and set up a Raines-Reed-Sperling meeting? OMB would of
course rather have us wait until we see their paper (I made Chow promise
we'd have it no later than first thing tomorrow morning) .

On a related issue, I expect to have paper shortly from HHS on their
proposed substitute $300 million saver.   Very generally, I understand the
proposal would a) require mandatory, rather than optional, review of
child support orders every three years, which would result in more
frequently updated child support orders, more collections for families as
well as the federal government; and b) would revise a "hold harmless"
provision related to child support incentive payments, which is garnering
some states more than expected.
