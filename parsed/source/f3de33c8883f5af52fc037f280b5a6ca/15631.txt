TEXT:
I just found out about a key conference call right now on FLSA.
Unfortunately, I had already scheduled a major conference call at the same
time on means tested benefits where I am pretty indispensable.  I am
trying to juggle the two, but I can't manage this when Kitty keeps calling
conference calls that I am not notified of that give everyone their
marching orders.
