                       Questions and Answers on Welfare Reform
                                    March 10, 1998


Q:   Recent state studies, such as those cited today in USA Today, show that about half
     of former welfare recipients are finding jobs. Do you consider that a success?

A:   Not enough time has passed for full scale research studies to be completed to tell us why
     welfare recipients leave the rolls or how they are doing when they do. However, early
     research from a number of states provides a helpful snapshot. These preliminary studies
     are generally encouraging. More people are going to work. On average, most states are
     finding that slightly over half of their former welfare recipients are working after leaving
     the rolls--combined with record case load declines, this means that a higher absolute
     number of recipients are going to work than in the past. Historically, people have left the
     rolls for a variety of reasons other than work, such as change in family circumstances,
     and these factors also continue to playa part.

     To help the growing number of people leaving welfare for work, the President's FY 99
     budget contains expanded funding for .child care, as well as continued tax credits for
     employers, and welfare-to-work housing vouchers. That is also why we are pushing for
     a $100 million a year welfare-to-work transportation initiative as part of ISTEA
     reauthorization. Finally, the Department of Labor is beginning to award the $3 billion
     Welfare-to-Work grants included in the 1997 Balanced Budget Act to states and
     communities to help move long term welfare recipients into lasting, unsubsidized jobs.

Q:   Are welfare caseload declines stilI the best indicator of success?

A:   Welfare caseloads continue to be a key measure of the success of welfare reform, and the
     only nationally available measure. As I announced in the State of the Union, we've
     met -- two years ahead of schedule -- the challenge I made in last year's State of the
     Union to move two million more Americans off of welfare by the year 2000. The
     most recent caseload numbers show that welfare caseloads fell by 4.3 million since I
     took office -- a drop of 30 percent.

     I asked my Council of Economic Advisors to look at the role of the economy in reducing
     the welfare rolls, and last May they attributed about 40 percent of the decline to the strong
     economic growth, about one-third to the welfare reform waivers we granted, and the rest
     to other factors -- such as our decisions to increase the Earned Income Tax Credit,
     strengthen child support enforcement, and increase funding for·child care.

     The new high performance bonus will focus on other important measures of success by
     rewarding states who do the best job of placing welfare recipients into jobs and helping
     them succeed in the work place. HHS will shortly release formal guidelines to the states
     that defines how this $200 million a year bonus will be awarded.




    Q:   There have recently been some reports of growing lines at food pantries. Do you
         think this is due to welfare reform?

    A:   We are always concerned about any report that hunger may be increasing, and we will
         continue to monitor the situation closely. I do believe that this Administration's
         economic policies -- which produced an unemployment rate at its lowest level in a
         generation and reduced the poverty rate from 15.1 percent in 1993 to 13.7 percent in 1996
         -- have gone a long way to help American families make ends meet.

         One reason for a possible increase in hunger is the fact that the welfare reform law
         contained cuts to legal immigrants that had nothing to do with the real goal of welfare
         reform, which is to move people from welfare to work. Last year in the Balanced Budget
         Act we were able to restore SSI and Medicaid for legal immigrants, and we should
         finish the job this year. That's why the President's FY 99 budget provides $2.5 billion to
         restore food stamps to all legal immigrant families with children, elderly and disabled
         immigrants who entered the U.S. before August 1996, and certain refugees, asylees, and
         special immigrant groups like the Hmong who fought alongside our soldiers in Vietnam.

    Q:   Even with the good economy, some people are concerned that there won't be enough
         jobs for all the welfare recipients who need work. Are you concerned about this
         issue?

    A:   Right now, the nation's jobless rate is at its lowest level in a generation. We've created
         more than 14 million jobs since the President took office. Nationally, we are creating
         enough jobs for individuals leaving welfare -- for example, the economy created 310,000
         new jobs in February, far more than the number of adults who leave welfare each month.

         But to make sure there will be enough jobs in every area of the country, the President
         fought for and won a $3 billion welfare-to-work fund in the Balanced Budget Act targeted
         specifically to high unemployment and high poverty areas where jobs may be scarce. He
         has also challenged companies all across the nation to hire welfare recipients -- more than
         3,000 have agreed so far -- and has committed the federal government to hire its fair share
         of workers from the welfare rolls.
