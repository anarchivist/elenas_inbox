TEXT:
There is a Native American component to two of the initiatives which are
not mentioned in the paragraphs:

1. Under "Recruiting Outstanding New Teachers for Our Nation's Public
Schools,"  there is also a new initiative that funds 1000 new Native
American teachers who will teach in areas of high concentrations of Native
Americans.

2.   Under "Modern School Buildings to Improve Student Learning,"  there
is also a component that allows tribes and tribal organizations to issue
bonds to build and renovate BIA-funded schools.
