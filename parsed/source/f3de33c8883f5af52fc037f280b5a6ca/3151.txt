Workforce committee reported out HR 1853, which would reauthorize the Carl D. Perkins
Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act. Committee Democrats opposed the bill
largely because it would hurt urban areas through changes in the substate funding formula, a
reduction in the minimum grant size for local school districts and postsecondary institutions, and
the option for states to create a 10% set-aside for rural areas. In addition, many Democrats, led
by Rep. Mink, objected to ending sex-equity set-asides (although the Administration proposal
would do this, as well).

Aside from the funding formula issue, the Department of Education has expressed several other
concerns with the bill. In particular, HR 1853 has very weak accountability provisions. It
would severely limit the Secretary's ability to make judgments about the quality of state funding
applications and would give the Secretary no role in developing state program performance
indicators or benchmarks.

We expect there to be continuing negotiations over provisions of the bill before it reaches the
floor, particularly because it is highly unlikely that there are enough Republican votes to pass it.

California Teacher Testing Litigation: The EEOC, Justice Department, and Education
Department are considering whether the EEOC should file an appeal in a case involving basic
skills testing of teachers. The Association of Mexican-Arnerican Educators and other
California-based civil rights groups challenged the California Basic Education Skills Test
(CBEST) in trial court, on the grounds that this employment test had a disparate impact on
Latinos, African Americans and Asian Americans, lacked validity, and therefore violated Title
VII of the Civil Rights Act. The court ruled against the plaintiffs, arguing that while there were
different pass rates for different groups, the test was job related and adequately validated, and
therefore permissible.

Though the EEOC did not participate in the trial stage, it believes that it should participate in an
appeal because, in its view, the court made serious procedural errors in determining that the test
is valid. According to the EEOC, these errors, if left uncorrected, would be a serious setback for
Title VII enforcement. The Education Department is opposed to appealing the verdict on the
grounds that the procedural errors were minor and, if corrected, would still show the test to be
valid. The Education Department is also concerned that an appeal in this case would undermine
the Administration's strong support for higher standards and tests for both students and teachers
by creating the public perception that the it opposes testing to ensure that prospective teachers
have basic skills in reading, writing and math.

National civil rights groups, including the Leadership Conference for Civil Rights and the
NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund are strongly urging the Administration to file a brief
supporting the plaintiffs appeal. They view the procedural issues as highly significant and
setting a precedent which will affect Title VII enforcement in other areas. They have made clear
that they view this case as a test of the Administration's willingness to enforce civil rights laws in
testing cases, and have implied that our action in this case will affect their stance on your
national testing initiative.

                                                                            Hex-Dump Conversion




     At a meeting this week with EEOC, Education, Justice, White House Counsel and DPC staff,
     Wade Henderson and his colleagues from the civil rights community suggested a possible
     compromise position. They proposed that we work to develop a brief that would strongly
     underscore our policy views in favor of higher standards and testing, limit the challenge to the
     court's decision to relatively narrow issues, and oppose only earlier versions of CBEST while not
     challenging the test currently in use. Representatives of all of agencies believe this was a good
     faith effort to assist the Administration in honoring its commitments to civil rights and to
     education standards, and are working to outline such a brief. However, the same representatives
     were unsure as to whether such a brief would be legally defensible, strategically wise, or would
     satisfy any of the competing values in this case. This determination will be made once the
     proposed outline is developed and reviewed. We expect to continue to consult with the civil
     rights groups before any final determination is made.               .
