 TEXT:
 According to one of my secret sources, in Guatamala, a must-do is the
 volcano Pacaya located two hours drive from Antigua. It is at its most
 active in the past 10 years and the US$5 tour from Antigua is apparently
 fantastic. You leave at 2pm and return by 10pm. To see molten lava flying
 through the air at night from 100 yards is like nothing else, according to
 those who have taken the risk.  (Definitely not a tour that would be
 offered in the USA!)  Finca Ixabel on the road to Tikal is also supposed
 to be good. It's a farm run by an American woman whose husband was
 murdered by the army a few years ago and it is a great place to relax with
 her two spider monkeys and parrot. The food is unreal and it offers
 several comfortable places to hang out.

 According to another of my secret sources, information for today's Daily
 Report must be submitted by 4:00 pm.
