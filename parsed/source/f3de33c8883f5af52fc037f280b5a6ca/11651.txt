TEXT:
The Clay-Wu class size amendment will not be offered to the House ed-flex
bill.    Apparently, the House Democrats
1) ran out of time in the debate, and -- according to the Education Dept
leg affairs --
2) may have been concerned that a second-degree amendment on IDEA would
have been difficult to oppose.
Two votes remain in the House tomorrow morning -- 1 on the Scott amendment
on Title I schoolwides and 1 on final passage.

Meanwhile, the Senate will vote on the 10 amendments we already knew
about.  The Education Department's counsel's office thinks the
IDEA/discipline amendment may be consistent with the our IDEA regulation,
and they will get back to us in the morning.
