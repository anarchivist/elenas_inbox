TEXT:
Donna Shalala has scheduled a meeting with Erskine Bowles sometime on
Friday to advise us how the Department plans to respond to the likely
defection of managed care plans from the Medicare program. Nancy Ann
advised us today that they have just received reports that numerous plans
are contemplating announcing early next week (prior to the October 1
deadline of intent of participation) that they will cease to participate
in the Medicare program in a number of markets around the country.

HCFA believes that the number of beneficiaries currently served by these
plans who could be dropped could be as high as 300,000 to 500,000 of the
6-7 million Medicare beneficiaries now enrolled in HMOs.  The plans will
blame inadequate reimbursement rates and excessive regulation, and will
calIon the Congress and the Administration to delay implementation of
BBA and the regs that implement it.

By all accounts (of independent, credible sources), the claims by the HMOs
are highly exaggerated and appear to be taking place primarily because of
continuing private sector pressures to limit increases.   (In other words,
the plans have become used to overpayments by Medicare to offset
potentially excessively low private reimbursement rates.)   Regardless,
this issue has the potential to get a great deal of coverage and we need
to prepare an adequate response.
