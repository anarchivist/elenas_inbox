Subject: Additional notes from POTUS comments

In a conversation with the advisory board members on the return trip, the
President said he wanted staff to start right away collecting a compendium
of "best practices" (not his phrase), and that he wanted 'that list to be
made available on the web site. He also wanted the web site to be
configured so individuals who have ideas to submit could add them to the
web site.

He also said we need to determine quickly what scientific research need to
be conducted and get it underway. He said the media responded positively
when he broached this topic and the university officials (including
representatives of the National Science Foundation) already had offered
their services.  The President posed one possible topic for study: How
the lack of diversity affects white Americans.

I don't know what is possible or what is already in the works, but I
thought you should know about his ideas.
