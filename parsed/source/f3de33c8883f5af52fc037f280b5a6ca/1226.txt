TEXT:
Yes. Some. The industry was quite frustrated with our position last year;
they felt that there was a legitimate.compromise that could have moved
separate and apart from the product liability bill.  They thought we were
the one, real big hang up. However, I never pushed very hard or got too
much involved because I didn't see any hope in legislation moving.  I am
sure there were numerous reasons why Bruce (and perhaps you?) did not want
this to move.

I do think there' is a chance this year for something constructive to
emerge this year, which might be good a reasonable compromise and also
good for the President. The industry really wants something and may be
willing to give more in this round.   Specifics are always the problem and,
if you want, I can update my memory banks.   I can tell you now, however,
that I would have to do that in order to be of anY'real assistance to
you.
