SSupreme Court justice won't block release of tobacco documents

    WASHINGTON (AP)   A Supreme Court justice today refused to spare
the nation's cigarette makers from having to release some 39,000
secret documents in a closely watched Minnesota trial.
    Justice Clarence Thomas rejected the tobacco industry's bid to
postpone indefinitely the effect of a Minnesota judge's order
requiring release of the documents.
    But Thomas' brief order will not require immediate surrender of
the documents. He extended a temporary postponement he had granted
Wednesday to 5 p.m. (EST) Monday.
    Tobacco industry lawyers are free to seek help from any of the
Supreme Court's eight other members by resubmitting their claims
that "tens of thousands"   of the documents are privileged
information that should stay secret.
    Minnesota and Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota are suing
cigarette makers to recover $1.77 billion they say they spent to
treat smoking-related illnesses. Lawyers for the state and health
insurers say some of the sought-after documents may be the most
significant to their case.
    Tobacco industry lawyers said release of the documents would
harm their clients in the Minnesota case and also in "hundreds of
other pending cases."
