TEXT:
I've followed up with Rep. Waters' staff, Katherine Atkins, to tell her
that we would very much like to meet with her to discuss grandparents.

To remind Jen of the genesis of this issue, Waters has a bill to exempt
grandparents who take care of kids on welfare from the welfare law's work
requirements.  HHS has told her (nicely) that we can't support that, and
that we think the law has sufficient flexibility to take this population
into consideration. However, her staff has now asked if we are interested
in discussing other approaches or initiatives to supporting this group,
and Elena asked me to send back a very clear "yes" signal to her, which I
have done.

Unfortunately, Rep. Waters would really like the meeting to be next week,
ideally Tuesday or Thursday. We need to decide which of us should go,
both from DPC and from HHS.  I am assuming we need you or Nicole, Jen, to
be there to talk about the issue.  I asked Atkins what agenda she
envisions for the meeting -- she said she'd like to discuss what areas we
have identified as needing work, and what initiatives we may be
undertaking. She said perhaps we would undertake some activities together.

Please let me know your thoughts on who should attend.   Elena, do you want
to try to come? We need to start setting this up on Friday, either by
Laura or by our new support person, Linda Cooper. From HHS, is it still
Carol Williams? Elena, I assume you would be anxious to make this work
for Waters at the time she wants.   (I'm out next week, so I'd like to get
this set.)
