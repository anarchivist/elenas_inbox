                          Recent Administration Actions on Service

The National Service Scholars Program: President Clinton announced today in his weekly
radio address that more than 1,600 high school students have won scholarships of at least $1,000
in the first year of the National Service Scholars Program_ The college scholarships recognize
outstanding community service.

The President proposed the program last year in an address at Penn State University, challenging
communities to raise at least $500 for their local high schools, which the federal government
would then match. High school principals nominate the junior or senior with a strong
commitment to community service to receive scholarships.

The $500 federal match is provided by the Corporation for National Service, which launched the
program this spring in partnership with the Citizens' Scholarship Foundation of America. The
deadline to apply for the program was June 30, and 1,683 high schools submitted nominees.
Awards will be sent to scholarship winners in early August.

The program has proved extremely popular, with a host ofleading community organizations
stepping forward to raise local scholarships and secure the federal match. The most frequent
local
contributors include: Kiwanis, Rotary, Lions, Dollars for Scholars, Seventh Day Adventists,
Veterans of Foreign Wars, the American Legion, Elks, Women's Clubs, the Masons,
Soroptomists, Junior Leagues, Optimists, Jaycees, Quota International, Sertoma, Parent Teacher
Associations, and Chambers of Commerce. The Miss America Foundation committed to
providing matching scholarships in every state; Sallie Mae provided the matching funds for every
public high school in the District of Columbia; and the Minnesota state legislature voted to fund
the match for all high schools in that state.

When he announced the initiative at Penn State, President Clinton said, "I want every principal in
America to be able to stand up before a graduating class and announce the name of a National
Service Scholar. We should make service to the community a part of every high school in
America and a part oflife of every dedicated citizen in the United States." Noting the success of
the first year effort, the President today challenged schools and communities to award
scholarships to many more students next year, with the goal of instituting the program in all high
schools. The President: s FY 1998 budget includes $10 million for the National Service Scholars
Program, enough to take the program nation-wide.

AmeriCorps Scholarships: The President also announced that service and religious
organizations have responded positively to his summit challenge that the Administration
would provide 50,000 new AmeriCorps scholarships over the next 5 years to organizations
that offer young people the chance to serve. The response has been even stronger than
expected, as 77 organizations have answered that challenge by offering to sponsor 10,000
new AmeriCorps members. The Corporation expects to make the first year's awards this
summer.
                                                                        Hex·Dump Conversion

Other Recent Actions: The Administration continues to use partnerships and Citizen servicelo
reach its key policy goals. For example, in May, the Vice President announced a new
partnership of civic organizations that will mentor families seeking to leave welfare for
work. Also in May, the Welfare to Work Partnership annonnced an expansion of its
efforts to mobilize businesses to hire welfare recipients, so those parents can move into the
economic mainstream and improve their children's future. In June, the President
announced that Kaiser Permanente will commit $100 million to provide health coverage for
uninsured children in California, complementing the Administration's efforts to enact new
legislation on children's health coverage.

In addition, Federal agencies are following through on the more than 40 commitments they made
at the Philadelphia summit, including mentoring, tutoring, and launching new partnerships with
corporations and nonprofits. Among other progress, the Corporation for National Service is
taking the lead to meet the Summit's goal of engaging an additional 2 million young people in
community service. In June, HHS Secretary Shalala launched a new partnership with the Girl
Scouts, to teach girls about the dangers of substance abuse and other risky behaviors, featuring a
new patch that Girl Scouts can earn by completing the program. In September, Agriculture
Secretary Dan Glickman will convene a National Summit on Food Recovery, to develop a
national strategy to increase gleaning efforts by one-third by the year 2000. In May, the
Department of Justice convened a new public/private Mentoring Alliance to promote the
Summit's mentoring goal, disseminate information about best practices, and determine how best
to link volunteers with the children who need them.
