TEXT:
I gave you each hard copies of my edits of the the welfare to work draft
state guidance this morning -- please let me know of any comments you have
(I need to report in about 5:00pm)

One new bit of news -- Haskins is flexible as to whether the match is
in-kind or cash. The Secretary of Labor wants to provide as much
flexibility as possible to the state and locals in what counts as match.
ThUS, they want to increase the pecentage of match from one-third in the
draft you have to one-half. My concern is that more in-kind match will
encourage more job prep programs and less subsidizing of real jobs.   I
think we should stick to one-third and if states persuade us they won't
participate in the program unless it's raised, then we raise it to
one-half.
