TEXT:
The drug paragraph is perfect    but I have one suggestion.   I would
recommend that we add the PSA    campaign to it.  I think we will get some
play 9ut of it, especially if    we are challenging the media. Right after
the sentence that ends "steer    young people away; " add:

        "We have a responsibility to send a consistent anti-drug message
to our children. My drug budget provides for a national media campaign so
that our children hear that message again and again.   I have a challenge
to the media --- for every ad we show, match it with another.  Turn up the
volume.

           Now let me say a word directly to you, our children ........ "


           I have another call into Kent      on the triggerlock and Brady.
