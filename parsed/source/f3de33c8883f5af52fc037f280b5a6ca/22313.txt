TEXT:
I just received a call from the VP's office.  They want to know if the VP
can preview some of the civil rights enforcement increases that are in the
budget at a Monday event (speech at the MLK library in D.C.).  I am not
sure of the status of its inclusion in the SOTU and, if it is not
included, whether you thought this would be a good idea.
