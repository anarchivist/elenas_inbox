AMENDMENTS PUT HEAD START A
               STEP BEHIND

By Sue Kirchhoff, CQ Staff Writer

Aug. OS, 1998 - House Education and the workforce
Committee Chairman Bill Goodling, R-Pa., said yesterday he
plans to jettison the Head Start reauthorization bill (HR4241)
marked up by his panel July 29 and instead try to bring a
stripped-down version to the floor under suspension of the rules
later this week.

The committee adopted amendments by Rep. Frank Riggs,
R-Calif., that would bar children from the program unless their
mothers cooperated in establishing paternity and would create a
limited program of vouchers that could be used to purchase
alternative child care. Committee Democrats voted against the
bill, angry about the changes and a third provision that would
eliminate the use of the Davis-Bacon prevailing wage law on
Head Start construction projects.

Goodling said in an interview that the unusual step of bringing a
substitute bill to the floor was necessary to avoid a drawn-out
fight over the preschool program, which has had broad
bipartisan support since its creation in 1965.

"What I want is to find a way to make sure that my whole
emphasis, which is on quality (in the Head Start program), is not
lost in this whole debate," Goodling said. He said that he wanted
to get a bill passed on the suspension calendar before the
coming August recess. The Senate passed its version of the bill
(S2206) by voice vote on July 27.

Goodling had introduced a substitute in committee that did not
have the paternity or voucher requirements. He said he could
take that substitute to the floor or simply bring up another
measure (HR4271) marked up by the committee to reauthorize


the Community services Block Grant and low-income heating
assistance program. The Senate combined those two programs
and Head Start in one bill, meaning the two chambers could be
able to conference on Head Start even if that program did not
pass the House.

Riggs, however, said he did not favor Goodling's strategy. "I
have not signed off on any such plan and find it hard to believe
that we would arbitrarily and unilaterally override the will of the
committee, particularly on provisions ... supported by almost all
Republicans."
