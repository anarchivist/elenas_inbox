TEXT:
We've resolved remaining issues on the proposed rule on "Methodology for
Determining Whether an Increase in a State's Child Poverty Rate Is the
Result of the TANF Program".   The rule is going to federal register
tomorrow and should be published early next week. This means it will
either be published, or at least at the Fed Register, by 9/24 when Census
releases its new CPS poverty numbers. ACF reluctantly agreed to drop the
section about widely disseminating state child poverty rates in the
context of this rule. However, I'm sure they will still want to make sure
this state-level data from the Census Bureau gets disseminated for
purposes of highlighting general trends in child poverty.
