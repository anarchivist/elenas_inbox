TEXT:
In response to my note about this possible Presidential memorandum, Elena
asked why we don't just have OPM tell all the agencies what they can and
should do, instead of asking each agency to examine their practices.    The
most obvious reason is that we are not asking agencies to break new policy
ground here, but simply to examine their practices and measure them
against the flexibility that the law and regs permit them. The hope is
that we will help some agencies to see that they are not taking full advant
age of what they could do. And OPM would issue guidance to agencies a few
days after the presidential memorandum goes out, so that agencies would
have the benefit of that during their review.

A second issue is that there are a few agencies with a somewhat aggressive
interpretation of federal rules and they allow employees to volunteer a
fair amount on agency time. OPM says that is OK in limited circumstances
(related to agency mission, doesn't take away from duties), but they are
reluctant to directly second guess agency decisions in these ca~es.  On
the other hand, they are nervous about remaining silent if these agencies
have not carefully considered their policies. So they would like to age
ncies to either justify their practices, or else reconsider them. But
this does raise the question of how close we want to get to this.

If we decide not to do the memorandum, then OPM would still certainly
issue its guidance.
