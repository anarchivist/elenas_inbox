D-R-A-F-T

TO:         Thurgood Marshall, Jr.

FROM:       John Gomperts

DATE:       January 6, 1999

REQUEST: President Clinton's participation in kick-off of AmeriCorps'       "Call
to Service" recruitment campaign.

PURPOSE:   To celebrate the success of       the President's national service
program by focusing national attention       on AmeriCorps passing its 100,000
member milestone and to kick-off "Call       to Service" - a national recruitment
campaign designed to ensure AmeriCorps       reaches its' 200,000 member mark by
the end of 2000.

BACKGROUND:   President·Clinton created AmeriCorps, the domestic Peace
Corps,
in 1993.  Since then, more than 100,000 Americans have participated in
AmeriCorps - a tremendous achievement for the President and for the
national
service movement.  (N.B. It took the Peace Corps more than two decades to


 reach the 100,000-member mark.)

 To call attention to the success of AmeriCorps and to enhance our
 recruiting
 efforts, we are launching a  "Call to Service" - a national recruitment
 drive
 to ensure AmeriCorps reaches 200,000 members by the end of 2000. This
 campaign includes a new television PSA produced by MTV, print advertising,
 a
 direct mail appeal to college seniors by former AmeriCorps members, as well
 as a number of campus-based and other recruiting events throughout the
 spring
 and summer.

For the February kick-off event, the President could swear in 100
AmeriCorps
members who are serving locally as well as several members from the first
AmeriCorps class to represent the more than 100,000 who have served since
1994. The event would also include the unveiling of the new MTV AmeriCorps
PSA.

PREVIOUS PARTICIPATION: Since his 1992 campaign, the President has
participated in number of high-profile AmeriCorps and national service
events
including the bill signing and the original AmeriCorps launch. Most
recently
the President served with AmeriCorps members on the Martin Luther King Day
of
Service in January 1998 and spoke to the City Year AmeriCorps Convention on
Idealism in Cleveland in June 1998. He was scheduled to participate in an
event marking AmeriCorps' 100,000th member on October 23, 1998, which was
canceled due to the signing of the Wye Plantation Peace Accord.

DATE/TIME:   Week of February 8, 1999

DURATION:      One to one and a half-hours

LOCATION:   Our recommended site is Georgetown University, the President's
alma mater and site of one of his "new covenant" speeches in which he spoke
eloquently about the ethic of service. A college campus with an audience
of
young people is a excellent setting for the President to deliver a "call to
service" campaign asking young people to give a year of service to their
country. Alternatively, the event could be held in East Room as originally
planned.  The White House venue has the advantage of being convenient, but
is
less appropriate for our recruitment message.

PARTICIPANTS:   The President, Harris Wofford, selected Members of
Congress,
Administration officials including especially Mark Gearan, current and past
AmeriCorps members.

REMARKS REQUIRED:   Yes.  Major speech on national service, in the vein of
the President's campaign speech at Notre Dame in September 1992, his speech
at Rutgers unveiling the plan for AmeriCorps in 1993, and his speech at the
City Year/AmeriCorps conference in Cleveland in June 1997. Also lead the
AmeriCorps members, and others, in reciting the AmeriCorps pledge, as he·
did
in Cleveland.



MEDIA COVERAGE:  National media.   Regional possibilities depending on
involvement of AmeriCorps members. Also, possibilities for strong focus on
college press.

PROPOSED ATTENDANCE: If at Georgetown University, a large student audience,
and leaders of the non-profit community.  If at the White House, AmeriCorps
members and the leadership of major non-profit organizations.

RECOMMENDED BY:              Harris Wofford
