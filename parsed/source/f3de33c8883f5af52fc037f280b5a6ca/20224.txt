TEXT:
I wanted to review the bidding on options for a health care event for next
Monday and see if we could use Ann's 5 pm meeting on the crime events to
reach a consensus on how to proceed.   If that doesn't work -- let's
discuss in Thursday's Podesta meeting.

Since Helen Hunt is not an option -- here's what I understand the
alternatives to be:

Tobacco:                Have the President talk about tobacco to the Presidential


                            Scholars (1400 high school students") who will be
    at the WH                       Monday afternoon.

    Medicare:               Announce that testing for osteoporosis, diabetes, etc. will
                            be covered effective July 1. (Other options for
    this                            announcement include doing at Family
    Conference, or                          have VP do while POTUS is
    in China) .

    Health Insurance:       Possible announcement re: portability.

    Please let me know if there's anything I'm missing.

    Reactions?

    Thanks, all.
