PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
OPENING REMARKS


AT THE WHITE HOUSE STRATEGY SESSION
ON CHILDREN, VIOLENCE AND RESPONSIBILITY
THE EAST ROOM
May 10, 1999

         I want to welcome all of you here to the White House, and to thank
you for coming to our Strategy Session on Children, Violence, and
Responsibility. This is a diverse and impressive group. Among you are
parents and children, teachers and religious leaders, government
officials, law enforcement, gun manufacturers, and representatives of the
entertainment industry.   I have brought together so many sectors of
society for a simple reason: because there is nothing more important than
the safety of our children. Any discussion starts with that premise, and
proceeds from there.

        Let me   just say a few brief words before we begin. As you know, I
announced last   Friday that we would launch a National Campaign to Reduce
Youth Violence   -- a grass-"roots effort to involve all Americans, from the
White House to   the smallest community, in protecting our children from
violence. The    discussion we have here will help lay the groundwork for
that campaign.

        In that spirit, we wonD,t be asking who takes the blame, but who
takes responsibility.  And simply by being here today, you~ ,ve given us an
answer: youD,ve said, weD,re all in this together.  Of course, we ,re not
going to agree on everything.  Surely, weD,11 challenge each othern,s views;
but also, by challenging our own, I believe we will find the common ground
on which to move forward and find solutions.

        I want to be sure that the government continues to do its part.
Today, I am directing the Surgeon General to conduct a ground-breaking
study -- the first report in more than a decade on youth violence and its
causes.

        But you know that government cannot do it alone. And already,
even before we sat down here today, some of you stepped forward and began
to step up to your responsibility.  I am pleased, first of all, that the
gun manufacturers here today have issued a statement of support -- not
only for our National Campaign to Reduce Youth Violence, but also for most
of the provisions of the gun legislation I introduced two weeks ago.   That
legislation, which is currently before the Congress, would ban violent
juveniles from buying guns for life; raise the age for handgun ownership
from 18 to 21; close the gun show loophole; and help US better trace
weapons that find their way into young hands.   These are common-sense
proposals, and now they are common ground with the gun manufacturers
willing to step up to their responsibility.

        Others have agreed to do their part. By July, the V-Chip will be
in half of all new television sets sold. A new study by the Kaiser Family
Foundation shows that around three-quarters of all parents want this tool
to block violent programming from their homes.   But the study also shows
that too many parents -- nearly one out of five -- havenD,t heard of the
voluntary TV ratings system or donll,t understand its ratings symbols.  That
is why the FCC has formed a V-Chip Task Force.   This massive, new public
education campaign will make sure parents have this valuable tool and know
how to use it.  Kaiser will support these efforts -- and, following this
meeting, will produce an ad campaign called D&Talking with Kids About Tough
Issues.DS

        I am encouraged by all these efforts; and I hope that the rest of


you will tell us today what you are doing -- or can do -- to give our
children the safe futures they deserve.  IU,m looking forward to hearing
your ideas.

         But first,   I know the Vice President would like to say a few
words.
