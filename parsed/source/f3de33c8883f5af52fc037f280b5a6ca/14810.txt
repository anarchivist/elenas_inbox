Subject:         Re: Saturday Message Strategy Meeting




Attached is the proposed Message schedule that I came up with going thru
April. Based upon the President's schedule I think there are some natural
connections with the rollouts which Kris proposed (plus DC and National
Service). Assuming we can get all the appropriate people to sign off on
such a schedule and prepare for such rollouts I got believe giving the
agencies such a schedule would be appreciated and enable them to have the
time to brainstorm and come up with good ideas of how they can bring
attention to these themes.

Taking advantage of the Monday Amplification Call and the Chiefs of Staff
Breakfast Tuesday we could lay this out for them and I think in turn we
could develop really well conceived rollouts amplifying the President's
positions' on these issues. In addition, in some cases successfully
pre-amplify the President so that when he does his events as much focus as
possible is on him as he demonstrates how he is involved and moving us
forward on these important issues.

Let me know what you think.==================== ATTACHMENT    1 ====================
