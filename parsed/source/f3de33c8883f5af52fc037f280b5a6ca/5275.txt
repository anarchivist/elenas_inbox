Modified Assault Weapons Directive

Q_    What are you directing the Treasury Department to do with respect to the modified
      assault-type weapons that have been reported in the press? How many and what
      kinds of f"irearms are at issue?

A.    Over the past few years, fireanns manufacturers have modified, or "sporterized", certain
      dangerous assault weapons to circumvent the ban on their importation required by the
      1968 Gun Control Act and the 1994 Crime Bill. There are about 30 models of these
      fireanns that are being manufactured in about 12 different countries, including modified
      Uzis, Galils and AK-47s. While only a limited number of these weapons have been
      imported to date -- and about 20,000 so far this year -- permits have been approved to
      import 600,000 more of these weapons and applications are now pending to import one
      million more .

      .The number of weapons involved underscores the potential threat to the public safety and
       necessitates that we take immediate action. The President's directive orders the Treasury
       Department to: 1) Immediately conduct an expedited l20-day review to determine
       whether modified assault weapons are properly importable under current law; and 2)
       Suspend outstanding permits on modified assault weapons until the review is complete.
       Thus, until the review is complete, the permits to import more than 1.5 million of these
       weapons will be put on hold.

      In the past, this Administration has used every tool available to keep millions of
      non-sporting, military surplus and other fireanns posing a threat to public safety from
      entering the country and flooding our streets:

      ·      In 1993, President Clinton banned the importation of assault pistols and
             toughened requirements for federal gun dealers.

      ·      In 1994, the President banned the importation of millions of assault-type weapons
             and ammunition clips from China.

      ·      The President fought for and signed the Assault Weapons Ban into law as part of
             the historic 1994 omnibus crime bill.

      The President's actions have helped to ensure that criminals are not better anned than our
      police. And we believe that due in part to our efforts, last year fewer police officers were
      slain in the line of duty than in any year since 1960.
                                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion

Q.   Doesn't this directive really amount to a revocation of permits that ATF already
     approved?

A.   The directive does not revoke already approved pennits, but suspends them for the
     duration of the Treasury Department's l20-dayreview. At the end of Treasury's review,
     existing permits will be revoked only if they determine that a particular weapon does not
     meet the statutory test for importation. Moreover, the importer would have an
     opportunity to make its case to Treasury before any permit would be revoked.

     The most important point of this directive is to ensure that -- in light of the new
     assault-type weapons that are coming into the country -- we are making every effort to
     guarantee that only legitimate sporting weapons that comply with the law enter into the
     country. That's the point of Treasury's review.


Q.   Why didn't you just take action prospectively and suspend pending and future
     applications for permits?

A.   Limiting our action to the pending applications to import one million firearms-- but
                                          allowing the importation of nearly 600,000 of these
                                          modified assault weapons under outstanding
                                          permits-- threatens to defeat the purpose of the
                                          overall review. That is why we are taking action
                                          similar to the 1989 Bush Administration decision to
                                          suspend already granted permits until completion of
                                          the agency's review process.    We  have roughly the
                                          same number of weapons importable under already
                                          granted permits as did the Bush Administration in
                                          1989, but today we are faced with pending
                                          applications to import roughly ten times more
                                          firearms.


Q.   Does this mean that you are already planning to permanently ban these firearms
     from importation?

A.   Not necessarily. The directive does not tell the Treasury Department what guns should
     or should not be allowed into the country. However, pursuant to the 1968 Gun Act, the
     Treasury Department has an obligation to ensure that only legitimate sporting weapons
     are imported. Thus, the proposed 120-day review will determine what changes, if any,
     are needed to continue enforcing this provision oflaw. And ultimately, those firearms
     that fail to meet the sporting purposes test will be permanently banned. If an importer has
     an approved permit for a banned weapon, their permit will be revoked only after they
     have had an opportunity to make their case before the Treasury Department.
                                                                         Hex-Dump Conversion




Q.    Why did the President take so long to sign the directive?

A.    This is not an action the President takes lightly and we needed sufficient time to explore
      our options and to consider the implications oftaking such a bold move. In addition, we
      received letters signed by about 60 members of Congress who argued that these weapons
      are not properly importable -- and we wanted to make sure we consulted with some of
      these members before proceeding. That being said, we moved as quickly as possible to
      finalize the final directive, and Treasury is now instructed to conduct their review as
      expeditiously as possible.


Crime Victimization Survey

Q.    What were the most significant {"mdings in the 1996 crime data released today?

A.    The 1996 National Crime Victimization Survey released by the Department of Justice
      confirms that crime is continuing to fall across the board and to the benefit of most
      Americans. Crime victimization rates fell to their lowest points since the inception of
      the National Crime Victimization Survey in 1973. Both the murder and violent crime
      rates plummeted 10% in 1996, and property crimes fell 8%. Rapes and car thefts were
      down even more. The decreases are even more significant when viewed over time: since
      1993, violent and property crime rates dropped 16% and 17%, respectively.

      The survey also shows that since 1993, reduced crime victimization rates were being
      experienced equally by men, women, and different racial and income groups throughout
      the country. And the sharp declines in murder are being felt by cities of all sizes and all
      regions of the country.

      When the President first took office, he made a commitment to take our streets back from
      crime and violence through a comprehensive anti-crime plan. That's why the President
      fought to pass a crime bill that gave communities the tools they asked for ~- more
      community police, tougher punishments and fewer guns in the hands of criminals. We
      think today's numbers show that our combined efforts are making a significant and
      sustained difference.


Q.    Are these crime numbers different from the numbers released by the FBI earlier
      this year?

A.    The numbers are largely the same and both confirm that crime is dropping. Today's
      statistics are released by the Justice Department's Bureau of Justice Statistics as part of
                                                                      I lex-Dump Conversion

     their annual National Crime Victimizations Survey. The National Crime Victimizations
     Survey is a series of in-depth interviews with approximately 100,000 people representing
     approximately 50,000 households. The BJS survey measures fewer cases than the those
     contained in the FBI annual report, but in much greater depth. The BJS survey yields
     vital information about the victims of crimes-- such as their sex, race, age and income
     level. Importantly, the BJS survey includes many cases which were not reported to the
     police. The FBI's Uniform Crime Reports record those crimes which were actually
     reported to the police.
