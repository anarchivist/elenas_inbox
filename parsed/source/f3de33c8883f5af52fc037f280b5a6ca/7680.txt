ADVISORY BOARD ACTIVITIES

        California State Board of Education. On May 11, Angela Oh met with
        representatives of the State Board of Education in Sacramento and suggested
        that they work with university researchers to undertake a study of the impact of
        diversity or bias reduction programs on primary school children.

        Latino/Jewish Business Roundtable. On May 12, Angela Oh met with this
        group of business leaders and showed them the Multicultural Collaborative video
        on race relations in Los Angeles. The video was well received, and they are
        exploring the possibility of showing it to a larger group of business leaders.

        Asian American Public Employees Council (AAPEC). On May 14, Angela
        Oh gave the keynote address at the annual AAPEC luncheon about the Initiative
        and her work on the Initiative. She addressed about 350 city, county, and state
        employees.

OFFICE OF THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR

     May Advisory Board Meeting on Administration of Justice. The Advisory Board is
     meeting on Tuesday, May 19 at The George Washington University. The focus of the
     meeting is race, crime, and the administration of justice. Attorney General Janet Reno
     will provide the keynote remarks. Christopher Stone, Director of the Vera Institute of
     Justice will give an overview of the facts surrounding issues of race and crime. The
                                        Hex-Dump Conversion
meeting will then consist of a roundtable Socratic-method discussion moderated by
Professor Charles Ogletree of Harvard Law School, which will explore: What are the
facts? How do different perceptions of crime and the administration of justice affect
efforts to build One America? What strategies can help promote a criminal justice
system that serves and treats Americans of all races fully and equally~

EEOC/Fair Employment Practices Agencies Conference. On May 11, I provided the
keynote address at the 1998 EEOCIFEPA Conference in Washington, D.C.
Approximately 250 persons participated in the meeting. A significant number of
attendees represented state and local human rights commissions and are members of the
International Association of Official Human Rights Agencies (IAOHRA) which passed a
resolution last Fall supporting the work of the Race Initiative. My remarks focused on
the Administration's FY99 budget proposal supporting increased funding for the EEOC
and the policy and action agenda of the Race Initiative. I encouraged attendees to
continue their efforts to identify promising practices for inclusion on our website and the
compendium to your report.

American Psychological Association. On May 13, I addressed the American Psychological
Association and discussed higher education issues, affirmative action, and the important
role psychologists can play in facilitating communication and change in their roles as
administrators, faculty, supervisors, and therapists.

Rising Stars Program. On May 14, members of the Initiative Youth Group staff
conducted a dialogue on race with approximately 200 members of the James MacGregor
Bums Academy of Leadership at the University of Maryland. Among the issues
discussed were interracial dating, affirmative action and social segregation.

Promising Practices. Over 35 new promising practice programs have been added to our
website. To date, we have featured nearly 150 examples of these programs from across
the country and spanning many sectors, including community building, education, and
multi-media.

                  Federal agency activities were not available.
