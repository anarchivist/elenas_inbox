TEXT:
Bear in mind, he's talking to 1500 young people.

        I have said before that each of us must do our part to ensure that
our progress continues -- and thatD,s what I want to talk about today: the
citizen service movement each of you is an imp'ortant part of.

         But before I speak about service, I want to talk to you about
·another issue you may have heard about that affects young people most of
 all: the battle in Washington over the tobacco bill.  Smoking kills more
 people every year than AIDS, alcohol, car accidents, murders, suicides,
 drugs and fires combined.   Studies show that 90% of all smokers lit their
 first cigarettes before they turned 18.  The big tobacco companies know
 this, and for years theyD,ve spent hundreds of millions of dollars on ads
 to reach children as young as 12. Their strategy has worked: 3,000 young
 people start smoking every day ... and 1,000 will die early as a result.

        This week, the Congress has the opportunity to pass a bill that
will protect young people from tobacco and stop children from lighting
their first cigarettes. Now, a great many people support this bill, from
parents, to public health officia~s, to members of both parties in the
congress. But the big tobacco companies are doing everything they can to
keep it from passing.

        The Congress faces a critical choice. And today, I want to say that if
Congress fails to pass this bill,   it will be a victory for the tobacco
companies and a defeat for. all of you - - our nationD, s young people. If
Congress fails to act, it will be because it has put narrow interests
above the national interest. And that vote will be very hard to explain
to the American people.
