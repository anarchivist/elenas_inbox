      TEXT:
      Just to let everyone know there IS a party in the planning
      for the 'Judge's retirement --
      It looks like the party will be on Tuesday, October 31st, from
      5:00-7:00 p.m. in the Roosevelt Room.  It may be someplace even
      better (111) -- we're waiting to hear -- that's why there has not
      been an official notice yet.
      As soon as I know, I will contact everyone. Until then, please
      mark your calendar for the 31st at 5:00.
      thanks.
