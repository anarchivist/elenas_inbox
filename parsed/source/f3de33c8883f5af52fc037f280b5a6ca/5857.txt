TEXT:
As we discussed, we'll get a scheduling proposal going for the U.S.Chamber
of Commerce on Feb. 23rd. You may be interested to know that that's right
in the middle of the NGA meetings, which are from 2/22 to 2/24, so if we
get the Chamber of Commerce that means an NGA speech focused on child care
or education or tobacco with a few words about welfare -- which I think
makes sense since he focused on welfare in July.
