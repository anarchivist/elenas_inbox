TEXT:
Federal agencies are very close to hiring 10,000 welfare recipients (we
were at 9,271 as of Nov 22). The goal set in April 97, was to hire 10,638
by 2000, though we've usually just rounded this to 10,000. So there's a
pretty good chance the President could say something like "The Partnership
met it's goal of signing up 10,000 companies. And, we're doing our part
and have met -- ahead of schedule -- our goal of hiring 10,000 former
welfare recipients who are proving to be good, productive workers just like
 those hired by private employers". OPM is polling agencies to see how
the December numbers are looking.   If I had to bet I'd say we'll hit the
10,000 but it may be close.   A large number of the Dec hires are likely
to be Census-related. Apparently Census has some good success stories and
I've asked to get a few examples in case there was interest in
highlighting one at SOU or in some other context (realizing the
sensitivity around Census we may not want to do"this).
