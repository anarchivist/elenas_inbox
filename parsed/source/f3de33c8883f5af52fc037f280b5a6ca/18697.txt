TEXT:
I have scheduled the Child Care Hill meeting at the request of Andi King
 (Gephardt) and Deb Colton (Ways and Means) for Monday, Feb. 23 @ 1pm.
There has been no room set for the moment.   PIs let me know if you are
able to attend.   We are trying to set an internal WH meeting for tomorrow
 (Thurs).  I will let you know if we are able to find a time.  Thanks.
