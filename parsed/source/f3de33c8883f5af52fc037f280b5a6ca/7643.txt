 TEXT:
 We are starting to plan for this event, where the President will attend
 CityYear's annual celebration event on June 3 in Cleveland.

 Gomperts had a thought for the June 5/6 radio address.  Habitat for
 Humanity has organized an event on June 6 with Congress, HUD, AmeriCorps,
 and others called "Houses of Congress", when 350 members of the House will
 spend part of that Saturday reconstructing a house with Habitat.  Perhaps
 in combination with some HUD housing message or stats, that could be a
 good message about housing and service.
