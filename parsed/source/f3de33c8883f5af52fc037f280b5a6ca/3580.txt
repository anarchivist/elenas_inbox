TEXT:
For the first time in months, we really had nothing to discuss. We were
all in the same place on the budget (no one knows anything); we spoke some
about the upcoming events.

One issue is on the horizon: apparently the FY 1997 state by state child
care allocation was done using the best data at the time; now better data
reveals that some states got more money than they should have and others
less. An administrative solution would be for states who "owe" money to
have a year or two to pay it back. HHS wants to propose a legislative
solution, which would deem this year's distribution to be correct, and
start with the new formula next year. OMB has concerns.   Paper will be
shared soon. Emily Bromberg's bottom line: no one says a peep to anyone
until after the NGA meeting, to avoid complaining governors.
