TEXT:
Q     Any kind of FDA announcement today, food safety
announcement?

             MR. MCCURRY:  There's no food safety announcement
today.  I think it's been reported various places that the White
House is considering a new initiative to ensure the safety of
fruits and vegetables consumed by the American public, especially
those that come from foreign sources.  The White House is
considering that, and I do expect the White House will announce
something soon about steps the President wants to take to direct
the FDA to issue better guidance on agricultural practices and
good manufacturing practices. And the President will likely have
some things to say about legislation that will improve the FDA's
authority to regulate imported fruits and vegetables coming from
other countries in a way similar to what the USDA already does
with respect to meat products --meat and poultry products.

             Q      When might that be?

             MR. MCCURRY:         Sometime next week perhaps.
