      TEXT:
      I spoke with Wade a few minutes ago and he said that they wanted to take
      their cue as to letters etc from us--I think Nancy Z is pushing a letter
      now, and he asked me to call her and reinforce that we don't think right
      now is the time to do it inasmuch as we may be able to skate by subcttee
      mark--he said let's see where we are at end of day and then decided if the
      groups should come in later in the week, or early next week--(I've got a
      conflict with the 5:30 mtg today--but keep me posted and I'm hoping Minyon
      can attend--ciao)
