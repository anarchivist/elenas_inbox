TEXT:
I talked to Joe and he supports the Klain/Kagan plan --- leaking class
size letter (assuming leg affairs is okay with that) to the Washington
Post for Monday and having the VP talk to the Post as a follow-up to his
Sunday event.

We would recommend gLvLng the story to Chuck Babington -- the Post's new
WH correspondent and former Gore Post-person.   Are you Gore people okay
with that plan?

Babington is in SFO, so Toiv can talk to him.  Please let me know if
everyone is okay with this and I will ask BT to connect with Babington.

Thanks, all.
