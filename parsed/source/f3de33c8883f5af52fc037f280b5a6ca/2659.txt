TEXT:
Good news.  FTC is holding a press conference now announcing action
against Joe Camel.

FTC announced it has "Reason to believe the law has been violated."
Staff of the Commission will proceed to present a case before an ALJ; that
judge will conduct a trial to determine whether the evidence supports an
unfairness allegation.  If FTC is successful, they'll consider remedies.
(i.e. this step is not unlike a civil indictment).

remedies it will seek: Reynolds cease and desist use of Joe Camel in
places children frequent; Reynolds maintain and make available to FTC data
on children's use of each of their brands; require Reynolds to fund public
education messages.

HHS/DoJ agree we should applaud FTC, and be clear, if asked, that we're
fully confident FDA's advertising provisions will be upheld (i.e., this
isn't a move away from use of FDA authority) .
