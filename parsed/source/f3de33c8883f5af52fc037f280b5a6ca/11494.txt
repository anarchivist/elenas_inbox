TEXT:
Today, Representative Lamar Smith along with 28 other Republican members
sent a letter to the President urging that the INS not publish a final
rule that contains "presumption of extreme hardship" for Guatemalans and
Salvadorans covered under NACARA.

I will have copies delivered to your office.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks.
