MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:         Bruce Reed
              Elena Kagan

RE:           DPC Weekly Report




        1. Welfare Reform:      New Republican Proposal on Workfare and Minimum Wage--
House Ways and Means Human Resources Subcommittee Chairman Clay Shaw is trying to
gamer bipartisan support among Governors and House members for a bill that addresses state
concerns about the cost of workfare programs. Unfortunately it does so by significantly
weakening the welfare law's work requirements. The draft legislation requires states to pay the
minimum wage for work experience and community service programs, but it limits the number
of work hours to what states can afford to pay, based on the amount of their welfare grant plus
food stamps. The balance of a recipients' time could be spent on job search and education
activities. Thus, a welfare recipient could work 10 hours a week and do 10 hours of job search.
There is a concern that the legislation'S definition of "work experience" and "community service"
may be so broad that nearly all subsidized work could be defined as such, allowing low benefit
states to require less than 20 hours of work from nearly all their "working" recipients. The bill
would also exempt workfare positions from FICA and unemployment taxes, something that we
indicated during the balanced budget negotiations that we were willing to do.

        Department of Labor lawyers are currently reviewing the legislative language to
determine if the bill weakens worker protections or minimum wage enforcement. If it does not,
then our grounds for opposition will rest solely on the weakening of the work requirements, an
issue on which we may not have many allies. We hear Chairman Shaw may unveil this
legislation at a press conference on Thursday, with a hearing and markup soon to follow. He
apparently plans to move the measure as a separate piece of legislation. As you may recall,
Speaker Gingrich told the Republican gathering in Indianapolis on August 22nd that enacting
legislation in this area would be a key priority for the fall "because the Clinton Administration,
working with the unions and the bureaucrats, is trying to undermine and destroy welfare reform."

             2. Education: Preliminary Injunction Denied in High Stakes Testing Case in North
     Carolina. On August 29, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of North
     Carolina refused to grant a preliminary injunction against a local school district policy which
     requires all students in grades 3 through 8 to achieve a specified score on the North Carolina state
     reading and math tests before they can be promoted to the next grade. Approximately 480
     students have been retained as a result of the policy, which had been challenged on behalf of the
     NAACP Legal Defense Fund and parents of 14 of the students affected. In denying relief, the
     court found that the plaintiffs were "less than likely" to prevail on the merits of their claim,
     Department of Education staff understands that the school district is adding additional measures
     of student achievement for promotion purposes.

             3. Crime: Juvenile Crime -- On Wednesday, a new report was released on crime
     committed in the after school hours. The report-- which contains the most comprehensive data
     on the prevalence of juvenile crime by time of day-- revealed that 41,8 percent of violent juvenile
     crime is committed between 3pm and 8pm on weekdays. While the numbers are slightly lower
     than a study that was previously cited, the data make clear that juvenile crime peaks in the after
     school hours and emphasize the need for responsible supervision and constructive activities for
     juveniles. The report was released by James Alan Fox of Northeastern University and Sanford
     Newman of Fight Crime: Invest in Kids,

            4. Crime: COPS -- Next week, the COPS Office will announce $23.8 million to fund
     an additional 319 new or redeployed police officers. The grants will fund officers in 10 states,
     bringing the total to more than 65,000 total officers funded throughout the country by the Clinton
     COPS Program.
