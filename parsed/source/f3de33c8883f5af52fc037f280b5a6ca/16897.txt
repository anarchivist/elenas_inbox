TEXT:
Here's some info regarding Intergovernmental's request that you return
Gov. Thompson's
call to the President:   This stems from a phone call Thompson had with
Mickey Ibarra on
August 1.   At that time, Thompson asked for an opportunity to talk to the
President about FLSA
on behalf of "a bipartisan group of Governors." So it's a pretty old
call. Originally the plan was
for Erskine to return the call; that never happened, so now they want you
to do it. Any other
relevant info, Emily?
