TEXT:
Attached is a slightly revised and shortened version of the memo I sent
Elena over the weekend. please have her look at this instead of the draft
she received Friday.

This memo makes clear that we will have an Administration bill ready to
transmit by the end of the week--and that we think it is premature to do
so.  Karen, Maria, Janet and I think we should hold off.

It is important that we get this to POTUS today, so that we know if we are
introducing the bill this week or not. The outside groups and the
Hispanic Caucus know that there is a chance we could introduce our
alternative within the week, and their pressure on us will grow as every
day passed.  Riley is meeting with the CHC on another issue tomorrow, and
it would be helpful if we had a sense of direction before he goes up there.

Janet Murguia has requested that this memo come from Bruce and Larry,
given the large role that Congressional strategy plays in it.

I have not shared this internally, though Janet, Maria, Karen, et. al.
have asked to see what we are going to send.   If you are not going to get
to this for a while today, do you have a problem if I circulate it.=================

MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:

SUBJECT:       Bilingual Education


       On June 4, the House Education and Workforce Committee reported H.R. 3982, the
English Fluency Act, introduced by Rep. Frank Riggs. This bill raises many of the same
programmatic issues and political dynamics as the Unz Initiative in California. The purpose of
this memo is to update you on our strategy for addressing this bill.

I.     Overview of Riggs Bill

        The bill would eliminate the existing Bilingual Education and Emergency Immigrant
Education programs and would (1) distribute funds through a block grant that is not targeted
toward school districts with the highest quality programs and greatest funding need; (2) require
states to withdraw funding from local programs in cases where students do not master English
within two years and set a 3-year limit for serving any individual student, though it would not
provide any extra help for students or corrective action for programs that need it; (3) not require
States to maintain their own efforts; and (4) eliminate professional development programs
designed to prepared qualified ESL and bilingual education teachers. The bill also seeks to
sharply curtail the enforcement powers of the Education Department's Office of Civil Rights by
voiding existing voluntary compliance agreements between OCR and local school districts with
regard to educating LEP students and by requiring OCR to publish -- and the Congress to ratify --
new guidelines and compliance standards for Title VI enforcement. These provisions would
weaken enforcement of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and result in increased litigation.

II.    Development of Administration Alternative

        We are on track to have an alternative bill based on the principles you approved and
Secretary Riley articulated in his statement of opposition to the Unz Initiative completed and
ready for transmittal to Congress by the end of this week. This bill would amend (rather than
replace entirely) the existing bilingual education program. Specifically, it would require (1)
school districts to establish a goal of preparing LEP students to enter successfully regular English
classrooms in not more than three years, (2) annual assessments of student's English proficiency;
(3)additional help for students not on track to English proficiency; (4) a corrective action plan, to

                                                                           Automated Records Management Svstel"
                                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion
         be approved by the Secretary, from programs in which a significant percentage of students do not
         meet the 3-year goal. The bill would also guarantee local flexibility by removing the existing
         cap on programs that do not use the students native language.


         III.   Congressional Dynamic

                H.R. 3892 was reported out of committee on a straight party line vote (22-17).
         Notwithstanding the success of the Unz Initiative, Committee Democrats did not feel compelled
         to offer an alternative to Riggs's bill during committee markup. Moderate Committee
         Democrats (e.g., Reps. Romer and Kind) as well as the four Members of the Hispanic Caucus on
         the Committee (reps. Martinez, Romero-Barcelo, Hinojosa and Sanchez) decided to vote against
         the Riggs bill even without a Democratic alternative.

                 It is not clear when the bill will be scheduled for House floor consideration, although it
         could well be scheduled before the end of June. There is no hint of movement in the Senate. It
         is quite possible that House Democrats will feel compelled to offer an alternative when the bill
         hits the floor so that they can vote for reform of bilingual education. 'Leaders of the Hispanic
         Caucus, including Caucus Chairman Becerra and Education Committee Member Hinojosa, have
         quietly acknowledged that, for the greater good of the Democratic Caucus, such a floor
         alternative might become necessary. However, up until now they have been adamantly opposed
         to a floor alternative, and remain to be convinced that one is necessary for a successful floor
         strategy. Moderate Democrats themselves are not yet clear if one is needed. In addition to their
         own apprehensions, Hispanic Caucus members are under substantial political pressure from
         bilingual advocates to steer clear of an alternative.

                  We could be ready to transmit an Administration alternative to Riggs in concert with the
         Portland State commencement address or any time thereafter. While announcing your own
         legislation in this short time frame would clearly demonstrate your commitment to reforming
         bilingual education, we believe such an approach would have very serious drawbacks in the
         Congressional arena.

                 In particular, introducing an alternative within the next week or so would be perceived by
         the Hispanic Caucus as jumping the gun strategically, and preempting meaningful consultation
         regarding the substance of an alternative. It would generate a hostile reaction from the Caucus,
         and is likely to recreate the same divisions among House Democrats we saw last year on national
         testing. The prospects that the Black Caucus would ally itself with the Hispanic Caucus and
         Republicans in opposition to your bill are high

                 The alternative course of action, which we recommend, would be to proceed immediately
         to consult with members of the Hispanic Caucus and other Democrats on the shape of an
         alternative bill, using the Administration bill as the starting point, and making our 3-year goal
         and strengthened accountability as nonnegotiable principles which must be incorporated into any


                                                          2
                                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion

 legislation we would support. While there is no guarantee that Democrats in general and the
 Members of the Hispanic Caucus in particular will endorse our approach, we can gain leverage in
these negotiations by making clear that a veto threat remains dependent upon the introduction of
 an alternative consistent with our principles. Since no bilingual education bill is likely to pass
ibis year, we can also make clear that we will transmit a reauthorization bill next year that is fully
consistent with these principles.

        If we determine together with House Democrats that an alternative is strategically
necessary when the bill comes to the floor, we could then introduce a bill consistent with our
principles that would unite, rather than divide Democrats. If, as the bill comes to the floor,
House Democrats either do not want an alternative, or will not support an approach based on our
principles, we can reassess our position at that time and either send up our own alternative or
choose to wait until next year's reauthorization.
