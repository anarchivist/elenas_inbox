Building on the success of six years of fiscal discipline and the virtuous economic cycle it created, President
Clinton has proposed a budget that includes a more than $3.4 trillion debt reduction lock-box that extends the
solvency of Social Security until 2055 and extends Medicare's solvency for more than a decade. It invests in
e.ducation and a cleaner environment, and a stronger urban America.

To build on the President and Vice President's strong foundation of community empowerment initiatives --
which includes programs to promote greater access to capital and credit, more affordable housing, and spur the
creation of private investment and job creation -- the FY2000 budget includes proposals to:
        Expand the Low Income and Housing Tax Credit.
        Make the brownfields tax expensing provision permanent.
    _   Create Better America Bonds to allow communities to create parks and open spaces.
    _   Spur private investment in distressed neighborhoods through a new markets initiative.
    _   Expand the welfare-to-work housing voucher program.

The Republicans have responded with a proposal that puts top priority on a tax cut which explodes in cost and is
targeted away from the middle class. Because the tax cut is so large and consumes the entire on-budget
surplus, the funds available for critical investments in urban America are squeezed dramatically:

The Republican budget would require a more than 10 percent cut in 2000 and over 20 percent cut in 2004
unprotected discretionary programs. This would have a devastating impact on programs critical to our
urban areas:
·   The cut to HUD's HOME program would deny tenant-based rental assistance to 1,300 families.
    Further, funds would be lost for new construction, rehabilitation, or acquisition of over 10,000
    affordable housing units.
·   The Republicans' reductions would wipe out the Administration's proposal of adding 100,000 new
    housing vouchers, including 25,000 to help move families from welfare to work, 18,000 for the
    homeless, and 15,000 for extremely low-income elderly.
·   The Community Development Financial Institutions Fund (CDFI) would be reduced by over $11
    million, with the result that 16 fewer community development institutions (CDFIs) would receive capital
    funding and 12 fewer financial institutions would receive Bank Enterprise Act grants. By 2004, the
    Republican budget would reduce CDFI's funding by $26 million, eliminating federal assistance to 37 CDFIs
    and 28 commercial CDFI lenders.
A low priority in the Republican budget:        Programs critical to urban America would be at risk because of
the squeeze on the overall discretionary funds proposed. The assumptions made in the Republican budget
resolutions show that programs important to urban America would be a low priority in competition for those
funds:
·   The Senate Budget Resolution proposes $5.3 billion in 2000 for community and regional development,
    $3.4 billion or 39.2 percent less than a freeze and $3.6 billion or 40.7 percent less than the President's
    budget. This would mean a massive reduction to the Community Development Block Grant Program
    (CDBG), one of the most popular and flexible sources of funds that mayors and governors use to
    improve economic opportunity and housing in low-income communities. Thousands of local
    neighborhood improvement efforts would be jeopardized. Cuts of 40 percent in this set of HUD
    programs would translate into a loss of assistance to 82,000 homes and loss of support for 114,000
    jobs in low-income areas.
                                                                                 Hex·Dump Conversion
                                The Republican Budget:
                    Sacrificing Our Environment and Public Health

President Clinton is proposing a record $33.9 billion in FY 2000 to protect our environment and public
health, including major new initiatives to preserve America's lands legacy, combat air pollution and
global warming, and help build livable communities/or the 21st century~

 The Republican budget not only fails to fund these environmental priorities. but imposes drastic cuts
 that would stop toxic waste cleanups. shut down national parks. cripple water quality programs. and
                                 heighten the risk of deadIv wildfires.

The Republican budget slashes funding for priority domestic programs 12 percent in FY 2000 and 28
percent in 2004. Across-the-board cuts would have these devastating impacts on public health and the
environment:

>     Stopping 135 Toxic Waste Cleanups - The Republican budget would cut Superfund by a total of
      $1.5 billion over the next five years, needlessly jeopardizing public health by preventing as many
      as 135 priority cleanups nationwide -- 92 percent of the federally led cleanups planned.

      Shutting Down National Parks - Cuts to the National Park Service would reduce services and
      hours of operation at 378 parks and other facilities serving almost 300 million visitors a year. In
      FY 2004, $575 million in cuts would shut down many smaller parks and backcountry areas in
      larger parks, and jeopardize visitor safety by blocking vital maintenance and repairs.

      Squandering Our Lands Legacy - By failing to fund the President's Lands Legacy initiative, the
      Republican budget would block federal efforts to preserve natural treasures, and deny states and
      communities $588 million to protect farmland, coastland, urban parks and other green spaces.

      Slashing Water and Public Health Protections - By FY 2004, cuts to the Environmental
      Protection Agency would eliminate funding for the Clean Water Action Plan, which helps
      communities clean up the 40 percent of surveyed waters still too polluted for fishing or swimming;
      and let polluters off the hook by crippling EPA's ability to enforce public health protections.

      Gambling with Global Warming - Cuts to the Department of Energy and EPA would gut efforts
      toward cleaner, more efficient energy for homes, transportation, and industry; and keep the
      Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles from meeting its goal of new cars three times more
      fuel-efficient than today's models by 2004.

      Crippling Wildlife Protections - Cuts to the Fish and Wildlife Service, National Oceanic and
      Atmospheric Administration, and Army Corps of Engineers would hamper salmon restoration in
      the Pacific Northwest, shut down wildlife refuges, and halt efforts to restore endangered species.

      Raising the Risk 0/ Deadly Wildfires - FY 2000 cuts to the Forest Service and Bureau of Land
      Management would close some lands to the public and reduce firefighting capabilities. A total of
      $700 million in FY 2004 cuts for these two agencies would cripple firefighting capabilities,
      jeopardizing lives and property throughout the West.
                                                                          Hex-Dump Conversion

                                 Republican Budget
                         Shortchanges Education and Training
                                            March 19, 1999

Building on the success of six years of fiscal discipline and the virtuous economic cycle it created,
President Clinton has proposed a budget that includes a more than $3.4 trillion debt reduction lock-box
that extends the solvency of Social Security until 2055 and extends Medicare's solvency for more than a
decade. The President's budget continues to place top priority on investments in education, including:
      Performance Accountability: $200 million in Title I to hold States and school districts more
      accountable for raising student achievement.
      21st Century Community Learning Centers/After-School and Summer School Programs:
      $600 million for the 21 st Century/After-School program, an increase of $400 million over the FY
      1999 level to help schools end social promotion through extended learning time.
      New Qualified Teachers and Smaller Class Sizes: $1.4 billion as the second installment of the
      President's plan to help schools recruit, hire, and train 100,000 new teachers by 2005 and reduce
      class size in the early grades.
      Tax Credits to Build Modern Schools for Our Children. A centerpiece of the President's tax
      cut agenda is to provide Federal tax credits to support nearly $25 billion in bonds to build and
      renovate public schools at a cost of $3.7 billion over 5 years.
    _ A $963 Million Three-Part Initiative To Close America's Skills Gap: 1) $190 million
      increase for adult education and family literacy initiative. 2) $368 Million increase for a
      universal re-employment initiative. 3) $405 million increase for a youth employment initiative.
      Expanding Head Start: A $607 million increase that will add 42,000 new slots for young
      children, including 7,000 Early Head Start slots, for total emollment of 877,000 and on track to
      meet the one million participation goal by 2002.

The Republicans have responded with a proposal that puts top priority on a tax cut which explodes in cost
and is targeted away from the middle class. Republicans have talked about making education a higher
priority, but the actions in this budget are in the other direction. Because the tax cut is so large and
consumes the entire on-budget surplus, the funds available for critical investments in education would be
squeeze dramatically.

The Republican budget would require a more than 10 percent cut in 2000 and over 20 percent cut
in 2004 unprotected discretionary programs. This would have a devastating impact on critical
education, training, and other programs for children:

   Head Start funding would be less than FY 1998 levels, a reduction of $1.1 billion from the FY 2000
   Budget. . A reduction of this magnitude would roll back all expansion progress made under the
   Clinton Administration, cutting services to up to 100,000 children, and making it practically
   impossible to reach the goal of serving one million children in Head Start by 2002. By 2004, Head
   Start emollment would drop below FY 1999 levels by over 230,000 children.

   Work Study would be cut by $106 million from the FY 1999 level of$870 million, to the lowest
   level since FY 1996. The number of students served would decrease by 112,000, from 930,000 in FY
   1999. If the Republican plan were assumed to continue through FY 2004, over a quarter of a million
   fewer students (257,000) would have the chance to work their way through college than in FY 1999.
                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion

    ·    TRIO funding would decrease by $73 million, from $600 million in FY 1999. As a result,
         approximately 117,000 fewer students would receive college preparation and support services in FY
         2000 than in FY 1999. By FY 2004, the Republican plan would cut 224,000 disadvantaged students
         from TRIO programs.

         GEAR-UP would be reduced $15 million, from $120 million in FY 1999. This funding level would
         not be sufficient to fund non-competing continuation awards from FY 1999. Approximately 5,900
         fewer low-income students would receive early intervention services in FY 2000 than in FY 1999.
         The Republican plan would further cut GEAR-UP so that more than 36,000 fewer students would
         receive services in FY 2004 than in FY 1999.

    .·   Dislocated Worker Assistance would be cut by $171 million below FY 1999, denying training, job
         search assistance, and support services to about 90,200 dislocated workers. In FY 2004, the
         Republican plan would deny services to over 205,600 dislocated workers.

         About 73,100 training and summer job opportunities for low-income youth would be eliminated.
          In FY 2004, about 166,000 low-income youth would be denied training and summer job
         opportunities.

    ·    This reduction could terminate Jobs Corps' planned 4-center expansion and/or force Job Corps to
         close 5-6 other centers in 2000. This could eliminate about 5,000 residential training slots for
         extremely disadvantaged youth in 2000. In 2004, this could result in over 11,000 students being
         denied the opportunity to participate in Job Corps.

         The Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG) would be reduced by $122 million,
         eliminating child care assistance for up to 34,000 low-income children. By 2004, the number of
         children receiving assistance would drop below FY 1999 levels by up to 79,000 children.

         WIC funding would be cut to below FY 1995 levels, a reduction of over $480 million from the FY
         1999 level of$3.9 billion, eliminating nutrition assistance for over 875,000 low income women,
         infants, and children each month. Furthermore, if the Republican plan were assumed to continue
         through FY 2004, funding for the program would be reduced by $1.1 billion below the FY 1999
         funding level, cutting approximately 1.9 million participants from the program.
