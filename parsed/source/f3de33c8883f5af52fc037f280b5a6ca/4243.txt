Thanks for your options memo    it has all the right info we needed.  If
everyone around here were as persistent and precise as you, we would have
finished this a long time ago.

I think we might be able to make the moderate option more attractive by
including a whopping lookback provision, that would raise $4 billion or
more per year for the kind of goodies you currently describe in option 3.
I would prefer the 3rd option to just be raising the upfront payment to
$30 billion and indexing to GDP.

Can you send me a 25-yr # for upfront payment plus indexing to GDP (not
including enhanced lookbacks)?

Let's talk in the morning.   Thanks again.
