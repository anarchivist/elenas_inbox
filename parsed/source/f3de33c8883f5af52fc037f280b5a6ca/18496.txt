Statement on National Assessment Governing Board Decision to Modify
Contract for Developing National Tests


        The Administration fought last year successfully to make sure that
the independent, bipartisan National Assessment Governing Board (NAGB) was
given responsibility for overseeing the development of voluntary national
tests in 4th grade reading and 8th grade math. Today NAGB completed an
important part of its work--to review and determine the modifications it
deems necessary to the test development contract. We are pleased that
NAGB is carrying out this responsibility in a serious and thoughtful
manner.

        Today we took another important step forward -- another step
toward putting high standards in the classroom and keeping politics out.
We do not agree with NAGB that it is necessary to delay the initial
administration of the tests for one year.   However, we are pleased that we
are on track to having the first ever national tests in the basic skills,
and to giving parents and communities tools to improve their local schools.
