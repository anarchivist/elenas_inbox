I spoke to Elena this evening regarding yesterday's meeting on our Needle
Exchange policy. I regret IGA was not at the meeting however, we are
interested in teaming with you to get the research information out to
local and state elected officials and the organizations that represent
them. Lynn Cutler has agreed to assist on this subject for IGA since
mayors and county officials have such a large stake. Please let me know
how we can help as well. Thanks.
