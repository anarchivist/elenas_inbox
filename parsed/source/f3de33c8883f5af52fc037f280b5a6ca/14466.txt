     MEMORANDUM FOR            ERSKINE BOWLES

     THROUGH:                           GENE SPERLING

     FROM:                     Ellen Seidman

     SUBJECT:                        securities litigation reform
     Background
     At the end of 1995, President Clinton vetoed a securities
     litigation reform bill that, among other things, limited
     discovery, changed pleading standards and created a "safe harbor"
     for forward
     o
     -looking information.  Congress overrode the veto.
     Concerned that plaintiffs' attorneys would bring actions in state
     courts that had been made more difficult or impossible in federal
     court, during the California Republican primary California
     business interests attempted to pass referenda that would have
     instituted changes such as "loser pays." These failed.
     The plaintiffs' bar, supported by labor and some parts of the
     pension community, as well as the California Democratic Party,
     then proposed Proposition 211, which was on the November ballot.
     Business interests vigorously opposed Prop 211.  The referendum
     would have established procedural rules for securities fraud
     suits in California courts that not only were far more favorable


to plaintiffs than the federal rules, but that also applied to
any company with any California shareholders. Business interests
asserted this would have effectively overriden the federal
statute, making California a haven for frivolous securities fraud
suits from allover the country.
On a campaign trip to California, which included a dinner with
representatives of the high tech community, the President and
Leon Panetta stated (and were quoted in the press) that Prop 211
was a bad idea. They also said it was a mistake for each state
to establish its own rules regarding an essentially federal body
of law. There are certainly people in the community who believe
the President said he would support a preemptive federal statute.
Prop 211 lost 75% to 25%. And as Congress adjourned last year,
it passed a securities law reform bill that preempts state
registration laws for most corporations and can be read,
aggressively, as preempting state fraud actions based on those
laws.



o
Current state of play
In February, the SEC will deliver to the President a report he
requested outlining the impact of the securities litigation
reform law. Their preliminary conclusion appears to be that,
while it is very early in the process, the act does not seem to
have had much impact either in reducing litigation or in
increasing information available under the "safe harbor." It is
far too early to know the impact on potential litigation of the
1996 statute.
Passing preemptive federal statutes -- particularly laws that
interfere with the procedures and operations of state courts --
is extremely difficult.  Senator Dodd made this point last fall
in wondering why we would favor preemption, although he thought
there might be a case for such a statute if Prop 211 passed. We
understand that Congressman Oxley (R
o
-Ohio), who business
interests expected to sponsor a preemptive statute, has declined
on the grounds that it's unneeded, too difficult, and not the
kind of thing conservative Republicans like to do.   Some of the
California Representatives on both sides of the aisle, as well as
Congressman Joe Kennedy, are said to be working on a preemptive
statute, but it is unclear how far they have gotten.
We have been silent on the issue since the election.
Recommendation
At a meeting attended by John Podesta, Bruce Lindsey, Kathy
Wallman, Elena Kagan, Tim Newell, Paul Carey, Dan Tate and me, we
concluded that it will be extremely important to walk the fine
line between encouraging the high tech group to believe that the
Administration favors preemption -- particularly the kind of
broad preemption they have had drafted -- and leading them to
conclude that we are going back on what they think the President
had agreed to.  The attached talking points attempt to guide you
through the thicket.                                  .

Talking Points for Meeting with High Tech Leaders
securities Litigation Reform (Preemption)

?        Last time we (Leon) talked together about this issue, we
were all concerned that Prop 211 would pass, potentially
making California a mecca for securities fraud litigation
under less rigorous standards than those in federal law.
?        Through all our efforts, that ·crisis was, fortunately,
averted.
?        We understand that you remain concerned that similar efforts
to establish minimal state standards that apply to
out
o
-of
o
-state companies might appear in other states, and
that fighting these one by one seems inefficient and
counterproductive.
?       As the President and I (Leon) said, we too are concerned
about state by state action altering what is essentially a
federal system.
?       On the other hand, the securities laws have 60 years of
history with concurrent federal and state jurisdiction.
Efforts to limit state jurisdiction, particularly access to
state courts, need to be undertaken carefully. They will be
successful only if they are directly responsive to a proven
problem, and only if there is broad consensus (which will
almost certainly have to include the SEC) to take the
action.   [Last year's preemption of state securities
registration laws in most cases is an example of a
long
o
-developing response to a well understood and documented
problem.]
?       Now that we are not under the imperative that passage of
Prop 211 would have created, it is critical that we
carefully work through the nature and extent of any state
law problem and whether and what type of federal action
might be needed.
?       We welcome the opportunity to work with you on this.  Kathy
Wallman, who has been the Deputy White House Counsel and is
now the Chief of Staff and Counselor at the National
Economic Council, will be leading our team.
