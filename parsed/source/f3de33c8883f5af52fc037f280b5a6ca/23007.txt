TEXT:
FYI -  On March 2, 1999, the Urban Institute issued a press release on a
report that calls for a National Report Card on Discrimination in America
and shows that paired testing can be used to audit discrimination. They
argue that this report card would promote greater undersatnding of the
prevelance of discrmination, provide strategic guidance to civil rights
enforcement agencies, develop insight on on the changing pattern and
impact of discrmination.

This report also provides strong support for the President's $10 million
request for additional funding to fight discrimination that would expand
the use of paired testing.
HUD has been using this method for two decades but this report proposes
that pair testing expand into different areas including employment, and
other daily consumer transactions such as car sales, taxi services, and
health club memberships etc.

I will review a copy of this report and let you know if I find anything
particularly interesting.

Let me know if you have any thoughts or comments.     Thanks.
