TEXT:
Udpate as of this morning:  Justice is basically ok with the draft that
OMB sent yesterday. Justice faxed over a couple of add-backs to the OMB
proposed language which OMB is now reviewing and expects to have clearance
by early afternoon.  I put this version on the fax to you.  If OMB can get
clearance, I would like to do a quick check with Lynn Cutler and Karen
Popp before I ship it over to Staff Secretary.

Justice would still like to get this signed today.  I was thinking best
case is forwarding directive to the Pre~ident with the cover memo before
he leaves and checking into possible VP release. What do you think?
