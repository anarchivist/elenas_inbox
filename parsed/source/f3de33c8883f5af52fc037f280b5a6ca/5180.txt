TEXT: _
Gomperts says they have a green light from Hilley to introduce the
AmeriCorps reauthorization as soon as Congress leaves, which he thinks
could be in a few days.   He wants to have the bill introduced in Congress
quietly right before they leave, so as to get a bill number, etc.  I told
him that might create a problem with the radio address we have reserved on
the 2lst -- i.e., it would rob us of the announcement of the
reauthorization. Do you concur?

He feels very strongly about this, though, and they will push this.  He
says it will greatly hamper their effort to get reauthorization moving
during the recess -- to schedule hearings, seek endorsements. He said
they will introduce the bills very quietly; and suggested we could
substitute the announcement of their "Seniors in Schools" program at the
radio address, as well as talking about the reauthorization.

(By the way, Silverman got a service event on the schedule in Sacramento
on Saturday, the l5th, but it's not clicking. There's no real ·AmeriCorps
presence there, and the President ~s supposed to do some environmental
project there called the Bay Delta which Steve hoped would have service
links, but doesn't seem to. We're still trying.)
