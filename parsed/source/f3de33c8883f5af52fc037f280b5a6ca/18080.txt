Duke gives benefits to grad students' same-sex partners
By BLAKE DICKINSON I The Herald-Sunl

   Duke University will begin offering health insurance and other benefits
to gay and lesbian partners of graduate students Jan. 15, President Nan
Keohane announced Tuesday.

   The new policy comes nearly three years after the campus extended
benefits to same-sex partners of faculty and staff.

   " I t ' s long overdue, " said Ian Lekus, a fifth-year graduate student in
history and member of Queer Grads. -'But we are very pleased to see Duke
University recognize the equality of same-sex relationships to those of
legally married heterosexual partners and live up to its own
nondiscrimination policy. ' ,

   Keohane's announcement, in the form of a letter to the executive
committee of the Task Force on Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual Matters, came
after she spoke with campus trustees behind closed doors about the matter
this weekend.

    Keohane could not be reached for further comment Wednesday.

   Access   to recreational facilities and campus libraries should be
available   early in the spring semester. Applications for available campus
housing     Duke currently offers Central. Campus apartments to married
couples _   will be arranged by next fall.



   The availability of health insurance may be bit more problematic,
university officials warned. Duke must negotiate a new contract with a
company that provides same-sex spousal equivalent coverage.

   Graduate and professional students interested in signing up their
same-sex partners will need to meet the same criteria required of Duke
employees. Applicants must sign an affidavit stating they are in a
long-term relationship in which both partners share personal and financial
responsibility.

   Duke undergraduates will not be eligible for same-sex benefits because
the university does not recognize their financial independence from
parents or guardians.

   Heterosexual live-in couples do not qualify under the policy and must
marry to receive full campus benefits. Same-sex marriages are not
recognized in North Carolina.

   "I'm just relieved that the issue is being put to bed,"    said James
Harkins, a fifth-year graduate student in music who began working on the
policy change in 1993. " I t has been frustrating that this inequity has
been around for such a long time."

   The push for same-sex benefits began shortly after Duke adopted a 1988
equal opportunity policy that denied discrimination on the basis of
"sexual orientation or preference."

   After nearly five years of campus debate over the moral and financial
ramifications of changing the policy, Keohane arrived on campus and
quickly gained support for extending benefits to the same-sex partners of
professors and non-faculty staff.

   University personnel estimated in January 1995 that between 2 percent
and 3 percent of university personnel might take advantage of the new
policy. About 40 of Duke's more than 20,000 employees have signed up their
same-sex partners for university benefits to date.

   Gay and lesbian graduate students thought they would be included in
short order.

   " I don't think anybody expected it would take this long,"   Harkins
said.

   After more than two years of quiet, behind-the-scenes negotiating,
graduate students stepped up their campaign last spring. Through letters
to the campus newspaper, petitions and a surprise May demonstration at a
groundbreaking ceremony for Duke's new recreation center, the students
made their cause public.

   " I t was not so much to embarrass the university as to focus the
attention of the administration on the fact. I think we felt the issue
fell off the table after the benefits were extended to faculty and
staff, " Lekus said. "We feel it is that attention that led the
administration to make its decision. ' ,

   Getting access to the libraries, campus gyms and housing will be nice
for same-sex partners, Lekus said. But the real issue was health
insurance.


   --It's very difficult to afford if you don't have access to a corporate
plan or your partner's plan," he said. --Health insurance is really a
matter of life and death. ' ,

   John Howard, the director of Duke's Center for Lesbian, Gay and
Bisexual Life, praised the decision.

   --I'm delighted. And I'm proud of Nan Keohane,"  Howard said. --She's
demonstrated leadership and courage on this issue. We couldn't be more
pleased. ' ,

   Graduate students, faculty, administrators, alumni and trustees who
pushed the issue forward deserve credit, Howard said.  --There's still a
little work to be done,"  he said. --But there will certainly be some
celebrating. ' ,
