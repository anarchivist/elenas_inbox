TEXT:
Jon called in and asked me to let you know that the charter schools
program guidance was distributed (without the q&a on religion and
desegregation issues), but that the civil rights guidance was not released
 (dept had consdiered releasing it in draft from with unresolved questions
deleted) .    During the conference, participants raised several questions
about issues that the civil rights guidance will address (e.g. admissions
- when can preferences be used). When Jon returns to the office, we will
work closely with ED to get the civil rights guidance in final form for
release.

As a side note, Jon also mentioned that ED is frustrated that the civil
rights guidance did not go out -- and that the review process led to a
last minute decisions.  Jon thinks that Mike Smith and others at the
Department might not have been aware that he turned around program
guidance comments quickly but that his comments weren't declined by ED
staff until late Thursday evening, and that the civil rights guidance
wasn't sent over at all until Thursday afternoon (which we both reviewed
that day). After a multi-hour conference calIon Friday, it became
apparent that only a Bruce-Mike call was going to resolve some of the key
differences.  We will work with ED to identify more efficient ways to plug
us into their review process so that our comments can be resolved - or
kicked up - earlier.
