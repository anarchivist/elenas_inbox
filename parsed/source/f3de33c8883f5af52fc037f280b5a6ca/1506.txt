TEXT:
Just to confirm then, we will tell Emily Bromberg to go ahead and tell
Govs. Voinovich and Miller that they would have a short speaking role on
the second panel to talk about what state govts can do to support
community efforts to help parents and enhance early childhood
development. We can fill it out and lock in on the respondent idea later.
