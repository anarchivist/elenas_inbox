TEXT:
Cliff has just given us a new draft of the food safety report, which we
will send over. The agencies are fine with it.   Lori McHugh is looking at
it tonight for press strategy as well. We are planning on releasing it
Friday or Monday, before the hearing on Tuesday.  Should the President
issue a statement?
