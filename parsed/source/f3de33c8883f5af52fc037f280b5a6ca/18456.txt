                        Questions and Answers on Health Care
                                  January 18, 1998




Q:   How do feel about the selection of Senator Breaux as the Chair of the Medicare
     Commission and Congressman Bill Thomas as the Administrative Chair?

A:   I believe that Senator Breaux is a fine choice to chair the Commission. His years of
     experience on the Finance and Aging Committees, as well as his strong track record
     of successful bipartisan negotiations on numerous policy fronts will serve the
     Commission and the nation well. I am also confident that Congressman Thomas
     will make significant contributions to the Commission in his capacity as
     administrative chair. As Chair of the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health,
     he has demonstrated extraordinarily leadership and an impressive knowledge about
     Medicare and the challenges it faces. I look forward to the Commission getting
     their important work underway.


Q.   Isn't your new Medicare buy-in policy just another example of a government
     take-over of the private health insurance system?

A.   Absolutely not. This is a carefully targeted proposal that is designed to make sure
     that older Americans have access to health care coverage. Currently, older
     Americans have less access to employer-based health insurance, are twice as likely
     to have health problems, and are at greater risk of losing coverage. Some have no
     insurance options, and others are left to buy into the individual insurance market,
     which can be prohibitively expensive because of their poorer health. This policy
     helps this vulnerable population get access to health care coverage by:

     ·      Enabling Americans Ages 62 to 65 Buy into the Medicare Program, by
            paying a full premium.

     ·      Providing Vulnerable Displaced Workers over 55 Access to Medicare by
            offering those who have involuntarily lost their jobs and their health care
            coverage a similar Medicare buy-in option.

     ·      Providing Americans Over 55 Whose Companies Reneged on Their
            Commitment to Provide Retiree Health Benefits A New Health Option, by
            extending (COBRA) coverage until age 65.
                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion



Q.   Isn't this policy a Medicare entitlement expansion, at a time when Medicare can
     least afford it?

A.   Absolutely not. There is no impact on the Medicare Trust Fund because
     participants would pay their full premium over time, and any of the temporary costs
     associated with this proposal are completely offset by Medicare fraud, abuse and
     waste savings.

     This Administration has made strengthening and preserving the Medicare Trust
     Fund a top priority since I took office. In 1993, we enacted a budget --without the
     vote of a single Republican -- that extended the life of the Trust Fund through 2002.
      The Balanced Budget I signed into law last summer extended the life of the Trust
     Fund beyond 2010. This new policy is a carefully targeted policy that will in no
     way compromise our commitment to strengthen the Medicare program.


Q.   Shouldn't you wait for the Medicare Commission to make its recommendations
     before you propose such policies?

A.   The purpose of the Commission is to develop proposals for the overall financing of
     Medicare. Because this policy is fully financed, it has no overall impact on the
     Medicare Trust Fund, and will not conflict with the Commission's work in this area.
      The proposal addresses an important problem in our health care system without
     interfering in any way with the overall financing of Medicare, which the
     Commission is looking into


Q:   Won't this policy cause people to retire early?

A:   Suggestions that this would be a significant problem are simply untrue and are not
     backed up by the fact. There is no financial incentive to retire since participants
     would pay a higher premium than they would in their current, subsidized employer
     health plans. And, since participants would have to pay the full premium, they
     may need to continue to work to afford the coverage. In fact, this option may
     actually encourage people to start second careers (e.g., opening their own stores;
     becoming a consultant) since they could purchase Medicare if they leave their
     current job.


Q.   Does this proposal create incentives for employers to drop retiree health coverage?

A.   For today's retirees, this proposal actually lessens the incentives for employers to
                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion


drop their health coverage. Such employers would have to allow their retirees to buy
into their current workforce's health plan if they break their promise of providing
retiree health benefits.



Q:    What do you think of the Norwood/D' Amato consumer bill of rights
      legislation?

A:    I applaud Congressman Norwood and Senator D' Amato for their leadership on
      this issue. Weare encouraged that so many Republicans and Democrats
      understand the need for national legislation. There are a number of bills on the
      Hill at this time. Some Members have indicated their interest in modifying their
      legislation before Congress comes back. We look forward to working with all
      Republicans and Democrats as we move forward throughout this process.
