            The following are Jen O'Connor's comments on the new draft. I'm not sure how
            we can address her concerns. Do you have any suggestions? I've attached the
            draft to the email below.

                        I think the draft is fine but it doesn't address the concern in
                        the letters which is that we would do something to preempt 211, or
                        presumably any future proposition like it. We didn't do so.   So I
                        think we should point that out.

            Unable to convert OA$SHARA114:ZWOTP41UQ.WPC to ASCII,
             The following is a HEX DUMP:
regarding securities lawsuits.

I opposed this Proposition because I felt it would undermine the balance between the federal and
state governments with respect to the regulation of widely trade securities. As my veto of last
year's Securities Reform Act attests, I believe strongly in the need to protect the rights of
defrauded investors. But after careful consideration, I determined that Proposition 211 's creation
of a novel cause of action, broader than any now recognized, would have gone too far in the other
direction, deterring companies from providing useful information and thereby harming American
investors.

Thank you again for giving me your views.
