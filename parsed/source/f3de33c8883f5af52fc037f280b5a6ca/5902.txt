TEXT:
Elena,

Maria just called to alert us to a growing situation in Miami. Apparently
(though I need to follow up with more fact finding with INS and DOJ) the
immigration judges in Miami are denying stays or continuances in
deportation proceedings involving Haitians because they understand the DED
to only stop the actual deportation (once the person has a final order),
and not to affect the proceedings themselves.  Though this is likely a
correct interpretation of what the DED means, it has angered some of the
local advocates (who would like stays or continuances pending a possible
leg. fix).  Maria hears that Carrie Meeks is writing us a letter about how
this is a waste of resources, particularly in light of the possibility of
permanent legislative relief for these Haitians.  I am callings INS and
DOJ for more facts, etc., but I wanted to alert you to what is coming down
the pike.

julie
