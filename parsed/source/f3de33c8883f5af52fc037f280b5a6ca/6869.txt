TEXT:
We just heard that Congressman Danny Davis from Chicago successfully
offered a Rules Committee amendment to the ISTEA bill in the House to
increase funding for Access to Jobs from $42 M to $150 M, bringing it to
the same level as the Senate bill. Apparently the amendment does not lift
the 10 demo project cap, leaving this for conference.
