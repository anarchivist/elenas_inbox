TEXT:
Here's a first cut at a summary of the education victories on the Labor-H
bill that we are working up with the NEC folks.   Mike hasn't had a chance
to review this yet, and we will probably want to do a lot of tightening,
but Shireman/Siewart will likely pass this on the Gene for a first look
tonight, so I wanted you to have it as well, especially if we're going to
be doing this bill-signing on Wednesday.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; ATTACHMENT    1 ;;;;;;;;

                      Labor-HHS-Education Budget Victories
                  An Historic Investment in Educational Opportunity .
                                      November 12,1997

Now I ask you -- and I ask all our nation's governors; I ask parents, teachers, and citizens all
across America --for a new nonpartisan commitment to education -- because education is a
critical national security issue for our future, and politics must stop at the schoolhouse door.
                                   President Clinton, State of the Union Address, February 4,1997

The Labor-HHS-Education Appropriations bill which the President signed today meets
our national commitment to expand educational opportunities for all students. In
addition to an 8 increase in Head Start, the bill increases discretionary funding for
Education Department programs by more than $3.2 billion over FY 1997 -- $200 million
more than the President won in the Balanced Budget Agreement. Overall, the bill
represents the largest increase in America's national education investment in thirty years.
The bill also contains an important agreement allowing continued progress toward high
national standards and voluntary national tests in the basics of reading and math.

HELPING YOUNG CHILDREN GET READY TO LEARN

Head Start
The legislation includes the President's $324 million (8 ) [Barry had $374 million over
the FY 1997 level] increase in Head Start, allowing 836,000 children to be served.
With this increase, Head Start funding will have increased 55 since 1993, continuing
progress toward the President's goal of serving one million children ..

HELPING STUDENTS MASTER THE BASICS AND ADVANCED SKILLS

Voluntary National Tests
The bill allows continued development of the 4th and 8th grade national tests, and shifts
control over test policies and development to the independent, bipartisan, National
Assessment Governing Board (NAGB), as the Administration had proposed. The bill
provides $16 million dollars to support the testing plan, and allows for pilot testing of test
items to begin next fall. The bill also provides for a study of ways to link state tests to
each other and to NAEP, an existing national sample test, that reflects high national
standards.

America Reads
The Corporation for National and Community Service -- AmeriCorps -- won an increase
of $64 million in the two bills that fund the program. This is more than a 10 percent
increase, a stark contrast to the 31 percent cut in the House versions of the bills, and more
America Reads program, connecting AmeriCorps members with schools to recruit and
coordinate trained volunteers to provide children with the extra practice they need to learn
to read well and independently by the end of third grade.

The bill also provides for $210 million in FY 1999 for the America Reads Challenge
legislation that is currently moving through Congress. In addition, funds are provided in
FY 1998 to help train college work-study tutors.

Technology Literacy Challenge Fund and Technology Innovation Challenge Grants
The technology education programs -- which were proteded in the Balanced Budget .
Agreement -- received a 91 percent increase, from $305 million to $545 million. That is
$39 million more than the President proposed. These programs are designed to facilitate
school access to the Internet and equip teachers with skills needed to integrate computers
into their classroom instruction.

Charter Schools,
President Clinton's public charter schools program received a 57percent increase, from
$51 million to $80 million. This program provides start-up funding for public schools
that parents, teachers, and communities create -- and that States free from most rules and
regulations and instead holds them accountable for raising student achievement. The
increase will help accelerate progress towards the President's goal of developing 3,000
new charter schools by early in the next century.

After-School Learning Centers
This new investment of $40 million will help extend learning opportunities for children
and their families at schools across the country, keeping schools open late, on weekends,
and in the summer so young people will stay off the streets and out of trouble.

Comprehensive School Reform
The bill includes $150 million in new funds for an initiative, supported by the President,
to help low-achieving, low-income schools transform themselves through proven reforms,
addressing failing schools without abandoning public education.

Bilingual and Immigrant Education
The bill includes a 35 increase in bilingual and immigrant education secured by the
President in the Balanced Budget Agreement. This vidory, increasing total funding to
$354 million, will help more children master learn English and prepare to meet the same
challenging academic standards as all other students.       .

parents, providing $4.4 billion dollars for special education -- an increase of $775 million
over FY 1997.


Goals 2000
The bill provides $491 million for the President's Goals 2000 school reform
program. Communities in every state are using Goals 2000 funds to upgrade curriculum,
improve teaching, increase parental involvement in schools, and make greater use of
computers in the classroom. Since 1994, over $1.3 billion has been invested in this vital
initiative.

Title I
The bill provides nearly $7.4 billion to support extra help in basic and advanced skills for
 more than ten million disadvantaged students in elementary and secondary schools.
Under the Clinton Administration, investment in Tide I has grown by over $ I billion.

HELPING STUDENTS GET A COLLEGE EDUCATION AND CONTINUE LEARNING
FOR A LIFETIME

Pell Grants
Congress adopted President Clinton's proposal to increase the maximum Pell Grant .by
$300 to $3,000 -- the largest increase in two decades.   In addition, the program was
expanded to serve an additional 210,000 low-income students who have been denied Pell
Grants because of anomalies in the design of the program.

cHOPE Modification to Enhance Eligibility for Financial Aid
At the last minute, appropriators added the President's proposal to ensure that families'
eligibility for Federal financial aid is not reduced as a result of the tax cuts for higher
education. This was a part of the Administration's original HOPE Scholarship proposal,
but was not included in the recent tax legislation. In addition, a provision· was added to
reduce the interest rate on consolidation loans in the guaranteed student loan program to
match the lower rate which has been offered under direct lending, and to allow
consolidations into either program.

OTHER VICTORIES

The bill fully funds the Education Department's Office for Civil Rights; meets the
President's request for increases for Historically Black Colleges and Universities and
Hispanic-Serving Institutions; increases funding for teacher training in the Eisenhower
Professional Development program; and maintains our investments in School-to-Work,
