TEXT:
NHTSA says this Thursday a group is releasing a study showing the high
level of incompatibility in child seat hook ups. The group is calling it a
national landmark study and says it will get the Today show live. They
invited Dr. Martinez, NHTSA head, who is declining. He points out we
could get hit for holding this, or at least miss a good opportunity to
piggy back the story.
