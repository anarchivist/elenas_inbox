      TEXT:
      Because of the time change for tomorrow's meeting, I need your names by
      10:30 am tomorrow morning.   Of course, the earlier the better.   Also,
      there have been several questions about the "notable characteristics"
      information I requested.   In addition to the basic information, I would
      also greatly appreciate (in fact, need) a couple of articles of a
      biographical nature as well as quotes you may have. Thanks for your
      assistance and sorry for the changes.

     Thanks,
     Clara
