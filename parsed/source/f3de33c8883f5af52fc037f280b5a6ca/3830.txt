TEXT:
Katie Steele tells me that Secretary Shalala will be in St. Louis next
Tuesday, at the breakfast event (which the President is not attending)
and at the Presidential event; She wants then to go see a program in
action (rather than go to the DNC fundraiser) and wants to know if Bruce
wants to join her.   Bruc'e, has she mentioned this to you?
