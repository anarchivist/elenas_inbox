TEXT:
DOL just told me that Katherine Boo from Washington Post may run a story
this weekend about one of DOL's welfare-to-work federal hires who was
recently involved in a child abuse incident (I understand there was a
story in the Metro section within the last week about the incident, though
it did not mention the connection with DOL/welfare to work).   Apparently
the woman and her boyfriend were babysitting someone else's child and the
child was scalded. The woman is out on bail and the judge told her to
return to work.  She has talked to the Post.  I imagine questions would go
to DOL's press office, but just wanted to give you a heads up.
