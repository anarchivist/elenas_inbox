TEXT:
Rep. Doggett has asked to meet with the VP about his bill, the
International Tobacco Responsibility Act of 1998.  I think his bill has
been included as a title in the House D's tobacco bill.

I think that Doggett just wants to tell the VP about it and ask for White
House support.

The meeting is set for Friday afternoon at 4:20 pm.  I have a summary of
the bill which I will fax to you. will you please take a look at it and
let us know what position the VP should take.  I'll put together a
briefing memo on Thursday and would really appreciate your input.  If it
is necessary, we can do a 5 minute briefing with him prior to the meeting
on Friday.

Thanks for your help.   -- Kay
