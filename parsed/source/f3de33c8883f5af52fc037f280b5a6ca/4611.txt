I spoke to Sarah Lichtman in Mike Smith office about ED's follow-up to
yesterday's meeting with LCCR. ED is planning to hold an internal meeting next
Monday at 10 to discuss a range of potential actions the Dept can take with
regard to concerns raised by LCCR.  (The Dept actually had a few potential
items to discuss at yesterday's meeting -- but didn't get to raise them before
the meeting ended.)

A follow-up meeting with LCCR members will take place either Tues or Wed of
next week.
