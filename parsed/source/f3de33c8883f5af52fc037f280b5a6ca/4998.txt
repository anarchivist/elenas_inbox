Subject:         Re: Has anything happened in Labor-HHS re: Murray?

I haven't been able to raise Chow yet, but here's what I'm told by House
Democratic staff.

Murray continues to hold out for her language in the bill itself, not the
report. Obey spoke in support of her. Republican members opposed.
Senate Republican staff have been told to try to craft something
"narrower" that might be considered. House D staff don't know what that
might be, nor are they being asked to participate.

They don't think a bill language provision can make it through. They
have . been talked to by Murray staff in a manner similar to the treatment
we got.
