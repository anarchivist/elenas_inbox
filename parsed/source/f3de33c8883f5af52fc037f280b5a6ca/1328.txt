TEXT:
Thge religious groups are on the sidelines at this point as DOJ and OPM
are trying to work it out. We also have to do outreach to the
non-participant religious groups before the matter is finalized but there
has been steady progression accross the board, and wonder of wonders,
there is an endpoint in sight.

Also, is there any movement on the HHS/Chrisitan Science piece or are we
just letting it go?
