                                 LOCATION:               Presidential Hall
                                 BRIEFING TIME:          1:10 pm - 1:25 pm
                                 EVENT TIME:             1:30 pm - 2:30 pm
                                 FROM:                   Bruce Reed, Jennifer Luray


     I.    PURPOSE

           To announce a new wage data collection provision in the pending legislation which
           would strengthen enforcement of the Equal Pay Act and to meet with working women to
           highlight the issue of equal pay and to emphasize the need for Congress to pass this
           legislation.

     II.   BACKGROUND

           This event is an opportunity for you to announce the new data collection provision
           for wages in the Paycheck Fairness Act, which is sponsored by Senator Daschle. In
           addition, it is an opportunity for you and the First Lady to hear first-hand from
           working women the problem of wage discrimination and issues of equal pay.

           One of the panelists highlights the issue of "comparable worth," where an job in a
           female-dominated profession is "equivalent" to a job in a male-dominated
           profession but is paid less. This panelist is included because the Administration
           recently has been pressured by Senator Harkin, Congresswoman Norton, the
           women's groups, and the unions to support Senator Harkin's comparable worth
           legislation that requires companies to equalize wages between "equivalent jobs," which is
           defined in the legislation as jobs that may be dissimilar, but whose requirements are
           equivalent when viewed as a composite of skills, effort, responsibility, and working
           conditions. While we cannot support this legislation, in a compromise to the above
           persons and groups, we agreed to include a panelist that highlights the comparable worth
           problem, but not the solution proposed in the legislation. However, you should not use
           the words "comparable worth," and should merely emphasize that this woman's story
           highlights the need for women to be paid equally with men.

           Before beginning the roundtable, you will announce the following:
                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion
Paycheck Fairness Act with New Data Collection Provision

You again will urge Congress to pass legislation called "The Paycheck Fairness Act,"
introduced by Senator Daschle and Congresswoman DeLauro, to strengthen laws
prohibiting wage discrimination. The legislation wiJI be reintroduced with a new data
collection provision added. The highlights of this legislation include:

·      New Pay Data Collection Provision. This provision would require the EEOC to
       complete a survey of data currently available for use in enforcing federal wage
       discrimination laws and to identify additional data collections that would enhance
       enforcement of these laws. In addition, the provision would call upon the EEOC
       to issue a regulation, within eighteen months, to provide for the collection of pay
       information data from employers described by the race, sex, and national origin of
       employees.

·      Increased Penalties for the Equal Pay Act (EPA). The legislation would provide
       full compensatory and punitive damages as remedies for equal pay violations, in
       addition to the liquidated damages and back pay awards currently available under
       the EPA. This proposal would put gender-based wage discrimination on equal
       footing with wage discrimination based on race or ethnicity, for which uncapped
       compensatory and punitive damages are already available.

·      Non-retaliation provision. The biJI would prohibit employers from punishing
       employees for sharing salary information with their co-workers. Many employers
       are currently free to take action against employees who share wage information.
       Without the ability to learn about wage disparities, it is difficult for employees to
       evaluate whether there is wage discrimination.

·      Training, Research, and Pay Equity Award. The bill would provide for increased
       training for EEOC employees to identify and respond to wage discrimination
       claims; research on discrimination in the payment of wages; and the
       establishment of an award to recognize and promote the achievements of
       employers in eliminating pay disparities.


Equal Pay Initiative
Previously, you have announced a new $14 million Equal Pay Initiative as part of
your Fiscal Year 2000 budget. The Initiative includes $10 million for the EEOC to
increase compliance with equal pay laws by providing training to EEOC employees
to identify and respond to wage discrimination, increasing technical assistance to
businesses on how to meet legal requirements, and launching an equal pay public
service announcement campaign to inform employers and employees alike of their
rights and responsibilities. The Initiative also includes $4 million for the
Department of Labor, primarily for a program to assist contractors in recruiting
and retaining qualified women in non-traditional occupations.
