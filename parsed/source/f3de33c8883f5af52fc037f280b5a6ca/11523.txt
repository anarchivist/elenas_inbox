TEXT:
The VP's office actually asked me for the information, but next thing I
heard was a regret. CCSSO really would like to do this on that Monday, and
VP is out of town that day.  I believe he is here on Tuesday, but Ambach
indicated to John Schnur that they will lose a lot of people.  I think
John is going to go back to the VP's office again to try to pursue Tuesday.

Let me know if it's raised tomorrow, and how you think we should proceed
(ie, push VP's office, HRC drop-by, or just have to regret).

Thanks.
