I.    PURPOSE

      To highlight an Administration initiative aimed at increasing employment for people with
      disabilities.


II.   BACKGROUND

      People with disabilities are at least twice as likely as people without disabilities to be
      unemployed, and their low employment rate is estimated to cost society in excess of
      $200 billion annually.

      The Executive Order establishes a task force of federal agencies to make
      recommendations aimed at removing workplace barriers for people with disabilities
      in areas such as employment discrimination, health care, housing, education,
      telecommunications, child care, and rehabilitation and training. The Task Force
      will be chaired by Labor Secretary Herman and co-chaired by Tony Coelho, Chair
      of the President's Committee on Employment of People with Disabilities. (Coelho
      is traveling on business and is unable to attend.) Secretaries of relevant federal
      agencies are members. The task force will issue its first report later this year with
      recommendations designed to bring the employment rate of people with disabilities
      as close as possible to the rate of the general population.

      The disability community is very cognizant of your longstanding commitment to
      their priorities. However, they believe that their issues have been absent from our
      budget initiatives. They are looking (1) to extend health care and tax credits to
      those on the disability rolls seeking to return to work and (2) to shift Medicaid from
      an emphasis on nursing home care to home and community-based care. Congress
      is considering legislation on both these issues, but we have so far withheld our
      support because of cost concerns. This task force should help address some of the

                                TALKING POINTS
                   DISABILITY EMPLOYMENT EXECUTIVE ORDER
                                 March 13, 1998


o    I am pleased to welcome you to the Oval Office this morning to celebrate an historic
     moment in the movement to bring people with disabilities into the mainstream of our
     country's economy. I am particularly pleased to welcome the members of Congress
     who are here, members of my Administration, as well as my very good friend, Justin
     Dart.

o    Today, our economy is strong. Since 1993, we have created 15 million new jobs. But
     this is not a time to rest, but a time to build, to build the America within our reach.

o    That is why I'm so pleased today to sign an executive order aimed at building--
     building employment opportunities for people with disabilities and addressing the
     unacceptably high unemployment rates among people with disabilities.

o    Many of you have spoken to me about the critical need for this initiative. When I met
     with leaders from the disability community last year, I remember my friend Tony Coelho
     saying that people with disabilities are the only group of Americans who are actually
     seeking to pay taxes, because pay taxes means they are working and contributing
     members of society.

o    This Executive Order will focus my Cabinet, led by Secretary Herman, on removing
     workplace barriers for people with disabilities and designing a strategy to make equality
     of opportunity, full participation, inclusion, and economic self-sufficiency realities for all
     30 million working-age Americans with disabilities.

o    This task force will focus on the most important policy issues affecting the employment
     of people with disabilities since the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act
     (ADA).

o    Since I first ran for President, I have been committed to a government that promotes
     inclusion, empowerment and independence for all Americans, including Americans with
     disabilities. By signing this Executive Order, I direct Secretary Herman, members of the
     task force, and the rest of my Cabinet, and the entire executive branch to work together to
     build on the progress of the last six years and promote policies and programs that enable
     people with disabilities to share more fully in the American dream.

o    I am excited that Secretary Herman has embraced this challenging assignment, assisted by
     Vice-Chair by Tony Coelho. I am confident that all of the agency heads who are here



        with us today, as well as those who could not be here, will give this assignment the
        serious work and commitment that it merits.

    o   I look forward to receiving the task force's reports and to working with the Congress on
        these critical issues. Thank you.
