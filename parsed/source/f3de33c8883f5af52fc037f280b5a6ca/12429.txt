TEXT:
To make sure we are on track with the public charge roll-out announcement,
I recommend that we have.a DPC-led meeting early next week that you would
chair with Janet, Maria, Sarah,  and other appropriate people and it would
helpful if Laura could help with scheduling.

Fyi - I spoke briefly with Janet and she seems ok with a TX roll-out.

Please advise.   Thanks.
