  TEXT:
  Wow -- progress on this since yesterday's note to you -- DOJ and HHS met
  with Lamar Smith today, and it went as well as could be expected.  They
  also briefed some Democrats. So now the only remaining issue is the
  remaining legal snag in the affidavit of support, and people think that's
  getting resolved. So the best guess is this will go public the week after
  next.

  Subject: Affidavit of support and means tested benefits

  You've asked me about the timing and status of the decision on means
  tested benefits, as well as the timing of the affidavit of support rule
  that Sally Katzen wrote that interesting note about.  Here's the wonderful
  story:

  Means-tested is ready to go.      But there are now 2 holdups to getting these
  2 out.

  1. DOJ feels very strongly that it should not send out major
  interpretations of the welfare law on immigration without first meeting
  and "consulting" with Rep. Lamar Smith.  There is about .000005% chance
  that he would like our interpretation, tell us anything we don't already
  know, or change our minds, but DOJ has been very firm on this.  So we are
  waiting for this meeting to get scheduled and occur, and then to let a
  respectable number of days pass before taking our action.

  2. On the affidavit of support, a final snag has arisen in the last few
  days on the definition of "state means tested benefits" that OLC says was
  raised by the Brady Law decision.  DOJ and INS met today to iron this out;
  I don't know the resolution yet.   I am trading calls with David Ogden to
  suggest to him that time is of the essence.



Finally, HHS feels very strongly that means-tested should be announced at
the same time as the affidavit, so there will be one day of attention to
this rather than two.  Therefore they are very reluctant to schedule the
meeting with Smith until they know that the affidavit issue is resolved.

So the schedule is:
1. settle state means tested definition issue in affidavit of support
(punting is a possibility)
2. meet with Smith
3.  issue both a few days later
