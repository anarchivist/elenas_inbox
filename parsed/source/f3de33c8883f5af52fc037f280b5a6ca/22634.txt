President will accept their recommendations and also announce an increase
of nearly $30 million in his FY 2000 budget to increase investigations and
prosecutions of gun law violations, including those occurring at gun shows.

Findings of the Report.   In response to a directive by the President last
November, the Treasury and Justice Departments reviewed 314 gun
show-related investigations conducted by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,
and Firearms (ATF) , mostly between 1997 and 1998. The investigations
involved more than 54,000 firearms and spanned a wide range of federal
firearms violations.  The review found the following:

Number of gun shows.  In 1998, there were an estimated 4,442 gun shows.
Most gun shows were sponsored by state and local firearms collectors
organizations, though some shows were promoted by individual collectors
and business people. Ten states sponsored the most gun shows: TX (472);
PA (250); FL (224); IL (203); CA (188); IN (180); NC (170); OR (160); OH
(148); and NV (129).

Typical gun show. The typical gun show costs about $5 to attend and draws
an average of between 2,500 and 5,000 people. Vendors rent tables for a
fee ranging from $5 to $50, and the number of tables varies from as few as
50 to as many as 2,000.  Federally-licensed firearms dealers (FFLs) make
up about 50 to 75 percent of vendors, with unlicensed gun sellers
representing the remaining 25 to 50 percent. Unlicensed gun sellers
who are assumed to be selling from their personal collections -- are not
required to conduct background checks or keep records of gun sal.es. Large
quantities of firearms are also sold in less formal and smaller public
markets, such as flea markets.

Guns sold. The firearms sold at gun shows include new and used handguns,
semiautomatic assault weapons, shotguns, rifles, and curio and relic
firearms (novel and older firearms).  Additionally, vendors often sell
large capacity magazines, machine gun parts, and a wide variety of other
paraphernalia (knives, ammunition, military artifacts, and books) .

Forum for illegal sales and trafficking.  Gun shows provide a forum for
illegal firearms sales and gun trafficking.  Of the 314 gun show
investigations reviewed, 46 percent involved the purchase or sale of
firearms by felons, and 34 percent involved the sale of firearms later
used in serious crimes, including homicides.   Other gun law violations
observed at gun shows included: the sale of firearms without a federal gun
license (more than 50 percent of the cases reviewed); the sale of firearms
"off the books" -- without conducting a background check or keeping a
record (about 20 percent of cases); and the sale or transfer of machine
guns in

-more-

violation of federal law (20 percent of cases). More than a third of the
investigations involved more than 50 firearms, and at least one
investigation involved up to 10,000 firearms.

The ReportO,s Recommendations. To close the gun-show loophole that allows
countless firearms to be sold on a "no questions asked" basis, the


     President will endorse all of the reportO,s recommendations and support
     legislation, to be introduced by Senator Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ) and Rep
     resentative Rod Blagojevich (D-IL), that will make them the law of the
     land.  These recommendations include:

     (1) Requiring Brady background checks on all firearms transferred at gun
     shows, with the assistance of federally-licensed dealers. Currently, an
     estimated 25-50 percent of all firearms sold at gun shows are not subject
     to background checks, because they are sold by an unlicensed seller.  The
     new legislation will require the participation of licensed dealers in all
     sales at gun shows, so that all sales will be subject to the Brady
     background check requirement.

     (2) Requiring vendors to report information on firearms sold at gun shows
     to the ATF.  Gun dealers would submit certain information (e.g.,
     manufacturer, model, serial number) on firearms transferred at gun shows
     to ATFO,s National Tracing Center and maintain additional information on
     file to assist in future firearms tracing requests by law enforcement.
     These requirements would ensure that firearms sold at gun shows cannot (as
     they so often do now) disappear without a trace.

     (3) Requiring gun show promoters to register with the ATF and notify it of
     all gun shows.  Promoters would have to provide the time and location of
     gun shows and a list of vendors; provide vendors with information about
     their legal obligations; and require vendors to acknowledge receipt of
     this information.

     (4) Defining gun shows broadly. These requirements would apply to any
     place where 50 or more firearms are offered for sale by at least two
     vendors.

     (5) Increasing resources to combat the illegal trade of firearms at gun
     shows.

     New Resources for Firearms Enforcement. Consistent with the reportO,s
     findings and recommendations, the PresidentO,s FY 2000 budget includes
     over $28 million in new funds to enhance the enforcement of federal
     firearms laws, including:

     $23.8 million for more than 120 new ATF agents to support firearms
     investigations, arrest violent criminals and gun traffickers, and crack
     down on illegal gun sales.

     $5 million for more than 40 additional federal prosecutors to conduct
     intensive firearms prosecution projects targeting violent felons who
     possess guns, armed drug traffickers, and illegal gun markets.
