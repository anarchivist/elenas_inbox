                    EXECUTIVE ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR JOSH GOTBAUM

 FROM:      OMB LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS

 DATE:      JUNE 18, 1998

 SUBJECT:           LEGISLATIVE REPORT



 Budget Resolution Conference/Tax Cuts: Speaker Gingrich said yesterday "I
 think the principle that Sen. Lott enunciated of a $60-$70b tax cut is the
 right idea .... I thought it was a terrific offer and thatO,s what weO,re
 trying to work out." Gingrich also said he believes that "virtually all"
 of a $60 billion to $70 billion tax cut could be funded by mandatory
 program savings without using savings from discretionary accounts.   House
 and Senate conservatives, however, reacted negatively saying they would
 oppose anything lower the House-passed $101b tax cut.

 Roth Critical of House-passed Tax Code Termination Bill (June 17, 1998):
 Senate Finance Committee Chairman Roth yesterday released the following
 statement regarding the House approval today of legislation that would
 sunset the tax code by 2003: "I am sympathetic to those who support
 sunsetting the tax code. I share their great frustration with the
 complexity of the current code -- complexity, I might add, that Congress
 and the Administration increase with every tax law enacted. Hqwever, I
 have serious concerns about sunsetting the tax code without an alternative
 in place. Doing so would leave businesses as well as individuals unable
 to plan for the future. For example -- if a family bought a house today,
 would they be able to deduct their mortgage interest after the current
 code was sunsetted? would they still be able to contribute to an IRA? How
 could a business make long term plans, if they did not know what the tax
 regulations would be? We need to reach a consensus on reforming the tax
 code, and unfortunately, we are not there yet -- even within our own party
 . Let's not put the cart before the horse."

 Deputy Director for Management Ed DeSeve is scheduled to testify on Y2K
 before the House Reform & Oversight Subcommittee on Government Management
 on Monday, June 22.

 DOD Authorization/China Issues: The status of the DOD authorization bill
 debate next week is in question, pending resolution of whether numerous
 amendments will be offered related to China.
