TEXT:
Gil will be in D.C. tomorrow and Wednesday. He has called looking for the
status of the collective bargaining issue.  If there is a resolution that
we are prepared to discuss with him, he said he'd be more than happy to
come in to discuss it in person Tuesday or Wednesday. What should I tell
him? Is there any progress I can report to him?
