EK-BR:

Attached please find the community prosecutors memo. It includes EK's
most recent edit and acknowledges, to the dismay of some in NYC, that
Brooklyn and NYC are in fact the same city.

I haven't included comment from the folks I touched based with, so here
they are in brief. Some of them are worth trying to incorporate.

Jeremy Travis -- Very excited about the initiatives, but points out two
things: (1) community prosecution can also be very effective against
violent offenders, especially when civii remedies (code enforcement) are
used to shut down crack houses, drug markets or when -- as in LA -- civil
injunctions are used to break-up gang presence; and (2) we should, within
the 20% for non-hiring purposes, specifically include programs to
hire/assign lawyers to focus on working withe community and police to
develop and use civil remedies/enforcement for this purpose.

Eric Holder -- Loves the proposal. Will he get to sit next to FLOTUS when
it is announced at the State of the Union? Also, we may want to
specifically mention "supervising agencies" in our innovative
courts/corrections program bullet. This would ensure that pretrial and
probation is included in states where they're not part of the court system.

Kent passed a message along that he had comments, but I haven't heard from
him.  I told him he should page EK or me with any reaction.  Michael Deich
has not gotten back to me.  I had put his staff on notice that we were
considering a $100 million community prosecutors initiative; he may be
surprised by the 5-year/$500 million jump.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE               PRES~DENT


FROM:          BRUCE REED

SUBJECT:       New Community Prosecutors Initiative

        Over the past month, we have spoken with the National Institute of Justice (NIJ), the National
District Attorneys Association (NDAA), and the American Prosecutors Research Institute (APRl)
about a new initiative to promote community prosecution as a local crime-fighting strategy. For
several years these organizations have been working with the handful of "pioneers" in this area, and
they are eager to work with the Administration to launch a new initiative to promote community
prosecution throughout the country. This memorandum outlines such an initiative and proposes that
you include it as part of the FY 1999 Budget and State of the Union.

Background on Community Prosecution

         Community prosection is the natural next step to community policing. Over the past few
years, as thousands of police departments have made the transition from reactive policing to working
proactively with community residents, new demands have been placed on local prosecutors -- as well
as on the criminal justice system in general. Local police and community residents have called on
prosecutors to take their concerns into account in deciding what kinds of offenders to prosecute.
Even more, increasingly they have asked prosecuting offices to dedicate attorneys to work in the
neighborhoods, to playa role in solving local crime problems, and to reorient their emphasis from
simply processing cases to taking on quality of life issues and preventing crimes from happening in
the first place.

        Perhaps the best example of the evolution of community prosecution can be found in
Multnomah County (Portland), Oregon. As part of an overall strategy to revitalize the Lloyd
District of Portland, local business leaders called for a number of private and public actions, including
improved lighting, better and more coordinated private security, more police officers and --
surprisingly -- a special prosecutor assigned to the Lloyd District. When government funding could
not be obtained for a dedicated prosecutor, the local business community raised the money to pay for
a prosecutor themselves. Although this course of action raised legitimate ethical issues and
concerned some in the community, District A!ttorney Michael Schrunk decided that establishing a
one-year, neighborhood-based pilot prosecution project was in the public interest; he accepted the
funds on the condition that if the project proved successful, the County would provide funding to
extend it. Today, Portland has 7 Neighborhood District Attorneys (NDAs), with all attorneys'
salaries paid for out of public funds.

       The community's original request for a dedicated prosecutor was fueled by the desire to
punish more severely recidivist offenders, and the NDA initially saw his role as making judges aware,
                                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion
during trial and sentencing, ofthe impact recidivists had on the community_ Within a few months,
however, the community also asked the prosecutor to do something about prostitution, public
drinking, drug use vandalism, street fights, and car thefts. The NDA focused his attention on these
issues, many of which were related to an illegal campsite in the area. He implemented a long-term
plan, including police sweeps and community action, to address the problem. As a result, the
incidence of these crimes in the area has decreased dramatically.

        Others prosecuting officers that have embraced community prosecution in some form include:
Boston, MA; Chicago, IL; Denver, CO; Indianapolis, IN; Kansas City, MO; New York City, NY;
Milwaukee, WI; Austin, TX; and Washington, DC (initiated this past year by former U.S. Attorney
Eric Holder). A new federal grant program will enable the Administration to help prosecutors'
offices join with their police departments in making use of community-based crime strategies. This
investment in community prosecutors also will help build support among police and prosecutors for
future initiatives to promote community-based approaches in the courts and corrections system.

Outline of Proposed Initiative

        Similar to the COPS program, this proposal calls for $100 million for FY 1999 (and $500
million for the next 5 years) for the Attorney General to make direct grants, on a competitive basis, to
state and local prosecutors for the following purposes:

       (1) Community Engagement. To increase substantially the number oflocal prosecutors
       interacting directly with members of the community ("community prosecutors" or
       "neighborhood DAs"); and

       (2) Problem Solving. To encourage local prosecutors to reorient their emphasis from the
       "assembly line" processing of cases to solving specific crime and disorder (quality of life)
       problems in their communities.

        A minimum of 80% of the grant funds ($80 million) would be used to pay for the salaries and
training costs associated with hiring or reassigning prosecutors to work directly with police and
community residents. Grants would last for 3 years and pay for a maximum of 75% of the costs --
with the federal share declining over the life of the grant. A maximum of 20% of the grants ($20
million) could be used for other non-salary costs, such as:

       - developing and implementing innovative programs that permit members oftheoommunity
       to assist prosecutors in crime control and prevention;

       - increasing prosecutors involvement in community activities that are focused on crime
       control and prevention;

       ~developing and establishing new administrative and management systems to facilitate the
       adoption of community-oriented prosecution; and


       - developing and implementing innovative, community-based programs that include the courts



                                                                            Automated Records Management System
            and corrections systems.                                        Hex"Dump Conversion

             This initiative proposes allocating half of the grant funds ($50 million) to prosecutors' offices
     serving populations of 500,000 or more persons and the remaining half ($50 million) to smaller
     jurisdictions. This distribution means that sizable grants of $1 million or more could be made to a
     majority of the 130 jurisdictions serving the largest metropolitan areas, and that smaller grants (about
     $50,000 to $75,000) could be made to nearly half the remaining, full-time prosecutors' offices (of
     which there are about 1,600 total).
