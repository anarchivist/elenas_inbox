TO:                            Stephanie Streett
                               Assistant to the President
                               Director of Presidential Scheduling

FROM:                          Bruce Reed
                               Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy and
                               Director of the Domestic Policy Council

                               Mary Beth Cahill
                               Assistant to the President and Director of Public Liaison

REQUEST:                       Speak to national, 2,000 person Welfare to Work
                               Convention sponsored by the Welfare to Work Partnership

PURPOSE:                       This is an opportunity to highlight the success of welfare
                               reform on the third anniversary of the new law and to
                               encourage critical efforts to ensure the success of welfare
                               reform in the nation's largest cities. Announcements will
                               be identified (could include new numbers regarding the
                               decline in the welfare rolls and how many recipients are
                               working).

BACKGROUND:                    Since the President launched the Welfare to Work
                               Partnership at the White House in May 1997, it has grown
                               from 100 companies to over 10,000 and these businesses
                               have hired over 410,000 individuals from the welfare rolls
                               -- exceeding the challenges set by the President.

                              In February, 1998, the Partnership launched the CityLink
                              initiative to bring together businesses, government officials,
                              and community organizations to help people move from
                              welfare to work in 30 cities with high poverty rates and
                              large concentrations of welfare recipients, including
                              Atlanta, Baltimore, Chicago, Los Angeles, Miami, New
                              Orleans, New York, Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C.
                              This initiative is an important part of the President's efforts
                              to ensure welfare reform works in the nation's largest cities
                          Hex-Dump Conversion

                             (as are his budget proposals for an additional $1 billion for
                             the Welfare to Work program, and additional funds for
                             welfare to work housing vouchers and transportation).

                             In August 1999, the Partnership will hold a national
                             convention in Chicago, hosted by Mayor Daley, called
                             "Welfare to Work: A Nation Unites". Delegations of
                             businesses, service providers and public officials from the
                             30 CityLink communities will share best practices to meet
                             the welfare reform challenge in their community,
                             participate in workshops and seminars, and work together
                             to plan for the next phase of welfare reform.

PREVIOUS PARTICIPATION:      The President launched the Partnership at the White House
                             in May 1997 and held a first anniversary event here a year
                             later. He has also participated in events in St. Louis and
                             Kansas City in August 1997 and November 1997. The
                             Chicago event will be in lieu of a May 1999 anniversary
                             event.

                             In both 1997 and 1998 the President did welfare reform
                             events in August to mark the anniversary of his signing
                             welfare reform into law (the 1997 event was with the
                             Partnership, the 1998 one was not). Both generated
                             significant press coverage and greatly influenced accounts
                             of the effect ofthe new law.
