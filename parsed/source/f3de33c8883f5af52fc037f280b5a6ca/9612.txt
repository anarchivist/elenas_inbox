TEXT:
        1. The Senate passed the agricultural appropriations bill today
without a veto proof majority, 55-43. We have threatened to veto the $60
billion bill because its $4.2 billion in emergency aid is $3.1 billion
less than the president wants.  The bill includes about $51 million for
the President's Food Safety Initiative, $31 million for USDA, $20 million
for FDA. when added to the $5 million we had previously gotten for CDC
it totals $56 million out of a proposed $101 million package.

        2.   Rep. Etheridge's (D-NC) staff is pushing the idea of lifting
the ban on US government involvement in promoting exports of tobacco
leaf.  It is possible Etheridge will call Erskine.  He will likely would
ask Erskine for the Administration to at least stay neutral. They are
faxing the language they are asking Glickman to agree to, Dallas said
Glickman wouldn't do it without WH sign off.
