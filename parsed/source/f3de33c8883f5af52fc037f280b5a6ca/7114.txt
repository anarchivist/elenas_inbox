  TEXT:
  FYI, Sonny Goldrich of the Wash. Times is doing a piece on what has to
  come out of the McCain bill if the industry walkout is permanent.  I
  didn't cooperate in the sense that I didn't give him anything on what
  might have to come out, except to remind him that we had answered
  questions on constitutional issues submitted by McCain.  I did say we
. like McCain but think it needs to be strengthened, we think it's a bad
  idea for industry to be out and that they'll ultimately be in but that
  we're moving forward in any event, and said that is not an issue right now
  and that we're instead moving ahead.
