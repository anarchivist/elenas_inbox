TEXT:
I asked Counsel (Eddie Correia) and DOJ about having the Shepards and
Bryds at our hate crimes event. Chuck Ruff said fine to have them but is
strongly against having them in a small picture with POTUS.  See below.
But the President is going to want to say something to them.  I'm thinking
that maybe: 1. they could meet with the President separately beforehand
-- even without photos and 2. they could be in a larger shot of supporters
of new legislation including POTUS, members of congress and civil rights
/police groups.  Eddie was going to check this out.  Ideas?

        I've asked DOJ to consider the question of the President appearing
with the Shepard and Byrd family members. The tentative Counsel's Office
formulation is that they can come to a large meeting but that they should
not be photographed with the President and we should not pay their
expenses to come. A question we have not quite resolved is whether they
can stand behind the President in a large group picture. Of course, they
can speak out individually however they want, including outside the White
House. Wade Henderson's tentative reaction was that the groups could raise
the money to bring them here if necessary. I'll let you know DOJ's
reaction.
