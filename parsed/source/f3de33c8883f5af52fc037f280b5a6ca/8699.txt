TEXT:
Talisman said OK. He wasn't happy, in that he said they've already gone
far beyond their usual process on this issue, but he agreed he'd call the
A&P guy right now to set up a meeting. He said the client attended the
meeting the other time they met with A&P, so he assumes they'd come now.
 (The other meeting was perhaps 6 months ago, before A&P wrote this paper,
when they first laid out the alternative idea to Treasury.)   He gave me
the caveat that he doesn't want it to be a negotiating session.   I told h
im that is not our goal, and I made it clear that we are in no way asking
Treasury to reconsider its position, but that we would expect them to lay
out their reaction to A&P's arguments.   I said we would attend not in a
substantive role, but to observe and make sure everyone's clear on the
purpose of the meeting.

I told him we wanted the meeting Tuesday.
