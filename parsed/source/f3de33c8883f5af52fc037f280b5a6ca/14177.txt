TEXT:

The final vote was 57 Senators voting to override the President's veto, short of
the two-thirds needed. 41 voted to sustain the veto.
But women's groups are worried that this may not be over: At the last minute,
Trent Lott switched his vote to sustain the President's veto, leaving open the
option that he could bring the late term vote up again next week for a
reconsideration.
Women's groups feel nervous about it:  Planned Parenthood is very worried that
Lott will be able to switch the moderate Republicans who voted for the
President's veto. NARAL feels fairly certain that the votes are stable.
FYI: Ralph Reed was on the Hill today.

Joining the 57 Senators who voted to override the veto were Nunn, Leahy,
Specter, and Fraham.
Joining the 41 who voted to sustain were Bradley, Byrd, Graham, Harkin and


      Bryan.
