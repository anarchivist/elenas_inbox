TEXT:
I think it would be best if Bruce raised the subject rather than be
badgered by Monahan and Tarplin, but I agree that this isn't a good forum
for a discussion.

I'll downplay it on the agenda.  Remember, Bruce doesn't hand out the
agenda -- it's just for his own use.

I'm not sure I want to do privatization and FLSA so prominently with this
group.  I can't think of anything we would gain from a real discussion.
Can we put these items last, put them together, and label them "status
report" or something? Or am I wrong on this?
