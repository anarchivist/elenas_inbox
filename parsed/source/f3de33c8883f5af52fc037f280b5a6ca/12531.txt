TEXT:
If you see Ron you may want to mention that you think public charge event
is a good idea for us in TX, Today, in our trip meeting decision was to
bump it back to him for decision. (even with recommendations of DPC, vp
communications and others in ovp). I am trying to expedite but would help
i think if you and he discussed.
