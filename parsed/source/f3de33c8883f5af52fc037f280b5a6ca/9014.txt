          FYI -- I'm double-checking with Melissa, but I think she was suggesting
          either releasing the case load numbers on the 19th, to get them into the
          stories about the MDRC Los Angeles study (which is embargoed for
          publication on the 20th) or releasing them on the 21st for stories
          published on the actual anniversary, Aug. 22nd.
