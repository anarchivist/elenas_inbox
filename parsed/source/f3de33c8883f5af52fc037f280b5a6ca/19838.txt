TEXT:
ACF is waffling about whether they will collect these caseload numbers or
not.  I have made it very clear--both to Michael Kharfen and Joan
Lombardi-- for several weeks that we expected numbers through March for
POTUS to announce at May 27th event.  Apparently Olivia has not signed off
on this and therefore the request for data has not gone out to states
(these numbers have been obtained by regional offices calling states, and
Kharfen compiling data).  She is concerned about using .caseload has the
only measure of success.  On the other hand, they have not presented any
viable alternatives, and have not even been able to tell us when we can
expect participation rate data to be complete. While I understand all the
caveats about caseloads, and we can certainly try to frame caseloads as
only one indicator of success, I'm assuming we absolutely want to announce
them.  I think Bruce or Elena needs to call Olivia and make this point.
The event is now two weeks away, and if ACF doesn't get moving, we won't
have the data in time.
