TEXT:
I talked to Beverly Barnes regarding outreach to black commentators (e.g.
Clarence Page, William Raspberry) so that we can give them our side of the
social promotion story and try to generate pro-Administration commentaries
ASAP.  Beverly suggested the possibility of gathering some of them for an
informal briefing next Tues or Wed.  She also suggested a regional group
of reporters as perhaps the most reachable group. She will get in touch
with me on Monday morning with a suggested plan and target list. Thanks
Beverly.
