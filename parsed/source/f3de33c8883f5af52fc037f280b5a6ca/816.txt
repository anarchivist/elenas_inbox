TEXT:
Elena -- Sandy Berger is going to discuss the Golden Venture
detention/supervised release issue with his staff this morning, I
believe.  Can we tell them anything about our view?

Also, I don't have the information about getting hooked into the telecon
you spoke to    me about that NSC is doing involving international
agreements and indigenous people. When we spoke you had mentioned that
you thought that they were trying to schedule it form llam this morning.

thanks
