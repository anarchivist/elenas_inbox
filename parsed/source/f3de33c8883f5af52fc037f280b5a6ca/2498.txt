     MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT
'I.




      X-FROM: '                JOHN HILLEY & GENE SPERLING


      Xv- SUBJECT: '           COMP TIME/ FAMILY MEDICAL LEAVE ACT LEGISLATION


      XH-I·.XxBACKGROUND/ANALYSIS (#

      This memorandum offers options for how to achieve the optimal outcome from the
      current
      legislative debate on comptime and expansion of the Family and Medical
       Leave Act
      (FMLA) .

      This week and next week, the House and Senate labor committees are holding hear
      ings
      regarding comp time legislation: the Ballenger bill in the House and the A
      shcroft bill in the
      Senate.  Both bills address only comp time and not FMLA exp
      ansion, and they provide fewer
      guarantees of employee choice and fewer protecti
      ons against potential abuse than your bill,
      which was sent to.Congress last Sep
      tember.  For example, the Republican bills:

      XK-X'   hp x (#%'0*, .813S@8:<H?A,Xhp x   (#%'0*, .813S@8:<H?AXxl)Do not exclude vuln
      erable workers; (#

      X4-Xx2)Do not include special protections for workers whose employers go
      bankru
      pt or shut down unexpectedly;(#

      X-Xx3)Do not guarantee real choice for employees because they allow
      employers t
      o refuse employees use of comp time if it would unduly
      disrupt operations. (Yo
      ur bill, on the other hand, allowed employees to
      take comp time for FMLA purpos
      es at any time, and to take it for other
      purposes with two weeks notice unless
      it would cause the employer
       substantial and grievous injury.); (#

      XI-Xx4)Allow employers to cash out employees comp time over 80 hours,
      thereby d
      enying them the use of comp time; (#

      XN-XxS)Provide weaker remedies for violations.    Your bill has solutions to all
      of
      these problems. (#

      In addition, the Ashcroft bill has additional provisions that would effectively
       eliminate the 40
      hour week by allowing employers to establish 80 hour biweekly
       schedules and, in certain
      circumstances, to pay employees straight time, not t
      ime and a half, for hours worked over 40
      in a week or 80 in two weeks.   Sen. J


effords plans to mark up the Ashcroft bill on February
26, and Rep. Ballenger p
lans to mark up his bill in early March.

senator Dodd, Sen. Murray, Rep. Clay, and Rep. Maloney have instead introduced
bills to
expand the FMLA.    The bills introduced by Maloney and Murray would ex
pand FMLA for
an additional twentyfour hours for the purposes of routine medica
I care for children and
elderly parents or school related activities, similar t
o your bill. The bills introduced by Dodd
and Clay would lower the threshold 0
f FMLA applicability from 50 employees to 25
employees, which would cover an ad
ditional 10 million employees in small businesses.
"(O*O*O*'''The FMLA bills have support from womens groups and the labor movement
, both of which
are more enthusiastic about dropping the threshold than providi
ng an additional 24 hours of
leave. The labor movement strongly opposes the Re
publican comp time bills, and finds the
provisions in the Ashcroft bill that el
iminate the 40hour work week to be particularly
offensive.   Most Republicans op
pose any expansion of FMLA.

The current legislative strategy among congressional Democratic leaders is to c
riticize the
comp. time bills and try to add the various FMLA expansions to the
Republican bills. Your
bill has not been introduced, nor is there any Democrat
ic version of a comp time bill.' The
labor movement has requested that the Admi
nistration threaten to veto any bill that doesnt 1)
improve the comp time provi
sions to provide real choice and real protections for employees,
and 2) link FM
LA and comp time.


X-II.XxACTIONFORCING EVENT(#

The Vice President will be addressing the AFLCIO at an annual meeting on Februa
ry 18 and
will be forced to address these issues either in remarks or in questi
ons and answers.  Thus, a
decision must be made now regarding whether to adopt
a strategy of insisting on linkage
between FMLA and comp time, and whether to i
ssue any veto threats.  The options are laid
out below.  In each case, the Vice
 President would articulate the Administration position on
February 18 at the A
FLCIO meeting.


X-III.XxOPTIONS(#


X-l.XxOThreaten to veto the bill if your principles are not addressed.O   The Ad
ministration
would layout a set of principles needed for a bill to be truly fa
mily friendly.  We
would say that the bill should include FMLA expansion, and t
hat any bill that doesnt
meet certain principles will be vetoed, but we would n
ot link a veto to FMLA
expansion. These principles are embodied in your bill f
rom last year: (#
Xx(#

XN-XxA)O Real Choice for EmployeesO, including the right to take comp time when
 needed for
FMLA purposes, the right to choose to use comp time for any purpose
 with two weeks
notice to their employer unless use of comp time will cause sub
stantial and grievous
injury to the employer, the right to cash out comp time f
or overtime pay on 15 days
notice and employers cant choose to cash out comp ti
me; and (#


X -XxB) OReal Protection Against Employer AbuseD, including the various protect
ive
provisions in your bill that are not present in the Republican bills, such
as exclusions
for vulnerable workers, special protections in case employers go
bankrupt or close
down unexpectedly, a prohibition against employers substituti
ng comp time for paid
vacation or sick leave benefits, a prohibition against em
ployers penalizing employees
who choose overtime pay instead of comp time, and
strong provisions for
enforcement. (#


XO(-XxC) OPreservation of Basic Worker Rights.O The Administration would threa
ten a veto of
any bill that eliminates the 40 hour work week, as the Ashcroft b
ill does. (#" (0*0*0* '"
X-Pros:XxA.    Would strengthen the position of congressional Democrats arguing t
o improve the
Republican bills. Would encourage congressional Republicans to n
egotiate in an effort
to produce a bill that would become law. (#

XxB.  If the strategy resulted in changes to the bills, it would significantly
improve upon
bills that presently do not carry guarantees of employee choice or
 adequate protection
against employer abuse. (#

XxC. Would b,e welcomed by constituency groups that view the Republican bills a
s a
weakening of employee protection laws, and would strengthen the leadership
position
of Democrats on womens issues. (#
..

     XxD.  Since this strategy doesnt threaten a veto if the FMLA expansion is not i
     n a final
     bill, it has the effect of assisting the Democrats who are trying to
     add FMLA
     expansion to the bills without locking you in to a veto on that specif
     ic issue. (#


     X-Con:XxYou might have to veto a comp time bill, although it would be one that
     would fall far
     short of the family friendly principles you have laid out. (#


     XK-2.XxDThreaten to veto a bill if your principles are not addressed AND FMLA e
     xpansion is
     X4-not included. 0 This strategy is the same as #1 above except that a fourth v
     eto principle
     would be the expansion of FMLA. The rationale is that FMLA and c
     omp time are
     linked family friendly policies.   Since comp time is not mandatory
     , the only guarantee
     that covered workers will have any additional leave is thr
     ough FMLA expansion
     amendments.   FMLA is one of your signature programs and thi
     s is one way to ensure
     its passage in a Republican Congress. (#


     X-Pros:XxSame as A, B & C above.  In addition, the AFLCIO has requested this pa
     rticular
     strategy and veto threat.  Sen. Kennedy also prefers this strategy and
      veto threat. (#


     XN-Cons:XxA.  Sen. Daschle is skeptical that his colleagues will support astra
     tegy that insists on
     FMLA expansion as the price for any comp time bill, howeve
     r strong.  It is difficult to
     defend the logic of refusing to accept one positi
     ve change in the law merely because a
     second positive change has not also been
     made. (#

     XxB.   If the strategy fails to produce a bill that includes FMLA expansion, you
      might
     have to veto a very strong comp time bill just because it doesnt include
      FMLA
     expansion. (#


     x#-3.XxDlntroduce principles for a familyfriendly bill.D We would layout the
     principles listed
     in #1 above and would insist that they are all vital to a fam
     ily friendly bill, but would
     not explicitly threaten a veto. (#


     X#'-Pros:XxA.   Would layout principles for a bill without locking you in to a
     veto. (#
..

     XxB. Would leave open the option of vetoing a weak comp time bill or a bill th
     at fails" (0*0*0*' "to expand FMLA. (#


     X-Cons:XxNot likely to produce changes to the Republican bills, thus could make
      it more likely
     that you face signing a bill that doesnt include sufficient emp
     loyee choice and
     protections. Signing such a bill would have the dual results
     of significantly altering
     the Fair Labor Standards Act without sufficient safeg
     uards and also seriously angering
     the labor movement and disappointing womens g
     roups. (#
