TEXT:
I have the revised version of the notice from SSA that will go to
all families with children on SSI who will be reevaluated as a
result of the new law.   SSA was able to pull back on the original
draft and revise it to reflect helpful comments by advocates and
others.  I promised SSA we would comment by cob today so that they
can get it to the printers in time to ensure that the notices will
meet the deadlines in: the law.
The new version looks much better.
Please let me know if you want'to review it.   If I don't hear
from you within a few hours. I will assume you don't want to.   (I
don't think any of you need to look at it.)
