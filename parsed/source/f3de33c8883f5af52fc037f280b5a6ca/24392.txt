TEXT:
Due to the large volume of users accessing the Holiday Card Database this
morning, we are experiencing maj or delays with the system.. These delays
are
also seriously affecting t~e WAVES application.   To alleviate this
problem, the
deadline for submitting names for Holiday Cards has been extended to next
Wednesday, September 30.

Because of the last minute submission of names and the errors it has
caused,
please do not submit anymore names today.   We will be providing more
information

access the
Holiday Card Database next week.

We apologize for the problems and appreciate your understanding and
