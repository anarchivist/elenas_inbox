      Fund is projected to become insolvent far sooner than Social Security's Trust Fund.
      Both have stated that Medicare's more acute problem deserves serious attention
      and, in fact, have said that addressing Medicare should be the Administration's and
      Congress' first priority. (Senator Breaux is no longer saying Medicare first, but is
      definitely wants the program to get equal billing). How do you respond? Don't
      they have a point?

A:    Assuring a strong, modem Medicare program has always been and always will be a
      top priority for this President. Last year, the President enacted into law arguably the
      most significant changes to Medicare since the program's enactment in 1965.
           A provision in that legislation, one that he strongly supported, was the establishment
      of the Medicare Commission. The Commission, which has 17 Members -- including four
      Administration appointees -- and is chaired by Senator Beaux, is charged with developing
      recommendations to begin dealing with the long-term health care delivery, financing, and
      demographic challenges facing the Medicare program. Because of the President's strong
      commitment to the program, we are closely following the work of the Commission and
      are hopeful that we will be able to embrace its final report, now scheduled to be released
      in March of next year.

      Unlike Medicare, however, we have all benefited from the completion of the work ofthe
      Social Security Advisory Commission. This Commission produced a comprehensive
      analysis of the challenges facing Social Security and produced a series of options that are
      now being seriously reviewed by all parties interested in this critically important program.
       As a result, we now have a historic opportunity to ensure the solvency of Social Security
      well into the next century. We need to respond to this opportunity. Doing so now will
      make it easier for us to focus on the future of Medicare.

 Q:   Are you saying that the President and the Administration will do nothing about
      Medicare until the Commission files its report?

A:    Of course not. The President has and will continue to take administrative actions and
      propose legislative initiatives that strengthen the Medicare program. For example, his
      record on advocating for anti-fraud and program integrity initiatives is clear. As such,
      we are currently reviewing options for this upcoming budget. However, we are doing so
      in a way that complements rather than undermines the Commission's work.
