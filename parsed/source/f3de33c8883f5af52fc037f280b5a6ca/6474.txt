 TEXT:
 I just found out that the tobacco antitrust letter has not even been
 signed yet.  It has been sitting in Ann Harkins office in OLA waiting for
 signature for the last 3 days.  If you guys want this thing to get bumped
 out of the Justice bureaucracy it might take" a phone call to Harkins.

  Could we get a copy of the DeWine letter, and, when it goes up, a copy of
  the McCain letter? It would be good for us to have them for the
  weekend.   Thanks.
