           Update on Embryonic Stem Cell Research Issues

On November 14, 1998, you requested your National Bioethics Advisory
Commission (NBAC) to consider immediately the ethical, medical, and legal


implications associated with the recently reported creation of an
embryonic stem cell that was part human and part cow.  After discussing
the issue at their meeting in Miami this week, NBAC members agreed with
you that profound ethical concerns are involved, and that any attempt to
create a child by combining a human cell and a non-human egg should not be
permitted. The Commission is drafting a detailed response, expected to be
sent tomorrow; they are also preparing to address the broader issues
associated with embryonic stem cell research in general.

Subject:         DAILY REPORT: The Stonecutter's Story

You all know how that old Japanese story begins ...

There once was a Stonecutter. He was busy one day shaping stone, when a
Government Offical came through town. All the shop keepers offered him
free goods, and he was asked to settle disputes among freinds. The
Stonecutter thought to himself, "A Government Official is truely a
powerful person. If I were a Government Official people would respect me,
and I would be powerful. I wish I were a Government Official."

Well, the Stonecutter had no idea what he was wishing for.  Today~,s heQ,s
working furiously -- putting up with long hours, little pay and no
recognition -- to produce bullets for the PresidentD,s Daily Report.  But
the Stonecutter has a secret -- heD,s still happy -- because he knows that
what heD,s doing is an honor.

Enjoy the honor.     please get your your bullets to me by 4:00 pm.
