 Here are my Q's adn A's at last.   Please note that I added a.note to the
 President at the end of the last question -- the intention is to give him
'information on an event so he shouldn't be caught by surprise, but not to
 suggest this be part of an answer.   I'm not sure this format works or is
 appropriate. Any ideas?
