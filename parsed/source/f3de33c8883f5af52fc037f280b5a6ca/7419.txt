TEXT:
At the privacy meeting today, we discussed the following three topics (1)
privacy entity within the government; (2)  industry self-regulation; and
(3) other areas the Government should take a look at such as medical
records, children, etc.  The decisions in these three areas would be
presented as the Administration's privacy package.

(1)    Privacy entity. They seem to be steering toward having the privacy
entity in OMB or some EOP office like NEC or DPC. The discussion focused
more on having the entity within OMB and having contact people at the
agencies to deal with specific issues, particularly those that concern
consumers. OMB's role would focus more on coordinating privacy policy
within the Government.

(2)   Industry self-regulation.  Ira Magaziner talked about the
developments of a consortium of businesses who would agree to post a seal
on their websites, indicating that they protect users' privacy.  There is
envisioned to be enforcement mechanisms for misusing the seal such as
existing procedures at the FTC or DOJ.   The Government is expected to
make a statement generally supportive of the consortium's efforts on July
1, but we would encourage more businesses to join and to go even further
in thinking about specific issues such as children's privacy. 'In the
event that the consortium doesn't seem to be making progress, Secretary
Daley and Magaziner are going to explore other options such as
legislation.

(3)   Exploring other areas. We are also going to explore to see what, if
any, position the Administration should take in areas such as medical
records, genetic, financial, and children.  In addition, there is going to
be an exploration of "profiling" -- the amassing of information about an
individual via his or her social security number and whether we should
propose tighter limits on the use of social security numbers by
non-government entities.
