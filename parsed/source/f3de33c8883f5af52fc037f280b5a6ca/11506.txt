                                  March 3, 1999

SURPLUS

  Q:   Doesn't your plan to reserve part of the surplus for Medicare represent a
       "pass" on real Medicare reform?

  A:   Absolutely not. It is a simple recognition that improving and strengthening
       Medicare requires adequate financing. Every independent Medicare expert
       in the nation has concluded that it is impossible to significantly extend the
       life of the Trust Fund without an infusion of new financial support. Not
       doing so would result in excessive cuts to beneficiaries or health care
       providers. I am convinced my proposal actually. By assuring a sign fie ant
       infusion of much needed revenue, our proposal actually makes it easier for
       Democrats and Republicans to come together to develop reforms that
       s,trengthen the program.


  MEDICARE COMMISSION

  Q:   Senator Breaux is circulating estimates by your own Medicare actuary which
       show that his premium support model saves $372 billion over 10 years. Do
       you agree with the estimate and how do you respond to it?

  A:   The Medicare actuary projects that Senator Beaux's proposal will achieve
       certain savings, from a variety of sources. The premium support reforms
       save between $75 and $100 billion over 10 years, while other changes --such
       as raising the age of eligibility and instituting an income-related
       premium --save another $200 billion or so. These estimates provide
       important information, but the broader challenge of the Commission is to
       review Senator Beaux's premium support model and the other aspects of his
       proposal to determine what overall impact they would have on the program,
       the beneficiaries it serves, and the hospitals, nursing homes, doctors and
       nurses who provide health care services. We look forward to receiving the
       final recommendations from the Commission.

  Q:      Do you support Senator Breaux's Medicare proposal?

  A.   First, let me remind you of my position on Medicare. I believe that we
       should dedicate 15 percent of the pr-ojected surpluses over the next 15 years
       to extending until 2020 the life of the Medicare Trust Fund. As I've
       indicated, however, my preference is to utilize these new resources in the
       context of broader improvements in the program which modernize the
                                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion

      program, make it more efficient, provide for prescription drug benefits, and
      still extend the life of the Trust Fund until 2020. With respect to Senator
      Breaux' proposal, I believe it serves no useful purpose to comment on each
      proposal that emerges as part of the Commission's deliberations. However,
      I will evaluate any proposal to see that it:

             Dedicates Surplus to Secure Medicare until 2020.
             Modernizes Medicare and Make It More Competitive.
             Guarantees Defined Set of Benefits wlo Excessive New Costs to
             Beneficiaries
             Usc Savings from Reform to Help Fund a Prescription Drug Benefit.

We look forward to working with Senator Breaux and the rest of the Commission as
they move forward with their important work.

Q:    The Medicare Commission is proposing to raise the Medicare eligibility age
      from 65 to 67 --making it consistent with phase-up for Social Security;
      What is the Administration's position on this proposal?

A:    As we have said many times, we have serious concerns about raising the
      Medicare eligibility age. I am unaware of any policy anyone has put forth
      that would ensure that such a proposal would not add more Americans to the
      ranks of the uninsured. Indeed, I have emphasized that we need to focus
      our attention on the most rapidly growing group of uninsured Americans--
      Americans between the ages of 55 and 65. So, I view any such proposal with
      a good bit of skepticism.

      NOTE: On Tuesday, Senator Breaux told some House Blue Dog Democrats
      that he would drop this proposal.

Q:    Senator Breaux is recommending an income-related premium. Do you
      su pport this?

A:    r am open to this concept. However, any such proposal would have to be
      considered in the context of an entire package of reforms.

PRESCRIPTION DRUGS


Q:    You recently said that a drug benefit should only be for those people who .
      need it. Were you suggesting your openness to a more limited drug benefit?

A:     Not at all. 1 was simply stating it is possible to design an acceptable drug
      benefit for Medicare beneficiaries that is optional. Many Americans have a
      comprehensive retiree health drug benefit, though fewer each year, and
                                                                          Hex-Oump Conversion '

     might not opt for the new Medicare benefit. I do believe, however, that any
     such drug benefit should be affordable and accessible to all Medicare
     bcneficiaries, and that it was made available through the traditional fee for
     service plan as well as Medicare managed care options. This would ensure
     that all Medicare beneficiaries, particularly those who live in rural areas
     without private plan options, have access to an affordable drug benefit.

Q.   Your Medicare Commission appointees have said that they would only
     support the recommendations of the Medicare Commission if they include a
     prescription drug benefit. Is this a litmus test for you?

A.   Any proposal to provide a long-overdue prescription drug benefit should
     take place within the context of broader Medicare reform. However, I
     helieve that a meaningful prescription drug benefit for all beneficiaries can
     and should be included in any such proposal. We have learned that
     successfully achieving meaningful Medicare reform can only happen in a
     hipartisan fashion. For this reason, we look forward to working with
     members on both sides of the aisle to add this important benefit this year.

Q.   Won't a prescription drug benefit, even in the context of broader reforms,
     result in higher Medicare spending? How can it be afforded at a time when
     the program is facing a serious financing crisis?

A.   Senator Breaux has said that not having a prescription drug benefit in 2000
     is like not having coverage for doctor's visits in 1965. Prescription drugs
     have become an essential part of treatments and cures, and are expected to
     play an even greater role in health care in the next century. I believe that
     additional savings from making Medicare more efficient should be used to
     hclp finance a long-overdue prescription drug benefit for all Medicare
     beneficiaries. It would be penny-wise and pound-foolish not to add this
     benefit.

Q.   Is it true, as some Medicare Commission appointees suggest, that since 65
     percent of Medicare beneficiaries already have some type of coverage, a new
     Medicare drug benefit would simply replace private dollars with government
     Sll hsidies?


A.   Absolutely not. Over 13 million Medicare beneficiaries have no coverage.
     or that 6S percent frequently cited, 38 percent have inadequate or declining
     private coverage, 20 percent have Federally subsidized coverage through
     Medicare managed care or Medicaid, and 7 percent have coverage that
     changes in the course of the year. Thus, there is no stable, private source of
     financing for this critical benefit. Moreover, it would be virtually
     impossible to design a policy that only targets those beneficiaries without
     coverage, since existing coverage is so rapidly changing.
