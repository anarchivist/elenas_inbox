                    PRESIDENT CLINTON URGES PASSAGE OF FEDERAL
                      HATE CRIMES BILL, ANNOUNCES PARTNERSHIP
                     TO TEACH TOLERANCE IN MIDDLE SCHOOLS, AND
                 SIGNS DIRECTIVE TO INCREASE HATE CRIMES REPORTING
                                      April 6, 1999

     Today President Clinton applauded public and private efforts to teach children about tolerance
     and urged Congress to quickly pass the pending federal hate crimes legislation. This legislation
     strengthens the existing federal hate crimes law by (1) extending the situations where
     prosecutions can be brought for violent crimes motivated by bias based on race, color, religion,
     or national origin; and (2) expanding the federal hate crimes statute to protect against hate crimes
     based on sexual orientation, gender, or disability. The President also announced a new
     public-private partnership which will focus attention on issues of hate, tolerance, and diversity in
     middle-grade schools. Finally, the President called on the Departments of Justice and Education
     to include hate crimes in its annual report card on school safety and to report on hate crimes and
     bias on college campuses.

     Urging Passage of Expanded Federal Hate Crimes Law. The President urged Congress to
     pass the bipartisan Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 1999, which expands a principal federal hate
     crimes statute. The current statute prohibits acts of violence that are based on a person's race,
     color, religion, or national origin and that are intended to interfere with certain specified federally
     protected activities. The proposed legislation would extend the situations where prosecutions
     could be brought by making these acts of violence illegal even if they did not interfere with
     federally protected activities. In addition, the legislation would authorize the Department of
     Justice to prosecute individuals who commit violent crimes against others because of the victim's
     sexual orientation, gender, or disability. Current federal law does not cover these cases.

     Announcing Public-Private Partnership to Create a Middle-School Program about
     Tolerance. The President announced a public-private partnership that will develop a program
     for middle-school students to teach tolerance in the classroom and in their daily lives. The
     members of the partnership are the Departments of Justice and Education and AT&T, Court TV,
     the National Middle School Association, the Anti-Defamation League, and Cable in the
     Classroom. This effort is supported by the NAACP, the Leadership Conference for Civil
     Rights, the National Council of La Raza, the National Asian Pacific American Legal Consortium,
     the National Association of Protection and Advocacy Systems, the National Education
     Association, and the National School Boards Association, and the Partnership expects support
     from other organizations that deal with these issues. Recognizing that tolerance cannot be
     taught in a single day and that raising awareness of diversity should be integrated into students'
     daily lives, this public-private partnership -- entitled "Dealing with Our Differences" -- will
     provide an opportunity for middle-school students to learn about the harmful impact of
     intolerance, and will highlight positive ways that young adolescents are dealing with diversity
     issues. The Partnership will develop in-school lessons and activities supported with cable TV
     programming; videos and websites; a nationally-televised forum on diversity and tolerance at the
     end of October; and post-show lessons and activities.

Directing the Education and Justice Departments to Collect Data About Hate Crimes in
Schools and Colleges. In order to better understand the problem of hate crimes and intolerance
among young people, the President called on the Departments of Justice and Education to include
in their annual report card on school safety a new section on hate crimes among young people,
both at and away from school. In addition, the President directed the Department of Education,
with appropriate assistance from the Department of Justice, to collect data on hate crime and bias
on college campuses for periodic publication.
