TEXT:
Elena:     I missed you after the 7:45 this morning, but given the VP's

central role in advising the President on this, I assume you will insure

that in:    (1) any group on the response to the NC decision, Don Gipps and

Ginny Terzano of our office are included;- (2) any group on the Tobacco

settlement talks, Don Gipps and Charles Burson of our office are included.



Let me know if this poses a problem.      Thanks!
