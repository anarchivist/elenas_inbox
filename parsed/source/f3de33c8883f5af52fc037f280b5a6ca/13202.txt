TEXT:
The Senate Energy Committee and the House timber task force are
having a joint hearing Wednesday morning on the Administration's
implementation of the timber provisions of the rescissions act.
Apparently the hearing will focus primarily, but not exclusively,
on timber salvage activities.
As of this moment, we're waiting for draft testimony from
USDA/USFS and for clarification as to who the USDA witness will
be. Katie and TJ both feel strongly that Lyons, not Thomas,
should represent the Administration. TJ is trying to reach Greg
Frazier now to make sure things are on track.
We're expecting the committee/task force members to use the event
to grill our witnesses on the President's plans for amendments to
the timber provisions of the rescissions bill.
I'll be following this closely, as will Ruth Saunders at OMB.   If
you'd like more info, give me a ring or e-mail and I'll try to
get you what you need.
