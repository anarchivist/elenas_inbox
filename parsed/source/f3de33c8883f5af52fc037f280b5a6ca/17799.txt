TEXT:
We are looking for an action item for the Nov. 19 meeting.   As you know,
the Departments of Education and Justice have drafted a self-assessment
guide for colleges and universities that are implementing affirmative
action programs in a post-Adarand world.  It has been suggested to me that
the guide could be released by the Administration (or Education or DOJ) in
conjunction with the November 19 meeting of the Board, which will focus on
the value of diversity in higher education.   (This action would be similar
to the policy announcements made by the Department of Housing and Urban
Development in conjunction wit the Sept. 30 Advisory Board meeting.)   The
message would be that, consistent with the President's "mend it, don't end
it" position, coleges and universities may use affirmative aciton but only
where such programs are fully consistent with existing constitutional and
statutory requirements.

What do you think?   Should I seek any other views on this suggestion?
