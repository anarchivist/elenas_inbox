TEXT:
There is apparently an L.A. Times article today that indicates that
Governor Wilson's position on providing certain health-related benefits to
undocumented immigrants is changing -- basically a necessary move from
political rhetoric to the real world. He is also calling for State
agencies to report on their verification procedures.  I have not seen the
article yet, but we need to follow the State's verification process
closely.

I spoke with Lisa Brown yesterday and she says that the process is on
track for getting the A.G. interim verification guidelines signed by the
A.G. and out at the end of next week.

thanks
