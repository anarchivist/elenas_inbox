TEXT:
I just wanted to alert you that we just faxed to you a Justice
letter on S 1018, Private Relief for Clarence Stewart (LRM
#4447), and the turnaround time on this letter is very short (the
deadline is 3:30pm TODAY, May 15th).  In its letter, Justice
discusses its constitutional concerns about S 1018.
The S. Governmental Affairs Committee plans to mark S 1018 up
TOMORROW, May 16th.  Consequently OMB needs to clear this letter
ASAP TODAY.
Therefore, please provide me your comments on this letter no
later than 3:30pm TODAY (preferably sooner if possible).   Your
prompt attention to Justice's letter is greatly appreciated.
Thanks.
