    TEXT:
    I realized after sending the revised version that I neglected to change
    the opening paragraph to reflect that we were sending an options memo
    rather than a strategy update.  Below is the new language for the opening
    paragraph.

    On June 4, the House Education and Workforce Committee reported H.R. 3982,
    the English Fluency Act, introduced by. Rep. Frank R.iggs. This bill raises
    many of the same programmatic issues and political dynamics as the Unz
    Initiative in California.   The purpose of this memo is to update you on
    this proposal and the development of an Administration alternative, and to
    present you with options for how to proceed.
