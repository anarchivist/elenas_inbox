      Correct me if I'm wrong - - but I understand from the AA meeting today
      there will be a "spin-off" Leg Affairs Sub Group meeting.  I've reserved
      the Roosevelt Room from 2:15-3:00 pm for this meeting tomorrow (Tuesday,
      July 15). I hope that everyone can make it.

      Attendees:

      Sylvia Mathews
      Gene Sperling
      Tracey Thornton
      Janet Murguia
      Richard Hayes
      Peter Jacoby
      Maria Echaveste
      Andy Blocker
      Al Maldon
      Susan Liss
      Andy Mayock
      Elena Kagan/Bruce Reed
