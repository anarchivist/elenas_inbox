TEXT:
The VP is scheduled to do a .08 event tomorrow.  Right now, they don't"
have an announcement, but are planning to push ISTEA conferees on .08 and
tie it to the lOth anniversary of the worst drunk driving crash in US
history which falls on Thursday. "Two questions:

1) Should they release the .08 report back to the President on the
directive? Begala had originally asked me to hold it for a possible
Presidential release.

2) Should the VP announce the 1997 DOT data on the # of traffic
fatalities? DOT is very excited about the percentage of alcohol-related
fatalities dropping to its lowest level since they started collecting the
data -- and will be highlighting this in their press release.   They were
planning on releasing the report this week, and it could be ready for
tomorrow if we want to have the VP announce. There is no state-by-state
breakout on the #'s of drunk driving deaths to give us good or bad news on
states with .08 laws.   DOT doesn't want to hold the fatality data past
next week -- as it is, they are concerned it could leak out if they don't
release it this week.

Please let me know ASAP if you think the VP should announce either report.

Thanks,
Leanne
