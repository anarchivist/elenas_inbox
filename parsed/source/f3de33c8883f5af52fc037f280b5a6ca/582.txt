TEXT:


        In conjunction with the on-going Federal investigations of the D.C.,
Atlanta, and Tulsa bombings, President Clinton has directed the Attorney General
to conduct a nation-wide security assessment of reproductive health clinics
through each United States Attorney's office and based on that assessment
determine:
        *       the need for additional U.S. Marshals manpower and resources for
                the security of clinics and other Justice Department resources;
                and
        *       Report back to the President in 15 days.

        In the Attorney General's response to the President, she can dedicate $5
million out of her existing Working Capitol Fund to the U.S. Marshals to provide
additional security at clinics.  This amount is equal to the amount that was
spent in FY 95, which was the high mark for the FACE program.  In addition, the
FY 98 budget submission to Congress can include language indicating that the
Civil Rights Division and the U.S. Marshals Service will be seeking additional
funds for their clinic violence programs.
