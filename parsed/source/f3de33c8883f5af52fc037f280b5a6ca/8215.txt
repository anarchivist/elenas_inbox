 TEXT:
 Well, I'm revising the memo again, so you can go one more day without
 reading it!
·We found out this afternoon that the Riggs bilingual bill will be added to
 the Labor-HHS-Education appropriations bill at mark-up next week.
 Subcommittee dem's are meeting tomorrow to figure out how they want to
 respond--we have no intelligence on where they are yet (mainly because they
  don't know where they are yet), but should know more tomorrow morning.

In addition to affecting the timing and changing some of the key players,
attaching this bill to the approps bill complicates our options in a
number of respects:

1. The issue could become lost in the larger fight over education
funding.   Because the underlying bill is going to be so clearly
unacceptable to us and to Democrats (the funding level will be too low
overall, key priorities such as technology and goals 2000 will be cut in
real terms or funded at lower levels than our request; there will be other
riders on testing and perhaps on block grants), we may want to frame the
fight over other issues, and the bilingual issue could simply get lost in
the larger battle.

2.  There may not be a direct floor vote on bilingual ed.  The dems could
conceivably assume that the Senate and WH will take care of this issue in
conference or through a veto, and decide to not try to strip or alter this
provision on the floor.  From their point of view, not having a floor vote
could help avoid dividing the· party, and strengthen the Senate's hand in
conference. No hint that this is where they would come out, but it
wouldn't surprise me.

As I rewrite the memo tonight and tomorrow morning based on what we learn
from committee dems, I think we may well wind up with 3, rather than 2
options. These would be;

1. Send up our bill ASAP regardless of the views of the CHC and other
Dems, as POTUS seems inclined to do.

2. Work with CHC and House Dems on need for, and timing of alternative --
the "let's keep the party unified" strategy (by the way, before we learned
that Riggs would be included on the appropriations bill, Tim Roemer told


us he definitely wanted an alternative to Riggs when it came to the
floor.  We told him to round up his like-minded friends and get the
message to the CHC.)

3. Threaten to veto the appropriations bill over a number of issues
including Riggs, keep repeating our view of the right way to reform
bilingual ed, and promise to propose legislation next year based on· our
principles.

This may all change tomorrow as we talk to the appropriators and others.

I'll get you a new memo ASAP tomorrow. We may still need to act quickly.
Besides, I'm off all next week, and want to get this done before COB
Friday.
