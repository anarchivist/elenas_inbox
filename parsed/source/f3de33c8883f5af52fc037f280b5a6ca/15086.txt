TEXT:
I realize that not everyone can make it -- but we would like to begin
these meetings with one from 3:30-4 in OEOB 160 today/Thursday. The
purpose is to coordinate activities among the policy councils and cabinet
affairs, pursuant to discussions last week between Kitty and
representatives of the policy councils.   Thank you.
