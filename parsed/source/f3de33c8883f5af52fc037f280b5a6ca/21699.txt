Here's a bullet for the weekly ... if it's not too late ... it pretty much
tracks the Chicago press release: .. jc3

Crime -- Chicago Gun Industry Law Suit -- As you know, this past Thursday
the City of Chicago and Cook County filed suit against the gun industry,
charging it with flooding Chicago with illegal guns -- knowing they will
be used to commit crimes against and injure Chicagoans. This suit comes
at the end of a 3-month investigation in which Chicago police officers --
posing as criminals -- bought 171 guns from suburban gun shops, whose
personnel repeatedly helped them evade gun laws. Named as defendants in
the suit are 12 gun shops from surrounding suburbs, 22 gun manufacturers
and 4 gun distributors. The suit claims that the defendants have "created
a public nuisance" because they "knowingly design, market and distribute
firearms in order to facilitate their illegal entry into and possession in
Chicago, where they are illegal to possess -- and where they are often
used in crimes." The suit seeks $433 million in damages for costs
incurred since 1994 by the Chicago Police Department, the Chicago Fire
Department's emergency medical services, the City Law Department, Cook
County Hospital and the Cook County criminal justice system.
