          SERVICE


           1. AmeriCorps Seniors. In the wake of John Glenn's return to space, we have an opportunity
         . to give other senior citizens a mission. We propose adding $25 million to the current
           AmeriCorps program to create a senior corps of 10,000 volunteers to serve as tutors and
           mentors and in afterschool programs. We would build on a successful demonstration program
           that recruits seniors to serve 15-20 hours per week over a fixed period of time in schools and
           other community centers. In exchange, seniors would be eligible for small incentives, including
           awards to participate in senior learning programs. By inspiring responsibility among seniors,
           this initiative would provide an ideal complement to Social Security reform. In the next century,
           it will become commonplace for people to live to be 100; they will need and want things to do.
           John Glenn has expressed some interest in playing a role in AmeriCorps now that he's retired.
           We could invite him back to the State of the Union and place him in charge of a national effort to
           inspire seniors to serve. (COST: $25 million above FY99.)

         2. Expand AmeriCorps. We propose expanding the AmeriCorps program from its current
         level of 50,000 members per year to approximately 70,000 per year, with the goal of reaching
         100,000 per year by the end of this Administration. These additional members could be
         targeted to serve primarily in after-school and summer school programs. (COST: $75 million
         above FY99.)

          3. Expand Service Component of Work-Study Program. Nearly 1 million students now receive
          federal work-study funding. Despite our efforts, colleges and universities are required to
          use only 7% of their work-study money for students employed in community service. The
          higher education lobby would object, but we could propose a substantial increase in that
          requirement -- e.g., phasing it up to 25% over the next 3 years. (COST: none.)


          TOBACCO

          1. State Menu. Our best vehicle for enacting tobacco legislation next year will be a
          legislative waiver of federal Medicaid claims to the states' expected $200 billion settlement
          with the tobacco companies. We will seek bipartisan agreement on a menu of uses for the
          federal share of state money, with tobacco control and child care as our top priorities. We
          will try to use this measure as a vehicle for other key elements of our tobacco policy, such
          as FDA jurisdiction and warning labels. (COST: In the end, this may be the way to get
          Congress to pay for child care, but we do not recommend using this as the child care offset
          in our budget.)

         2. Price Increase. One of the most difficult budget decisions will be whether to assume a
         tobacco tax increase in our budget request, and if so, what to do with the money. Proponents
         argue that a substantial price increase is an essential part of our efforts to reduce youth smoking,
         and we need the money to pay for new initiatives. Others argue that once again using tobacco as
         a honeypot will hurt our ability to pass tobacco legislation and undermine the credibility of our

                                                                           Automated Records Management System
                                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion




          entire budget, since a big tax hike is unlikely to pass. Ifwe do assume tobacco revenue, the
          candidates for it include: I) assistance to tobacco fanners (about $1 billion a year); 2) the
          long-tenn care tax credit (about $1 billion a year); 3) other tax cuts, such as a child care /
          stay-at-home tax credit and/or a reduction in the marriage penalty; 4) Nlli research; 5) the
          Medicare trust fund and/or a new drug benefit for Medicare beneficiaries in managed care.

                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion
