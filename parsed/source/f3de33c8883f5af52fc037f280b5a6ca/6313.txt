STATEMENT BY VICE PRESIDENT AL GORE
ANNOUNCEMENT OF "THE HEALTHY KIDS ACT"
WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY ll, 1998

        Today, we take a crucial step forward in the fight against teen
smoking    and the next big step toward writing last yearO,s tobacco
settlement into law.

        For years, AmericaO,s parents and families have been outmatched --
by multi-million dollar ad campaigns targeted at our children. By secret
strategies to hide the deadly effects of smoking. By nicotine addiction
that captures 3,000 of our children every day -- and costs l,OOO of them
their lives.

        Over the past five years, President Clinton and I have been
determined to change all that -- to protect our children from the
number-one preventable cause of death in this country. We enacted the
toughest-ever measures to cut-off childrenO,s access to tobacco, and the
tobacco companies came to the bargaining table -- because they knew we
meant business.

        Now we have an opportunity to build on the landmark tobacco
settlement that was reached last June. We have a chance to pass
bipartisan, comprehensive legislation that dramatically reduces teen
smoking and changes the way tobacco companies do business forever.

        The President has made clear that there are five core principles
that must be met for any bill to receive his signature: It must raise the


price of cigarettes by up to $1.50 a pack over the next 10 years, with
penalties on the tobacco industry if it keeps marketing to children.   It
must give the FDA full authority to regulate nicotine as a drug.  It must
require tobacco companies to disclose information on the dangers of their
products.  It must advance other crucial health goals, like reducing
second-hand smoke. And it must protect the economic welfare of tobacco
farmers and their communities.

        Today, just two weeks after Congress has come back to work,
Senator Conrad and his colleagues have come forward with legislation that
meets all five principles -- and therefore meets AmericaO,s challenge of
reducing teen smoking.  IO,m grateful for their leadership. The President
and I look forward to working with them -- and with members of both
houses, and both parties -- to shape the best ideas and proposals into a
bipartisan, comprehensive solution to this crushing public health problem.

        I want to emphasize that any successful bill must have broad,
bipartisan support. There are a great many Republicans in both houses of
Congress who care very deeply about this issue   -- and the President and
I will support any bill, Republican or Democratic, that meets our five
core principles.

        But I am especially pleased that the Healthy Kids Act, very first
bill to be proposed, meets those principles, and makes them the starting
point for this legislative debate.  Teen smoking is a comprehensive
problem -- and it demands a comprehensive solution. When it comes to
protecting our children, half a loaf isnO,t good enough. That is why the.
President and I will not support legislation that fails to meet all five
principles -- including a substantial price increase on a pack of
cigarettes, along with other measures to cut teen smoking in half.

        Our call for a price increase is not about money; itO,s about our
childrenO,s health. Without a substantial increase in the price of a pack
of cigarettes, we simply will not achieve our goal of dramatically
reducing teen smoking. And that has always been our sole and central goal.

        I ask every member of Congress, of both parties: follow the
example of these Senators. Support this legislation, or come forward with
your own bill that meets our.five principles. This can be the Congress
that finally protects our children from nicotine addiction and disease --
and gives America the healthy kids and families we deserve.
