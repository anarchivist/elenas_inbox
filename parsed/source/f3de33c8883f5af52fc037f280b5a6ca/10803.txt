TEXT:
I wanted to flag two issues that have arise regarding fathers and Welfare
to Work reauthorization:

1) We had p'roposed to make clear states and localities would have the
option of denying services to a father who has another child out of
wedlock, a policy roughly parallel to the family cap for moms. HHS is
adamently opposed to this.   I've found one of their reasons persuasive
affirmatively proposing this could make it difficult to rally support for
our proposal among many of the religious social service providers such as
Catholic Charities, whose help we need in reauthorization. Even if we
don't propose it, localities could decide to exclude these fathers.    Thus
we propose to drop it.

2) A question arose regarding what constitutes "work" for a minor father
who hasn't finished high school. We'd propose to allow attending high
school or GED to count for this group, as it does for minor moms in TANF.
A father could work instead or in addition to school.  OK by you?
