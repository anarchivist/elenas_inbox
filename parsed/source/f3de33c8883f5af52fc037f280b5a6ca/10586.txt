            TEXT:
               AG Michael Moore (D) dropped out of the gov. race 1/6, "stunning
            political
                        observers who considered him the front-runner" for the Dem nod.
            While Moore plans to
                        run for a fourth term as AG, he would not rule out a "future
            run" for gov. or U.S. Senate.
                        Moore: "I've received a lot of support and encouragement over
            the last year to run for
                        governor. The truth of the matter is my heart's not in that
            race." Moore said he believes
                        he can "accomplish more" as AG -- including "additional work on
            his landmark lawsuit
                        against the tobacco industry" that will give MS $3.36B over 25
            years. Moore's decision
                        leaves LG Ronnie Musgrove (D) as the .only big-name Dem running
            to replace
                        term-limited Gov. Kirk Fordice (R). Musgrove will meet James
            "Booty" Hunt,
                        Carrie Harris and Katie Perrone in the 8/3 primary. Musgrove
            "said he had been
                        planning all along to run against Moore" for the Dem nod. Moore
            said he "feared that
                        everything he has worked for since becoming" AG, including
            fighting the tobacco
                        industry, would have been threatened had be become" gov.
             (Cassreino, Biloxi Sun
                        Herald, 1/7).
                              Moore, who did not endorse Musgrove, "said polls showed
            he was the frontrunner"
                        for gov. Moore: "The money was there. The numbers were
            tremendous. The only thing
                        that was missing was my heart wasn't in it . . ,. I was being
            truthful with myself" (Holland,
                        AP, 1/7).



                       An Unannounced Announcement? In Line To Replace Reno?
                             In October, Moore told his staff and the press that he
            would run. In fact, bumper
                       stickers saying "Moore/Governor" had already started appearing
            on some cars.
                       "Rumors" of Moore's decision not to run "flew through" MS on
            1/6, "so much so that
                       Moore returned from" DC and preempted his own plans to have a


      news conf. on 1/8
                 announcing his decision. Moore's trip to DC "fueled speculation
      he is in line to replace
                 ailing" AG Janet Reno. Moore "did not substantiate the rumors
      but said he'd be lying if
                 he said he wouldn't accept such an opportunity" (Wagster,
      Jackson Clarion-Ledger,
                 1/7). Likely GOPers: ex-LG Eddie Briggs, eX-Rep. Mike Parker,
      state Rep. Charlie
                 Williams and Crystal Springs Mayor Dan Gibson.   (Back to
