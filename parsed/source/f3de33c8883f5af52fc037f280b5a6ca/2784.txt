TEXT:
Michelle/Rahm:

Following up on yesterday's meeting with respect to upcoming statements on
Supreme Court decisions, we or Justice don't know what sex offender case
your talking about .. ?

There are no cases concerning community notification before the Court.
And the only sex offender case currently being considered deals with the
civil commitment of a Kansas sex offender who was not determined to be
mentally ill.  DOJ/Kent also mentioned that they specifically chose not to
file an amicus brief in this case.

Is there some other case in some other court on which we should comment?

Jose'
