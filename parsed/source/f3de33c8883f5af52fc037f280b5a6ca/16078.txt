 RE:     URGENT -- Budget ConfereesD, Letter


  Enclosed is the draft conference letter. Unfortunately, we need you to turn
 this around
  in short order. Congress has requested that we deliver it as soon as
 possible, and we
  want to do so by mid-day.  Please provide us with any mark-ups of hard copy by
 9 a.m.
  tomorrow (Wednesday) -- at the latest.  Unfortunately, we wonD,t be able to
 use electronic
  comments.  Larry is in Room 253 or at fax 5-6818. Lisa is in Room 249 or at
 fax 5-3729.

  We apologize for the short turn-around, but our staffs have been crashing all
 day just
  to get this draft done for your perusal and, for many reasons, we believe it
 will help our
  efforts to deliver our views as specifically and as quickly as possible.

  Thank you for your help.
