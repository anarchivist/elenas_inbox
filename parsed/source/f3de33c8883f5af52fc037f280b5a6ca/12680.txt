                    CBS Pulls Show on Violence Concerns

                    By David Bauder
                    AP Television Writer

                    NEW YORK (AP)   -- CBS left a drama about mobsters off its
fall
                    prime-time schedule because of concerns about violent
programming in
                    the wake of the Littleton school massacre.

                     --It's not the right time to have people being whacked
on the streets of
                    New York,"   CBS President Leslie Moonves said Wednesday.

                    Moonves said he screened the pilot for a new drama,
--Falcone,' , the
                  week after 13 people at Columbine High School in
Littleton, Colo. were
                  killed by two teen-aged boys who later killed
themselves. The massacre
                  happened on April 20.

                     - -It did affect us.   It really did, ' , he said.

                    The hour-long television drama is about a mob war in New
York City.
                    The lead character, Joe Falcone, must choose between two
rivals trying to
                  take control of organized crime. Moonves said it was
similar to the movie,
                  - -Donnie Brasco. ' ,

                    While it's not fair to blame the media for the rampage,
Moonves said that
                   --anyone who thinks the media has nothing to do with
this is an idiot.' ,


                   "We felt a responsibility not to put it on now, "     he
said. " I t just didn't feel
                   right. ' ,

                    CBS announced its prime-time schedule on Wednesday and
included six
                    new series. "Falcone"   is still being considered as a
midseason
                    replacement, Moonves said.

                    The WB network is also reportedly considering what to do
with its
                    season-ending episode of "Buffy, the Vampire Slayer' ,
that treads
                    uncomfortably close to Littleton.

                    In the episode scheduled to air next week, heavily armed
students at
                   Buffy's high school try to confront the town's mayor,
who has been turned
                   into a monster. WB officials didn't return calls for
comment Wednesday.
