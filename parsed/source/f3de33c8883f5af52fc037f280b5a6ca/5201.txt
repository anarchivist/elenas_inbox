TEXT:
I spoke with Peter-- he says that DC approps is supposed to come up this
afternoon in the Senate and may get passed by the House as early as
tonight.

Our chances of getting Haitians and NJB are still unclear but looking less
than optimal.   In addition, it looks like there will be report language
which will ask the Justice Department to use its discretion to give.
Salvadorans and Guatamalans an easier standard in their suspension cases
(apparently Abraham favors this too).

We need to decide our position on an easier standard for
Salvadorans/Guatamalans and what kind of future commitment we want to make
for Haitians who may get left out of this deal.  The signing statement
provides an opportunity for the President to say something on these
fronts.  Since he may be signing this as soon as tomorrow, Peter. said we
should meet late today to get these policy issues resolved.

I'm setting up something for 5:00pm today in room 231 and inviting the
usual suspects.
