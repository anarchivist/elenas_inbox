  Subject:         HHS letter on H.R. 1818

  Yesterday, you should have received a draft HHS letter on H.R. 1818, the
  Juvenile Crime Control and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1997. The letter
  voiced HHS' support for Title II of the bill. Title II would re-authorize
  and amend the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act (see LRM MDH90) .

  Collin
