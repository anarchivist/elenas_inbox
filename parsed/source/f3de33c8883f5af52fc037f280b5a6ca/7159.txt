WASHINGTON (April 20, 1998 1:19 p.m. EDT http://www.nando.net) --
President Clinton Monday
urged Congress to pass tough legislation on regulating tobacco, despite
House Speaker Newt
Gingrich's prediction that such a bill didn't have much of a chance. "We a
re fighting for the lives of
our children," the president said.

  In a statement in the White House Rose Garden, Clinton said he hopes
  Gingrich, R-Ga., would
  change his mind and support the legislation. The speaker said during the
  weekend that the tax
  increase and new regulatory power proposed in the bill made it too liberal
  for the
" conservative-dominated House to accept.

"Before his recent comments, I had been encouraged," Clinton said. "He
baSically said he would not
permit us to take a stronger position than he did. I certainly hope he
will return to his former position.
We" need everybody working together."

The legislation, which passed the Senate Commerce Committee on a 19-1
vote, would codify a
settlement reached last year between the tobacco industry and state
attorneys general to help states
recover the costs of treating smoking related illnesses and help tobacco
companies shield themselves
from future lawsuits.

But the bill, as proposed by Sen. John MCCain, R-Ariz., would cost


cigarette makers an estimated
$516 billion over 25 years, much more than the amount of the settlement.
Tobacco companies claim
the cost would be tens of billions of dollars higher and oppose the
measure.

The president decried the industry's reversal, saying the entire country
has a responsibility to put a
stop to "predatory practices by tobacco companies that have targeted our
children."

"The tobacco industry seeks, once again, to put its bottom line against
our bottom line," Clinton said.
"We are fighting for the lives of our children. I believe the majority of
American people and, indeed,
the majority of Congress ... will see this for what it is: a tobacco
industry smokescreen."
