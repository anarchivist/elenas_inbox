        Welfare Reform -- Vice Presidential Welfare-to-Work Event: On Friday, November
20th the Vice President will announce the second round of Welfare-to-Work competitive grants
at a town hall meeting with civic and faith-based organizations; employers, and individuals who
have moved from welfare to work. You announced the first round of competitive grants at a
Welfare to Work event in late May. While the Department of Labor is still finalizing the grant
awards, we expect to award approximately 75 new grants totaling over $250 million. The Vice
President will be joined by Secretary Herman and we expect several other Cabinet Secretaries to
amplify this message at similar events around the country.

        Welfare Reform -- Caseload Dynamics: A new study presented at the Southern
Economic Association meeting last week sheds some important new light on the employment
rates of families leaving the welfare rolls. The report tracked welfare recipients in Atlanta,
Baltimore, Houston, and Kansas City by matching welfare case data with employment data
submitted by employers through the Unemployment Insurance reporting system. All four cities
have experienced substantial caseload declines over the last few years, as well as substantial
increases in the rates oflong-term recipients leaving the welfare rolls (although because short
term recipients are leaving the rolls at even greater rates, the proportion of the caseload that is
long-term recipients is still growing). Most significantly, the study found that the proportion of .
those leaving welfare and going to work has increased in all four cities. Specifically, between
early 1993 and late 1997, the proportion of people who were working in the quarter after they left
the rolls increased from 55% to 67% in Kansas City, 47% to 57% in Atlanta, 45% to 56% in
Baltimore, and 43% to 47% in Houston.

         Tobacco -- Proposed State Settlement: As you know, the eight state Attorneys General
that have been negotiating with the tobacco industry have reached a tentative settlement which is
now being shopped to the other states. As we understand it -- and we haven't seen any paper yet
-- the settlement provides states with about $220-$230 billion over 25 years (more than the $196
billion they would have gotten under the June 20th settlement). The settlement will create a
fund, about $300 million a year, for counteradvertising and public education campaigns. The
advertising restrictions are akin to those adopted in the Minnesota settlement, banning billboards,
paid product placements, and promotional items with brand names or logos (such as hats and
gym bags). While the settlement would forbid marketing targeted at children, it would not go as
far as the FDA rule in restricting images that appeal to children (the rule limits advertising to
black-and-white text for all billboards, point of sale promotions, and publications, except those
with a predominant adult readership or at adult only facilities) and the settlement would allow
some sports sponsorships and retail store ads. The proposed settlement does not require
companies to pass through the settlement costs to consumers, and Wall Street analyst Gary Black
predicts that companies will increase their price by $.15 per pack rather than the full $.35. The
settlement will not have any provisions for farmers. States have until November 20th to decide
whether to sign onto the deal.

        [Note: this is based on BR's notes of his conversation with AG Gregoire and reports from
the press and Wall Street analysts and will likely need to be updated Friday for new information.]
