TEXT:
Below is a draft privacy executive memo that the VP plans on announcing on
Thursday. The memo basically directs the agencies to do what they are
already supposed to be doing pursuant to the Privacy Act. More
specifically, the memo (1) establishes a policy on privacy throughout the
federal government; (2) has agencies review their use of the Privacy Act
procedures, particularly the "routine use" exemption which allows the
information to be disseminated; and (3)   provides for OMB to do a report
on privacy within the federal government.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE HEADS OF EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENTS AND
AGENCIES

SUBJECT:        Privacy

        Privacy is a cherished American value, closely linked to our concepts of personal
freedom and well-being. At the same time, fundamental principles like the First
Amendment, perhaps the most important hallmark of American democracy, protect the
free flow of information in our society.

        The government's collection of appropriate information about its activities and
about the activities of its citizens is necessary to allow it to carry out its diverse missions
mandated by the Constitution. Long mindful of the potential for misuse of Federal
records On individuals, the United States has adopted a comprehensive approach to
limiting the government's collection, use and disclosure of personal information. Among
the protections afforded information is the Privacy Act of 1974 and the Principles for
Providing and Using Personal Information, published in 1995.

         Increased computerization of Federal records permits this data· to be used and
analyzed in new ways that could diminish individual privacy in the absence of data
protection safeguards. As development and implementation of new information
technologies creates new possibilities for the management of personal information, it is
appropriate to reexamine the Federal Government's contribution to accommodating the
interests of a democratic society in the free flow of information and personal privacy.

       Accordingly, I hereby direct executive agency heads, as follows:

Section 1.   Policy.

       It shall be the policy of the executive branch that agencies shall:

                (a) ensure that new information technologies enhance, and do not erode,
                the protections of the Privacy Act of 1974, the Computer Matching and
                Privacy Protection Act of 1988, the Paperwork Reduction Act, and all
                other statutes relating to agency use, collection and disclosure of personal
                information;

                          (1) As used in this order, "agency" and "agencies" shall be defined

                (b) assure that personal information contained in Privacy Act systems of
                records be handled in full compliance with fair information practices as set
                                                                            Hex-Dump Conversion

              Providing and Using Personallnfonnadon (Privacy Principles) to the
              extent permitted by law;

              (d) evaluate new legislation and legislative proposals involving collection,
              use and disclosure of personal information by the Federal government for
              consistency with the Privacy Act of 1974.

              (e) evaluate new legislation and legislative proposals involving the
