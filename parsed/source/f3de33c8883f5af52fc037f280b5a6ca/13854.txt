 Attached is a draft TEAM Act memo.   It tries to incorporate Gene's
 and John's comments and has a one page summary on top.   please get
 me John Hilley'S and any other comments as soon as you can.
 Harold is also reviewing. it. I presume that if it is necessary,
 this memo will be put before the President by the end of this week
 by Harold and those of you who also want to be part of the
 discussion.  I personally want to be done with it by 5pm tomorrow
 so I can leave for a little break.  Thanks.
