I just read this.   Sorry.   I am swamped, but let me give you a quick
couple of points:

1. Medical Records Privacy. A broader bill on medical records privacy is
being put together by HHS, but will take probably months to work out
internal (OMB) and external (business and insurer) political problems. I
would say August or so.

However, there appears to be a good chance that we could do something on
privacy related issues as th~y relate specifically to genetic screening.
With all this cloning stuff around, I think this would be a very good and
timely idea.  It could provide for protections against insurers using this
stuff to underwrite.  I was planning on having a meeting with HHS on this
sometime during the week, but events have intervened.  I do believe,
however, that a later April timeframe for an announcement is really very
doable.  (I will report back immediately after my meeting.)

2. EO on unemployed workers. Nancy Ann Min did put a call into OPM on
this issue, but never heard back before her departure.  I asked her to put
a staff person on it and was told I would soon get a report. Nothing yet,
but I will look into it as soon as I get a free moment.   (I have a
feeling, however, that this will not be an easy thing to do.)

3. Criminal background checks on home health care/nannies. We included
the background check in the recent home health reg.  Probably not much
here in my area, but nannies may be another thing, Dennis?

4.  Diabetes Research.    Checking into this as per our conversation.    Will
get back to you.

Sorry I don't have a lot right now.    Sorry ...
