TEXT:
Do you have time on Tuesday to talk through where we are on various State
of the Union ideas for the environment? I think it would be helpful for
you to get some background on where we are.  I am also sending a memo
today that gives a thumbnail sketch of the ideas.  I have meetings at
9:15, 11:00-12:30, and 3:00-4:30, let me know if you can fit it in.
