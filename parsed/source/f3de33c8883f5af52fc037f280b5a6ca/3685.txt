TEXT:
Ed Lorenzen, Stenholm's guy, says the state is asking him the following:
can they privatize in 50% of the state, and do their integrated thing
statewide; or is the deal that their integrated thing could only be
state-wide? I assume it's a 50% limit on privatization, and there is no
limit on the integrated enrollment system per se.   Do you know?
