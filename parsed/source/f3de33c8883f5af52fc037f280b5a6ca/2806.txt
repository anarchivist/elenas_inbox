TEXT:
The DPC and NEC met this week with Gerald McEntee to discuss an AFSCME
plan to help cities move people from welfare to work. The plan grows out
of your suggestion to McEntee and other labor leaders in an Oval Office
meeting earlier this year that the labor movement should do its part to
place welfare recipients in jobs. McEntee hopes to persuade Mayors
Archer, Rendell, and Giuliani to create new positions for welfare
recipients who would count toward the work requirements, earn the minimum
wage or better, and be new union members.  The recipients would be paid
with funds that would otherwise go toward their welfare checks, and would
have first priority for job vacancies that come open for regular jobs on
the city payroll.  The program would focus on creating new positions in
child care and home health care. We encouraged AFSCME to pursue the
proposal, and asked McEntee to help CWA and SEIU do the same. We will
provide technical assistance in identifying useful federal programs.   If
AFSCME can sign up a bipartisan group of mayors to hire people off
welfare, we should consider a White House announcement as a way to show
support for our $3 billion welfare-to-work plan in the budget.
