Please ignore the first FLOTUS Race Event e-mail, it was sent prematurely.
Sorry.

On Wednesday, January 21, the First Lady will address students at Gaucher
College in Baltimore, Maryland with Taylor Branch. The speech will be on
race.  The First Lady's office is drafting a speech and would like to know
if we have any suggestions for that day.

please consider the following: Is there policy that we could add to this
speech (Elena)? Is there a new promising practice to highlight in
Baltimore (Peter/Lin)? Should she offer a challenge to the students
(Minyon/Mike)? Should she launch the PSA (Ann)? AND/OR Should she also do
·

    a "Conversation?"

    Please respond with any recommendations that you have and stay tuned for a
    possible meeting on this event. Thanks.
