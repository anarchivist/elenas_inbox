TEXT:
On Friday, I circulated to you for review and comment testimony from Joel
Klein for a hearing tomorrow morning before the House Judiciary Committee
on legislation that would create an antitrust exemption for certain
physicians. JUSTICE strongly opposes the legislation.   Also, the FTC has
publicly opposed this legislation.

Justice is anxious to get its statement to the Committee - please give me
your comments/signoff by no later than 3:00 p.m. today.  Thanks.
