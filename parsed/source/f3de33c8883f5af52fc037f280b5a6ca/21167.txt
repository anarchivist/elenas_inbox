TEXT:
I am not having great success in fighting for the radio address to be on
Air Bags, because the President has already signed off on the proposal for
either Drug Free Communities Grants or Food Stamp Fraud and Ann Lewis
isn't likely to change the recommendation.  Is it possible that one of you
could please talk to Erskine about changing the topic to Air Bags.

I know you have been fighting for this, but I just want to add that it
seems really crazy not to do an event on this b/c there are so many very
moving stories from victims (mothers and fathers) who can praise the
President for taking direct action to solve the problem that killed their
children.  I don't think we have ever had a better story line before, so
I'm stunned we're passing on this opportunity.   I have heard one of the
concerns Maria raised is that car manufacturers will be pissed off, but
according to Jerry DOT believes that they won't be as upset as expected
once they see the details of the rule.
