TEXT:
I believe it's important for the federal government to collect good social
science data.  This list seems okay -- some measures seem slightly
subjective, and a few important things are left out.    However, these
data will provide a depressing portrait of America, drawing attention to
many problems we may not be able to change but ones we should try to
change.

I'd also like to know:

        1) What do they want the President to do?   What is this Children's
Executive Order
        Sally refers to?

        2) What's the relationship between this effort and other data
collection efforts (Census,
        Welfare Indicators Act, welfare law requirements)

         3) Are these data already collected, or would we have to divert
funds from another
         project to collect them?

Shall I call Sally and ask?

Did you ever look at these? Don't spend too much time on it, but give me
a call when you have a chance.
