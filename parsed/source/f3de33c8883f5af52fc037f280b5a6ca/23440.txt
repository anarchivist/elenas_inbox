TEXT:
Meehan has about 20 democratic cosponsors lined up for the Meehan/Hansen
bill. Still waiting on repubs ...

His office is also working on a letter to the appropriations conferees
opposing the senate provision. They hope to get the task force members to
sign it.

They and Hansen are holding a briefing with the task force members staff
next week with HCFA and outside groups to talk about what the states are
planning to do with the money and why the Administration must allow the
states to.sue on their behalf and seek 1/2 of the settlement funds.
