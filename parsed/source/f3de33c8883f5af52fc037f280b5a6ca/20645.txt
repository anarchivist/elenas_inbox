TEXT:
Attached for your OK is a draft press statement on the signing of the
child support incentives bill.  Phil Caplan wants this tonight so he can
circulate it in the West Wing for clearance. He expects the President to
sign the bill tomorrow.

FYI, Melissa feels that we shouldn't criticize the old nuclear penalty
because it risks making the bill look weak.  She feels we should simply
say that these are "additional tough penalties" since HHS could still
theoretically use the nuclear penalty. This draft reflects her views.

DRAFT

PresidentD,s Statement on Signing of HR3130 (to be released to press)

I am pleased to sign into law H.R. 3130, the Child Support Performance and
Incentive Act. This Administration has conducted an unprecedented
campaign to increase parental responsibility and ensure that parents
support their children. We have had many successes. Through tougher
enforcement, we have collected a record $13.4 billion in child support, an
increase of 68% since 1992, with 1.4 million more families now receiving
child support.   In addition, we located one million delinquent parents
during the first nine months of a new collection- system that tracks
parents across state lines, a system enacted as part of the 1996 welfare
law that my Administration first proposed in 1994. On paternity
establishment, which is often the crucial first step in child support
cases, we set a record in 1997 -- 1.3 million paternities established, or
two and a half times as many as in 1992. Last month, I signed the
Deadbeat Parents Punishment Act, a law based on my AdministrationD,s 1996
proposal to crack down on egregious child support evaders by creating a
new felony offense for those who flee across state lines to avoid
supporting their children.

However, there is much more that we must do.  H.R. 3130 will build on this
progress and help ensure that parents give their children all the support
they need and deserve.

First, the new law incorporates a proposal that my Administration sent to
Congress last year.  It will reward states for their performance on a
wider range of key child support goals, such as the number of paternity


establishments and child support orders, rather than simply on
cost-effectiveness as the old law provided.

Second, it puts in place additional tough penalties for states that fail
to automate their child support computer systems on time. Under this new
law, states that fail to establish these state-wide system$ face automatic
and escalating penalties, ranging from 4% of funds for the first year to
30% for the fifth year that a state fails to· implement a system.

Third, the new law will make it easier for states to establish
standardized medical support orders in cases where the non-custodial
parent has private health insurance, by putting in place a process to
create a medical support notice that all companies will recognize.

Many members of Congress, Administration officials, state officials,
experts, and childrenD,s advocates worked together constructively in a
bipartisan fashion to craft this valuable piece of legislation, and I wish
to thank them for their efforts.  In particular, I would like to thank
Reps.
Levin and Shaw, and Senators Moynihan, Roth, Rockefeller, and Baucus. [Leg
