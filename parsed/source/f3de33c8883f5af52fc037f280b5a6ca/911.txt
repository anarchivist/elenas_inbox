TEXT:
The attached is a note from Elgie re: a connection between the Kids Health
EO and the Brain conference. This issue seems to keep coming up - CEQ
also wants to talk about a connection.

I see the possibility of perhaps announcing the Exec Order at the
conference or as part of the rollout after the conference. And perhaps
including some specific language in the EO about impact on kids 0-3. What
do you think? Where you involved in the conversation between Elgie and
Bruce?

Do we have the WH children's conference scheduled yet? -- I'm interested
from the standpoint of coming to closure on the proposed children's
environnmental health EO, which BR had talked about as a possibility for
linking with the Conference. Thanks.
