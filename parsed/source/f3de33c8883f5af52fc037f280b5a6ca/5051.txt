TEXT:
Bruce mentioned something to Cynthia today that I have heard him say
before, and I wonder what your recollection of it is: He says that,
almost a year ago,. when the question of whether waivers were grandfathered
or not was being settled, he recalls that at a meeting in Leon's office
HHS and we agreed on some limits to the grandfathering -- that time limits
and work requirements wouldn't be overridden by waivers.   I wasn't at that
meeting and don't recall it, but I would think you would have been there
representing counsel's office. Any bells ringing?
