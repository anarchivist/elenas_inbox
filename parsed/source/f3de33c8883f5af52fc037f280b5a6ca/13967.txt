TEXT:
This is really from Diana:
Yvette Jackson of USDA/food stamps (the woman at the meeting
today) said she gave you a copy of the draft implementing memo for
the recertification directive.  She needs your comments on that
today, or at the latest Monday morning.  She wants to send out
that implementing memo with the larger implementing memo that USDA
wants to send out on all the food stamp provisions in the bill (it
was in the packet I handed you at the meeting today) .
I will send you her phone number; but she just told me she will be
out next week -- I THINK Stacey Dean would be the person to talk
to if you can't get to her until Monday morning.
By the way, there are 2 legal questions on how to interpret the
children's SSI cuts that have a big effect on the timing and
number of disabled children dropped from the rolls.    I have asked
SSA to have Arthur Fried, their general counsel fill you in on one
of the 2.  I will get you info on the other. They are both issues
that have to be decided shortly -- probably Labor Day week.
