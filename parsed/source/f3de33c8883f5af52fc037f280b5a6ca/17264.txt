     Dear Representative Stupak:

             Thank you for your letter dated September 24, 1997, expressing concern about the effects
     of increased trade on food safety. I share your concern about the safety of food for all
     Americans, and I will not permit any trade policy to impair the health and safety of the
     American people.

             I have committed this Administration to ensuring that the food that Americans eat is the
     safest in the world. We have put in place improved safety standards for meat, poultry, and
     seafood products, and have begun the process of developing enhanced safety standards for fruit
     and vegetable juices. Together, we have enacted legislation in this area, including the Safe
     Drinking Water Act of 1996 and the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996.

             This month, I announced an initiative to upgrade domestic food safety standards and to
     ensure that fruits and vegetables coming from overseas are as safe as those produced in the
     United States. I asked Congress to enact legislation that will require the Food and Drug
     Administration to halt imports of fruits, vegetables, and other food products from any foreign
     country with food safety systems and standards that are not on par with those of the United
     States. I also directed the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of
     Agriculture to work cooperatively with the agricultural community to develop guidance on
     agricultural and manufacturing practices for fruits and vegetables within one year. Finally, I
     committed to providing the necessary funds in my Fiscal Year 1999 budget to enable the FDA to
     dramatically expand its international food inspection force so that it can make effective use of
     this new legislative authority. I am attaching a fact sheet on my new proposal, as well as the
     directive I sent to Secretaries Glickman and Shalala.

             This new initiative will help guarantee the safety of food in the United States. It
     provides the improved inspection capacity we need and increased regulatory power to combat
     imports that could be contaminated. I am committed to continuing to improve the safety of food
     that Americans eat, and I look forward to working with you on this vital project. Thank you
     again for your letter.



                                                  Sincerely,
