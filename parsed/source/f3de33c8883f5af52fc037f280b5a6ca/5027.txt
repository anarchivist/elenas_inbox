I finally reached Mike Cohen on the plane. He felt very strongly that
while Mickey's instinct to include BIA, Tribal, and DOD schools was a good
one, but it would be inappropriate to do so in this directive, .for the
following reasons:

BIA -- we control these schools, and so the indirect approaches described
for encouraging states and cities simply doesn't make sense for them.  It
just raises a question of why disseminate info on best practices to this
system, why not just order that these things be done. We need to address
our efforts to assist these schools through the working group process that
is underway.

Tribal -- Mike was concerned that, among other things,   this could raise
Treaty issues.

DOD -- The directive, which is focused on intervening in failing schools,
is largely inapplicable to the DOD schools, which are generally in fairly
good shape.

Bottom line is that we should not attempt to make this change.
