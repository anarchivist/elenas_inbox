      Reminder:    this meeting is at 2:00 today!   Thank you.


      I just'wanted to let you know that it is important that you come to this
      meeting on time.  If you cannot make the meeting, please let me know
      ASAP, A reporter from Harper's Bazaar will be present at the meeting
      because she is doing a profile on Sylvia. A firm understanding will be in
      place that the substance of the meeting is off the record.
