  Assume a state with a block grant of $1 00 million with a $5 million or 5 percent top penalty for missing the work participation rate,
                               95% of case10ad in single parent families and 5% in two parent families,
                            an overall participation rate of 30 percent, and a two parent rate of 75 percent.

 Step #1: Establish Penalty
 based on Degree of
 Non-Compliance

 Example A:                         The penalty is $4.5 million.     The penalty is $5 million. 1     The penalty is $.5 million         The penalty is $.25 million
 If state did not achieve 90%
 of the work participation rate     [The smaller of $4.5 million     [Full penalty imposed if state   [The larger of $.5 million or      [Equal to $5 million times
 (e.g. participation rate was       or $4.75 million, i.e., the      falls below 90% threshold].      $.25 million, i.e. the larger of   .05, the percent of the
 lower than 27% for overall         smaller of ($5 million x .9)                                      ($5 million x .1) or               caseload that are two parent
 caseload and 67.5% for two         or                                                                ($5 million times .05, the         families.]2
 parent):                           ($5 million x .95, the percent                                    percent of caseload that are
                                    of caseload that is non-two                                       two parent families)]
                                    parent families)]

 Example B:                         The penalty is $2.25 million.    The penalty is $2.5 million.     The penalty is $.25 million.       The penalty is $.125 million.
 If state achieved 95% of the
 work participation rate            [The maximum penalty --          [The maximum penalty --          [The maximum penalty --            [The maximum penalty --

 71.25% for two parent):            is reduced in half because       reduced in half because state    reduced in half because state      reduced in half because state
                                    state achieved half the          achieved half the difference     achieved half the difference       achieved half the difference
                                    difference between the           between the required rate        between the required rate          between the required rate
                                    required rate and the            and the threshold.]              and the threshold.]                and the threshold.]
                                    threshold.]

 Step #2: Consider
 Reasonable Cause


         I   If state fails overall and two parent rate, the maximum total penalty shall be $5 million..

         2 HHS argues that although this option is simpler and, one could argue, fairer to states with very small two parent caseloads, their minimum 10 percent
penalty would be better because it would a) signal that we're serious about two parent work rates, and b) not discourage states from adopting pro-family welfare
policies which increase the number of two parent families on the rolls.
