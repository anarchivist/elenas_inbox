I. Themes

     A. Why We Need Comprehensive Tobacco Legislation

              Ifwe act now to pass comprehensive tobacco legislation we can prevent the
              premature deaths of almost 1 million children in the next five years. To save
              those children we need strong legislation that includes the provisions outlined by
              President Clinton: we must raise the costs of cigarettes to children and impose
              tough penalties on companies that sell to kids; the new law must let the FDA
              regulate nicotine like the drug it is; and we need to end tobacco company
              advertising that targets kids. This is a unique opportunity to save almost a
              million American children and we should get it done this year.


     B. What Comprehensive Tobacco Legislation Should Include:

              1. Tough penalties and price increases to reduce youth smoking. Price increases
              of up to $1.50 if necessary over the next ten years.

              2. Full authority for the FDA to regulate tobacco products. Nicotine is a drug.
              Its use in a product needs to be regulated by the Food and Drug Administration.

              3. The tobacco industry must change the way it does business, including stopping
              advertising to children.

              4. There needs to be progress towards other public health goals including cutting
              second-hand smoke and better funded programs to help people quit smoking.

              5. There should be protection for tobacco farmers and their communities so they
              do not suffer economically because of this legislation.

              These are the five elements President Clinton announced on September 17th as
              keys to comprehensive tobacco legislation.


     c.     General Points

              1. Time Delays Mean Lives. Everyday 3,000 kids start smoking and 1,000 of
              them will die prematurely from this addiction. Congress should pass this
              legislation this year.

              2. We need a comprehensive bill. We shouldn't settle for anything doesn't
                                                  Automated Records Management System
                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion

     raise the cost of cigarettes significantly and contain tough penalties that cost the
     industry real money if they don't meet youth smoking targets. The public
     strongly supports increasing cigarette prices by more than $1 per pack. While
     Americans are not against so-called "skinny bills" they agree with the response
     that we shouldn't stop at a piecemeal approach, we should do as much as possible.

     3. President wants a solution. The President has made clear he wants a
     bipartisan solution to this problem. He said so on September 17 when he
     announced his plan, he has met with leaders of both parties, and senior
     Administration officials have met and will meet with Democratic and Republican
     leaders to help draft legislation.
