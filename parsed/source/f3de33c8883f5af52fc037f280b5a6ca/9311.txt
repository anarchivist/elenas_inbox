Individual Development Accounts

Today, the House Passed the IDA bill drafted by Harkin and Coates.  The
bill would provide for the first time direct funding for IDAs, something
the President has supported since 1992. The Senate has provided funding
of $10 million to go along with the authorization.  This legislation now
goes to conference. Their are still some issues to resolve on Head Start,
but it looks like they may well be worked out.
