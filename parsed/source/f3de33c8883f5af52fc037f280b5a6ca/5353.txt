Subject:         Senior Staff Coverage/Leave for Thanksgiving

As usual, I will be collecting information on Senior Staff office coverage
for the upcoming federal holiday: Thanksgiving Day, Thursday, November
27. The Chief of Staff has requested a complete list of senior staff
(Assistants to the President and Deputy Assistants to the President only)
who will be working the holiday, as well as the names of those senior
staff on call and how they can be reached.

Please submit your names to me as soon as possible. We will be submitting
this information to the Chief of Staff on Monday afternoon.

Also, please remind any staff members who plan to take off Friday,
November 28, that they are required to take annual leave for that day.

Remember to provide the WHCA Signal Switchboard with information on how
the senior staff who will be out of town may be reached.

Thank you.
