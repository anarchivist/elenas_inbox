TEXT:
Paragraph on Campaign Finance Reform

The time is now for us to pass real bipartisan campaign reform.  I am
please that the leadership in both Houses have scheduled a vote for
March.  But a vote is not enough.  I challenge Congress to pass real
reform and send it to my desk.  In the meantime, I will move the reform
forward by petitioning the Federal Communications Commission this week to
provide free broadcast time to candidates for Federal office.
