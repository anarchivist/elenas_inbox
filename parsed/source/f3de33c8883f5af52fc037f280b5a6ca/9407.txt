TEXT:
OMB and I just briefed DOL staff on the agreement Bruce and Jack reached
on this issue. They were "delighted" with the outcome and appreciated the
thought that went into this, and the trade-offs involved.   Keep in mind
this is at the staff level -- we might still hear a little grumbling about
the weighting favoring job entry rather than retention/earnings, but
hopefully not.   Staff understand one of the reasons it doesn't make sense
to put too much weight on back-end measures is that this is a one-shot dea
1 and we may not have a whole lot of retention/earnings to measure in time
to award the bonus. DOL will send a fed register notice over to OMB
quickly, then plans to brief stakeholders, Hill etc as soon as it's ready
 (I'll find out exact date).   I reminded DOL that we'd gotten good press
on this when HHS released the TANF HPB and we should try for a repeat.    Do
we want to do anything more?
