                     PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
            REMARKS AT THE LABOR-HHS-EDUCATION BILL SIGNING
                            THE WHITE HOUSE
                            NOVEMBER 13, 1997

       Acknowledgments: VP Gore; Sec. Riley; Sec. Hennan; Sens. Specter and Harkin, Reps.
Obey and Porter, for their fine leadership in putting together this bill; other members of
Congress; Philip Israel, 5th grade student; Tina Israel, mother; Kikuyu [Kee - COO - yoo] Shaw,
Pell Grant recipient.

        Six years ago, I set forth a vision to keep the American Dream alive for every person
willing to work for it ... to keep America the world's strongest force for peace, freedom and
prosperity .,. to bring all of us together across the lines that divide us into One America. That
vision is coming alive all across our country. Our economy is the strongest in a generation.
Crime, welfare, unemployment are falling. But we must continue to move forward.

         I believe the best way to sustain and build on our progress is to provide all Americans a
world-class education. In my State of the Union Address, I challenged all Americans to join me
in a non-partisan effort to make sure every 8-year old can read, every 12-year old can log on to
the Internet, every 18-year old can go to college, and all Americans can keep learning throughout
their lifetimes. These must be America's central education goals. And they are at the heart of
my 10-point Call to Action for American Education.

       Now, less than a year after I issued that challenge, America and Congress have
answered the call. By signing this bill into law, I am signing into the record books the best
year for American education in over a generation.

        First and foremost,_we are taking historic steps to make sure that every child in America
can meet high, national standards of academic achievement -- so that every child can master the
basics. This bill represents a breakthrough for national standards. For the first time, we will
have workable and generally agreed upon standards in reading and math. And for the first time,
we will have voluntary national tests to measure performance in fourth grade reading and eighth
grade math -- and Congress has voted to support the development ofthese tests. The tests will
be created by an independent, bipartisan organization, and they will be piloted in schools next
fall.

        The importance of this cannot be overstated. We must demand high academic
achievement from all our children. Our children will rise to the expectations set for them. We
know that every child can meet high standards -- and with these tests, we will see to it that they
do. I thank Sen. Bingaman, Rep. Miller and everyone who worked across party lines to forge
this essential progress in American education.



                                                  1
                                                                          Hex-Dump Conversion

        Weare also taking concrete steps to help our children meet these standards and help
every 8-year old read on his or her own. This bill expands the America Reads Challenge and
strengthens the partnership between AmeriCorps members and schools to recruit trained literacy
volunteers. All of us can give our children the practice and extra attention they need to read by
the end of third grade.

        Second, this bill will take significant steps to ensure that every 12-year old logs onto the
Internet. This bill nearly doubles our national commitment to technology education. We are
well on the way to connecting every classroom and library to the Information Superhighway by
the Year 2000. And when we do, a child in the poorest inner-city neighborhood or the most
isolated rural community will have the same access to the same information as a child in the
wealthiest suburb, for the very first time.

       Third, this bill -- along with the college tuition tax cuts I signed into law this summer --
will make it possible for every 18 year old who is willing to work for it to go to college. The
measure I sign into law today includes the largest increase in Pell Grants scholarships in two
decades, raising the maximum grant and serving an additional 214,000 students. I have said that
our mission must be to make the 13th and 14th years of education as universal as high school is
today. With all of these investments, the doors of college have been thrown open wider than
ever before.

      Taken together, this is a remarkable series of concrete steps toward our vision of giving
Americans the world's best education. And I thank all who supported and fought for this
measure.

       This legislation does even more to meet the challenges I set out in my State of the Union
Address. It promotes innovation and expands public school choice, helping parents, teachers
and community leaders open some 500 new charter schools and clearing the way for 3000 such
schools by early in the next century. It recognizes that learning begins in the earliest years of life
and significantly expands investment in Head Start. It challenges teachers to reach higher
standards, and honors those who do, by helping 100,000 educators seek certification as Master
Teachers. It builds on our work to bring discipline and order into the lives of our
children, with $40 million to help schools stay open late, on the weekends and in the summer to
keep young people off the streets and out of trouble.

       There is still more to do to meet our educational challenges. We must pass a G.I. Bill for
America's workers, which simplifies existing training programs and will help all Americans who
need them to learn new skills for the workplace. And we must meet the quiet crisis of
crumbling and crowded school buildings across America. We cannot build our children up in
buildings that are literally falling down.

      Finally, this bill continues our efforts to strengthen families on so many other fronts. It
expands educational opportunity for the disabled, recent immigrants, and children growing up in

                                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion
         our poorest neighborhoods. Itsignificantly increases funding for biomedical research, from
         cancer to Parkinson's disease to the human genome project. And it will help make the new
         powerful AIDS therapies more available to needy patients.

                 These are just some ofthe important provisions in a measure that honors our vital and
         shared duty to prepare our children for the challenges of the future. As much as any bill in
         years, it extends opportunity to all Americans, demands responsibility from all Americans, and
         helps build a community of all Americans. And I am proud to sign it into law.
