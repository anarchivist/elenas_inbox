TEXT:
In my edits to the INS Press document on the NACARA reg, I suggest adding
to the last paragraph on the first page some recognition of the
President's role in this process and the sentence would therefore read:

"As President Clinton directed, this new program is the culmination of the
Administration's efforts to create as accessible and simple a process as
the law permits," says INS Commissioner Meissiner.

please let me know if you have any concerns adding 'this reference to the
president.

Thanks.
