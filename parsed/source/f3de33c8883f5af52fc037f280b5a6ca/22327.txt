As Prepared for Delivery
Statement of Gregory Craig
Special Counsel to the President
January 16, 199B

        The thirteen House Republican prosecutors have the Constitutional
burden to prove their case that the President of the united States should
be removed from office.  After three uninterrupted days of presenting
their case, they have failed to meet that burden.

        Nothing: nothing in any of the presentations, nothing in the five
volume, 60,000 page record, nothing, in the testimony of at least one
hundred witnesses has proved their case. The House Republicanso, case
ends as it began: an unsubstantiated, circumstantial case that does not
meet the Constitutional standard to remove the President from office.
That standard is clear: unlike federal judges, who are appointed for life
and who serve during o&good behavior,oB our President is elected by all
the people, and should only be removed for the most grave offenses against
the Constitution.

        The simple truth is that the House Republican prosecutors failed
to demonstrate that the will and interest of the American people would be
served by nullifying the results of a national election.

         Next week, on behalf of the President, we will present a strong,
vigorous defense, based on the facts, the law and the Constitution ... and
we ,look forward to the day when all of us can return to the important
business of the American people.

        Thank you.

                                   ###
