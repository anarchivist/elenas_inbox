If I can't beat this back, I wonder if the event isn't better as a radio
address.

Subject:         Hate Crimes Event

        After discussions with DOJ about the possible appearance of the
Byrd and Sheppard family with the President, this is the Counsel's Office
position. If we want to invite the families, DOJ needs to consult first
with the prosecutors in both cases to ensure that they do not believe it
will create an issue in the prosecutions. If we do consult with them, we
need to be prepared to be bound by their request, which may be that the
families should not participate at all. If they do not object to the
families attending. an event, there still should not be a picture with the
President and he should not comment specifically on the cases. The
families, of course, could say what they want independently. An
alternative, which we feel presents no problem, is to invite the Mayor of
Jasper, TX, to come to talk about the moving story of taking down the
fence in the town cemetery. That would fit with the
reconciliation/tolerance Easter theme but could not be seen as prejudicing
the defendants. Please think about how to proceed because, if DOJ is going
to consult with the prosecutors, we need to get that process started.
