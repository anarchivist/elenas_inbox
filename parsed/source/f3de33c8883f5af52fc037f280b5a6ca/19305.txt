TEXT:
Attached is a draft Labor letter recommending that the President veto S.
1723 (which is scheduled for markup tomorrow in the Senate Judiciary
Committee) . This bill would permanently increase the cap on H1B visas
for foreign temporary "professional" workers.  Barbara Chow asked that we
bring this matter to your attention.

Before putting this draft letter into the LRD interagency clearance
process, we would like you to take a look at it and let us know if you
agree with sending a letter and, if so, should it include a veto threat.
We would appreciate if you   could review the letter and provide
comments/sign-off by noon today, in light of tomorrow's markup.



FYI - Labor submitted the attached letter with signature blocks for the AG
and the Sec. of Commerce, but could not confirm that Justice and Commerce
has signed on to the veto recommendation.  Therefore, we deleted the
Justice and Commerce signature blocks and references to them in the letter
and plan to check with the agencies individually to see if they want to
sign on.

DRAFT -- NOT FOR RELEASE

The Honorable Orrin Hatch
Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary
United States Senate
Washington, D.C. 20510

Dear Senator Hatch:

        This week your Committee will mark-up S. 1723, "The American
Competitiveness Act," which, among other things, would permanently
increase the annual limit on admissions of foreign temporary
"professional" workers admitted under the Immigration and Nationality
Act's (INA) H-1B program.  The Administration strongly opposes this bill
and, if presented to the President in its current form,  the Secretary of
Labor would recommend that he veto it.

        Like you, we have heard a lot recently about a shortage of trained
workers for the information technology (IT) industry. While reliable,
independent evidence remains inconclusive, the President believes that our
first response to increasing the availability of IT workers -- to meet the
industry's needs, continue its expansion and assure its continued global
leadership and U.S. economic growth -- must be increasing the skills of
U.S. workers and helping the labor market adjust more quickly so there is
an adequate supply of skilled workers where there is a demand for skilled
workers. While it may be necessary in the short-term to increase the    .
number of visas for foreign temporary "professional" workers under the
H-1B program, this must be done only in conjunction with significant
additional efforts by the nation's IT industry to educate, train, recruit
and retain U.S. workers, and with long-overdue, needed improvements in the
H-1B program that would serve these same purposes.

        It is the Administration's strongly-held view that any increase in
the H-1B program admissions ceiling should be temporary and limited to the
minimum amount demonstrably necessary.  However, the fundamentally-flawed
H-1B program must not be expanded even temporarily -- unless it is also
fixed.  In 1996, the Department of Labor's Inspector General, in response
to a request from the Employment and Training Administration, reviewed the
H- 1B program and found that:

"The [H-1B, or Labor Condition Application (LCA)] ... program is intended
to provide U.S. business with timely access to the 'best and brightest' in
the international labor market to meet urgent but generally temporary
business needs while protecting U.S. workers' wage levels. We found the
program does not always meet urgent, short-term demand for highly skilled,
unique individuals who are not available in the domestic workforce.
Instead, it serves as a probationary try-out employment program for
illegal aliens, foreign students, and foreign visitors to determine if
they will be sponsored for permanent status." (p. 1)

        "our contacts with [H-1B] LCA employers disclosed:


75 percent of the aliens worked for employers who did not adequately
document that the wage specified on the LCA was the proper wage, and

19 percent of the ·aliens were paid below the wage specified on the LCA,
when we could determine the actual wage paid."

"Some LCA employers use the [H-IBJ alien labor to reduce payroll costs
either by paying less than prevailing wage to their own alien employees or
treating these aliens as independent contractors, thereby avoiding related
payroll and administrative costs. Other LCA employers are D+job shopsD,
whose business is to provide H-IB alien contract labor to other employers."

"The LCA program has become a stepping stone to obtain permanent resident
status not only for the 'best and brightest' specialists but also for
students, relatives, and friends." (p. 3)

        Since 1993, this Administration has sought reforms of the H-IB
program that would address the serious failings uncovered by the Inspector
General. The reforms are:    (1) assurances that employers seeking to hire
foreign temporary workers had made bona fide efforts to recruit and retain
u.S. workers in these jobs before hiring foreign temporary workers; (2)
assurances that these employers have not laid off or otherwise displaced
qualified u.S. workers to replace them with foreign temporary workers; and
(3) reduction of the maximum stay of H-IB workers from six to three
years.  These reforms alone would help target H-IB usage to industries and
employers that are truly experiencing genuine skills shortages.

        Regrettably, S. 1723 does not address these serious problems in
the H-IB program, but instead emphasizes providing u.S. employers with a
dramatically larger pool of foreign temporary workers.  S. 1723 does not
contain requirements that U.S. employers try to recruit and retain u.S.
workers before hiring foreign temporary workers, and it does nothing to
prohibit employers from laying off U.S. workers in order to replace them
with foreign temporary workers. Although represented as strengthening
program requirements and enforcement so as to prevent and appropriately
punish abuses by employers, S. 1723 actually eliminates some of the
important law enforcement provisions in the current H-IB program.   For
example, the bill increases the maximum fine for "willful" violations, but
eliminates fines in current law for certain non-willful violations. And
-- ostensibly to provide "reforms to achieve greater accuracy in
determining prevailing wages for companies"    S. 1723 effectively repeals
the prevailing wage requirements that exist in current law.

3

         S. 1723 would permanently increase the ceiling on H-IB admissions
nearly doubling the current cap -- even though the sponsors acknowledge
that any shortage (about which the evidence is ambiguous) will be
short-term as the labor market adjusts.   In the not-too-distant future, thi
s permanent increase will result in increased permanent immigration and
pressure on the ceiling on permanent, employment-based admissions in
current law and threaten job opportunities and force down wages for U.S.
workers in the IT industry.

        The Administration stands ready to work with the Congress to
address the increased demand for skilled workers in the IT industry,
effectively protect and promote the interests of U.S. workers, and enhance
the international competitiveness of important industries and U.S.
ecomonic growth that derives from it.  S. 1723 is clearly not an
acceptable and balanced approach to achieving all of these important goals.



        The Office of Management and Budget advises that there is no
objection to the submission of this report from the standpoint of the
AdministrationO,s program.

                                               Sincerely,




ALEXIS HERMAN
Secretary of Labor
