TEXT:
1. Dan Mendelson says he'll give food money if you give it some
priority. How does it look?

2.  Bill Schultz, policy at FDA, is going to DOJ to do civil appeals.
They are looking for a replacement if you have apy ideas.

3. Today's USA Today reports on an unpublished study at CDC on e-coli
rates. O'hara claims to be furious about the leak which supposedly comes
from the research level and had yet to be vetted.  The researchers
supposedly told a private meeting with outsiders who then told the paper.
We are getting talking points organized so the agencies say the same thing
in response.
