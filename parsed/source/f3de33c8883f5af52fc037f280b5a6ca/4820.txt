TEXT:
Bill White of Public Liaison and I just learned that the President's
Committee on Mental Retardation wants to issue a report in the next few
days saying that SSA is mishandling its redeterminations of children's
eligibility for SSI under the new standard.  The draft report pretty much
repeats all the criticisms that the advocates have been making -- SSA's
review process is not reliable, questionable, suspect; employees are
unprepared and overworked; we should have a moratorium on case reviews;
and SSA's interpretation of the statute itself should be reviewed.

The President's Committee is housed at HHS, but its committee members are
presidential appointees who are experts in mental retardation.  Several
have ties to the Kennedy family; the Committee itself was begun by
President Kennedy.  They have apparently already voted to issue a report.

Since Ken Apfel is in the middle of the 3~-day review of these issues that
he promised at his confirmation hearing, Bill and I have suggested to the
Committee's executive director that perhaps a meeting with Ken would be an
alternative to issuing a public report. He's going to get back to us. A
second alternative that we have not yet suggested is that the report could
simply recommend the items Ken should be looking at in his review, without
repeating the litany of criticisms of SSA.
