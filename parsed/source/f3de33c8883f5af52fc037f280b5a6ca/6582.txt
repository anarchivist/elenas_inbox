                   SYLVIA MATHEWS

SUBJECT            PRESIDENT'S INITIATIVE ON RACE WEEKLY REPORT
                   FEBRUARY 28 - MARCH 6

DATE:       MARCH 6,1998


ADVISORY BOARD ACTIVITIES

     Asian Pacific Americans in Higher Education. On March 1, Angela Oh gave
     the keynote address at their annual conference. She spoke about the
     importance of the involvement of the higher education community in the
     Initiative.

     French-American Foundation. On March 4, Angela Oh and other Los Angeles
     community leaders hosted a discussion on tolerance and cooperation among
     racial groups in the Los Angeles area with a delegation of French civic
     educators.

     University of Mississippi. On March 16 -17, the University of Mississippi will
     sponsor a series of events for members of the Advisory Board, including a public
     forum. The University is an important venue for a Race Initiative event because
     of its role in the integration of higher education - - as a result of James
     Meredith's effort to enroll there, it is analogous to the role of Little Rock Central
     High School in public school integration. Governor Winter, Rev. Johnson Cook,
     and Bob Thomas will participate in the public forum. Press coverage for this
     event has been quite extensive and positive.

OFFICE OF THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR

     Educational Testing Service.      On March 3, we met with Educational Testing

                                           1
 President for Public Leadership. They provided us with a description of
 research they are undertaking to create alternative measures of merit and
 redifine the role of testing in college admissions and affirmative action programs.
 WH staff from the Counsel's office, National Economic Council, Domestic Policy
 Council, and the Office of Public Liaison joined us for this meeting.

  Research Advisory Group. On March 5, we met with representatives from
  cabinet departments and agencies which committed to support the National
  Academy of Sciences (NAS) race research effort. It is an effort to summarize
  existing research relating to race. In this meeting, we discussed topics for the
. research summaries. We also asked representatives to suggest names of
  researchers and authors who could be commissioned by the NAS to write these
  papers.

 "How To" Manuals. A manual on how to conduct dialogues on race is due to
 go to publication shortly. An initial printing of 10,000 easily reproducible
 40-page manuals is contemplated. Initial distribution will be for the Campus
 Week of Dialogue from April 6-9, and the Statewide Days of Dialogue on April
 30, as well as for public officials, youth, corporate leaders, and religious leaders.

  March Advisory Board Meeting. We are continuing to draft the agenda for the
  March Advisory Board meeting. It will occur on March 23-24 in Denver,
  Colorado, and will focus on race and stereotypes. We are working with Advisory
  Board members, consultants, and other experts to identify key questions for
. discussion, likely panelists, and other appropriate meeting participants.

 Campus Week of Dialogue. The letter from Secretary Riley and Dr. Franklin
 was sent to 3,500 college and university presidents across the nation this week.
 The letter invites them to participate in our Campus Week of Dialogue which will
 occur April 6-9. Also, we met with over 30 higher education organizations and
 they agreed to contact their members and encourage them to participate in the
 Campus Week of Dialogue. We are already beginning to receive responses
 from colleges that they will be participating in this event.

 Religious Leaders Forums. The first Religious Leaders Forum will be held in
 New Orleans on April 15. The second forum will occur in Louisville, Kentucky,
 but a date has not yet been determined.

 Corporate Leaders Forum. The forum in St. Louis, Missouri, will now likely
 occur in late April to accommodate Secretary Slater's schedule. Efforts are
 being made, as well, to schedule a forum in New York to be hosted by Secretary
 Rubin.

     DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

          Hate Crimes Conference. Approximately 250 attendees, including
          representatives of 90 United States Attorneys' offices, law enforcement
          officials from 50 states, 40 FBI agents, and 20 ATF agents, attended the
          Hate Crimes seminar in Washington, D.C. Attendees heard from the
          Attorney General, Acting Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights,
          President and CEO of the NAACP Kweisi Mfume, and DOJ Hate Crimes
          Coordinator Castello, among others. The Attorney General asked all
          U.S. Attorneys to form a district Hate Crimes Working Group which would
          include federal, state, and local law enforcement and community-based
          groups.

          Japanese-Americans. On February 27, Bill Lee, Acting Assistant
          Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division, traveled to Los Angeles to
          meet with Japanese Americans. He announced that Japanese
          Americans who were fired from railroad jobs during WWII would be
          eligible for redress payments.

          American Indians Conference. On February 26, the Attorney General
          addressed the National Congress of American Indians, where she touted
          the Administration's proposed increased budget funding for Indian
          Country.

     DEPARTMENT OF INTERIOR

          Alaska Indian Country Decision. In a unanimous decision, the U.S.
          Supreme Court ruled that lands conveyed under the Alaska Native Claims
          Settlement Act (ANCSA) do not constitute Indian Country. Passed in
          1971, ANCSA settled aboriginal land claims in AK by conveying 44 million
          acres of land and approximately $1 billion to Alaska Native corporations.
          The Supreme Court held that ANCSA ended federal supervision over
          Indian affairs. Accordingly, tribes in AK will not be able, under current
          law, to exercise governmental powers over ANCSA lands such as taxing,
          tribal court jurisdiction and environmental regulation. The reaction to the
          Supreme Court's decision has been diverse. Tribal government
          representatives have expressed great disappointment, but have also
          stated that they do not expect much to change on the ground. The AK
          Congressional delegation has applauded the decision, but has also noted

                                        3

         that the case has underscored problems in rural AK that need to be
         addressed. The Governor has created a Rural Alaska Governance and
         Empowerment Commission to review AK's relationship with and
         responsibility to rural AK.

    UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE

         Civil Rights. On March 2, Secretary Glickman spoke to an all-employee
         gathering at USDA to give an update on civil rights, including USDA's
         accomplishments and challenges. Secretary Glickman said that USDA .
         "has come a long way" in the last year, and that the civil rights efforts of
         the past year would "continue without interruption."

    DEPARTMENT OF LABOR


         NAACP Image Award. On March 5, Secretary Herman was honored in
         a national broadcast of the NAACP Image Awards which aired March 5 on
         Fox Television in a gala honoring African American artists, writers, and
         public figures. Secretary Herman received the President's Award for her
         lifetime achievements and public service.

    DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT

         Congressional Black Caucus. On March 4, Secretary Cuomo attended
         the Congressional Black Caucus' weekly luncheon to discuss HUD's FY
         '99 budget priorities. The luncheon allowed members of the caucus to
         engage in an informal dialogue with the Secretary on HUD initiatives and
         budget.

    DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION

         Racial Awareness Initiative. Approximately 500 enthusiastic
         participants listened to a discussion of federal, state, and local issues of
         concern for the survival of our African-American communities. Secretary
         Slater participated in this event and his remarks focused on the Welfare to
         Work Initiative, the Race Initiative, and the importance of education in the
         survival of our children in the 21st century.

    OFFICE OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT

         Race Discussions. On March 4, Director Lachance taught classes and
         visited the University of Southern California and California State
         University, Los Angeles. At both campuses she amplified the SOTU,
         budget and reinvention themes, as well as diversity in the federal
