Subject:         Elena's spot

I found out who that person was in Elena's spot. She was traveling this
week, but should be back this evening and I've instructed her office to
tell her to park in her own spot.  If her car isn't moved by tomorrow
morning, tell Elena that spot #48 is currently unassigned, if she wants to
park there in the meantime.

Thanks.    Sorry for the trouble!

Brooks
