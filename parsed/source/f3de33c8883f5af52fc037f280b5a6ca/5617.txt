Here's Mike's take on the meeting Judy Heumann wants. He offers a
legitimate way to say you don't need to do the meeting.

Subject:         Re: special ed budget

Right now, the special ed budget is level funded, and neither Bruce nor
Barbara Chow have been particularly open to an increase.

Barbara and I met with Mike Smith for ED's appeal--Mike pushed the issue,
and I suspect Riley will with POTUS.
One way Elena could get out of the meeting is to tell Judy that DPC was
involved in Mike Smith's OMB appeal, and that we therefore are fully aware
of ED's concerns and are trying to figure out how to take them into
account in a tight budget year ..
