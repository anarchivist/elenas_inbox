President Clinton is Committed to Making it Simpler for Americans to File Their Taxes,
to Improving the Tax Code, and to Reforming the IRS.
                                    President Clinton Has Cut Taxes for
               Middle-Income Working Families and his New Budget Provides
               New Tax Relief for Child Care, Education, and the
               Environment.
                                    Under President Clinton, It Is Easier and
               Simpler for Millions ofAmericans to File Their Tax Returns
               Electronically and Over the Phones; and
                                    The President Signed the Taxpayer Bill of
               Rights into Law and Wants Congress
                                    to Send Him Comprehensive IRS Reform
                                    Legislation as Soon as Possible.
The Scheme to Sunset the Tax Code Is Reckless and Irresponsible and Would:
                              (1) Create Tremendous Uncertainty for
              Financial Transactions in Our Economy, Thereby Threatening
              to Reduce Business Investment and Cost Jobs.
                             (2) Place at Risk Families' Health Insurance
              and Home Values, and Eliminate Incentives for Retirement
              Savings.
                               (3) Threaten to Take Away the Child Tax
              Credits, Hope Scholarships, and Expanded IRAs that Families
              are Counting on.
                               (4) Gamble With The Fiscal Strength the
              Nation Has Worked So Hard to Achieve and that is So Critical
              as the Retirement of the Baby Boom Approaches.
                            Broad opposition to this proposal:
                            ·   As Chamber of Commerce chief economist
                                Martin Regalia said, "It's more than a little
                                dangerous" [Commercial Appeal, 3/22/98).
                            ·   The President of the National Association of
                                Realtors, Layne Morrill, denounced the
                                sunset idea as "disastrous for American home
                                owners. " [Commercial Appeal, 3/22/98)
                            ·   The Tax Executive Institute, a nonpartisan
                                association that represents approximately
                                5,000 in-house tax professionals employed by
                                2,800 leading companies in the U.S. and
                                Canada, has said the proposal would
                                "threaten major disruptions of the economy
                                and the lives of the American people." [TEl
                                letter to Chairmen Archer and Roth, March 23, 1998)
CUTTING THE DEFICIT, INVESTING IN THE FUTURE, AND OPENING MARKETS ABROAD.
FIVE YEARS LATER, THE ECONOMY IS THE STRONGEST IN A GENERATION.
       The Unemployment Rate Is Now 4.3 Percent. The lowest in 28 years -- and more than 16
       million new jobs have been created.
       First Surplus In A Generation. In 1992, the deficit was a record $290 billion. This year,
       OMB projects the surplus will be $39 billion -- the first surplus since 1969.
       With Lower Interest Rates, Business Investment Has Boomed. Under President Clinton,
       real business investment has increased 12.2 percent per year -- the fastest since John F.
       Kennedy was President.
       Smallest Tax Burden Since 1976. This year -- because of the tax cuts signed into law by
       President Clinton -- the typical middle-income family offour will face the smallest Federal
       tax burden in more than two decades (1976).
                                                                 Automated Records Management Systerr
                                                                         Hex-Dump Conversion
THE TAX CODE, AND TO REFORM THE IRS.                                          Automated Records Management System
                                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion
    Cutting and Simplifying Taxes. President Clinton proposed and signed into law 40 tax
    simplification measures. The balanced budget agreement ensures that 99 percent of homeowners
    will not pay capital gains tax on the sale of their home and over 90 percent of corporations,
    especially small businesses, do not have to worry about the alternative minimum tax.
    Making It Easier to File Taxes. The Administration is aggressively pushing its innovative
    programs to have people file their tax returns simply and easily by computer or telephone. For
    this year's filing season, 18.5 million taxpayers havefiled electronically, up 29 percent from last
    year. Another 6 million taxpayers have filed by telephone this year, an increase of27 percent
    compared to last year. The typical call takes about ten minutes.
    Reforming the IRS. The President signed into law a taxpayer bill of rights and has been urging
    the Congress to send him a responsible IRS reform bill as soon as possible.

THE PROPOSAL TO ELIMINATE THE TAX CODE, WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT THE
REPLACEMENT SYSTEM WOULD BE, IS DANGEROUS AND WOULD CREATE TREMENDOUS
UNCERTAINTY, THREATENING TO DERAIL THE ECONOMY FROM ITS SUCCESSFUL
COURSE:

·   The Value of Family Homes Could Fall by Thousands of Dollars because the future of the
    mortgage interest deduction would be completely unknown for the 30 million homeowners who
    claim it.                                 .

·   People's Health Insurance Could Be Threatened because the exclusion from income for
    employer-provided health benefits would be in jeopardy. Over 165 million Americans are covered
    by employer-provided health benefits.

·   Family's Retirement Security Would be Less Solid with the Potential Elimination of Tax
    Incentives for Pensions, 401(k)s, and IRAs. This would result in less employer-sponsored
    retirement savings and less promotion of retirement saving vehicles, which many believe would
    harm retirement income security. About 60 million Americans and retirees participate in
    employer provided pension plans structured around provisions in the income tax code and about 22
    million have established IRAs.

·   Critical Enacted Tax Relief Would Be Threatened. The balanced budget the President
    delivered provides a $500 child tax credit to 26 million families and $1,500 HOPE Scholarships to
    5.8 million students. This proposal places these tax cuts at risk.

·   The Uncertainty Created Would Harm Business Investment Decisions. Every plan to
    purchase a piece of equipment or build a factory has tax consequences. The uncertainty about the
    future of the tax system will raise interest rates, slow investment, and cost jobs. Moreover, there
    are over $3 trillion in investment costs that have yet to be recovered. The proposal would make
    future recovery uncertain and would necessitate very complex transition rules.
                                                                                ,
·   The Proposal Would Create Tremendous Uncertainty for Charitable Institutions of all types
    -- churches, cultural institutions, medical research institutes, colleges and universities, and relief
    organizations -- that rely on $80 billion in deductible charitable contributions each year.
FOR MANY IN THE CONGRESSIONAL MAJORITY, SUNSETTING THE TAX CODE IS A DEVICE
TO BE USED TO IMPOSE EITHER A NATIONAL SALES TAX OR A FLAT TAX. All of these
proposals would either: undermine fiscal discipline and drain surpluses that could be critically
important to saving Social Security first.!!!: raise taxes on tens of millions of working families.
                                     From a Reckless Scheme
                                                                       .Automated Records Management System
As President Clinton has said:                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion

   "We put in place a three-part economic strategy rejecting these false choices from the past:

   ·   First, restoring fiscal discipline and conquering the deficits that hobbled growth, spiked
       interest rates, and robbed our economy of capital for investment throughout the 1980s.

   · . Second, investments in our people, in science and technology, in education and job
       training, and health care, so that everyone has a chance to reap the rewards of growing
       prosperity.

   ·   And third, we responded to the global nature of the new economy by opening new
       markets to our goods and services.

   The strategy is clearly working. There is renewed confidence in the American economy. Its
   stability, its strength, its steady growth are the envy of the world." [Speech to Mortgage Bankers
   Association, March 2, 1998]

The nation is enjoying the strongest economy in a generation: the lowest unemployment rate,
4.3 percent, in 28 years, the first surplus since 1969, and more than 16 million new jobs
created. The reckless attempt to sunset the tax code poses a direct threat to our economic
prosperity. As President Clinton has said:

   "All that would be certain about this proposal is uncertainty. And again I say, as all of you
   in this room well know, uncertainty is the enemy of economic growth. We live in a world
   where there is a lot of change and unpredictability and uncertainty, by definition, in the
   nature of this new economy. But to do well, you have to at least know what the rules are.

   Our economy is growing because consumer confidence and business investment are at record
   highs .... What people think is going to happen, as all of you know, in an economy, is just as
   important as what in fact is happening today. Almost every business investment has tax
   consequences. With no ability to predict the consequences, businesses might decide to
   postpone, cancel, or pare back on plans to buy new computers, build a new factory, hire new
   workers. How could you plan, construct, or finance a new apartment complex or shopping
   center if you couldn't calculate the return on investment because you couldn't determine the
   tax consequences?

   Business growth would stall in that kind of uncertainty. And economic uncertainty is no
   friend to families. The scheme to abolish the tax code could threaten nearly every American
   family's best-laid plans for the future." [Speech to Mortgage Bankers Association, March 2, 1998,
   emphasis added].

                                        Broad Support for President Clinton's
                                           Stand Defending the Economy
                                                                       Automated Records Management System
                                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion
    ·   As Chamber of Commerce chief economist Martin Regalia said, "It's more than a little
        dangerous" [Commercial Appeal, 3122/98, emphasis added].

    ·   The Tax Executive Institute, a nonpartisan association that represents approximately 5,000
        in-house tax professionals employed by 2,800 leading companies in the U.S. and Canada, has said:

        ·   the proposals "illustrate the folly of making tax policy by sound bite and should be rejected."

        ·   "a company that otherwise would invest millions of dollars in a multi-year expansion of its
            manufacturing facilities might well demur if the pending legislation were enacted because of
            uncertainty over whether or how, after December 31, 2001, it would be able to recover its
            costs. (The~e are an estimated $ 3 trillion in unrecovered costs of existing property, and of
            course the current economic expansion is dependent on sustained future investments.)

        ·   Similarly, individuals who would otherwise invest and save toward retirement might pause
            because of uncertainty over how their retirement earnings would be taxed. To repeal the
            Internal Revenue Code without specifying a replacement system -- to exalt the exhilaration
            of 'doing it now' over the necessity of 'doing it right' - is to threaten major disruptions of
            the economy and the lives of the American people." [TEl letter to Chainnan Archer and Roth,
            March 23, 1998, emphasis added]

    ·   The President of the National Association of Realtors, Layne Morrill, denounced the sunset idea as
        "disastrous for American home owners." [Commercial Appeal, 3/22/98, emphasis added].

    ·   Harvey Hirschhorn, a portfolio manager and chief economist at the Chicago-based investment
        house of Stein Roe & Farnham, told Investors Business Daily that: "Ifthe Tax Code
        Termination Act were to pass, the markets would experience significant volatility," He also said
        that, "there's no question about it. The stock market'simply doesn't like uncertainty." [Investors
        Business Daily, 3/24/98, emphasis added].

    ·   On March 5, 1998, Bob Dole said, "I'm not certain about saying we're going to sunset the IRS by
        the year 2001, unless you've got something to put in its place." [Tax Analysts' Highlights and Documents,
        March 6, 1998]

    ·   Joel Slemrod, a tax expert at the University of Michigan Business School, has called sunsetting
        the tax code: "A crazy idea" [The Christian Science Monitor, March 9, 1998].

    ·   Letter from former Commissioners, Democrats and Republicans, of the IRS to Roth and Archer:
        the sunset proposal "does not meet the standards of reasoned and responsible legislation." [Letter
        from fonner Commissioners to Chainnen Roth and Archer, March 19, 1998, emphasis added].
