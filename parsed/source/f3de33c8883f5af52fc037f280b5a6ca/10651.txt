Subject:         A reminder about guidance

A plea to those of you who provide guidance.  Please remember that our
deadline for guidance EVERY OAY is 11:00am unless you hear otherwise.
There are no exceptions.   It is unfair for us to expect Joe to prepare
adequately in less time than the 11:00 deadline provides.  If, for some
reason, and these cases should be RARE, you absolutely cannot get your
guidance in, please call me and let me know WELL BEFORE the 11:00
deadline. Thanks so much.
