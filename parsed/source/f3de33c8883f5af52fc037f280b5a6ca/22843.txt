Obviously, the GOP Governors are trying to push their message that there
should be "no new initiatives (class size, school construction) unless
current federal commitments (IDEA at 40 %) are fully funded." Jonathan
Jones (Carper) has inserted into NGA policy a helpful and important twist;
"No new iniatives OR TAX CUTS unless federal commitments are fully funded."
