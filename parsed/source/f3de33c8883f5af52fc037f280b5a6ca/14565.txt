                               MARYLAND EDUCATION EFFORTS


    Standards: As a result of state education refonn initiatives over the last five years, Maryland
    has become known for having high standards. Education Week's report card gave Maryland in
    Standards and Assessments a 100% rating. Part of the state's education refonn efforts included
    developing a test called the Maryland School Perfonnance Assessment Program (MSP AP),
    which measures how well students are meeting these standards by testing their reading, writing,
    language, math, science, and social studies skills. The Administration's proposal for national
    voluntary tests in reading and math is very compatible with the MSP AP.

    Charter Schools: There are no serious charter schools bills pending in the legislature, although
    there are advocates for charter schools legislation in the legislature and on the State Board of
    Education. Chris Cross, the President of the Maryland State Board of Education and several other
    Board members have been attempting to promote charter schools legislation for the past year.
    However, this proposal ran into opposition from the Public School Superintendent's Association
    of Maryland and the Maryland Association of Boards of Education. A Task Force appointed by
    the State Board of Education concluded that local school boards already had sufficient authority
    to establish charter schools -- and several have been established in Baltimore City.
    Consequently, there are no current proposals in the legislature to authorize charter schools,
    though most advocates of charter schools believe legislation is needed in order to see any
    widespread development of new charter schools.

    Hope Scholarship: Governor Glendening introduced legislation to create the Maryland Hope
    Scholarship which will provide tuition, mandatory fees, and a book allowance to students who
    graduate from a Maryland high school with a "B" average and whose family income is below
    $60,000.



    NOTE:

    Baltimore City funding controversy: The state legislature will soon have to decide whether to
    approve a proposed settlement of a suit brought by Baltimore against the State, alleging unlawful
    disparities in school financing. Under the terms of the settlement, Baltimore will receive an
    additional $40 million per year from the state in each of the next five years .. In exchange,
    Baltimore will accept a new school board, which will be jointly appointed by the Mayor of
    Baltimore and the Governor of Maryland from a pool of candidates recommended by the State
    Board of Education. Legislators from Montgomery and Prince George's Counties have objected
    to the proposed settlement, arguing that it gives too much money to Baltimore. It is currently
    impossible to predict whether the state legislature will approve the settlement.
