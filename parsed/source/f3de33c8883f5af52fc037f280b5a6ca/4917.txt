 I have not yet persuaded OMB not to respond to this old letter from Murray
 and Wellstone, but I'm still trying.  I'm now trying to get Sally Katzen's
 shop to object since the reg is under review.
 They've asked me to revise their draft letter which is awful.

  Subject:         letter to Murray/Wellstone

  cynthia, the Director wants to respond to the Senators.  I have watered
  this down to say almost nothing. How does this look? If there is a
  particular sentence that is of concern to you, please let me know if you
  could suggest a modification.  thanks

  Dear:

          Thank you for sharing your views on the Wellstone/Murray Family
  Violence Option provision that was contained in the Senate-passed budget
  reconciliation bill. The provisions would have given states discretion to
  issue temporary waivers from various requirements in their welfare plans
  to victims of domestic violence.

          The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) was the result of a long
  process of bipartisan negotiations. The final legislation contained
  language requiring a study of the effect of family violence on
  contributing to the use of welfare programs.  Recognizing that your
  concern was resolved in a manner different than you had hoped for, we must
  emphasize that the final bill viewed as a whole represents bipartisan
  consensus, which balances the budget and cuts taxes for middle class
  families, while protecting important priorities such as education and
  childrenD,s health care.



         As you know, there are ongoing efforts to address this concern as
 a part of the Labor, Health and Human Services fiscal year 1998
 appropriations bill.
  As you and I have discussed, we share your goal of permitting states to
 grant temporary waivers from the work rules and time limits to victims of
 domestic violence. We share concerns that you have in this area and
 believe that the regulation nearing completion at the Department of Health
 and Human Services will go a long way to address some of them.
