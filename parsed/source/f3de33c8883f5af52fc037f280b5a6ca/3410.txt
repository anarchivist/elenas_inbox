     TEXT:
     If we want to push OMB to expand the DOD computer accommodations to the
     whole government, here is a draft memo explaining what the program is and
     why it should be expanded.  I know I can't make it happen by talking to
     OMB, so if we want to do it, we have to convine Frank/Jack or, more
     likely, get Vicki to do something, given that Erskine made positive noises
     about it when he met with the appointees.  At the moment, it's in the
     draft executive order.

FROM:

As we approach the anniversary ofthe ADA, we would like to move forward on a good idea that
has been floating around for some time -- expanding the Defense Department's "CAP" program.
It has minor budget implications.

The Defense Department's Computer Accommodations Program ("CAP") purchases equipment
for DOD employees with disabilities to allows them to keep working if they become disabled, or
for new employees just joining the workforce. By using a central $2 million fund for such
purchases, individual offices do not have to bear the cost within their own budgets, and are less
likely to be deterred from hiring a person with a disability. CAP is also able to get better prices
on equipment through its bulk purchases and expertise. It has a showroom to help employees try
out appropriate adaptive devices (CAP makes the decision on what equipment is purchased, not
the employee). It has provided over 9,000 accommodations since its inception in 1990.

This program is a good example of how employers and employees are taking advantage of new
(and increasingly cheap) technology, such as computers for the blind that talk and listen, and
altemative computer keyboards for people with dexterity problems, that allow people with
disabilities to work.

For some time, the Administration's appointees with disabilities have been pushing the idea of
expanding the CAP program to cover all Federal employees, not just those at Defense. This is a
particular priority for Tony Coelho, chair ofthe President's Committee on Employment of People
with Disabilities. The idea was presented to Erskine when he met with the appointees several
months ago, and he felt it was a promising idea.

OMB staff believe that a centralized fund is unnecessary because agencies are already obligated
under current law (Section 504 of the Rehab Act) to provide such accommodations today.
However, many do not, and a centralized fund has many advantages.

Defense has estimated that it would cost $8 million a year to expand CAP government-wide, but
this is definitely overstated since CAP now serves the entire Defense Department for $2 million a
year. A more realistic range is $2 - 5 million a year. While having DOD perform this service
for all federal employees is a bit unusual, they have a great deal of expertise at this task and they
are ready to take on the added responsibility.

Ifwe were to announce this in connection with the ADA, the appointees with disabilities would
view this as a positive step but would not be exceptionally grateful for it, since they view it as
overdue and are also hoping that we will be able to come to an agreement on an executive order
on employment of people with disabilities. Weare continuing to work on that possibility.
