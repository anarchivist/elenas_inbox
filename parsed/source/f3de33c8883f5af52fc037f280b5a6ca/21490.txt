TEXT:
All of the news for the weekly for the President on health care would come
from an update on the budget negotiations.  Key issues that I believe that
he would benefit from receiving updates are: home health fixes, skilled
nursing facilities, assisted suicide, needles, race and health,
Pennsylvania DSH issues, and numerous CHIP fixes requested by states.
However, because all of these issues remain unresolved as of this moment
and will be resolved probably by Saturday evening, it would seem
ill-advised to send an status report on provisions that are likely to
change within the next 48 hours and be dated when the President reads
them.  If you like we could slightly modify this note to you and highlight
issues and cite these as examples of the numerous moving parts of the
budget deliberations of issues.
