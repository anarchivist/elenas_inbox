TEXT:
In the next few days, we have an excellent opportunity to work across
party lines and show the American people that we are making real progress
in improving our schools.  I strongly support the efforts of Senators
Daschle, Murray and Kennedy to offer a class size amendment to authorize
funding for 100,000 new, well-prepared teachers to reduce class size to a
national average of 18 in the early grades.   We have to act now when local
hiring decisions are being made to let local communities know that we have
a long-term committment to reduce class size.   I urge the Republican
leadership to allow a vote on this important amendment, and I urge every
Senator to support this effort give our nation's chilrdren the individual
attention they deserve in the classroom and the better future only a good
education can bring.
