TEXT:
The Post has requested a copy of the draft cloning report under FACA. HHS
doesn't think it can legally say no.  Shapiro doesn't want a fight and
doesn't mind giving it out. Unless we have immediate concerns, HHS will
send the report over later today or tomorrow.    NBAC discussed its
policy recommendations publicly last Saturday, so these won't create news,
but the report's interesting and detailed discussion of ethical,
religious, legal and scientific issues may be newsworthy.   Given HHS's
legal position, I'm assuming we have to let the draft out.

Can we give HHS the go ahead to give report to Washington Post?     Do I need
to prepare anything for press office?

Additionally, NBAC has decided to hold its last meeting on cloning
Saturday, June 7,  8:30-11:30 am in Crystal City. The Post has also asked
for copies of materials for the June 7 meeting at or before the meeting.
We should think about how to do POTUS announcement given these
developments.  Ideas?
