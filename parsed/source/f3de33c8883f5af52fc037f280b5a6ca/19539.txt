    I spoke with Becerra on this issue--he said he spoke with Shalala
    yesterday and indicated to her that he was glad that the science had been
    affirmed but where was the money? He did say that while he hadn't really
    heard from members, he didn't anticipate a Caucus statement or press
    conference saying that some of the members were conservative and not in
    favor of the needle exchange program. He did suggest that matching
    localities with private sources of funding would be a good thing.  Below
    is Minyon's note re her conversation with Waters.

    As a follow-up to your call, I spoke with Maxine. They haven't taken an
    official position on the Administrations announcement,   but anticipate
    meeting late tonight or tomorrow to discuss their response.   She indicated
    that she has rec'd pressure from many members re: federal funding and the
    impact on minority communities.    She further stated she wanted to have a
    longer discussion with Charles Rangel'.  She indicated that more than
    likely they will issue a press statement or do a press co~ference once
    consensus has been met. Asked if I wanted a heads up (response why
    course) .

    Maria she and Becerra will be talking.

Subject:         Needle Exchange Q&A's- note correction!



Note   the correction is the answer to the first question:

Because the science is now there to make these findings. We already knew
that needle exchange programs can help reduce the rate of HIV transmissions
, and yesterday, the Secretary made clear that the scientists, including
all the respected leadership within the National Institutes of Health,
have concluded that these programs do not increase drug use.

                                        Needle Exchange Q&As
                                            April 21, 1998


           Q:      Why did the Administration choose to issue the findings that needle exchange
                   programs reduce HIV transmission and does not increase drug use
                   yesterday?

           A:      Because the science is now there to make these findings. We already knew that
                   needle exchange programs can help reduce the rate of HIV transmissions, and
                   yesterday, the Secretary made clear that the scientists, including all the respected
                   leadership within the National Institutes of Health, have concluded that these
                   programs do not increase drug use. Communities around the country, who are
                   making their own decisions on this issue, should know that appropriately designed
                   needle exchange programs reduce HIV transmission and do not encourage illegal
                   drug use.


           Q:      If the science concludes that needle exchange programs reduce the
                   transmission of HIV and do not increase drug use, why aren't you releasing
                   federal funds for needle exchange programs?

           A:      We have always said that communities should make their own decisions on this
                   issue, based on their own circumstances and using the best available scientific
                   information. Releasing federal funding for needle exchange would have
                   inappropriately shifted the focus away from communities -- where these decisions
                   should be made -- to the national level. That could have severely undermined or
                   threatened local programs that are currently in place, and hindered additional
                   communities from deciding to put these programs into place. At the same time,
                   such federal action could send an inappropriate message about the acceptability of
                   drug use -- a message that is not sent when an individual community decides, on
                   the basis of its unique circumstances, that a particular, carefully designed needle
                   exchange program advances public health interests. For these reasons, the
                   Administration concluded that it should simply give the scientific guidance that is
                   necessary for communities to make their own decisions, rather than federalize the
                   needle exchange issue.


     Background:

                   Congress gave the Secretary of Health and Human Services the responsibility to
                   make two determinations: whether the scientific research findings conclude that
                   needle exchange programs reduce HIV transmission and whether they increase
                   drug use. In 1997, the Secretary made a determination that needle exchange



         programs do reduce the transmission ofHIV. Yesterday, the Secretary held a
         meeting with her senior scientific advisors, including Nobel Laureate and head of
         the National Institutes of Health, Dr. Harold Varmus. These scientists agreed
         that the science-based standards have been met with regard to drug use as well.


    Q:   Isn't it hypocritical to say that needle exchange saves lives, but that the
         federal government will not pay for needle exchange programs?

    A:   No. In making her announcement yesterday, the Secretary informed local
         communities that under certain conditions, needle exchange programs can reduce
         HIV transmission and not encourage drug use. The decision as to whether to
         adopt such programs is up to these communities, based on their own unique
         circumstances. The Administration did not want to imperil local decision making
         by bringing needle exchange up to the national level. Neither did the
         Administration want to take the risk that federalizing needle exchange would send
         a mixed message about drug use.


    Q:   Won't this send a message to young people that drugs -- especially injectable
         drugs like heroin -- are ok?

    A:   Absolutely not. Injectable drug use is illegal, unhealthy and wrong. It is clearly
         a major health problem as well as a significant law enforcement concern. That is
         why this Administration has consistently sent a unified message to all Americans,
         particularly young people: Drugs put your future at risk; they can kill you; and
         they can infect you with HIV. And that is part of the reason why the
         Administration will not release federal funding for needle exchange. National
         action could send a mixed message on drug use that individual local actions,
         based on and responding to particular circumstances, will not.

         Of course, this Administration has an extremely strong record on fighting drugs.
         We have increased the availability of drug treatment. We have worked in
         partnership with communities to fight drugs in and around schools. We have
         worked with state and local governments to put 100,000 more police officers on
         the streets, and we have doubled the number of border guards. We will continue
         to fight drug use in this country and to offer drug treatment to those who are
         addicted so that they stop using drugs.


    Q:   Wasn't the decision not to federally fund needle exchange programs based on
         political considerations?

    A:   The decision was based on a belief that communities should decide for themselves
         whether to adopt needle exchange programs, based on their own local



         circumstances and the best scientific evidence possible. We did fear that
         federalizing needle exchange would imperil such local decision making, by
         igniting a congressional battle on the subject. To that extent, the
         Administration's decision took into account political realities. But first and
         foremost, the decision resulted from a commitment to real, locally-based decision
         making on this subject.


    Q:   Isn't the Administration decision essentially an attempt to reach a
         compromise that both Secretary Shalala and General McCaffrey can sign on
         to?

    A:   No. Of course both the General and the Secretary support the Administration's
         decision. But that decision was a result of (1) scientific evidence about needle
         exchange and (2) a belief that needle exchange should be a local,
         community-based decision.
