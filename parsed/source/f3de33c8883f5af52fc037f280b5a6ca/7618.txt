                          President Clinton's New Transportation Proposal
                                        Offers a Clear Choice

           In just a few short days, Congress will face a critical decision on a transportation bill
           that will have far reaching implications. The choice is clear:




           Current Congressional Plan -- calls for spending in excess of receipts flowing into
           the Highway Trust Fund. The plan is not paid for and it would force dramatic cuts in
           critical priorities such as education, health, law enforcement and the environment.



President Clinton has proposed a new surface transportation funding plan.                         The new
proposal:
   ·   Provides an unprecedented guarantee that all Highway Trust Fund receipts will be spent on surface
       transportation (fully phased in by 2001).
   ·   Commits to the same level of funding as in the House and Senate surface transportation
       reauthorization bills -- $219 billion-- but the funds would be spent over 7 years rather than 6 years, so
       as to protect other investment priorities.
   ·   Is fully "paid for."

       Achieves record levels of transportation spending, while still:
               Protecting the surplus to save Social Security First.
               Protecting critical investments in education, health, the environment, and law enforcement
               because the Administration proposal does not force these priorities to compete with transportation
               needs.
   ·   By setting spending on surface transportation equal to prior year Highway Trust Fund receipts, this plan
       ensures that spending levels can be sustained after the end of the authorization period
   ·   Protects key transportation priorities, including transit, safety and the environment.
       Provides for historic levels of surface transportation spending:
           Average annual spending on surface transportation in the Bush Administration was $20 billion.
       _   Average annual spending during the first 4 years of the Clinton Administration was $25.5 billion, an
           increase of 25 percent.
       _ The President's FY99 budget proposed spending $28 billion it year -- a 37 percent increase over Bush
           levels.
           The Administration's...new.proposal tWtould reach $33.8 billion a year -- a one-third increase over
       - spenOing aunng the t'reslClt:nt s nrs erm.
In stark contrast, the current Congressional plan calls for excessive levels of spending that would
threaten the budget surplus -- undermining the President's pledge to save Social Security First -- and
force draconian cuts in other critical domestic programs.
       collects each year. Thus, the federal government could not maintain these spending levels for the
       long-term without increasing the gasoline tax.
       If fully funded, it would drain tens of billions of dollars from critical national priorities including -E ~
                                                                                                                0::::'
       education, child care, medical research, food safety, the environment, and even law enforcement and ~ ~
       other transportation priorities, such as aviation.                                                      ijl :J!
                                                                                                                n;
       Even at these spending levels, the congressional plan would not guarantee sufficient funding for high~
                                                                                                            ::>
       safety. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) would have to compete with <r:
       other domestic discretionary programs to get the funding levels the President has requested.
       The congressional plan slights mass transit, spending a smaller fraction of available funds on transit than
       the Senate's ISTEA II bill or the Administration's proposal.

The President's senior advisers would recommend that he veto a conference bill that makes available an
excessive level of budgetary resources if it is financed by: spending the surplus, reducing the domestic
discretionary budget caps, using unacceptable budget offsets, or forcing cuts in domestic priority
programs. They would also recommend veto of a conference bill that slights highway safety or other
transportation priorities.


                                          The Choice is Clear
