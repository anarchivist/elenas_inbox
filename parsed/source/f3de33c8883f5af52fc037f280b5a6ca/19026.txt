ABBREVIATED TALKING POINTS ON NEEDLE EXCHANGE

The Clinton Administration
A Record of Fighting the AIDS Epidemic

It has been more than 15 years since the epidemic of HIV/AIDS struck our
nation.   In that time, more than 600,000 Americans have been diagnosed
with AIDS and more than 300,000 men, women, and children have died of
AIDS.   President Clinton has worked hard to reinvigorate the response to
HIV and AIDS, providing new national leadership, substantially greater
resources, and a closer working relationship with affected communities.

Overall Increases.  Since President Clinton took office in 1993, overall
funding for AIDS related programs has increased by more than 86%.

Supported the Ryan White CARE Act.  President Clinton in five years has
tripled funding for the Ryan White CARE Act, the largest distributor of
funds for medical and support services to people living with HIV and
AIDS.  In 1996, the Administration earmarked Ryan White funds for the AIDS
Drug Assistance Program to help those without insurance obtain much needed
prescription drugs; since then, ADAP funds have increased by 450%.

Supported   the National Institutes of Health.  The Administration has
increased   NIH AIDS research funds by 50% in five years.  In 1993,
President   Clinton signed the NIH Revitalization Act creating a permanent
Office of   AIDS Research at NIH and investing it with new authority to plan


and carry out the AIDS research agenda.

Accelerated AIDS Drug Approval to Record Times. Since 1993, the Food and
Drug Administration has approved 10 new AIDS drugs, 20 new drugs for
AIDS-related conditions, and three new diagnostic tests.  Included in the
approvals are a class of drugs known as protease inhibitors, which, in
combination with previous drugs, have shown tremendous promise in the
treatment of HIV progression.

Pushed for an AIDS Vaccine.  On May 18, 1997, the President challenged the
nation to develop an AIDS vaccine within the next ten years.  He has
supported that goal by dedicating an AIDS vaccine research center at the
National Institutes of Health and encouraging domestic and international
collaboration among governments, medical communities and service
organizations.

Increased Access to HIV Prevention Services for Youth.  In a directive
issued on World AIDS Day 1997, President Clinton instructed each Federal
agency to identify all programs under its control that offer opportunities
to youth for preventing HIV infection and develop within 180 days a plan
through which those programs can increase preventative education as well
as support services for those already infected.

Protected Medicaid.  The President fought to preserve Medicaid coverage
for people living with AIDS.  Nearly 50% of people with AIDS and 92% of
children with AIDS rely on Medicaid for health coverage.  He also revised
eligibility rules for Social Security Disability Insurance to increase the
number of HIV+ persons who qualify for benefits.
