BR/EK:

ONDCP, WH Counsel and DOJ are still pushing for a press conference next
week condemning the various medical marijuana state ballot initiatives.   I
understand that the tentative plan is to have McCaffrey or his deputy,
Reno and Shalala give comments on why voters should reject pending state
ballot initiatives on medical marijuana (i.e., smoked marijuana not proven
to be helpful, research on marijuana components not conclusive and still
underway, and drug laws should not be changed until the medical facts are
in) -- and release a supportive letter by the past Presidents. A
statement by the President would follow a day or two later (see attached) .

WH Counsel has spoken to Toiv and Begala, and they seem to be okay w/a
statement. Barry suggested that the event take place Tuesday, before the
Columbia state visit on Wednesday, and Paul thought the statement should
be released separately from the event.  Shalala has still not bought in to
the event, but was going to be speaking to Reno this afternoon, who seems
to be supportive and believes Shalala should be present.

                          PROPOSED STATEMENT ON MEDICAL MARIJUANA

         "This election day, voters in several states are considering ballot initiatives on medical
         marijuana. I urge voters to reject these initiatives. Smoked marijuana has not been
         demonstrated to be effective in treating disease, and there is only anecdotal evidence that
         marijuana components may help some patients. Before rushing to change our drug laws,
         scientific research must first confirm that the benefits of medical marijuana outweigh the risks.
         The federal government is currently funding such research, and I encourage voters to oppose the
         pending initiatives until the medical facts are in."
