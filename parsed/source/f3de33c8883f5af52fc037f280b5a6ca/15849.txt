TEXT:
as you know, potus would like to talk about urban policy when he speaks
to the mayors on 6/23. bruce-- i think you were in the scheduling meeting
with the president, so you may know more than me but reports are that he
wants some policy announcements if possible--more than the cops in housing
stuff. are you working on something--or is gene? should we get together to
talk about it?
