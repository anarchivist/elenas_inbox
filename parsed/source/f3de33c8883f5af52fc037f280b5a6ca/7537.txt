                                 . Class Size Q's and A's

Q.   The Senate already rejected a class size amendment several weeks ago when it took
     up the CoverdeU bill, along with other key parts of the President's education
     agenda, such as school construction. What do you expect Congress to do with the
     legislation the President transmitted today?

A.   We expect the Congress to take this proposal up, and we will fight to get it passed in both
     the House and Senate and to the President's desk for his signature. The fact that the
     Senate has turned this down as an amendment to the Coverdell bill does not predict how
     it will fare when it is fully considered on its own terms. As we learned in 1996, as we
     get closer to the Fall elections, Congressional interest in doing things that will have a
     tangible benefit for for education increases. Reducing class size and modernizing school
     buildings are among the most important and tangible things this Congress could do to
     improve our schools.

     This proposal is an important part of the President's overall effort to strengthen public
     education. Parents and teachers know that children will learn more in smaller classes, and
     the report released by the Education Department backs that up with solid research
     evidence. This national effort to reduce class size in the early grades will help
     significantly improve the quality of our public schools.

     Smaller classes should not be a partisan issue. It isn't a partisan issue outside of
     Washington, where governors of both parties (e.g., Wilson in CA, Gilmore inVA,
     Carper in DE) have launced their own efforts to reduce class size. Mayors of both
     parties, who met with the President just yesterday, support federal funding to help reduce
     class size. We hope the Congress will join with parents, educators and elected officials
     to support this effort on a bipartisan basis.


Q.   The President has proposed to pay for this class size reduction initiative out of funds
     from the proposed tobacco settlement. Yet in an interview (with Al Hunt) last
     week, the President said he would be willing to let Congress give states more
     flexibility in how to spend tobacco money. How hard is the President going to fight
     for this proposal?

A.   The primary focus on tobacco legislation right now appropriately is to make sure that any
     legislation meets the principles the President has laid out for preventing teen smoki~g and
     promoting public health. As the legislative process progresses, we will work closely
     With the Congress to ensure that the President's priorities are reflected in how tobacco
     revenue is spent. The President is going to fight hard for this proposal, as he has been
     doing for all of his education proposals. That's why he went to Delaware today--to
     continue to make the case for his proposals throughout the country.

Q.   The President has proposed to pay for this class size reduction initiative out of funds
                                        Hex-Dump Conversion
     from the proposed tobacco settlement. If the Congress doesn't pass tobacco
     legislation will the President be forced to drop this proposal, or is there another
     funding source for this?

A.   We expect the Congress to pass tobacco legislation before            ; the President is
     working very hard to help make that happen, and he believes the chances are good that
     such legislation will pass. So it is premature to speculate about hypothetical situations.


Q.   Delaware is trying to pass its own legislation to reduce class size in the early grades.
     Why should the federal government do the same thing, if states are already doing it?

A.   First, there are many states and many communities which are not yet working to give
     students small classes, so it is a mistake to assume that because some states are working
     to lower class size that all are. Second, while it is very important to give students
     smaller classes, it is also expensive to do this. The President has called for national
     effort to create smaller classes, and for creating a partnership between federal, state and
     local governments to accomplish this goal. The President's proposal provides significant
     resources to help states and communities reduce class size.

Q.   California already has a major initiative to reduce class size to 19 students in grades
     1-2. If the President's proposal passes, wouldn't a state like California simply stop
     spending its own money on this, and use federal money instead?

A.   Like most federal education programs, the President's proposal would require states to
     continue its own efforts and not simply substitute federal funds for state funds. But,
     California could use the funds under this program to further reduce class size in the early
     grades--say to 15 students. Or, it could use these funds to expand its efforts to additional
     grades.
