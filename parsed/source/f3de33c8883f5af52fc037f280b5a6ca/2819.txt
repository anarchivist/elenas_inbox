                         PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
                     ANNOUNCEMENT OF CLONING LEGISLATION
                               THE ROSE GARDEN
                                  JUNE 9, 1997

      Acknowledgments: Vice President Gore; Secretary Shalala; Dr. Harold Varmus, Dir.,
NIH; Dr. Jack Gibbons, the President's Advisor on Science and Technology; President's
Committee of Advisors of Science and Technology.

       I want to express my deep gratitude to Dr. Shapiro and the National Bioethics Advisory
Commission for preparing this report. As Dr. Shapiro mentioned, the time was short, the topic
was sensitive, and the area to be covered was wide. I thank each of you for your commitment
and your courage to break new ground in public policy making.

        As the remarkable breakthrough in cloning we are here to address makes so clear, we are
living in a breathtaking era of scientific discovery. More and more, America's future -- and the
world's future -- depend on science and technology. And more and more, the scientific
community will influence the course of that future, and the lives our children will lead in the 21 st
century. As I said in my commencement address at Morgan State University last month, our
scientific explorations must be guided by our commitment to human values, the good of society,
and our basic sense of right and wrong.

        Nothing makes the necessity of that moral obligation more clear than the troubling
possiblity that these new animal cloning techniques could be used to create a child. That is why
I acted quickly in March to ban the use of federal funds for cloning human beings -- and to urge
the private sector to observe this ban voluntarily -- while we initiated a national dialogue on the
risks and responsibilities of such a possibility. And that is why I asked the National Bioethics
Advisory Commission to prepare this report.

        For three months, the Commission has rigorously explored the scientific, moral and
spiritual dimensions of human cloning. You have talked to leading scientists and religious
leaders; philosophers and concerned families; patient advocates and the general public. And
from their many opinions and beliefs, one conclusion has emerged: attempting to clone a human
being is unacceptably dangerous to the child and is therefore morally unacceptable to society.

         I believe strongly that this conclusion reflects a national consensus ... and I believe
personally that it is right. Today, I am sending legislation to Congress that prohibits anyone -- in
either the private or the public sector -- from using these techniques to create a child [for the next
five years]. Until the day I sign that legislation into law, the moratorium I declared in March
will remain in effect. And once again, I call on the private sector to refrain voluntarily from
using this technology to attempt to clone a human being. It is untested, it is unsafe, and it is
wrong.
                                                                                       Hex-Dump Convarsion

        I want to make clear that there is nothing inherently immoral or wrong with these new
techniques if they are used for proper purposes. In fact, these techniques hold out the promise of
revolutionary new medical treatments and life-saving cures to diseases like cystic fibrosis,
diabtetes, and cancer; of better crops and stronger livestock. That is why this legislation will not
prohibit the use of these techniques to clone human tissues and cells, and it will not ban the
cloning of animals.

        What this legislation will do is reaffirm our most cherished beliefs about the miracle of
human life, and the God-given individuality that each person possesses. It will ensure that we
do not fall prey to the temptation to replicate ourselves at the expense of those beliefs ... and the
lives of the innocent children we would produce. Finally, this legislation will ensure that we
continue the national dialogue we began three months ago.

       [To make sure that all of our voices are heard as we explore the possibility of human
cloning, the legislation specifically requires the National Bioethics Advisory Commission to
continue to study the issue and report back to Congress within four-and-a-halfyears. At that
time, we will decide whether the ban will continue.]

       It is my own opinion that banning human cloning is the right thing to do. Creating a
child through cloning calls into question our most fundamental beliefs about what it means to be
human. It has the potential to undermine the sacred family bonds that are at the very core of our
ideals. And it has the potential to encourage prejudices and preferences that threaten our unity
as a nation.

       We are still a long way from understanding all of the implications of this remarkable
breakthrough. But it is our moral obligation and our honor to confront the issues it raises, and to
act now to prevent its abuse. I am confident that the step we are taking today will continue that
process. Once again, I thank the National Bioethics Advisory Commission for the work you
have done and will continue to do in the coming years.

       Thank you and God bless you.
