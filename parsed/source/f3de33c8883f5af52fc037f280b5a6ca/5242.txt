                                  1998 Education Budget:         Hex-Dwnp Conversion
                     An Historic Investment in Educational Opportunity
                                          November 13, 1997

  Now I ask you -- and I ask all our nation's governors; I ask parents, teachers, and citizens all
  across America --for a new nonpartisan commitment to education -- because education is a critical
. national security issue for our future, and politics must stop at the schoolhouse door.
                                     President Clinton, State of the Union Address, February 4,1997

 HIGHLIGHTS: The President's signature on the Labor-HHS-Education Appropriations Bill today,
 along with the education tax cuts enacted in August, take us an historic step closer to reaching
 the President's goal of making sure that every 8-year old can read, every 12-year old can log on
 to Internet, every I8-year old can to college, and all Americans can keep on learning throughout
 their lifetimes. These investments represent the largest increase in our education investment in a
 generation, including the biggest increase in college aid since the GI Bill 50 years ago. The bill being
 signed today:
          promotes high standards and continued development of voluntary national tests;
          increases Pell Grants to $3,000 -- the largest increase in two decades;
          expands Head Start;
          funds America Reads to help all children read well and independently by age 8;
          brings technology to the classroom;
          expands choice and accountability through public Charter Schools.

 HELPING YOUNG CHILDREN GET READY TO LEARN

 Expands Read Start toward 1 Million Children. The bill provides nearly $4.4 billion for Head
 Start, continuing on track with the President's commitment to the goal of serving one million
 children. With this $374 million increase, Head Start funding will have increased 57 SInce
 1993. The program will serve an estimated 836,000 children in 1998.

 RAISING STANDARDS: HELPING STUDENTS MASTER THE BASICS AND ADVANCED
 SKILLS

 Continues Development of Voluntary National Tests. The bill allows continued
 deVelopment of national tests in 4th grade reading lind 8th grade math, based on widely
 accepted national standards used in the National Assessment of Educational Progress
 (NAEP). It shifts control over test policies and development to the independent, bipartisan,
 National Assessment Governing Board (NAGB), as the Administration had proposed. The
 bill provides $16 million to support the testing plan, and allows for pilot testing of test items
 to begin next Fall. The bill also provides for a feasibility study to determine if existing state
 tests can be linked to the NAEP standards, and to each other.
                                                                   Hex-Dwnp Conversion
Provides Funding for the America Reads Challenge. The bill provides $301 million in new
America Reads funding. This builds on current AmeriCorps tutoring efforts, and more than
800 colleges that have committed to using Federal work-study slots tutoring children who
need help in reading.
               AmeriCorps and the senior volunteer programs won an increase of $64
               million in the two bills that fund National Service program ($39 million in the
               bill being signed today). This will fund more than 3000 AmeriCorps
               members and senior volunteers who will recruit more than 100,000 volunteer
               tutors.
               State teacher training and family literacy efforts are increased a total of $47
               million, and $5 million is provided to help provide training for tutors.
               $210 million for pending legislation based on the President's America Reads
               initiative. The House version of that legislation -- promoting tutoring, family
               literacy, and teacher training -- passed the House with the Administration's
               support on November 8.

Brings Technology to the Classroom. Technology education programs received a 91 percent
increase, from $305 million to $545 million, including:

               Technology Literacy Challenge Fund    The bill provides $425 million, more
               than twice as much as the $200 million appropriated last year, to help States,
               comm~nities, and schools acquire hardware, software, and connectivity
               linkages; provide professional development in the integration of technology
               into the curriculum; and apply technology to support school reform efforts
               and opportunities for all students.

               Technology Innovation Challenge Grants. The bill includes $106 million--a 41
              percent increase over last year's level of $75 miIIion--to support 15 new
              projects focused on delivering the most effective training for teachers in using
              educational technologies, as well as 62 existing projects involving a wide range
              of innovative strategies for improving teaching and learning and increasing
              student access to technology..

Expands Choice and Accountability in Public Schools. President Clinton's Public Charter
Schools Program received a 57percent increase, from $51 million to $80 million. This
program provides start-up funding for public schools that parents, teachers, and communities
create -- and that States free from most rules and regulations and instead holds them
accountable for raising student achievement. By the end of next year, the Department of
Education will be funding nearly 1,000 locally-designed charter schools, accelerating
progress toward the ~resident's goal of developing 3,000 new charter schools by early in the
next century.
                                                                         Hex-Dwnp Conversion
Supports Certification of Master Teachers. The bill includes $18.5 million in support of
the President's plan to help 100,000 teachers nationwide seek certification as Master
Teachers by the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards.

Provides After-School Opportunities for Children.  The bill dramatically expands support for
the 21st Century Community Learning Centers program, providing $40 million to support
hundreds of after-school centers in rural and urban schools across the country that will
provide academic enrichment, tutoring, and other learning opportunities 'while giving students
a safe haven during the often-dangerous after-school hours.

Supports Strategies for Transforming Failing Schools. The bill includes $150 million in new
funds for an initiative, supported by the President, to help low-achieving, low-income schools
transform themselves through proven reforms, addressing failing schools without abandoning
public education. Will help almost 3,000 schools implement successful reforms.

Helps Children Learn English. The bill includes a 35 increase in bilingual and immigrant
education secured by the President in the Balanced Budget Agreement. The bilingual
education funding will help school districts teach English to more than a million limited
English proficient children, as well as provide some 4,000 teachers with the training they
need to do their jobs better. The Immigrant Education program will help more than a
thousand school districts provide supplemental instructional services to 875,000 recent
immigrant students.

Helps Children with Special Needs.      This bill appropriates $3.8 billion for Special Education
Grants to States, an increase of $700 million that will raise the Federal share of serving about
6 million children with disabilities by 19 percent. This increase will help States and school
districts improve educational results for children with disabilities and help these children meet
high standards, as called for by the recently enaded Individuals with Disabilities Ad
Amendments of 1997.

Promotes High Standards for All Children. The bill provides $491 million for the
President's Goals 2000 school reform program. Communities in every state are using
Goals 2000 funds to upgrade curriculum, improve teaching, increase parental involvement in
schools, and make greater use of computers in the classroom. Since 1994, over $1.3 billion
has been invested in this vital initiative.

Funds Extra Assistance for Low-Income Schools and Students. The bill provides nearly $7.4
billion in Title I to support extra help in basic and advanced skills for more than ten million
disadvantaged students in elementary and secondary schools. Under the Clinton
Administration, investment in Title I has grown by over $ 1 billion.
FOR A LIFETIME

Increases Pel/Grant Award to $3,000 Maximum. Congress adopted President Clinton's
proposal to increase the maximum Pell Grant to $3,000 -- the largest increase in two decades.
 Approximately 3.7 million students will receive the $300 increase, and an additional 214,000
low- and moderate-income families that were not previously eligible will receive Pell Grants.
Protects Families' Financial Aid Eligibility. The bill includes the President's proposal to
ensure that families' eligibility for Federal financial aid is not reduced as a result of the tax
cuts for higher education. This was a part of the Administration's original HOPE
Scholarship proposal, but was not included in the recent tax legislation.

Reduces Student Loan Interest Rate. A one-year provision will reduce the interest rate on
consolidation loans in the guaranteed student loan program to match the lower rate which
has been offered under direct lending, and will allow old loans to be consolidated into either
program.

STRENGTHENING OUR NATION'S COMMITMENT TO EQUITY IN EDUCATION

Fully Funds Office for Civillughts. The bill fully funds the Department of Education's Office
for Civil Rights, meeting the President's request for a 12 increase in order to protect
America's students from illegal discrimination in education.

Increases Funding for HistoricaUy Black Colleges and Universities and Hispanic Serving
Institutions. The bill meets the President's request for increases for both Historically Black
Colleges and Universities and Hispanic-Serving Institutions, providing greater support for
these vital postsecondary institutions.

OTHER VICTORIES

The bill also maintains our investments in Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities,
School-to-Work Opportunities, College Work-Study, and other education priorities.
