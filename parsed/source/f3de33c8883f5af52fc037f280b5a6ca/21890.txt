     TEXT:
             This is an update on two important affirmative action cases. In
     Lutheran Church v. FCC, the D.C. Circuit struck down the FCC's EEO
     standards for broadcast licensees. There has been little interest in
     seeking cert. at DOJ or at the FCC, and the time for doing so has almost
     run. I agree that this is not a good cert case. In addition, the FCC has
     published a proposed rule to reinstitute the rules without numerical
     guidelines, which the court felt was the key problem. This is only a
     modestly good solution. There are thousands of licensees. Without knowing
     whether a station has met or exceeded a particular hiring goal, the FCC
     has a hard time deciding when to review a licensee's recruitment
     practices. Nevertheless, there was general agreement at DOJ and the FCC
     that this was the best we could do. There is a good possibility that the
     question of when recruitment and outreach trigger strict scrutiny will
     arise again.

             In Wessman v. Boston School Committee (the Boston Latin case), the
     plaintiff challenged the refusal of Boston Latin, a highly competitive
     public high school, to admit her. The school admitted 50% of their class
     based strictly on their rank on a composite index that included a
     standardized test score and grades. The remaining 50% were filled by
     allocating a portion of the remaining groups to five different racial
     groups, based on the share each one made up of the qualified applicant
     pool. Then students were admitted within each group based on their rank on
     the composite index. The First Circuit did not reach the question of
     whether diversity can be a compelling interest. However, in a 2-1 vote,
     the court found that the admissions policies were not narrowly tailored.
     It said the admissions guidelines were "less a means of attaining
     diversity in any constitutionally relevant sense and more a means for
     racial balancing."


            The School Committee has decided to seek cert. While there is time
    for reflection, the initial reaction at DOJ has been that this is not a
    basis for Supreme Court review of these issues, and, therefore, is not
    inclined to urge the Court to grant cert. On the other hand, if the Court
    does take the case, we will very likely want to file a brief defending
    diversity, though not the particular scheme that was used.  I also think
    this the right approach. If anyone would like to have more information on
    these cases, please let me know.



    D.C. cui        As you may know, the First Circuit recently held that the
    admissions program of a highl competitive public high school Thanks for
    your note on the Boston Latin case. As we have discussed, there are some
    difficulties in relying on this case to argue for the constitutionality of
    diversity in admissions. The SG's inclination, with which I agree, is not
    to file an amicus advocating that the Court grant cert. However, if the
    Court does decide to take up the case, the strong likelihood is that we
    would get involved. No decision has to be made for a while, so there is
    time for discussion.
