      Hello, friends,

     I spoke yesterday to Wade Henderson; Art Coleman spoke to Bill
Taylor.

       Both Wade and Bill understood that the Administration was committed
      to the national tests and would welcome continuing the conversations
      with the civil rights groups.

      Wade: . Point One. Yes, he had read the Secretary's letter and was
      surprised that we had circulated it widely.  He was trying to keep
the
     conversation below the radar. Wade had communicated to Maria
Echaveste
     his disappointment that the letter signed by Secretary Riley did not
     recognize that the Leadership Conference was splitting off from other
     civil rights groups that detested testing in any form.  Wade was
     particularly offending by the "patronizing" tone of the first few
     paragraphs that preached the values of school reforms.  The
Conference
     had already embraced high standards in their original letter, and the
     Administration's letter completely ignored that significant statement


        by LCCR.

        Point Two.   Wade welcomed further discussions.   He saw no value in
        advancing "positions" in the manner of the Caucuses "won: and the
        White House "lost" because disagreements between two supporters of
        high standards inevitably leads to the opponents of high standards
        lIwinning."

        Point Three.   Wade is interested in continuing the conversations
about
        the concerns that the LCCR group expressed in the national tests.  He
        described the Secretary's letter as lacking any substantial
        concessions to the concerns raised by the first LCCR letter.   (This
        sounded to me like posturing before going into negotiations, though.)

        Bill Taylor. On the other hand, Bill sounded much more enthusiastic
        about Secretary Riley's letter. He was still troubled about the
        Reading test measuring only English-reading skills, but he thought
        that the letter contained many significant commitments by the
        Administration. He said he would welcome conversations with the
        Administration about the national tests and the steps the Adm. would
        take to address further the civil rights concerns. On the whole, he
        saw the letter as a very positive sign that the Adm. had heard the
        civil rights groups' concerns.

        Norma
