TEXT:
THe mission, which I had a BRIEF conversation with Bruce about already, is to
figure out if we can have a position other than "just say no" in case Dole

products veto, challenging us to prove we're for consumers and not the trial
lawyers. John Schmidt should love it, but I agree with your analysis.   Ellen
