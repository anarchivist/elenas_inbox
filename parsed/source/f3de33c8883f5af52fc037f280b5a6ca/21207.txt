SUBJECT:                  Heads up on HHS Proposed Rule on Medicaid Managed Care


        HHS is preparing to submit a proposed rule which substantially alters the Medicaid
managed care program, implementing key provisions in the Balanced Budget Act (BBA) of
1997. The rule streamlines the administration of the program for States, adds patient
protections and creates a number of new quality-related requirements on managed care
organizations (MCOs). The rule is complicated because it was developed working with three,
often differing constituencies: beneficiaries (advocates), States and MCOs. Chris Jennings
(DPC) is organizing an event on the 17th around the rule. HHS is hoping to submit the rule to
OMB
early next week but is struggling to gain closure on a number of issues.

       Relying on both the BBA and the Patient Bill of Rights, the rule establishes new
beneficiary protections in areas such as quality assurance, grievance rights and coverage of
emergency services. The rule eliminates the waiver process, leaving States free to mandate
enrollment of beneficiaries into managed care (with the exception of vulnerable populations,
such as the disabled) and other impediments to managed care such as the enrollment composition
requirement. As required by law, the rule also creates a quality assessment and performance
improvement program to monitor and evaluate the quality ofMCO service provided.

        Although HHS has done fairly extensive outreach to affected constituencies, it is unclear
how patient advocates; States, and the managed care industry will react. Patient advocates will
be pleased with the adoption ofthe patient and consumer rights provisions. States, although
happy to avoid waivers, have expressed concern over the remaining conditions and limitations on
them. The MCOs may find the quality assessment provisions somewhat burdensome, but have
indicated that they are pleased that these provisions are consistent with the Medicare Plus Choice
regulations promulgated earlier this year.
