TEXT:
 I think we can certainly suggest that they wait until at least Mayor
June. I agree that it may be potential overload - particularly if there is
not significant action at each event - per SOTU. However moving the EZ/EC
conference would require a conversation with Kumiki. I know their plans
aren't firm and won't be until the Director situation is setteled. You may
have a better sense on the timing of that.


Changing the Subject .....
RE: zero to three letter.  I talked with Pauline, please send me the
letter with changes and draft of exec order and I will get out to the
appropriate folks.  I have a lunch meeting and will be back by 1:15.
Thanks.
