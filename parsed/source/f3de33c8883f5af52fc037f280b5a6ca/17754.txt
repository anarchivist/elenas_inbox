FROM:      OMB LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS

SUBJECT:           LEGISLATIVE REPORT


Monday morning the Senate passed (voice) H.J.Res. lOS, a 5th Continuing
Resolution through Friday, November 14th, clearing the measure for the
President.

The House and Senate will reconvene at 12:00 noon on Wednesday, November
12th.

Last night, House and Senate negotiators agreed on a 7-month highway
extension. While it passed the Senate, House action is expected this
week.  The Senate plans to take up the mUlti-year ISTEA bill as its first
order of business next year; the House is still expecting to consider the
multi-year bill later in the Spring, in the context of the budget
resolution.

Late last week, Senate Minority Leader Daschle appointed Senators Jay
Rockefeller and Bob Kerrey to the Medicare Commission; they are the first
of 17 commissioners to be appointed by the congressional leadership and
the President. The Commission is due to begin its work December 1.

CONGRESS TODAY (11/10)

- S 493 (relating to cell phones) with Hatch and Kyl amendments.
