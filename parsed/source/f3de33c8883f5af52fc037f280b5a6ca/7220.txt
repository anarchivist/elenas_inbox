Thank you for the info.  Jason Goldberg just sent me an e-mail saying that
he thought you and Elena were working on a briefing memo for the VP.  Is
that right? If it is, obviously we'd defer to your memo, if not, I'll
write a very brief briefing (so to speak) and you can brief the VP in
person tomorrow on any more of the details. Thanks again.

The main point is that we want to persuade them that 1) bipartisan
negotiation is better than chaos on the floor, and 2) we need to move
quickly and be reasonable or we're going to blow the chance to get this
done.
