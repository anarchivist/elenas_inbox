  TEXT:
  Results from our meeting:

  1.  State/Commerce/USTR have agreed on draft language to send to US
  embassies to implement the Doggett Amendment:  formalizing our "no
  promotion of tobacco" policy.  It might make a decent leak.  On the plus
  side it makes explicit our current rule (for instance an Ambassador could
  not go to a tobacco event in a foreign country under the new policy) on
  the other hand: (1) embassies have generally understood they shouldn't be
  promoting under our old policy; (2) some might say we were prompted by
  Doggett to do this; (3) tobacco companies can still get "routine
  facilitation services" such as "publicly available information." USTR is
  nervous about press as they say it will only raise the bar for what we
  should do.     I still think its worth giving out, we say it formalizes
  our current policy, Doggett provides for continued giving out of services,
  and we are looking for a more comprehensive strategy to come out of the
  comprehensive legislation. I'd go ahead and check with groups to make sure
  we get validated if we were thinking of doing this.

   I've dropped a copy of the document off for you.

  2. The Hill (a group including Lautenberg, Durbin, Doggett, Waxman,
  Lugar, Harkin) have a variety of draft bills in the works:

  * An expanded Doggett that makes Doggett, which was attached to an
  Appropriations bill, permanent and includes all U.S. government agencies
  not just State/Commerce/USTR.

  * Smuggling labeling and tracking to ensure custody chain.   (I've sent over
  a copy of their memo) .

  * Fund creating $150 million a year endowment bo do media/education
  against smoking efforts internationally.

  * International labeling and advertising bill to make companies comply
  with federal domestic requirements.
.'
          These Hill groups are looking to move this stuff in the next two weeks
          with a media event on Feb. 11.

          3. Framework Convention idea. HHS still wants to move the idea of a
          convention along.  State is hesitant but not negative. State argues we
          don't have a policy yet to codify in a treaty.
