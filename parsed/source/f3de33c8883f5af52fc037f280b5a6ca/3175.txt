MEMORANDUM FOR THE CHIEF OF STAFF

FROM:          Bruce Reed

SUBJECT:       Tobacco Settlement Review Process

This memo sets forth the process we will use to review and evaluate the proposed tobacco
settlement with relevant agencies, to seek input from the public health community, Congress, and
others, and to present recommendations to the President. Our goal is to prepare a memo for the
President by late July that: defines our public health and public interest objectives for a global
settlement; weighs the settlement's strengths and weaknesses against those objectives and
proposes possible modifications; summarizes the views of the public health community,
Congress, and other affected parties; and lays out positions the President could take on the
settlement proposal.

Interagency Review

The review will be carried out by four major workgroups:

I.     Regulatory Issues (Chaired by Elena Kagan). Subgroups will look at: (a) FDA
       regulation' of product content; (b) FDA regulation of access, advertising and labeling;
       and (c) restrictions on environmental tobacco smoke in public buildings and workplace
       settings. Participating White House offices are DPC, OMB, OVP, NEC, OSTP.
       Participating agencies are HHS, DOJ, DOL, GSA, EPA, Treasury.

II.    Program and Budget Issues (Chaired by Chris Jennings). This group will examine
       programs to reduce smoking, expand children's health care coverage, and other proposed
       uses of settlement funds. Subgroups will consider: (a) Medicaid funds / children's health
       care; (b) education efforts (including grass roots programs); (c) smoking cessation
       programs; and (d) investments in health research, including nicotine research. White
       House offices are DPC, OMB, NEC, OVP, OSTP. Participating agencies are HHS,
       Treasury, DOL, USDA, Interior, V A, and DOD.

III.   Legal Issues (Chaired by Elena Kagan). This group will consider a number of legal
       issues, including liability, litigation, document disclosure, and antitrust questions. White
       House offices are DPC, OVP, NEC, Counsel. Participating agencies are DOJ, HHS,
       Treasury, Interior.

IV.    Industry Performance and Accountability (chaired by Bruce Reed). This group will
       analyze economic and international issues. Subgroups will assess: (a) the economics of
       the industry and the settlement's effects on, industry performance, federal revenues,
       consumers, farmers, etc.; (b) the incentives and penalties industry would face if children's

       international issues, and the settlement's international implications. White House offices
       are DPC, NEC, CEA, OVP, OMB, OSTP; participating agencies are: HHS, Treasury,
       DOL, USDA, USTR, State, DOD.

Public Outreach

We will work with OPL and HHS to run a tightly focused public outreach effort designed to
demonstrate the President is conducting a thoughtful, thorough review focused on the public
health. Many groups covering a wide range of interests are affected by the proposed settlement.
We will narrow our task -- and reinforce the President's focus on public health -- by hosting 6-8
highly visible White House meetings with small, select groups of health experts. We will
encourage others to share their views through written comments and, where appropriate,
meetings with agency staff.

Donna and I will host the White House meetings over the next three weeks. We will convene
leading thinkers on tobacco, including: experts from national health organizations;
Koop-Kessler advisory group participants; experts on nicotine addiction; local grass-roots
advocates; state and local tobacco control officials; and children's health advocates.

The first meeting will be on Friday. We will invite in Dr. Kessler and several members of the
Koop-Kessler advisory group, including the American Cancer Society, American Medical
Association and the American Lung Association (Koop is not available). The committee will
not have finished its report, but will be able to validate the careful, thorough review the
Administration is conducting, and praise the President for expressing concern over the proposal's
handling of nicotine regulation.

Congressional Outreach
-- this is a placeholder based on my conversation with Rich this morning. Rich is seeing ifhe
can put off Lautenberg meeting until week after next--

If the President chooses to promote a settlement, he will need strong and broad Congressional
support. Multiple committees in both the House and Senate would have jurisdiction over
legislation enacting an agreement. The goal of our Congressional outreach process will be to
strengthen relationships on the issue with key members, keeping the debate bipartisan. Today
and tomorrow HHS is making calls to key Republican and Democratic members to let seek their
input on how best to consult with the Hill in the coming weeks. We expect to conduct meetings
with members the week of July 7, and will have a more detailed Congressional outreach plan by
mid-week next week.                                    .

Press Plan

This issue is certain to attract considerable press attention throughout our review. Major news
organizations have assigned entire teams to cover the tobacco settlement. After devoting so
much coverage to the negotiations, the networks are determined to keep this issue alive. We

On Friday, Donna and I are prepared to brief the White House press corps on how we will
conduct this review, who will be involved from within the administration, and what groups and
outside experts we plan to consult. As noted above, on Friday we will also invite David Kessler
and other members of the Koop-Kessler advisory group to discuss their efforts to develop an
expanded blueprint on tobacco control.

The week of July 7, while the President is away, Donna and I will conduct the public health and
Congressional meetings described above. This will give the press something to write about, and
show that we're running an open process. The week of July 14, we will continue public health
and Congressional meetings and bring in two groups of attorneys general -- the enthusiasts and
the skeptics. The Vice President is willing to hold a public hearing with us in mid-July [Bruce --
let's talk about this -- there are downsides].

Schedule

We have planned the following schedule. HHS does not believe the review can be completed
within 30 days, as the President suggested. We will work as quickly as possible to preserve that
option but ensure a decision by early August at the latest.

     Week of June 23: Work groups convened; subgroups assigned analytic tasks.
                    June 27:          First outreach meeting and press briefing on process.
     Week of June 30: Subgroups provide preliminary assessments; define remaining issues.
     Week of July 7:      Subgroups develop options for 0titstanding issues and synthesize work.
                          Continue White House meetings with public health groups.
                          Begin meetings with members of Congress.
     Week of July 14:     Principals review workgroup assessments and meet to firm up options.
                          Possible public hearing with VP
     Week of July 21:     Initial meeting with the President
     late July/early Aug: Presidential decision
