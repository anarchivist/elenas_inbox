TEXT:
All:
Ellen Vargyas had a conversation with David Frank this afternoon. He told
her that according to Mike Rengler, there has not yet been a committee
report drafted for the subcommittee. On the $ front, he told her that the
appropriators had not settled on a figure.  One of the big issues is the
part of the increase ($9 million) that is slated to improve technology at
the agency. According to Frank, some on the subcommittee indicated that
they were interested in having the EEOC fund its technology improvements
(computers; e-mail; legal data bases) using discretionary dollars in the
Treasury-Postal legislation ($ intended to be used to address the the Y2K
problem).  Frank further indicated that the agency should get "a big
chunk" of the rest
($28 million) .

Ellen told Frank that we want to make sure that we have resolution on the
other five conditions as soon as possible.  Frank told Ellen that he would
try to get Rengler to focus on drafting conference language on this.
Given this delay, he indicated that they could push back the date by which
he would want to know whether we had a deal on testers (they had
originally talked about a July 1st deadline).

Julie
