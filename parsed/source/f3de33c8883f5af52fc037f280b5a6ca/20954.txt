    TEXT:
    Elena/Rob:
    According to Scott Busby, Alan Erenbaum (INS leg. affairs) and Peter J.
    made a deal last Friday (unbeknownst to us (NSC/WHC/DPC)) with Rep. Jack
    Reed that we would not oppose his amendment (to the House CJS approps.
    bill) that provides for the extension of TPS (temporary protected status)
    for Liberians. As I indicated in my last note on this, the DOJ recently
    decided to terminate TPS for Liberians, effective September 28, 1998.

    In addition, OPL sent a note to the President about a letter from the
    Liberian Association of Metropolitan Atlanta in which the group expressed
    its concern about the deportation of Liberians. This note also stated
    that the Liberian Ambassador approached Ben Johnson in Atlanta requesting
    that the President issue a stay of deportation.  In the margin of this
    weekly item, the President indicated that he wanted Berger to figure out
    whether we could help with this and asked what Jesse Jackson thought about
    it.

    Last night, Scott Busby faxed me a copy of the Jackson recommendation.
    Jackson has asked the President to direct the AG to grant DED for
    Liberians b/c (1) though the country is doing better, it is not yet fully
    developed; (2) the economy could not now sustain a "sudden influx of
    citizens" -- not enough jobs or opportunities; and (3) Liberians living in
    the U.S. provide remittances to Liberia that are needed.

    According to Scott, Berger wants to respond to the President as soon as he
    can with some background on this issue.  Scott and Eric Shwartz want to
    recommend DED for Liberians if the Reed TPS amendment fails or if CJS does
    not pass before the expiration of TPS. Their reasoning is that the
    situation here is more stable than in Liberia (or in the rest of Africa
    where the overwhelming majority of ex-pat Liberians live and from where
    they are currently being repatriated); and that Liberia continues to be
    fragile.  Busby and Shwartz have concluded that it would be "helpful" not
    to burden Liberia with more Liberians.

    I continue to think that there are many problems with granting DED for
    this small population of Liberians -- (1) the number of Liberians at issue
    is very small; (2) the rate of deportation is very low (so the reality is
    that few Liberians will be returning within the next year); (3) many who
    are here may be eligible for asylum (the approval rate for asylum seekers
    in high for Liberians); and (4) we continue to fund (through UNHCR)
    repatriation efforts of close to 500,000 Liberians from other parts of the
    world and thus have made a foreign policy decision that the country is


     stable enough for return.  According to NSC, the State Dept. and DOJ
     continue to be opposed to DED for Liberians.

     I have asked Scott to call a meeting with us, DOJ, INS and State (and
     whomever else) to discuss their proposed recommendation.
