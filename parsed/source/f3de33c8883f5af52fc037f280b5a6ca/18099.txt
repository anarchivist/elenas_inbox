                             Southwest Border Drug Initiative               HJ)(·Dump Conversion

Background:

     For several months, General McCaffrey has been arguing for a comprehensive effort to
     stem the flow of drugs coming across the Southwest Border. Based on his site visits to
     many of the 39 points of entry (POEs) along the Southwest Border, McCaffrey has argued
     for improved management and increased resources to support the "rule of law" along the
     border. In brief, McCaffrey's recommendations include: (1) improved accountability by
     establishing a "Border Czar" and appointing an "in-charge" federal official at each POE;
     (2) improving infrastructure along the Southwest Border; (3) expanding cooperation with
     Mexico; and (4). improving law enforcement and intelligence coordination. After
     outlining these recommendations to the Chief of Staff this week, General McCaffery
     announced to the press that the Administration would be releasing a 5-year Southwest
     Border strategy as part of the State of the Union.


Q:   Mr. President, this past week General McCaffrey announced that you would be
     announcing a new strategy for the Southwest Border in your State of the Union
     Address. Is this true and, if so, can you tell us a little bit about this proposed
     strategy?

A:   This summer, General McCaffrey and other officials spent a considerable amount of time
     on a fact-finding tour of the Southwest Border. He has since briefed me and key
     Members of Congress on his findings. In short, he points out that our Southwest Border
     is one of the largest and most active borders in the world, and that its getting even busier.
      Tens of millions of cars and trucks cross every year, as so do hundreds of millions of
     people -- and billions of dollars in two-way trade. And this increased traffic makes our
     drug control efforts more important than ever.

     This Administration has already dramatically increased the federal presence at the border.
      We have doubled the number of Border Patrol agents from 3,000 to 6,000 and added
     other law enforcement resources. But even more needs to be done.

     General McCaffrey has already initiated an exhaustive review of our intelligence
     architecture. Working with the Departments of Justice and the Treasury, he is looking
     for ways to improve and better coordinate our intelligence efforts. But we need to look
     at other ways to support the rule of the law at the border -- increased accountability,
     better law enforcement coordination and improved technological capabilities. These are
     all issues we are considering in the budget process and in the development of our
     National Drug Control Strategy, and I expect we will come forward with
     recommendations and improvements throughout the year.
