TEXT:
Elisabeth spoke to Liz Fine at DOJ who said they're meeting with the AG in
a week or two to discuss their study and related initiatives, including a
possible model project.  They think they would be ready for some type of
release in September.

I would propose we set up a face to face meeting with Liz and her people
to discuss next steps -- we would have the meeting in about two weeks,
after they've met with the AG.   What do you think?
