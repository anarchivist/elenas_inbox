TEXT:
    Although Gov. Jesse Ventura (Reform-MN) "already had a permit to carry
a gun,
           state law banned him from packing heat in state buildings,
including the Capitol." Until
           2/5. Now Ventura's appointee as public safety commissioner, Cha
rlie Weaver, "has
           authorized the governor to carry a handgun in any state
building." Weaver said he didn't
           deal directly with Ventura. Rather, John Wodele, the governor's
press sec., "told
           Weaver that the governor needed the authorization, and Weaver
complied." Wodele,
           when asked why the governor sought the authorization: "The
governor has no intention to
           carry a weapon in any state building or the Capitol. This is
merely a procedure that was
           necessary to go through in case -- in case -- just for
protection in case he ever forgot that
           he was carrying and found himself in a state building. It is
merely an insurance policy in
           case he unintentionally carried into a state building. However,
he has no intention to."
           Carrying a concealed weapon in the Capitol or other state
buildings without authorization
           carries a fine of up to $10K, prison time of up to five years,
or both. Ventura "has
           declined to say why he sought the gun-carrying permit or who
issued it to him." Ventura
           has said that he probably would carry his weapon only if he
didn't have his State Patrol
           security detail and if he was concerned for his safety
(Whereatt, Minneapolis Star
           Tribune, 2/5).   (Back to Contents)
