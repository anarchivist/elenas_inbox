TEXT:
I think we should   sit down with her tomorrow, with Bruce, and tell her the
idea is for Bruce   to represent all of EOP in the meeting with Donna and
that we want more   of her input. We could add that we're trying to keep
the meeting small   with a few observers.  I think if she wants to be an
observer it would   be hard for us to exclude her.
