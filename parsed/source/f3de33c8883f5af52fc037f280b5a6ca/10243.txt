TEXT:
BR/EK/CR/LS:

I've suggested to both MD and ONDCP that they should postpone their 12/9
"Drug-Free Prisons" event until the first week in January when we
anticipate being able to do a broader coerced abstinence event with new
guidance for the use of prison funds, a DOJ report on drug
testing/treatment in prisons and ONDCP's drug detection grants. The ONDCP
announcement -- while not huge c_ links nicely with the prison grants and
would allow us to show -- exactly a year after the President signed a
directive on "zero tolerance" for drugs in prisons -- that we've made
progress on 2 out of the 3 issues we identified at the time: (1) up to $50
million for the 50 states to do more testing and treatment; and (2) $4
million for 8 key states to implement drug detection technologies to keep
drugs out of prisons (MD, CA, AZ, AL, FL, NJ, NY and KS).   (FYI: The third
issue was increased penalties, at the state level, for trafficking drugs
into prisons.)

Should we also have cabinet affairs or someone else reach out to
McCaffrey's folks to make the same request?

Jose'
