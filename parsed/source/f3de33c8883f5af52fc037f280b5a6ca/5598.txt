Subject:         Enforcing Civil Rights

In developing the Civil Rights Enforcement Initiative , it is important
that we also consider an explicit commitment to enforcing the equal pay
laws --something we know that working women are very concerned with. The
question of fair pay --or,more accurately, discrimination in pay
comes up in every report of womens concerns ,a nd beacuse the bottom line
is family income, is also popular with working men. "Pay equity" is high
on the list in discussion of a common Democratic agenda, with several
bills already introduced by Democratic leaders.
    While no one thinks these bills will get very far, being able to show
that we take the concept of fair pay seriously will be very helpful. Some
of the ideas suggested include 'a hot line to report pay discrimination,
and a "Swat Team" to enforce it . I can't see any conflict at all with
the proposals you have suggested      seems that it would go well'
