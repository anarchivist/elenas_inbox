TEXT:
FYI, 2 small ideas we are playing with for next week's CityYear speech:

1. Announcing that we have set aside $5 million in Corporation demo money
to add 500-1,000 new AmeriCorps slots to pursue the summit/America's
Promise goals.

2. Announcing that we are asking all AmeriCorps members to pledge to do
some amount of extra service, either during their year or after. This is
still a bit vague.  It might be done in concert with Big Brothers/Big
Sisters, Boys/Girls Clubs, and the Y.  Presumably CityYear would agree on
the spot to do this, and then Harris could require it of future AmeriCorps
grants.
