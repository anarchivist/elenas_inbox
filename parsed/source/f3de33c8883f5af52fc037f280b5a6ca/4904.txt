     TEXT:
     Last Friday, Sally Katzen hosted a briefing on OMB's decisions for
     modifying the standards for data on race and ethnicity that are planned
     for release next week.  Several individuals were unable to attend and have


  asked for a make-up session. To that end, another briefing has been
  scheduled for Thursday, October 23, at 9:15 a.m. in room 350.  Please
  contact me by phone (x54852) or e-mail to confirm your attendance.
