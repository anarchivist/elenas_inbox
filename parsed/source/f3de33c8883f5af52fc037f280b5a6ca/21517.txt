    BR, EK, et. al . :

    At the close of today's juvie meeting, Peter expressed that: (1) we would
    defer to the House and Senate Dems on whether or not we'd except the
    substance of the current juvie crime bill (the R's caved on most of their
    demands); and (2) even if the Dems were okay, we would insist on a handful
    of our own proposals before agreeing to include it in the omnibus.

    The D's are sorting things out with their members and visiting withe
    leaderShip.  Peter will hear back from them soon, and their may be another
    meeting with the R's.  In the meantime, I've drafted a one-pager on what
    we should insist on if all the D's agree to go with the bill.  If not, oh
    well ...

    Let me know if this doesn't work for folks ... jc3

        ADMINISTRATION CHANGES TO BE DRAFT JUVENILE CRIME BILL


        1. Prosecutors/Courts Initiative

              The bill should guarantee a percentage of funds for the Administration's $100
              million prosecutors/courts initiative -- just as it does with other programs. This
              could be accomplished by amending the current authorizing language, which
              guarantees 45% of the funds -- or $450 million -- for the Republicans'
              Accountability Block Grant, to say that 10% of the funds -- or $100 million -- are
              reserved for a prosecutors/courts program, and 35% of the funds -- or $350
              million -- are reserved for the Accountability Block Grant.

        2. Juvenile Brady -- Gun Ban for Violent Juveniles

              The most recent draft of the juvenile crime bill includes a juvenile Brady
              provision that is unacceptable. Not only would it allow states to circumvent the
              ban by easily restoring a juvenile's right to own a gun, but its effective date is
              contingent on the Attorney General making a detemiination that the records to
              enforce this new ban would be "routinely available" through the National Instant
              Criminal Background Check System. We should insist on our tougher version of
              juvenile Brady.

        3. Increased Penalties for the Youth Handgun Safety Act

              The draft juvenile crime bill does not include increased penalties for juvenile
              handgun possession (from mandatory probation to up to 1 year imprisonment) or
              for transferring a handgun to a juvenile (from 1 to 3 years imprisonment).
              Generally, these penalty increases have not been considered controversial, and
              they have most likely been dropped to deny the Administration a "gun victory."
              We should insist on their inclusion.

        4. Postpone Juvenile Crime Bill Funding Formula Until FY 2000

              The current Commerce-justice-State (CJS) appropriations bill includes language
              that would allow any juvenile crime legislation that passes to supersede the
              juvenile crime allocations already included in the CJS appropriation. This would
              effectively cut prevention funding for FY 1999 and should be deleted. The
              juvenile crime bill's funding formula should not go into effect until FY 2000.
