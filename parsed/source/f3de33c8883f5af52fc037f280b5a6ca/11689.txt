TEXT:
Harry Holzer has pointed out something very interesting:
The decennial Census has data that in some ways is even better than the
proposed EEO-1 could generate, for creating a "profile" of wages by gender
and race/ethnicity within occupation, industry, and local labor market.
The Census has hundreds of 3-digit occupations, within 3-digit industry
and city or metro area, whereas the proposed EEO-1 would have only 15
occupational categories. The full Census has this information for an
approximately 15% random sample of all workers in firms of all sizes, and
the Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) has it on 5% of them.
The Census' disadvantage is that it gets as much as 12 years out of date
before the next Census data are available, it does not have information on
firm size (so one can't separate firms with over 100 employees from
smaller ones), and it is a sample rather than all workers.

This suggests that EEOC could creat "screening" profiles without having
pay data on the EEO-1s from every firm with over 100 employees.   It could
collect the pay data from a firm against which a complaint is filed, and
compare it with the profile from the most recent Census for that


occupation, industry, and local labor market area.
