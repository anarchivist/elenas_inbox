     Draft 8-04-98
     MEMORANDUM FOR THE HEADS OF EXECUTNE DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES

     SUBJECT:       ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN AMERICAN INDIAN AND ALASKA
                    NA TNE COMMUNITIES

            Across America, communities are recognizing that technology and information
     technologies are key to creating economic opportunities and increasing productivity. My
     Administration has made substantial gains in spurring the development of an advanced
     information infrastructure in order to bring the benefits of the Information Age to all Americans.

              Looking to the future, we know that technology is a key to economic growth. We need
     to stimulate the growth of modern production facilities, small business incubators, capital access
     for start-up companies, and strategic planning to develop a vision for technologically competent
     communities. In particular, as telecommunications and information technologies continue to
     playa key role in providing new job and educational opportunities, we must ensure that all of
     our communities are able to fully participate in this new information economy.

             Because of their often remote locations, American Indian and Alaska Native communities
     stand to benefit the greatest from the Information Age, yet, are in the greatest danger of being left
     behind. We must act to ensure that these communities gain new tools to battle high levels of
     unemployment and low per-capita income. A recent study by the Department of Commerce
     on Internet and computer usage in America shows that, although many more Americans
     now own computers, minorities and low-income households are still far less likely than
     white or more affluent households to have personal computers or access to the Internet.
     And even more alarming, this study reveals that this "digital divide" between households
     of different races and income levels is growing.

             The ability to own a home and have access to capital are also very important for
     economic development. Residents of Indian reservations encounter several unique issues
     when seeking to obtain a mortgage. Trust land status, tribal sovereignty, and requirements to
     gain clear title from the Bureau of Indian Affairs are examples of issues that lenders and
     borrowers must grapple with during the mortgage lending process. Thus, individuals seeking to
     acquire a homesite lease or a residential mortgage are often required to obtain approval from
     several federal, tribal, state, and local agencies as well as private providers.

             The Department of Commerce, particularly through the Economic Development
     Administration (EDA), has a 30 year history of investing over $730 million in economic
     development projects in American Indian and Alaska Native communities, working with its
     existing network of 65 tribal planning organizations. In addition, Commerce's National
     Telecommunications and Information Administration has funded demonstration projects that
     show Native American communities how they can use technologies to improve the quality oflife
     on reservations.

            The Commerce Department's Minority Business Development Agency, has funded eight
                                                                       Hex,Dump Conversion

Native American Business Development Centers (NABDCs) that provide assistance with
accounting, administration, business planning, construction, and marketing. Wc must continue
this focus on infrastructure technology needs and business development in American Indian and
Alaskan Native communities.

         I accordingly direct the Secretary of Commerce, in collaboration with the Department of
the Interior and consultation with tribal governments, to report back to me within 9 months on
the state of infrastructure technology needs in Indian communities, including distance learning
facilities, telecommunications capabilities, and manufacturing facilities. This report should
identify the infrastructure technology needs in Indian country as well set forth proposals that
would help address these needs.

         In addition, I direct the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Commerce, and the SBA
Administrator to report back to me within 90 days with the development of a strategic plan that
will coordinate efficiently economic development initatives for Native American and Alaska
Native communities within the Department of Commerce, the Department of Interior, and the
Small Business Administration, including with the private sector. This strategic plan should
cooperate and consult with all interested parties, including tribal governments and other federal
agencies and offices -- particularly, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the
Department of Transportation, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture -- and build upon current
efforts in your agencies as well as look toward future efforts such as providing technical
assistance, enhancing infrastructure, and developing software.

         Finally, I direct the Secretaries of the Treasury and the Housing and Urban Development,
in partnership with local tribal governments and in cooperation with other federal agencies --
particularly, the Department of the Interior, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and the
Department of Agriculture, to initiate a project to help streamline the mortgage lending process
in Indian country in order to improve access to mortgage loans on Indian reservations. The
Secretaries should initiate this effort through a year-long pilot program on the Navajo Nation and
in at least one other location.

        These steps, taken together, will help ensure to the fullest extent possible the continuing
economic development in Indian country. I appreciate your commitment to improving the
technology infrastructure needs and the access to capital of Native Americans, and I look forward
to your continuing leadership in developing this strategic plan for economic development.
