TEXT:
Bruce forwarded me a letter from the Council of Chief State School
Officers requesting a meeting with the President sometime during their
legislative conference in DC March 14-16. Would you like me to go ahead
and submit a scheduling proposal for this meeting?

would we just want to do a meeting with the group, or would we want to
build some kind of message event around it?
