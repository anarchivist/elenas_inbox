TEXT:
Here are a few thoughts on our media plan to put in your memo to EB.    This
isn't much; maybe you have some ideas ...

Media Plan: This issue is certain to attract considerable press attention
throughout our review. Major news organizations have assigned entire
teams to cover the tobacco settlement. After devoting so much coverage to
the negotiations, the networks are determined to keep this issue alive.
We should take advantage of that heightened interest to advance our public
health message.

        On Friday, Donna and I are prepared to brief the White House press
corps on how we will conduct this review, who will be involved from within
the administration, and what groups and outside experts we plan to
consult. This week, we will also invite David Kessler and other members
of the Koop-Kessler advisory group to present us with the recommendations
on strengthening the settlement.

        The week of July 7, while the President is away, Donna and I can
conduct a series of outreach meetings at the White House with leading
public health advocates and members of Congress.  This will give the press
something to write about, and show that we're running an open process.
The week of July 14, we can bring in two groups of attorneys general --
first the enthusiasts and then the skeptics.

         Because the settlement raises a host of interesting and
complicated questions, the review itself will generate a number of
stor'ies. We won't be able to prevent leaks with dozens of people from
half a dozen agencies meeting regularly at the White House.   But we can
steer the press toward stories that work to our advantage and keep the
President's options open.
