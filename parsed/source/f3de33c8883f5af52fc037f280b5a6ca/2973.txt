TEXT:
Pres. letters has drafted the attached very brief reply to that long
letter from the Leadership conf. on welfare reform and civil rights.  It's
kind of short, but we clearly didn't want to get into a discussion of the
many issues / ideas they raised.  Maybe we need a stronger statement of
the Pres's dedication on civil rights? Anything you'd recommend?

I deleted the "civil rights enforcement" reference in the opening
sentence.  How does this read now?

Thanks.


Thank you for your letter regarding welfare reform.  You have raised
important issues, and I appreciate knowing of your numerous concerns
and recommendations.  I assure you that my Administration is committed
to implementing the welfare reform law in a fair and effective manner.
I have shared your letter with Secretary Shalala and Attorney General
Reno.

This summer, as I begin a nationwide dialogue on race relations and
civil rights enforcement, I look forward to your continuing counsel on
these critical issues.
