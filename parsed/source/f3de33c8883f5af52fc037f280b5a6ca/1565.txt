RE:            COMMENTS ON DRAFT TEXAS LETTER

DATE: MARCH 31


I do not think the Texas letter as it currently stands takes a strong enough position.

The language is very cautious and I believe could be read as a more ambiguous signal then we
intend to send. Suggestions for strengthening it are:

3rd graph      Rewrite: HHS believes states must bear in mind Section 1902 of
               the SSA which establishes the principle that ....

               Delete the qualifier, "In general ... "

4th graph:     Add a sentence which explicitly states that while the Medicaid
               principle is the basis for our guidance, we do not wish to imply that
               the incentives in Medicaid are analagous. (HHS can craft
               appropriate language.)

7th graph:     Rewrite: "HHS endorses the search for increased efficiency and
               accelerated innovation through the use of outside contractors. At
               the same time, however, we emphasize thast contract terms must
               assure program integrity and embody incentives that tightly align
               contractors' interests with program goals. Further, contract terms
               must provide for the kind of complete and transparent data that
               allows for meaningful evaluation and on-going competition.
