As you know, Harkin's staff asked for tobacco pay-fors that could raise
$4-$5 billion in FY 2000 for the Labor-HHS bill.  Here's a slightly
revised version of Treasury's options that I'm showing to OMB and HHS this
morning. Any comments? I want to get this to Peter Reineke by COB
today.  ==================== ATTACHMENT   1 ====================

                                          FY 2000 Tobacco Proposals
                                         June 7,1999 - DRAFT 9:30am

         Below are several approaches that would reduce youth smoking and raise revenue for health-
         related programs in FY 2000. All estimates are preliminary. Either an industry payment or a
         company payment based on the number of children smoking could raise close to $4 billion.
         Adding an acceleration of the scheduled increase in the tobacco excise tax to either payment
         could raise another $1.1 billion.

         Industry and Company Payments

         Industry Payments
         Each tobacco company would pay a per-child payment based on the number of children smoking
         nationwide (regardless of brands smoked).

                A one-time payment of $1 ,200 per kid raises about $4.4 billion in payment payments, less
                about $600 million in lost excise tax revenues, for a net revenue effect of$3.8 billion.
                This payment amounts to 22 cents per pack; because such payments would be
                nondeductible for the companies, prices would go up by 33 cents per pack.

                A one-time payment of $900 per kid raises about $3.4 billion, less about $500 million in
                lost excise tax revenues, for a net effect of$2.9 billion. This translates into 17 cents per
                pack in payment, and a 26-cent increase in retail prices.

         Company Payments
         Each tobacco company would pay a per-child payment based on the number of children smoking
         its brands of cigarettes nationwide.

                A one-time payment of $1 ,000 per kid raises about $3.8 billion, translating into 19 cents
                per pack payment.

                A one-time payment of $750 per kid raises about $2.9 billion, and translates into 15 cents
                per pack in payment.

         Both options would use data gathered by the newly expanded SAMSHA survey, which collects
         both brand-specific and overall data about smoking among youth. [check data availability]

         Acceleration of Excise Tax Increase

         The 1997 Balanced Budget Act raised the tobacco excise tax 10 cents per pack effective January
         1, 2000 and another 5 cents effective January 1, 2002. Accelerating the scheduled 15 cent
         tobacco tax increase, so that it takes effect in FY2000, would add about $1.1 billion in FY 2000.
         The increase would be slightly less if coupled with the industry payment, rather than the
         company payment, because the industry payment would increase cigarette higher, reducing
         cigarette consumption and the revenue raised by the higher excise tax.
