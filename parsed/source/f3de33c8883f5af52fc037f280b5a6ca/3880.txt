TEXT:
It seems like Eli is prepping most of the reporters, and is comfortable
with how things are going except for the Post and Times.  He's planing on
calling their welfare reporters Friday, but says he hasn't had much luck.
Evidently, the Wall Street Journal is planning a story for Tuesday am--
someone should touch base with them ...

 The White House reporters sound like they see this as   a Gephardt story.
Alternatively, Harris at the Post wanted to know if we   could give him any
policy early and he and Havemann (?) would write it as   welfare early.  (we
might coordinate who is getting what with McCurry, Eli   is supposed to talk
with McCurry today or tomorrow).  regards, Tom
