      TEXT:
      Below are some possible education announcements, as requested at the staff
      meeting this morning. We may have some additional suggestions tomorrow,
      as we get updated information from ED on grant awards and publications.
      Please note that several of these come from Jon, based on his outstanding
      work looking for announcement for the VP.  Clearly our new partnership is
      paying off!

      possible small policy initiatives and other education announcements

      1.      Bilingual Education Directive:  Direct the Education Department to
      produce a report that (1) highlights programs that help kids learn English
      within 3 years shows what makes them effective; (2) identifies
      international benchmarks of language training, identifying practices for
      teaching immigrants new languages, and teaching natives foreign languages.

      We can do this relatively quickly if we need to.

      2.       Announce first grants of Comprehensive School Reform
      (Obey/Porter) Program: On June 19, the Education Department will be ready
      to announce the first grants under this program.  Seven states (Illinois,
      Kansas, Maryland, Mississippi, New York, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin) will
      receive approximately $33 million, enough to support reform in up to 650
      schools. By July 1, there may be an additional 7 states that can receive
      approximately $18.2 million.

      3.      Highlight Lifelong Learning Tax Credits: The Lifelong learning tax
      credits will kick in on July 1. We could underscore this by releasing
      state-by-state figures showing the number of students eligible for the tas
      credit as well as HOPE Scholarship (which started Jan 1.). The VP is
      tentatively slated to release these figures in Iowa on July 7.

      4.      Announce lower interest rates'on student loans: On July 1, interest
      rates on student loans will drop almost a full percentage point--as
      proposed by the Administration last February. The lower rate was adopted
      as part of a temporary, 3-month measure included in the highway bill. The
      VP is also tentatively slated to make this announcement.
t

    5.      Launch the Education Departmentl), s Summer Reading Iniative: In early
    July 70 partnerships around the country will launch summer reading
    intiatives aimed at young kids.   This could be used to highlight the
    America Reads initiative', which has a July 1 deadline for being enacted in
    order to secure $240 million in FY 99 funds.
