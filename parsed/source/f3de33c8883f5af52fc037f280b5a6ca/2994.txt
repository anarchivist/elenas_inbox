TEXT:
HCFA is working on an options list; and I hope we'll get it today or
tomorrow. Then we'll need a meeting right after that.   I assume that I am
no longer covering this issue as I would have under Carol, and that the
bulk of the policy analysis on this would be done by Chris's team.

We shouldn't let ourselves get embarrassed on this. Is HCFA working on
this now? When will we get their options? Chris -- can you press this a
bit?
