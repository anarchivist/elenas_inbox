TEXT:
From today's U.S. News, Washington Wispers ...

           The director of President Clinton's program to put
                   100,000 new cops on the streets is on his way out.
                   Joseph Brann, the former Hayward, Calif., police
                   chief who has headed the cops program for most of
                   its five-year existence, told friends he is leaving for
                   personal reasons. The move comes after he was
                   stripped of authority after friction with Attorney
                   General Janet Reno. Also, the Justice Department's
                   inspector general said in a report that only 50,000
                   officers actually have hit the streets and that many
                   cities lack plans to make the additional cops
                   permanent. Allies say he has tired of getting
                   requests to award funds with political
                   considerations in mind.
