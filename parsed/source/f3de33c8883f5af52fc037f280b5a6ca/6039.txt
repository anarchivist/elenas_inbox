Just wanted to let you know that Peter Jacoby and I are working with the
EEOC legislative affairs office to coordinate some calls over the weekend
and get some paper faxed to Member's offices on Monday morning.  I sure
could use the draft fact sheet on this as soon as possible. We will want
to get a copy to EEOC/Leg. Affairs too.  Minyon, let me know if you have
any comments or suggestions.
