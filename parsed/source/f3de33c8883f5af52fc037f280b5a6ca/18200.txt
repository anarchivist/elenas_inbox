TEXT:
The select group of people recel.vl.ng this e-mail is the "Late Weekly
Report Group." Most other offices can manage getting their reports in by
Friday night -- your offices however ...

This week, please get the reports to me by no later than 10:00 am Saturday
morning. With the President leaving for Bosnia on Sunday afternoon, he
will really only have Saturday to read the reports.   Therefore, we should
get him the reports as early as possible on Saturday.

Then again, if you turn them in Friday night, so much the better.    But I'm
a realist.
