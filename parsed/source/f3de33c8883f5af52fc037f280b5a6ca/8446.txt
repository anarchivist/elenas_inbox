Subject:         Brief Description of Bragdon v. Abbott

BRAGDON v. ABBOTT
        The Supreme Court, as urged by the Solicitor General,  found that
being HIV positive is a disability subject to the Americans with
Disabilities Act, whether or not the individual is symptomatic, because
the infection impairs a significant life activity, in this case,
reproduction.  The Court did not rule definitively that all people with
HIV are protected by the ADA -- only those who can show.that the disease
impairs their ability to reproduce and bear children.
