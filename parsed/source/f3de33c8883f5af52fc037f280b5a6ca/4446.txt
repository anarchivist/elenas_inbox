TEXT:
As you may already have heard from Christa, the meeting request   for US
Commission on Immigration Reform Chair Hufstedler was regretted   by
scheduling. At a meeting earlier today, Sylvia suggested that     Erskine
meet with Hufstedler the day before the Commission releases its   report.

Jose and I wanted to make sure you thought this was ok; if so, I will make
sure they get all the necessary information.
