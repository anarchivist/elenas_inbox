TEXT:
I spoke with Larry Haas who is in charge of the documents, and at this
point he is just using the language in the budget document text.  He had
not heard of a re-write from Josh.  If he gets one, he promised to get it
to you two and us.

Sorry for these notes, but it's our unfortunate experience that you can
never be too careful.

Jeanne
