                 STATEMENT BY PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
                   ON THE NEW KAISER FOUNDATION REPORT
                       ON THE PATIENTS' BILL OF RIGHTS
                                 April 22, 1998


Today, the Kaiser Family Foundation released a new report that confirms our longstanding belief
that the cost of the Quality Commission's patients' bill of rights I have endorsed is modest and
well worth the protections it would provide. The Kaiser Report reaffirms recent estimates by the
C;::ongressional Budget Office that these protections would cost less than I percent (less than $3
per family per month).

The vast majority of Americans believe that they have inadequate protections to. assure high
quality care in the nation's rapidly changing health care system. They worry they will not be
able to see the specialists they need or get emergency care wherever and whenever a medical
emergency arises. They fear they cannot talk freely with doctors and nurses about all the medical
options available, not only the cheapest and that have nowhere to turn to address their concerns
and grievances with their health plans. The Quality Commission's patients' bill of rights
responds to these concerns by assuring these and other common sense protections. The modest
premium increases projected by both Kaiser and CBO are more than worth the protections
needed to renew American's confidence in their health care system.

By affirming the CBO estimates, this report closes the door on the scare tactic rhetoric opponents
have used to undermine bipartisan efforts in the Congress to pass a patients' bill of rights this
year. Opponents charge that these basic, common sense protections will increase premiums
substantially. Today, we have new information that yet again confirms that such claims are
baseless and serve only special interests rather than the real needs of Americans.

With this new information, there are no excuses left not to pass a strong bipartisan patients' bill
of rights this year. I am therefore reissuing my call on the Congress to move rapidly to send me
legislation that gives Americans the protections they need and deserve. I look forward to
working with members on both sides of the aisle committed to this end and remain confident that
we can place the needs of all Americans above the narrow interests of those who oppose a
long-overdue patients' bill of rights.
