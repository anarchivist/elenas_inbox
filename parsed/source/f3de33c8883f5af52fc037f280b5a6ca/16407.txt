TEXT:
HHS staff just called to inform us that Senator Craig will not be offering
the expected Hyde Extension amendment to the Senate Appropriations
Committee mark-up of the L/HHS bill.  So it appears that your review and
clearance on the HHS draft substitute amendment will no longer be required.

Thanks for your assistance.
