Subject: International Crime Strategy

You may know that DOJ has been heading an interagency team to develop the
first
ever national strategy for the USG's international crime efforts.   The
strategy
will be the Administration's framework and plan of action, including eight
broad
goals and related objectives, targeting the most serious threats posed by
international crime to US national security interests.   Thematically, this
issue
has strong links to the G-8 Birmingham agenda, where crime cooperation
will be
the major deliverable at the Saturday (May 16) session. We would propose
that
the POTUS rollout the International Crime Control Strategy the week before
departure for Europe as a way of linking the strong measures the
Administration
is pursuing at home in protecting the nation's security with the growing
partnership with our allies to fight the common threat of organized
crime.
