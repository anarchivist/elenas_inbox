TEXT:
FYI--Supervisor Gloria Molina is corning tomorrow for a welfare to work
event with the VP.  I don't know where she is on this issue, but you might
want to call her today (she leaves at 4:00 their time) and see if she's
willing to make some calls while she's
here. She will be having breakfast with me at 8:00 to go over the panel
she's doing, will do panel 9-10, will do event with vP, but should be done
at noon.
