TEXT:
HRC is speaking to the Pediatric AIDS Foundation on Tuesday night, and
they clearly want her to say something about pediatric drug labeling, the
issue I mentioned in my email to you about issues and event ideas.  I am
sure I can work out some language with HHS, FDA, and OVP for HRC to get
us through Tuesday. But after Tuesday would you like the DPC to take this
issue on? Kessler met with Shalala on this issue late last week. Apart
from the policy question of how best to achieve the shared goal of having
pediatric labeling on more drugs, the strategic question is whether to
move on this issue administratively and separately from FDA reform.   Some
people reportedly believe that it would make it more difficult to win
passage of a good FDA reform bill.

I will try work out some language for HRC along the lines of "the
Administration is committed to ensuring we make more progress on this
issue," (which has been said before) and if possible something about time
frames for action.
