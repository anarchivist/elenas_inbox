         BR:

         I think it makes sense to have DOJ try and    get the records piece fixed.
         The fee is still a good battle -- arguably    a better battle.  However, we
         should still try and get a freebie federal    page article on the fee/records
         issue before the a conference report comes    out.  Tom: what do we need for
         you to get your pals to get this done?

I spoke to Colgate and he understands our position on the fee issue.   He
is asking for guidance on the records retention issue however.

The current Brady act allows the government to retain records for up to 18
months and DOJ has written the software in the insta-check system to do
this. The Appropriations language would reduce the records retention to
24 hours.  If this is enacted, it will take DOJ 6-9 months to reprogram
the system and effectively delay implementation of the insta-check
system. Justice would like to try to negotiate with the appropriators on
the records retention issue and get them to agree to retaining the records
for 6 months instead of 18 months. Revising the software for a 6 month
retention period would not delay the implementation of the insta-check
system.

The problem with negotiating and fixing the records retention issue is
that we will be making the appropriations better and therefore harder to
oppose. Not fixing the records retention issue could potentially delay
implementation of insta check and make the Administration's opposition
stronger.

Colgate would like guidance on whether they can negotiate with the
appropriators on the records retention issue.  He and AG have a meeting
with Mollohan tomorrow morning at 10:00 on appropriations issues in
general.
