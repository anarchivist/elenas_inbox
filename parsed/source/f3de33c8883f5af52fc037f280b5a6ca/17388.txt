             BIPARTISAN SUPPORT FOR EXPANDING CHOICE IN PUBLIC
                   EDUCATION AND FIXING FAILING SCHOOLS
                                October 17, 1997

Now I ask you -- and I ask all our nation's governors; I ask parents, teachers, and citizens all
across America -- for a new nonpartisan commitment to education -- because education is a critical
national security issue for our future, and politics must stop at the schoolhouse door.
                                          President Clinton, State of the Union Address, February 4,1997

In his weekly radio address today, the President praised two initiatives in Congress where
Democrats and Republicans have come together in support of needed improvements in public
education. One bill would expand and strengthen President Clinton's public charter schools
program, by accelerating progress towards the President's goal of developing 3,000 new charter
schools by the year 2000, and encouraging states and local school districts to provide these
innovative public schools with more flexibility together with greater accountability. Another
measure would help schools implement school-wide reforms based on effective, proven models.
These initiatives show how we can improve our schools, and turn around low-performing
schools, without abandoning public education: strengthening schools with proven practices or
providing students and their families with more high-quality choices in public education.

CHARTER SCHOOLS HAVE EXPERIENCED TREMENDOUS GROWTH UNDER
PRESIDENT CLINTON'S LEADERSHIP. As a result of the President's continuing
leadership, there has been a dramatic growth in the number of charter schools. When President .
Clinton took office, there was one charter school in operation nationwide and only two states
with a charter law. This year, over 700 charter schools are expected to be in operation.
Similarly, the number of states with charter laws continues to grow -- 29 states, and the District
of Columbia have passed legislation authorizing the establishment of charter schools.

This growth has been fueled by the President's proposal of a public charter schools program,
which was enacted in 1994 as part of the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary
Education Act. With the President's leadership, the charter school program has grown from $6
million in FY 1995 to $51 million in FY 1997. The President has requested $100 million from
Congress in FY 1998 to provide support for 1,000 charter schools.

A BIPARTISAN BILL TO EXPAND CHOICE WITH PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY.
Recently House Education Committee Democrats and Republicans reached across party Hnes to
approve suggested amendments to the Public Charter Schools Program in a bill co-sponsored by
Rep. Riggs (R.-Calif.) and Rep. Roemer (D-Ind.). This bill would give a priority for awarding
new charter schools grants to states which are creating larger numbers of charter schools with
increased control over financial decision-making and that are clearly held accountable for results.
The bill also incorporates the President's goal of increasing the number of charter schools to
3,000 by the year 2000. Similar legislation is expected to be introduced shortly in the Senate by
Sen. Coats (R.-Ind.) and Sen. Lieberman (D.-Conn.). The President endorsed these bipartisan
efforts, and Administration staffwill continue to work with members of both parties as the
legislation moves through Congress.

BIPARTISAN SUPPORT FOR REFORMS THAT WORK: To help strengthen all public
schools, especially those with high concentrations of poverty, today the President also
announced his support for a bipartisan initiative led by Congressman David Obey (D.,
Wisconsin) and John Porter (R., Illinois). The initiative would help schools adopt
research-based models for school-wide improvements that have demonstrated
track-records of success at improving student achievement, through proven strategies such
as high standards for all students, intensive help in the basic skills in the early grades,
strong parental involvement in school decision-making, challenging curriculum often
implemented with the effective use of learning technologies, and effective training for
teachers. At funding levels included in the House Education Appropriations bill, the initiative
would fund $50,000+ competitive grants to at least 2,000 schools to adopt research-based models
of comprehensive school reform, such as those supported by New American Schools.

THESE INITIATIVES SHOW THE KIND OF INNOVATION THAT RESULTS WHEN
WE WORK TOGETHER TO IMPROVE -- NOT ABANDON -- OUR PUBLIC
SCHOOLS. Charter schools are examples of genuine public education reform -- they provide a
mechanism for change with real public accountability for promised results. Likewise, the
reform models to be made available through federal grants would provide a proven mechanism
for turning failing schools into successful ones. These initiatives would help increase the options
for creating and maintaining high-quality schools within the public school systems that the vast
majority of American children attend.
