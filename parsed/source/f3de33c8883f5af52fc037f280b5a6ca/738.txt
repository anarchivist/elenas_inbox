TEXT:
As you know, the final piece of the adoption directive asks several
agencies (Treasury, Commerce, HHS, Labor, and OPM) to work on a public
information campaign on adoption and disseminate information about the
adoption tax credit and other supports for prospective adoptive parents.

I finally have the list of the points of contact from the agencies and am
ready to convene a meeting here to get status reports from the agencies
and do some brainstorming to ensure that we adhere to the President's
directive.  I have two questions:

1. Would you like to chair the interagency meeting? I think that Lyn and I
could hold it ourselves, but it would have more weight with your being
there to set the tone.

2.  I think   it makes sense to fax a memo to the agency contacts soon
setting the   meeting and asking them to come to the meeting prepared to
discuss the   directive and ways that their agency is being responsive.  If
you want to   be involved, can I draft it for your signature?

FYI, the interagency group is:

Treasury:         Michael Thorton
HHS:              Carol Williams, Melissa Skolfield
Labor:            Stephenie Sworsky
Commerce:         Cheryl Bruner
OPM:              Janice Lachance
Justice:                  Eldie Acheson (Justice is not specifically
directed in the   executive memorandum, but is important to the issue)
