TEXT:
OK, scratch the previous message (reprinted below) .   OPM has previously
advised of their view that as a prohibited personnel practice, sexual
orientation discrimination claims have some remedies through the Merit
System Protection Board and the Office of Special Counsel as it now
stands, so they ce.rtainly wound not have any less after the EO. That's the
answer I think we needed to proceed.

Bruce, you told me you thought we should do this the last week of May,
after Congress goes out.  I'd like to raise with John P. the timing of
this for next week.  You will recall that when we last visited this, the
agreement was that we would do it in April or May.

OK w/ DPC to proceed as outlined?

I am assuming the plan is still to do this the week after next. We could
really use it. As I mentioned, I think OMB should send it over to EEOC
for a quick look and to answer the question: What procedures are in place
now or what types of procedures should be implemented to enforce the


requirements of the order relating to sexual orientation. We will get
this question and it would be good to have their answer ready. Thanks.

Enjoying the tobacco wars?
