TEXT:
Sally and Elena,

I sent you the revised version of the poverty memo for which the "cover
memo" has been substantially re-written/re-organized.  Please (please)
feel free to make substantial changes if it will make the memo more
effective. We're now holding the pen and given that this issue is quite
important, I think that the memo should be as good as possible.

I look forward to receiving your comments.

-- Ceci
