                                  FROM:            Bruce Reed


      I.    PURPOSE

            To announce a $200 million initiative in your FY 2000 budget that will require states and
            school districts to take corrective actions to improve low performing schools, and give
            them the resources to get the job done.

      II.   BACKGROUND

            You will be addressing an audience of approximately 200 parents, teachers, students,
            community leaders and educators from the JacksonlMann Elementary School and Boston,
            MA community. The JacksonlMann Elementary School serves students from K-5, and is
            attached to the Horace Mann School for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing, the oldest public
            day school for the deaf in the United States, and to the an Early Learning Center serving
            children from age 3 through grade 1. The school has a very diverse student and teacher
            population, and in general the student socioeconomic level is low.

            Boston has been implementing a school accountability policy that holds schools
            accountable for improvement and requires each school to implement an improvement
            plan. Next year, Boston will begin taking corrective action in low performing schools in
            a fashion consistent with the policy you are announcing today. The JacksonlMann
            Elementary School was identified by Superintendent Tom Payzant as a typical Boston
            school that is beginning to make atypical gains. The school has shown improvement in
            their Stanford-9 test scores over the last four years, and has implemented a
            comprehensive school plan focusing on literacy. The literacy program includes intensive
            help from trained reading teachers, an after-school program for 4th and 5th grade students
            assisted by America Reads tutors; and individual tutoring for 1st graders by volunteers
            involved in the Boston Partners in Education program. Later this month, JacksonlMann
            will launch a second after school program, in conjunction with the Bell Foundation at
                       Hex-Dump Conversion

Harvard University, that will serve all grade levels. All teachers at the school are
certified, with 75% of teachers having more than 5 years of experience teaching.

In your State of the Union Address, you called on all states and school districts to identify
and tum around their worst-performing schools -- or shut them down. Today you will
announce your $200 million initiative in your FY 2000 budget that will require states and
school districts to take corrective actions to improve low performing schools, and give
them the resources to get the job done.

$200 Million to Turn Around Low Performing Schools. Your FY 2000 budget
includes a $200 million in new funds for the Title 1 program, to be set aside for
intervening in low performing schools. Your proposal will require states and school
districts to identify the schools with the lowest achievement levels and the least
improvement, and take corrective action to tum them around. These corrective actions,
based on a careful assessment of each school's needs, would include steps such as
intensive teacher training, support to improve school discipline, and the implementation
of proven approaches to school reform. If these actions do not result in improved student
achievement within two years, your proposal would require states and school districts to
take additional corrective actions, such as permitting students to attend other public
schools; reconstituting the school, by fairly evaluating the staff and making staff changes
as appropriate; or closing the school and reopening it as a charter school or with an
entirely new staff. The funds provided in your budget will be used to support these
interventions.

An approach that works. Experience demonstrates that when these interventions are
carefully implemented, are accompanied by the resources to support change, and are part
of a broader state and district strategy to raise academic standards, upgrade curriculum,
strengthen teaching, keep school safe and disciplined and implement proven practices,
schools improve and student achievement increases. For example, in the Fall of 1995
Florida identified 45 critically low performing schools in Dade County. The Miami-Dade
School District responded with Operation Safety Net which requires schools to
implement a school wide reading program, and provides them staff assistance, improved
technology and other resources. These schools are given 3 years in which to make
adequate progress or be subject to further action. After 3 years, Dade County removed
each of the 45 schools from the state's list oflow-performing schools. New York City
has created the Chancellor's district, to provide low-performing schools with special
intervention to redesign the school, set instructional priorities, identify staff training needs
and take other steps improve student performance. In 1966, the Chancellor's District
identified and took over 10 of the city's lowest performing schools, and by 1998 half had
made enough improvement to be removed from the Chancellor's direct control. In one
successful school, P .S.154 in Harlem, staff redesigned the school, chose a concentrated
reading program, organized an education plan around it, and trained all teachers to
implement the plan. In the first year, the number of third-grader students meeting state
standards increased 20 percent, and student reading scores on a statewide assessment
have improved significantly. In 1992, Houston identified 68 low performing schools,
                                 Hex-Dump Conversion

       and as a result of the school district's intervention all of those schools have increased
       achievement and are no longer considered low performing.

       Making Common Sense Common Practice -- Now. Holding every school accountable
       for results, providing extra help to schools that need it, and closing down those that don't
       improve, is a common sense approach to strengthening public education. Your proposal
       will dramatically speed up the pace at which states and school districts begin to turn
       around low performing schools. In March 1996, you challenged every state and school
       district to take responsibility for intervening in low performing schools. According to a
       recent Education Week study, nineteen states currently have policies and strategies in
       place to help improve low-performing schools. More than half of these schools are in
       urban areas, and a growing number of urban school systems, including New York City,
       San Francisco, Dade County, Philadelphia and Chicago are taking similar steps,
       including the implementation of comprehensive school improvement plans, after-school
       academic help to students, and intensive teacher training. The Boston Public Schools
       have begun to implement an accountability plan that requires every school to implement a
       school improvement plan, and that targets help and intervention to the lowest performing
       schools. Under current Title 1 requirements, states and school districts participating in
       Title 1 must begin to take corrective actions for low performing schools by school year
       2003-2004. Your proposal will accelerate these efforts, and will ensuring that every state
       and every school district with the lowest performing schools will start immediately to turn
       those schools around.
