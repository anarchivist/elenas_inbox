            OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE SYPHILIS STUDY AT TUSKEGEE
                             May 16, 1997 --- DRAFT ---

Today, President Clinton recognized the injustice done to the participants of the Public Health
Service syphilis study in Tuskegee, Alabama. The President fonnally apologized to survivors,
their families and the nation for the unethical study that left as many as 400 African American men
untreated for syphilis. The Public Health Service (PHS) began the experiment in 1932 and did not
end it until 1972 -- many years after penicillin was available to treat the disease.

Today, President Clinton also signed an executive order extending the charter of the National
Bioethics Advisory Commission (NBAC) to October, 1999 to ensure a continued, national focus
on bioethical issues. Building on the work of the President's Advisory Committee on Human
Radiation Experiments, an NBAC subcommittee will make recommendations this fall for further
strengthening protections for human research subjects.

President Clinton also announced 4 additional steps the Department of Health and Human
Services (HHS) will take to ensure we learn from the PHS syphilis study, rebuild trust, and
protect human subjects in the future.

o      Building a lasting memorial. The President announced that HHS will award a planning
       grant to Tuskegee University to pursue establishing a Center for Bioethics in Research and
       Health Care at the University. The· Center would be a lasting memorial and would support
       efforts to address the legacy of the syphilis experiments and strengthen bioethics training.

o      Increasing Community Involvement and Restoring Trust. The legacy of the PHS study
       still impedes efforts to conduct promising research, particularly involving minorities, and to
       provide the best health care services to all Americans. Today,.the President directed the
       Secretary ofHHS to issue a report, within 120 days, detailing effective strategies to more fully
       involve communities, especially minority communities, in research and health care.

o      Strengthening Researchers' Training in Bioethics. The President directed the Secretary of
       HHS to develop bioethics training materials to help researchers effectively apply cthical
       principles in diverse populations. In partnership with private organizations I, within one
       year, HHS will complete and disseminate course materials that build on core ethical principles
       of respect for persons, beneficence, justice, and infonned consent, and that help ensure
       researchers successfully apply these principles in all communities.

o      Providing Post-Graduate Fellowships to Train Bioethicists, Especially Minorities. To
       increase and broaden our understanding of ethical issues in clinical research, HHS will offer
       fellowships, beginning in September 1998, to promising students enrolled in bioethics
       graduate programs. HHS will make special efforts to recruit minorities currently
       underrepresented in the field.


       Ipartners will include the Association of American Medical Colleges, the Association of
American Universities, the Association of Schools of Public Health, the National Association for
Equal Opportunity in Higher Education, and the Association of Minority Health Professions Schools.
