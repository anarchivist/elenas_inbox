 The Honorable
 United States Senate
 Washington D.C. 20510

 Dear Senator

 The undersigned organizations applaud the determination by the Department
 of Health and Human Services that current law permits the use of federal
 funds to support research utilizing human pluripotent stem cells.

 Human pluripotent stem cells have the ability to reproduce themselves
 indefinitely and to give rise to other more specialized types of cells,
 such
 as muscle, skin, nerve, pancreas or blood cells.  This ability to produce
 specialized cells opens a tremendous avenue of research with enormous
 potential for the treatment of many diseases.  For example, human stem
 cells
 could be used to produce different kinds of specialized cells and tissues
 for use in transplantation to treat many diseases and conditions, including
 neurological disorders such as Parkinson*s and Alzheimer*s diseases,
 heart disease and stroke, diabetes, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis,
 and spinal cord injury.
 Stem cell research also offers great promise for use in drug development
 and testing, to evaluate and understand both the beneficial and toxic
 effects of drugs on different human cell types, thus potentially reducing
 the need for animal studies and enabling fewer and more sharply focused
 human clinical trials. Research on human stem cells will open exciting new
 pathways by which to strengthen our understanding of normal human cell and
 tissue development. This, in turn, will accelerate our insights into the
 mechanisms of abnormal growth and development, and could lead to the
 discovery of radically new approaches to the prevention and treatment of
 birth defects and cancer.

 It is essential that the Federal government play a primary role in funding
 and overseeing the conduct of this research so that the talent and
 creativity of all our scientists -- both privately and federally funded --
 can be applied to this important line of research.   Federal involvement
 creates a more open research environment, promoting the free exchange of
 ideas and data among scientists, and ensuring greater public engagement and
 the protections of federal regulatory oversight.   Federal support will also
 increase fiscal resources and expand the pool of well-trained investigators
 engaged in this area of research, both of which will speed the pace of
 scientific discovery.

 We concur with the National Institutes of Health*s plans to move forward
 to develop clear guidelines to address the special scientific, legal, and
 ethical issues surrounding this research.  We are confidant that this
 process will have appropriate public input, as well as the advice of the
 National Bioethics Advisory Commission and NIH*s newly established Council
 of Public Representatives. NIH has made clear that it will not support any
 research using human pluripotent stem cells until the appropriate guide


 lines
 have been developed and disseminated and an oversight.process is in place.

 Given the tremendous promise this research holds for millions of Americans,
 indeed all humankind, we strongly urge you to work with the NIH to ensure
 that this research can move forward with the support and oversight of the
 Federal government.
