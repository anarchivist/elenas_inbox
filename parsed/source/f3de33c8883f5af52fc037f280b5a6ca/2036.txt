TEXT:
After your meeting Friday before last, Mary Beth Donahue (Deputy COS)
decided this had to be run out of the Secretary's office, ordered Jerrry
NOT to talk to rest of HHS about it, and assigned the issue to a staff
person at HHS "exec sec." Mary Beth promised a memo by tomorrow (thought
that Corr had let you know last week they couldn't meet original
deadline) .

I am doing what I can w/out HHS.  Jerry is following up with a police
organization Dennis Burke put us in touch with, and I am trading phone
calls with NHTSA.  I'll have time to move the ball forward this week.
