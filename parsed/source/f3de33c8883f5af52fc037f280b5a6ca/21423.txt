TEXT:
The letter calleds for 20% of the federal portion of the settlement funds
to be spent on tobacco control efforts and says "over 50%" of the
settlement funds belong to the feds.  Thus I read this as: 20% of 50%
going to tobacco control, or 10 percent of the total.

Thus ENACT is pushing for:

           50 percent unrestricted
           40 percent menu
           10 percent tobacco control

Tom Mahr's cover sheet indicate he wants:

           50 percent unrestricted
           25 percent menu
           25 percent tobacco control

The legislative language leaves blank the percentage to be devoted to
tobacco control
efforts but dictates that of the amount devoted to tobacco control:

                  bet. 25-30 shall be spent on cessation
                  bet. 25-30 shall be spent on counteradvertising
                  bet. 25-30 percent shall be spent on smoking prevention
                  the remainder shall be spent to enforce youth access
restrictions
