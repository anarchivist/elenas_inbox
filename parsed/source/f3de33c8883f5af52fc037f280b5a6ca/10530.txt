 TEXT:
 FYI

 I'll get Paul information on the Thursday announcement as soon as we nail
 it down.  Is there anything we should do to let Tom Toch at US News know
 we are working on something bigger for SOTU, without providing details?

  Also, I just received an embargoed copy of Quality Counts -- an annual
  report from Education Week -- which will be released Thursday morning.    It
 .generally gets pretty decent coverage.    The focus of this report is
  "Rewarding Results, Punishing Failure" The lead in the press release is
  that "Most states have yet to back up tough talk on holp.ing schools
  accountable for results ... only a nandful of states have in place a full
  range of policies to reward success and punish failure in education."

 There is a section on ending social promotion, which highlights the effort
 in DC this year, and which makes the point that parents and teachers
 strongly support ending social promotion, especially when coupled with
 extra support.  They even have survey data from high school students
 showing that about 2/3 of those in schools with high school exit exams
 said the tests made them work harder. More than half of those in schools
 without exit exams say that they would work harder if they had to pass a
 test in order to graduate.

 I'll pull a summary of this together for the POTUS briefing and
 speechwriting.

 Mike,

         U.S. News is closing a cover package this week (on the newstands
 next monday) on America's best high schools.  It will include profiles of
 poor urban schools that have effectively ended social promotion through
 the use of very high academic standards and tough exit exams. My friend


    Tom Tach is editing the package and writing the introductory essay; the
    earlier in the week we get him paper on our new ed initiatives, the more
    prominently our initiatives will play in that essay and in the package
    generally.  We could hardly ask for a better vehicle for our education
    initiative, presuming we're still on for this week, so let me know how I
    can help getting material to Tom asap.  Thanks
