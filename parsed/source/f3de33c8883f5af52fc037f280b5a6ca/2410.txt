TEXT:
Below, and attached, are text of memo I gave, at request of VP's staff, to

Maria yesterday concerning a proposed education insert for the VP's NAACP

address on THursday. THe problem is that the speeech is a rather

content-free, and this is a proposed solution, complementing the usual

laundry list of accomplishments and such. It suggests four "principles" in

an effort to me modestly visionary.



1. Standards/excellence,VNT (yes, I choked)



2. Opportunity to learn - but note how mild, watered down, non-federal and

bully-pulitish



3. Cut attainment gap in half -- modeled after the health disparities

initiative, but state-focused and hortatory



4. Integration, based on POTUS sentiments on the subject, voiced most

recently at the PBS roundtable.




The question is whether it is possible to clear something along these lines

for the Vice President to use, even though we haven't consulted governors


and the Organization of American States.



I sent this to Mike Cohen yesterday because Maria was going to call him,

but you ought to have it because now she says she may call you, sometime

this morning.



Eli Attie is working on the speech.



Ciao.



ps: Thanks for your counsel yesterday.

Re:       Vice President's Gore's NAACP Speech - Clearance of Education

Issues




Attached is a series paragraphs containing some education ideas I would


like the Vice President to consider for his NAACP speech on Thursday. I

know time is short. The question is, can something like this get clearance?

The VP's office is interested, but we have not shared it with the Vice

President yet. Everyone's concern is that the policy process just moves too

slowly to get this done. Is that true?



I apologize for my tardiness. I should have proposed this weeks ago. I was

wasting my time on other matters.

[insert follows.     .J




I believe we can do better.   I believe we can hold ourselves to a higher

standard.   I believe that if we give them the opportunity, every child in

America can learn.   And I believe it's time to stop pointing fingers and

start joining hands to fix our schools -- because we don't have a child to

waste.



      Today, I want to suggest four clear principles to guide us, four core

values to guide us as we move forward in the struggle: excellence,

opportunity, achievement, and integration.



      First, we will not get excellence from our children until we demand it

- demand it from students, parents, teachers and administrators. - from


everyone.   That is why President Clinton has called for voluntary national

tests in the basics: 4th grade reading, and 8th grade math.   excellence

from all requires accountability for all. When it. comes to education, the

era of excuses must be over.



     Second, I believe that every state and school district should define a

basic level of opportunity for our children -- including the right

resources and the right climate for learning -- and then measure whether

classrooms and schools are meeting that goal.   if kids don't get a chance

to take algebra, or learn English; should we be surprised by low sat scores

or high drop out rates?   every child deserves a basic opportunity to learn,

.and the NAACP can playa role in holding local schools and officials

accountable.



     Third, I believe that every state and school district should set a

goal of cutting in half the achievement gap between the richest and the

poorest students, and among different racial and ethnic groups, over the

next decade.        And fourth, at time when America is becoming more

diverse, too many of our schools are becoming less diverse.   I believe we

must reverse this trend, and recommit ourselves to integration and

diversity in our schools using voluntary tools such as public schoO'I

choice, charter schools and magnet schools. the best education is one which

prepares students for the diversity in America. we must break down the

walls between us, to understand our neighbors, and since everyone can't be

in the army, our best hope for doing that is through the experiences we

give our children in school.



     These four principles are not some distant dream -- they are the

foundation for the education battles we are fighting right now -- battles

we must wage for our children's future.




     Let's start by passing President Clinton's plan to hire 100,000 highly

trained teachers to reduce class size in the early grades from an average

of 22 to 18.



     Then let's hire another 35,000 teachers in our poorest schools, and

improv,e the quality of their teaching.



     Let's pass Senator Carol Moseley-Braun's $22 billion plan to rebuild

and modernize our schools -- because we can't lift our children up in

schools that are -falling down.



     Let's pass Congressman Chaka Fattah's High Hopes program -- to tell

children as early as elementary school: if you work hard and stay in

school, we'll give you mentoring, we'll give you tutoring, and we will

guarantee you the help you need to pay for college.



    And in this new economy and Information Age, let us close the digital

divide that throws up new barriers to opportunity, and to the high-paying

jobs of the future.



     Think about it: if we put computers and the Internet in every

classroom and school library in America, along with trained teachers, we'll

never again have to worry that schools lack the latest textbooks, or good

library collections.   Every child in every community -- from the most

remote rural district to the poorest inner city school -- will have access

to the same vast universe of information.



     And now we need the E-Rate -- so Internet connections will be greatly

discounted for 30,000 schools, and almost free for the poorest schools.
