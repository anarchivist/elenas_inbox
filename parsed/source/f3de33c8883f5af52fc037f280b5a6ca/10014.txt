TEXT:
Do any of you know who from the WH worked on the issue/process surrounding
the Gambling Impact Study Commission from a policy perspective? I know
that Bill Marshall covered the issue for the Counsel's office, and now
it's mine.  The information in Bill's files is scant, but your names
appeared on some of the documents. A legal question has been raised by
the Commission that could use some policy guidance. Can any of you point
me in the right direction? We need to respond as soon as possible.

Thanks.
