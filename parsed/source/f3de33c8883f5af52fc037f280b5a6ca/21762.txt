46 states agreed to the proposed tobacco settlement by today's noon deadline. Several
states apparently waivered until the end, under pressure from some health advocates.
Drs. Koop and Kessler have come out strongly against the settlement, saying the public
health would be better served if the states took their cases to trial. Other groups are being
more pragmatic -- the American Cancer Society, for example, is now focusing its attention
on working with each state to make the best use of these funds (the deal sets aside $1.45
billion for counteradvertising and public education and $250 million for a research
foundation, but states will chose how to spend most of the remaining funds).

       Crime -- Final 1997 FBI Crime Statistics: On Sunday, the FBI will release the final
1997 Uniform Crime Report (UCR), which will show crime down for the sixth year in a row.
Overall crime fell 2 percent from the 1996 level, and is 7 percent lower than in 1993 -- with all
regions of the country reporting declines in crime rates from 1996 levels.

   (1) Violent Crime: Violent crime fell 3 percent, with all categories of violent crime
   declining in volume and rate between 1996 and 1997. Murder: The murder rate in 1997 hit
   the lowest point in 30 years. Between 1996 and 1997, the number of murders fell by an
   additional 7 percent -- 26 percent fewer murders than in 1993. About 77 percent of murder
   victims, and 90 percent of murder offenders were male. Whites were 48 percent of murder
   victims and 45 percent of murder offenders. Blacks were 49 percent of murder victims and
   53 percent of murder offenders. Nearly half (48 percent) of murder victims knew their
   assailants; among female murder victims, 29 percent were killed by husbands or boyfriends.
   Rape: There were over 96,000 forcible rapes reported in 1997, with a decline in rate of one
   percent from 1996. Robbery: declined 7 percent as compared to 1996 levels. Street or
   highway robberies accounted for half of the nearly 500,000 robberies nationwide. Forty
   percent of all robberies were committed using firearms. Aggravated assaults: declined by 1
   percent from the 1996 total.

   (2) Property Crime. Property crime fell 2 percent between 1996 and 1997, with all
   categories of property crime decreasing in both volume and rate. Burglaries and
   larceny-theft declined by 2 percent each, motor vehicle theft declined by 3 percent, and arson
   offenses declined 7 percent.

   (3) Hate Crime. In 1997, a total of9,861 hate crimes were reported -- 5,898 were
   motivated by racial bias; 1,483 by religious bias; 1,375 by sexual-orientation bias; 1,083 by
   ethnic bias; 12 by disability bias; and 10 were multiple bias offenses. Crimes against
   persons were 70 percent of the total number of hate crimes reported. Among crimes against
   persons, 55 percent were intimidation, simple and aggravated assault were 26 percent and 18
   percent, respectively, and murder and rape were less than 1 percent each.

   (4) Juveniles. Juvenile arrests for violent crime declined for the third year in a row,
   dropping an 4 percent in 1997. In addition, arrests for juvenile murders dropped 16 percent
   between 1996 and 1997.
