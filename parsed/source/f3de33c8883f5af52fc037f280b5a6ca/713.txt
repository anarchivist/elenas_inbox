TEXT:
I ran into Bruce and he gave me some help/advice on this.  He said to just
use the estimate implicit in the law (50% in work participation rates when
fully phased in), to get a number of roughly 2 million people (given there
are 4 million heads of households now on welfare) .

Subject: Statistic for state of the union

communications is asking me for a welfare number for the state of the
union that I thought you should know about (if you don't already).  They
asked for the number of welfare recipients who are able-bodied, with no
children under 1. They said the underlying goal is to get a measure of
who is able to work, because they aren't disabled or don't have very small
kids at home. Olivia says she doubts that exact number is available, but
was checking.  She also had concerns about what the context would be.   Let
me know if you have any insight/concerns.
