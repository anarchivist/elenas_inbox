TEXT:
Kathleen Begala from CPSC says they have a ready to be released study of
Hazards in Child Care Settings.  CPSC studied 220 child care settings
across the country and found 66% of settings exhibited at least one safety
hazard (e.g., 8% had cribs that did not meet safety standards, 19% had
cribs with soft bedding that might present a suffocation hazard).  The
study looked at hazards in child care at GSA, non-profit, in-home, and
for-profit run facilities.  GSA did not do particularly well (42% had soft
bedding present). Kathleen has told Milanne about it. CPSC have some
guidelines they want to release. I don't know the issue but wonder whether
it makes sense to combine the study release with an executive order to GSA
run facilities (maybe we have already) or whether the President and first
lady would like to use the study as a way to push his legislation (radio
address) .
