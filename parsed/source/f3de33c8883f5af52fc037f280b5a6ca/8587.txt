                                              July _,1998



     The Honorable - - - - - -
     United States House of Representatives
     Washington, D.C.

     Dear Congressman _ _ _ _ __

             I am writing to state the Administration's vigorous opposition to the amendment offered
     by Congressman Hefley to H.R. 4104, the Treasury and General Government Appropriations bill
     for 1999. The Amendment would effectively legitimize discrimination by the United States
     government against its own citizens based solely on their sexual orientation. This
     Administration will not accept such unfairness. If this Amendment is adopted, the President's
     senior advisers will recommend that he veto the bill.

           The amendment seeks to prevent the Administration from spending any funds to
     implement, administer or enforce Executive Order 13087, which the President issued on May 28,
     1998. That order amends Executive Order 11478, which bars discrimination by the federal
     government based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, handicap or age.   The
     amendment merely adds sexual orientation to the list of prohibited bases of discrimination.

              The arguments mustered against this Executive Order are unfounded. First, the Order
     confers no "special rights." It bars the Government from discriminating. The right to be free
     from governmental discrimination is not a special right. It is the inalienable right of every
     American. No one should be denied ajob based on attributes that have nothing to do with their
     ability.

             Second, many of the claims that have been made about what this Executive Order means
     are false and distorted. The Order is clear. Plainly and simply, it bars discrimination based on
     sexual orientation in the federal civilian workforce. It does not mandate affirmative action based
     on sexual orientation. It does not allow preferential treatment. It does not require that agencies
     find out which of their employees are gay, or how many gay employees they have hired. It does
     not cover federal contractors. And -- to address the most outlandish charges -- it does not
     authorize sexual misconduct in the workplace. Although supporters of the amendment have
     claimed that the phrase "sexual orientation" is not defined and could cover a wide range of
     conduct, the President intends the term to have the common meaning stated in the Employment
     Non-Discrimination Act of 1995, "homosexuality, bisexuality, or heterosexuality." With
     regard to all these issues, as this is the President's order, the President's intent as to what it
     means is conclusive. See Sea-Land Service, Inc. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, 738 F.2d
     1311, 1314 (D.C. Cir. 1984) ("The 'law' at issue in this instance is an Executive Order
     promulgated by the President, and it is to his intent that we must tum for guidance ... ").

            Third, this order does not reflect any new policy and creates no new law. The Civil

                                                                    Automated Records Management System
                                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion




          Service law, enacted in 1978, prohibits "discrimination for or against any employee or applicant
          for employment on the basis of conduct which does not adversely affect the performance of the
          employee or applicant or the performance of others." 5 U.S.C. 2302(b )(10). In 1980, the
          Office of Personnel Management interpreted this law to mean what it clearly said, "applicants
          and employees are to be protected against inquiries into, or actions based upon, non-job-related
          conduct, such as religious, community, or social affiliations, or sexual orientation." OPM
          reiterated this interpretation in 1994 and 1997. Most federal agencies and departments have
          issued regulations, policy directives, or memoranda from agency heads to implement this law.
          President Clinton's Executive Order does merely makes the policy uniform for the entire civilian
          federal workforce.

                  Fourth, the President unquestionably has the power to issue this Order. Presidents since
          George Washington have directed Executive Orders to their employees in the Executive Branch.
          In 1966, Congress specifically authorized the President to "prescribe regulations for the conduct
          of employees in the executive branch." 5 U.S.c. § 7301. Presidents have frequently exercised
          that authority over the federal workforce, issuing scores of Executive Orders. This particular
          Order by President Clinton amends Executive Order 11478, issued in 1969 by President Nixon,
          barring federal employees from discriminating based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin,
          handicap or age. The same authority that supported that Order supports this one. President
          Reagan issued Executive Order 12564, requiring a drug-free federal workplace, and Executive
          Order 12353, governing charitable fundraising by federal employees. President Bush issued
          Executive Order 12674, setting forth principles of ethical conduct for government employees. It
          would be nonsensical to contend that the President can regulate the ethical conduct of federal
          employees, that he can prescribe standards for fundraising and require drug testing, but cannot
          instruct federal employees to refrain from discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation.
          Indeed, in accordance with normal procedures, the Department of Justice specifically reviewed
          and approved this order before it was issued.

                 Finally, the amendment sends a disturbing message. Whatever the intentions of its
          supporters, the amendment conveys an unmistakable message that discrimination based on
          sexual orientation is acceptable. This Administration rejects that message. We oppose
          discrimination by the federal government, and we oppose this amendment.

                                                               Sincerely,




                                                                            Automated Records Management System
                                                                            Hex-Dump Conversion
