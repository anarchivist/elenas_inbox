TEXT:
Erskine just spoke with Henry Waxman.  Immediately after Erskine called
out to Carolyn and asked that we set up a meeting (sometime in the next
several days) with "Waxman, Bruce, Elena and John." Do you know the
substance? Do you have any recommendations / questions concerning this?
I'll also try to get more info from Erskine.  Kevin
