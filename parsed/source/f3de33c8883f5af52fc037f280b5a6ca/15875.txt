nation, in our everyday lives, the reality is very different. Opportunity is still a dream for too
many of our people. They don't feel that they have a stake in our society. Often, that breeds
alienation, resentment and worse.

        Racism would be less of a problem if everyone had a good job. Racism would be less of
a problem if everyone had a chance to get a good education. Racism would be less of a problem
if everyone had safe and decent housing and health care.

       Do not believe that one group can make gains only at the expense of another. That is
simply not true. Together, even with our limited resources, we can find the ways to address the
economic issues that keep some of our people down. We know where the barriers to
opportunity lie; we need to find the ways to dismantle them.

        The economy has created many jobs. But disparities remain. In some states,
unemployment is so low there is a labor shortage; while in some of our cities, unemployment is
quite high and so are the social ills that accompany poverty. That is no coincidence. We are
working hard to encourage employers to locate in the cities, but businesses need to make a
commitment to the cities, too. We cannot leave our cities behind.

         And we must do more to protect the jobs of people being discriminated against. When I
took office, we faced a huge backlog of cases filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission. We have taken care of many of the cases, but many more remain. And there is
very little we can do about it -- not because these cases are not valid. But because the Congress
will not give us the resources to enforce the law. Ifwe believe in opportunity for all Americans,
then we need to protect that opportunity. I urge the Congress to make funding for the EEOC a
priority.

        But our most important concern in making sure everyone has opportunity must be
education. We have begun doing that by making college loans more available and more
affordable and by expanding our Pell Grants. We have put in place programs that aim to ensure
that every child, no matter what race or ethnic background, will be able to read by the age of 8,
sign on to the Internet by age 12 and continue his or her education at age 18 -- and we need to
concentrate more efforts in schools in our cities and hard-pressed rural areas. But we can't stop
there.

        We must protect access to higher education for people of all color. I ask you: What does
it mean for this state and for Texas that some of the brightest students won't even apply to law
schools there? It means a "brain drain." That's the disease that erodes future prosperity and it's
caused by Proposition 209 and the Hopwood case. It's also called ''resegregation.'' And if you
believe that we can build the kind of society we need in the 21 st century by closing the door on
whole segments of our people, then you don't remember the lessons of the South. I saw school
segregation, and it took years to begin to tum back the damage it did socially and economically.
It wasn't until segregation ended that the economy in the South began to swing upward.

                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion
better chance of getting a job with a growing income. For every person who gets that education,
that means stability. That means another contributing member of a community. That means
another stakeholder in America. Ifwe can get more young African Americans and Hispanics
and other low-income Americans to graduate from high school and get into college, we will go a
long way toward tearing down disparities in wealth and opportunity. That IS why we cannot
abandon any efforts to expand access to higher education -- and that includes affirmative action.

        Let's be honest: Test scores are but one factor is admissions. Here are some others:
athletic ability -- no one complains when a top quarterback or basketball center is given extra
consideration for admission to many schools. Or the children of alumni. Or music prodigies.
Well, a diversified student body has value, too.

       I want to be clear: We will continue to fight the rollback of affirmative action in higher
education because it is wrong, it is hurtful to our progress and it divides our people. 209 is a
wrong number.                                .

        And while we look at the barriers to opportunity, we need to examine our criminal justice
system and ask some hard questions: To what degree does it treat whites and minorities
differently? Our police officers are the protectors of order in our society, and I am proud that we
have put [HOW MANY THOUSAND?] of new officers on the beat. They put their lives on the
line every day to keep our people safe. But we have seen that authority can be abused and brutal
force used on some of our citizens. So, as we call for our citizens to respect the law, we need
the law to respect our citizens, no matter their color or economic condition.
