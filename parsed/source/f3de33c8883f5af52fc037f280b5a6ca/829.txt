TEXT:
Did you get my draft no-fault memo? Aside from the fact that I need to add
something about what "support" means -- saying we think it's something states
should do, "authorizing" states to do it (a meaningless act since they can
already), incenting them to do it (e.g., through more highway safety funds), or
requiring them to adopt a choice plan -- do you have any suggestions before I go
final?
Ellen
