TEXT:
Just want to clarify that yesterday morning, when I spoke to the teacher
and invited her to speak, it was still unresolved as to whether the VP
would intro. the President or the teacher would.  So, I told her that she
would introduce either the VP or the President.  She was fine with that,
and in the remarks that she drafted and sent to me last night she did not
put anything in about introducing anyone. We are speaking at lOam this
morning to review her remarks.   I have no idea why people felt that she
was planning to introduce the President, and, in fact, I have no idea how
anyone saw her remarks other than Karen T. Regardless, I'm pleased that
she is able to introduce POTUS. This is something that I was pushing for.

As a side note, it's frusterating that the decision was made yesterday
afternoon that she would NOT introduce POTUS -- so I called Leg. Affairs
to make sure Daschle knew he would be introducing the teacher, and we went
back and forth several times to make sure they had all the right info.
Now I've just asked them to change that, but it is all such a waste of
time when this is a basic decision that was certainly clear to me from the
beginning.  I know the problem stems from the VP's staff, and Stacie's try
ing to work it out with them but I just figured you should know how it
does effect us too.
