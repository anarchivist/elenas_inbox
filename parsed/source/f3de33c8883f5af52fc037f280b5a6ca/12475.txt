Subject: I sent you the wrong Termination provision




This is the right one:

   "(2) PROGRAM IMPROVEMENT PLAN.--(A) The Secretary, before
making a continuation award for the fourth year of a program under this
section, shall determine if the program is making continuous and
substantial
progress in assisting children and youth with limited English proficiency
to


learn English and achieve to challenging State content and performance
standards.   The Secretary shall base the determination on--
  "(i) the indicators established under section 7123(d) and
the data and information collected under section 7123; and
 "(ii)   such other data and information as the Secretary may require.
   "(B) (i)  If the Secretary determines that a
recipient requesting a fourth-year continuation award under this section is
not making continuous and substantial progress under subparagraph (A), the
recipient shall promptly develop and submit to the Secretary a program
improvement plan for its program.
    "(ii) The Secretary shall approve a program
improvement plan under clause (i) only if he or she determines that it
holds
reasonable promise of enabling students with limited English proficiency
participating in the program to learn English and achieve to challenging
State content and performance standards.
    "(iii)   If the Secretary does not approve a

recipient's program improvement plan under clause   (i), the Secretary

shall take such other action as he or she determines to be appropriate,

such as the denial of a continuation award.";
