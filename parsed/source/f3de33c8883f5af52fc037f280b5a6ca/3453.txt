TEXT:
Yes, and I'll pull something together, though I'm still haggling with the
agencies about tomorrow's Brady meeting.  The key question here is: Do we
want to talk about the AG/ONDCP rec or not? Mark-up will still be going
on through Thursday, and we will need to give leg. affairs at least an
afternoon if we're going to publicly say anything.  Peter recommened
saying that we're considering new recs, consistent with the sentencing
commission's report, but want to work with Congress before we release.
Can we get away with this? More importantly, won't BC want to comment
affirmatively to this audience about the new recs?

Jose'
