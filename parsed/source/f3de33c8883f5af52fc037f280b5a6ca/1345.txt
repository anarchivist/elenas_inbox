TEXT:
The Monday Campaign Finance Reform Event will likely take place at the
same scheduled time with the Vice President - as long as the co-chairs and
other invitees agree.  There is a meeting at 10:30am in Waldman's office
to finalize this.

The Chief States Schools Event will take place in the Roosevelt Room with
the VP and Riley for 30 minutes sometime on Monday, but we won't have the
specific time for a few hours.

FYI:  I spoke to Elizabeth Drye and will forward you a scheduling proposal
today that asks for the President to sign the Executive Order on
classified research with appropriate Cabinet folks in the Oval -- (in case
there is a need for events where he sits and signs stuff.) The backup
scenario will just be to have a statement released and have Cabinet brief
before or after McCurry's briefing on Tuesday, March 25.
