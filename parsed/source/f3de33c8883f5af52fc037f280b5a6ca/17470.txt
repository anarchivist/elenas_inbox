TEXT:
At my request, OMB circulated the Lautenberg .08 amendment through its
clearance process.  (I also put it in the President's weekly report    and
he okayed it -- though you would not have seen that.)  So, contrary to
what DOT said, it was cleared by OMB rather than NEC.

I apologisze for not flagging it for you, Lynn, since you will get grief
from governors; I have been consumed by other issues, and not really
focusing on .08. Elena, I did talk with Jerry Mande abt . . 08 and viewed
hiim as the DPC's person on this issue; now I realize he may not really be
DPC.
