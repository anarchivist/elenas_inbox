Re:             Title IX/Equal Opportunities for Girls
                and Women In Sports

Because the President will be making remarks tomorrow regarding
title IX, I have prepared the following memo. The memo includes
brief background information on title IX and four points of
controversy surrounding title IX that could be raised during Q&A.
Background
Title IX prohibits sexual discrimination at educational
institutions that receive federal funds. It is part of the
Education Amendments of 1972 that President Nixon signed into
law.
Title IX is used to provide equal opportunities for girls and
women in school athletic programs. Most private colleges are
subject to Title IX guidelines just as public colleges and
universities are because both receive federal funds through
financial aid programs such as Pell Grants.
Title IX has paved the way for female athletes and sparked a new
level of excellence in women's sports. In this year's Olympics, a
record
o
-setting total of about 3,700 women competed from here and
abroad.
Data show that girls who play sports in school have a reduced
risk of becoming pregnant or dropping out of school, have higher
levels of self
I~'
      "


          o
          -esteem, and reduced risks for osteoporosis and
          breast cancer.
          Controversy Surrounding Title IX
          1) Since the Spring of 1992, several substantial law suits
          charging noncompliance with title IX have been brought against
          universities, the most notable of which is against Brown
          University.  Brown decided to reduce its financial support for
          the women's volleyball and gymnastics teams-
          o
          -instead asking them
          to raise some 'of their own funds. The Department of Justice filed
          an amicus brief in Cohen v. Brown University. The Court ruled
          against Brown. However Brown appealed and the suit continues.


          2) More recently, members of the U.S. Congress argued that title
          IX does not mean better opportunities for women athletes, but
          rather destruction of men's athletic programs.  In 1995, Rep.
          Dennis Hastert (R
          o
          -IL) organized House members to sign and send a
          letter to the Department of Education calling for "common sense"
          revisions to title IX such as to omitting men's football from
          title IX regulations. The Department of Education agreed to
          review title IX regulations. Currently, the Office of civil
          Rights of the Department of Education is working on guidelines
          outlining what actions are appropriate to prevent sexual
          harassment and discrimination in schools. The guidelines will be
          issued sometime over the next two months.
          3) A recent Texas court case determined that educational
          institutions with knowledge of sexual harassment between students
          that do not take corrective action are not violating title IX.
          This decision has been very controversial and may advance to the
          Supreme Court. The Supreme Court is deciding this week whether or
          not it will hear the case.
          4) For an institution to be Title IX compliant, it must show its
          female student
          o
          -athlete ratio to be proportionate to its female
          student population. The NCAA conducted its own gender equity
          probe in 1991 and found that over 80 percent of the dollars were
          going to men's programs and that 75 percent of the athletes were
          men.
