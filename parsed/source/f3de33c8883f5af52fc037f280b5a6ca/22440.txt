 TEXT:
 Next Friday, at 8:30 a.m., the mayors will be coming to the White House
 from their conference.  There will be about 200 mayors here.   As last
 year, there will be stand-up continental breakfast and then a seated
 meeting with POTUS. Unfortunately, we don't have seating in the meeting
 (except for COS and Dep. COS and maybe a few more). However, we would like
 to come and mingle with the mayors, talk up the budget and generally get
 some business done. They would love to see you.   They will only be at
 breakfast until 9:00, so please try to come on time.
 OPL and Political, could you share this with your people?    Thanks.   (If I
 forgot someone, please let me know) .
