TEXT:
The House Rules Committee also plans to take up H.R. 4579 - Taxpayer
Relief Act of 1998 tomorrow with House floor action possible Friday,
9/25.  position: POTUS will Veto.  Please review and provide
changes/clearance to me by 11am tomorrow.  Many thanks.

DRAFT --- NOT FOR RELEASE
September xx, 1998
(House)
H.R. 4579 - Taxpayer Relief Act of 1998
(Archer (R) Texas)

The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 4579.   If the bill were presented
to the President, he would veto it.

H.R. 4579 would cut taxes by $85 billion over five years and $176 billion
over 10 years. Virtually none of the bi1l0,s costs have been paid for.
This blatantly violates the pay-as-you-go fiscal discipline of the Budget
Enforcement Act -- discipline which has been an essential component of our
remarkable economic revival. The President will veto any tax cut or
spending bill that undermines fiscal discipline by changing the budget
rules.

In addition, by draining billions out of projected budget surpluses, this
bill violates the PresidentO,s unwavering commitment to save Social
security first.  None of the projected surpluses should be touched until
the long-term solvency of Social Security has been fully secured. We must.
not squander this unique opportunity to save social Security.

Last February in the FY 1999 Budget, the President proposed tax cuts
targeted to help American families -- and proposed offsets to fully pay
for the tax cuts.  The Administration urges the Congress to consider tax
cuts only if we can do so in a manner that adheres to the budget rules,
maintains fiscal discipline, and meets the President's commitment to
reserve the entire surplus until we have strengthened social Security.

Pay-As-You-Go-Scoring

H.R. 4579 would affect revenues; therefore it is subject to the
pay-as-you-go requirement of the Budget Enforcement Act. Under the Budget
Enforcement Act, OMB would be required by law to impose automatic spending
cuts on Medicare and other non-exempt mandatory spending programs in
amounts sufficient to offset the revenue losses projected for FY 1999.    In
the absence of offsetting legislation, these automatic budget cuts would
be triggered again in each of the following four years.   These automatic
cuts would affect:   the special milk program, vocational rehabilitation,
Stafford loans, foster care and adoption assistance, Medicare (up to four
percent), and could also affect CCC, Child Support Enforcement, Social
Services Block Grants, Immigration Support, Crop Insurance, Veterans


Education and Readjustment Benefits, and others.  [Note: the last sentence
in this paragraph may need to be revised or deleted following Rules
committee action.]

(Do Not Distribute Outside Executive Office of the President)

This Statement of Administration Policy was developed by the Legislative
Reference Division (Jones), in consultation with the Departments of the
Treasury (Dorsey), Justice (Jones), the Social Security Administration
(Chesser), the Council of Economic Advisers (Elmendorf), OMB Economic
Policy .(Minarik), and BASD (Lind, Barth).

The National Economic Council, the Office of White House Counsel, White
House Legislative Affairs, OMB GC, HTFD, and OIRA did not respond to our
request for comments on the draft SAP.

OMB/LA Clearance:

The House Committee on Ways and Means ordered H.R. 4579 reported by a vote
of 23-15, on Sept. 17, 1998.

Administration Position to Date

The President, in a speech to the International Brotherhood of Electrical
workers on September 17th, stated that he would veto any bill "that
squanders the surplus on tax cuts before we save social security."

Summary of H.R. 4579

The principal provisions of H.R. 4579, as reported, are described below.

        Tax Provisions

 Reduce the so-called O&marriage penalty08 by increasing the standard
deduction couples can claim from approximately $7,200 to $8,600 (effective
for tax years beginning after December 31, 1998);

and gift tax exclusion effective after December 31, 1998. Currently, that
exclusion is to increase gradually to $1 million in 2006;

Eliminate Federal income taxes on the first $400 of interest income for
couples and $200 for singles (effective for tax years beginning after
December 31, 1998);

Allow certain nonrefundable personal tax credits (e.g., child credits,
HOPE and lifetime learning credits) to offset an individual taxpaye~I,s
minimum tax liability as well as their regular tax liability.  (Current
law permits these credits to be applied only against the regular tax
liabili ty) ;

Make health insurance costs for self-employed individuals fully
deductible,  retroactive to January I, 1998. Current law would make these
costs fully deductible for tax years beginning January I, 2007;

Increase the maximum amount of annual investment in qualified property by
a small business to $25,000 for taxable years beginning after December 31,
1998. Current law phases in an increase from the current maximum of
$18,500 to $25,000 over five years;

Designate 20 D&renewal communitiesD8 and make businesses in these areas
eligible for various forms of tax relief;

Permit private higher education institutions to establish tax-free prepaid
tuition programs (Currently, only public institutions may establish such
programs) ;

        Trade and Tariff Provisions

Extend the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) , which expired on June
30, 1998,to February 29, 2000;

        Revenue Offsets

 Include in the income of certain shareholders dividends distributed to
liquidate a real estate invest trust or regulated investment company.

        Social Security Provisions

Increase to $37,941 in 2008 the amount a social security recipient between
the age of full retirement (currently 65) and 70 years old can earn before
their benefit amount is reduced.  Currently, that amount is $14,500.

Delay the recomputation of benefits for social security recipients who
continue to work after normal retirement age until January 1st of the
second year following the year of the earnings.

Pay-As-You-Go Scoring

According to BASD (Barth) and the Treasury, H.R. 4579 would affect
receipts; and therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you go rules of the
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1990. H.R. 4579 would result
in net budget costs of $10.6 billion in FY 1999 and $85.5 billion over FYS
1999-2003. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that the bill will
reduce revenues by $6.6 billion in FY 1999 and $80.1 billion over FYs
1999-2003.
