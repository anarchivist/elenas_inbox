TEXT:
HHS today held a meeting with domestic violence advocates·regarding the
regulation and they said it was generally well received, although the
advocates of course want to review the details. Our friend Pat Reuse of
the NOW Legal Defense Fund was there and apparently saw some merit to our
structure.  By contrast, Senator Murray's staff was still somewhat
difficult at Monday's briefing of Hill staff, although HHS thinks that won
us points with Senate Republicans.   Per our earlier emails, I will put
last week's weekly report summary on the "hot issues" sheet for the
President's trip to Washington this weekend.

On a related matter, Bonnie Campbell of DOJ's Violence Against Women
office is speaking at SUNY Stonybrook on Friday, and I've faxed her our
summaries so she can be on message.
