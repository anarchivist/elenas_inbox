 Esteemed Colleagues:

 Elena and I just spoke to Rahm who thought that, if we're going to do
 Andrew's $400 million peice, we should pull the crime stuff and save it
 for another day.  His thinking is it's very unlikely that we'll get both
 covered, and that all the urban stuff combined drowns out the crime pieces
 -- especially wino crime folks on the program.  Thus, we suggest you pull
 the crime piece and go ahead and focus on the urban initiatives in the
 budget -- and announce Andrew's new Community Empowerment Fund.  I think
 HUD will have to get us some paper on this ...
