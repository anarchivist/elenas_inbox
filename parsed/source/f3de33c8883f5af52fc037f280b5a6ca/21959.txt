Shirley Sagawa has scheduled a meeting with the Corporation for National
Serivce on Thursday, December 17th at noon and would like, if possible,

distribute that information once I have it.  In the meantime, if you could
accept or regret via email or phone (62106), it would be greatly
appreciated.
Thank you.
