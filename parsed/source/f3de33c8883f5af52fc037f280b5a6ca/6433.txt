Bruce/Elena:

FYI.  I have had a preliminary discussion with Tom Kalil about looking
into the idea of providing voice mail services to those seeking work
(either welfare recipients or a larger group of poor job-seekers without
phones). On Wed. and Thurs. of this week, there is a conference (unsure
who is the sponsor) on telecommunications access for the poor. According
to Tom, the VP will attend part of it. Once that is over, I will try to
follow up with them on ideas/strategies for this. Also, there is a group
in Seattle that is working on a project to provide voice mail to the
homeless who may be helpful in thinking about this.

Julie
