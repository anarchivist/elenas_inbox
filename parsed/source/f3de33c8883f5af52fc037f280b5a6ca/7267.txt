TEXT:
You both missed another exciting privacy meeting, but don't worry Sally
wants to do another one Tuesday. The main substantive issue to look
forward to at that meeting is a discussion of where a possible "privacy
entity" organizationally it might be placed.   In the past her staff has
mentioned NEC, DPC or OMB.    We should talk about what the DPC position
is at our Monday team leaders meeting.

 The meeting today consisted of the agencies (Commerce, DOJ, HHS, Treasury)
 discussing what functions they thought a privacy entity should fulfill.
 The agencies were intitially split over what functions an entity should
 occupy (in the previous' paper Sally circulated to you all she mentioned
'five possible activities -- representational, advisory, coordination,
 consumer advocacy, ombudsman.)    Then Sally circulated the OMB
 recommendation which I have sent around.   It suggests a representational,
 advisory, and coordinating role and briefly defines what they mean.

There wasn't any real discussion of health privacy issues.
