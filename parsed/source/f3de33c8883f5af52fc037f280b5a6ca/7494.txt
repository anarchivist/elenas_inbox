TEXT:
proposed below, very roughly, is an agenda for our Benchmarking meeting on
Friday, and the individuals expected to respond initially to a given
issue.  I would appreciate your comments on it -- including order, what to
add, leave out, or change, so that we can have a productive meeting on
Friday. Thank you.

                                AGENDA

-- Background:   Legislative Update on Status of ISTEA   (Leg Affairs, Nancy
McFadden)

-- Background: Status Update on DOT's Final Regs -- expected completion
and expected release date (Nancy McFadden)

-- Background: Justice Department Developments (they are being pushed on
getting the new regs implemented, I am told) (Justice folks)

-- Background: Status of SBA's ramp-up of new certification process
(Richard Hayes)

    Finality of Regs:  Any outstanding issues? -- are benchmarks
completed? is there agreement on content?   [Note: any disagreement about
needed content changes should not be hashed out at this meeting, but
rather noted, and resolved at future meetings between necessary people]

    Timing: When should we release them given the background info above?
What other events (e.g., VP's announcements) might we link with?

-- Roll-out Strategy:  Assignment of responsibilities for Talking Points,
briefings, overall message, etc.

-- Other?
