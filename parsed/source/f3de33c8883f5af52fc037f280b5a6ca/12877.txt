        The Greenwood language is much worse than Sessions and strikes me
as positively offensive. The required disclosure implies that for lots of
people religious faith IS associated with prejudice and intolerance. In
addition, why is respect of the diversity of deeply held beliefs only
important in the case of hate crimes and not in all other cases? The
Sesssions language at least has the benefit that it's innocuous.
