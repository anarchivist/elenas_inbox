TEXT:
Jim Jukes thought that you might be interested in a paragraph touching on
"Tort Reform" in draft Transportation letter we are circulating on Senator
Hutchison's Amtrak reform bill (due to be marked up on Thursday).  I have
faxed you a copy with the the passage marked (it is on the second page) .
Please let us know if DOT's proposed language is acceptable. Thanks.
