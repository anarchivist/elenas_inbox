TEXT:
with FDA, we've come up with the following options for dealing with the
Collins hearings on food safety Thursday:

1.   Have Mikulski do a same day press conference pushing her bill.

2. Have Durbin push the legislation in the hearing itself (Mikulski is
not on the panel)

3. Offer Mike Friedman out aggressively between now and then to the press
(he did Good Morning America this morning effectively pushing for a bill) .

4.  Have other Senators call Collins to encourage her to rally behind some
solution (more resources, our legislation) .

5. Have FDA press brief all the major reporters again tommorow on the
relevance of the legislation. We did follow-up with the network reporters
from last night in case they cover the hearings Thursday.

We will keep pushing ahead.

'What do you think of asking Mikulski to call Collins and ask to testify at
 the hearing about her bill?
