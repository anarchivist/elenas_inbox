MEMORANDUM FOR THE CHIEF OF STAFF

FROM:                  ELENA KAGAN
                       JANET MURGUIA

SUBJECT:               MEETING WITH TOBACCO FARMERS AND REPRESENTATIVES

        On Thursday, August 6th, you will be meeting with Democratic members of the North
Carolina delegation and tobacco farmers from several states to discuss the unusually small
amount of tobacco the companies have been purchasing. We understand that Bruce Flye,
President of the Flue-Cured Stabilization Cooperative Association, would like to make a
presentation to you about the magnitude of the flue-cured problem and urge you to support
putting pressure on the companies to purchase more flue-cured tobacco. The attached provides a
background on who will attend, describes their areas of concern, and suggests talking points.

        In addition, Secretary Glickman's office has prepared a very useful status report on
projected tobacco sales this year and next, which we have attached.


Who Will Attend (All Democratic members from North Carolina)
Rep. Eva Clayton
Rep. Bob Etheridge
Rep. David Price
Rep. Mike McIntyre
Rep. Bill Hefuer
Rep. Melvin Watt

* Clayton's office has not finalized a list offarmers who will attend.  They say farmers from
each member's district in North Carolina will attend, as will farmers from Florida, Virginia, and
South Carolina. In addition, Bruce Flye will attend.

We have also invited Dallas Smith of USDA who is an expert on tobacco programs and who the
groups requested be present.

Background on Current Market Conditions

      As you may know, when the 5 tobacco companies refuse to purchase tobacco, the
farmers' cooperatives buy the tobacco and release it for sale at a later time when the
market is more hospitable. Flue-cured tobacco markets opened in Florida on July 21st

                                                 1
                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion

and have been opening further north over the last few weeks. Initial sales have been very
poor, with the cooperatives being forced to buy 19% of the tobacco on sale, up from the
normal levels of 5-10%. Markets in the "Old Belt" of Northern North Carolina and
Virginia opened Tuesday, August 4th, and we plan to update you on sales reports from
there shortly before the Thursday meeting.

        Last week, Flye and other farmer representatives met with Senator Faircloth in an
unsuccessful effort to persuade him to pressure the tobacco companies to increase their
purchases. The farmers say they hope to get a commitment by the companies to purchase
550 million pounds of flue-cured tobacco. The companies publicly stated purchase
intention is for only 457 million pounds. While the companies are required to buy only
90% of their formal purchase intentions, they have indicated they will buy the full amount
of their purchase intention.

       Flye and some farmers from his group have previously met with representatives of
the DPC, USDA, and OPL to discuss the difficult state of the markets. USDA and the
Administration have worked closely with the farmers groups during the tobacco legislative
negotiations, and you have previously met with tobacco state representatives to help ensure
that comprehensive tobacco legislation contained measures acceptable to farmers.


The AG's Settlement Agreement and Continuing Talks

      The settlement agreement with the Attorneys General did not outline a plan to
compensate farmers for the diminished domestic tobacco sales that might result from
comprehensive legislation. The on-going talks, according to our information, also do not
currently contain a farmer provision.

Legislative Background

      If a so-called skinny bill is introduced by Republicans in the House, we have worked
with Democrats to make sure a substitute bill contains provisions acceptable to farmers.
However, it seems unlikely that Republicans will introduce tobacco legislation or that a
Democratic counter-measure would pass.


Talking Points

* Discuss the scope and implications of the problem (the groups say they mostly want you
to be aware of the problem):

      The markets have opened very poorly for tobacco fanners.

      Declines in purchases this year and next mean reduction in quota and increased costs to
      farmers. USDA projects a possible 22% reduction in quota from the 1998 level for next

                                             2
                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion
    year and a significant increase in costs to fanners as they pay for the assessment that is
    part of the "no net cost assessment" the farmers pay to the government.
    This hits fanners very hard, and reaches whole communities.

    It also hits minority fanners very hard (15% of flue-cured quota owners are
    African-Americans. )


*   Farmers have done nothing wrong.

    The President has repeatedly said tobacco fanners should not suffer in this process.

    They worked closely with us in trying to put together legislation that reduced youth
    smoking and protected tobacco fanners and their communities.


*   Ask what steps they suggest

    Note Secretary Glickman is scheduled to go to North Carolina and met with tobacco
    fanners on August 27, 1998 and will visit with Reps. Etheridge and Clayton.

    State we will continue to urge the AG's to include compensation for fanners in any
    agreement they formulate.

    Indicate that we will use whatever leverage we have to urge the companies to purchase
    550 million pounds oftobacco this year. That it should not be a partisan issue.

    You could ask them ifthey would favor the Administration putting forward legislation
    that would move the cost of paying the "no net cost assessment" from farmers to the
    companies alone. Currently, farmers pay some of this cost. In this year's agricultural
    appropriations bill we inserted a provision charging the companies for the cost of the
    program to support a food safety measure. However, this provision wii1likely be
    stricken on procedural grounds (the measure is deemed a tax because it did not originate
    in the House).
