 Subject: SLATE Delivery - August 8 1997

 (Your copy of today's SLATE ON PAPER is attached to this mail. It may
 be at the bottom.)

 August 8, 1997

 Dear Reader,

 Move over, Forbes 400, the time has come for SLATE to rank the rich--not
 by the crass measure of wealth, but in a hierarchy of heart. The SLATE
 60 lists the top charitable donations of the quarter, who made them, and
 where they went. Some names ring a bell, others may not, but no good
 deed goes unpublished. Philanthropy will never be the same.
 http://www.slate.com/Slate60/97-08-09/Slate60.asp

democracy, block the conduct of the people's business?"
