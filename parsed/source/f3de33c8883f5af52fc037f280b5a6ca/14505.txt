TEXT:
It was a great meeting -- congratulations ... Did you think that the
discussion on the 0-3 conference precludes sending the exec. memorandum
out before the SOU (i.e. not until the next, smaller principals working
group is convened) or could we convene the meeting Shalala requested while·
sending the memo out at the same time, considering that the purpose of the
memo is both substantive and PR, i.e. to be on record on the issue?

FYI, Pauline, Jeanine and I met this morning on the 0-3 conference and are
aiming to have a proposal to you by Wednesday on possible panel
participants. We will vet it on a staff level, and perhaps you and Bruce
could get input from the appropriate Cabinet principals.
