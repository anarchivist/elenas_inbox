TEXT:
States can spend Child Care and Development Block Grant funds only on
families up to 85 percent of the state median income.  They also must
spend no less than 70 percent of their funds on families who are receiving
welfare, transitioning off welfare, or at risk of being dependent on
welfare ..

Our child care budget proposal omitted this second requirement to allow
states to aim funds at the working poor.    As you know, our language was
cleared internally, but never officially submitted to the Hill (except as
I understand it, shared with some. of our friends on the House side).

The tobacco bill also omits this second requirement for the additional
child care money, at I believe OMB's suggestion.   However, this does not
eliminate the basic limitation that states to spend CCDBG funds only on
families under 85· percent of the state median income.
