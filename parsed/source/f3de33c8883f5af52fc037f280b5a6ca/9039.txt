MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:          Bruce Reed
               Elena Kagan

RE:            DPC Weekly Report


        Tobacco -- Counteradvertising Event: We are planning a tobacco event for September
where you will announce a new national effort to promote tobacco counteradvertising. At the
event, you will direct HHS to: (1) designate the CDC's Media Campaign Resource Center as a
National Clearinghouse on Tobacco Counteradvertising; (2) collect and disseminate a package of
the "top-10" advertisements for preventing youth smoking, and make these available to states and
organizations for television placement free of charge; (3) work with the Department of Education
to make effective anti-tobacco curriculum available to every school; and (4) conduct research on
what media interventions are most effective for preventing youth smoking. While some
advocates are concerned that any effort on our part to launch a counteradvertising campaign will
take the heat off of the House to pass comprehensive legislation, we believe that we need to take
whatever action we can through executive action in order to reduce youth smoking.

        At the event, you could also call on the entertainment industry to take a leadership role in
reducing youth smoking, by urging actors to serve as role models and speak out against youth
smoking, writers and directors to eliminate smoking from movies and television programming,
and broadcasters to air public service announcements targeting youth smoking. (In 1996, 77
percent of all major motion pictures portrayed the use of tobacco. In most of these movies, the
lead actor or actress smoked.) We could invite supermodel Kristy Turlington and musical group
"Boyz II Men" to participate in the event, both of whom have already demonstrated their
commitment to this effort by making public service announcements targeting youth smoking that
are available through the CDC.

         Crime -- Probation/Parole Study: On Sunday, the Justice Department will release a
survey of the nation's probation and parole population in 1997. Key findings include: (1) Total
number -- A record 3.9 million adults were on probation or parole in 1997, though the 2.9%
increase from 1996 was consistent with the average annual increase of 3.0% since 1990; (2)
Probation -- Of the 3.26 million probationers, 54% were convicted felons, 28% were
misdemeanants, and 14% drunk or impaired drivers; (3) Parole -- Of the 685,000 adults on
parole, nearly all (96%) had been convicted ofa felony; and (4) State Trends -- CA (408,900) and
TX (538,500) had the most probationers and parolees, and NY, ME, NH and AZ had a more
than 10% increase in their probation population. Nine states reported more than 10% increases
in their parole popUlations.
                                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion


        Crime -- COPS/Police Corps: We are preparing a possible event for you the week of
August 23, where you would announce the release of funds to hire and educate law enforcement
through the COPS Program. You could make the following three-part announcement: (1) Police
Corps -- $30 million in state awards under the Police Corps program -- including $14.3 million
for scholarships to 330 new students, and 6 new participating states (CO, FL, IL, MA, OK, UT
and the Virgin Islands); (2) COPS Small Community Grants -- Approximately $10 million to
help 855 small and rural law enforcement agencies (serving populations under 50,000) defray the
costs of retaining current COPS-funded officers; and (3) COPS Universal Hiring -- $74.8 million
to hire over 1,000 community police officers in 237 jurisdictions, including 12 school resource
officers for Jonesboro, AR.

         Crime -- Early Warning Guide: For your August 22nd radio address, we are working
to finalize the Early Warning Guide to school violence that you recently directed Secretary Riley
and the Attorney General to develop. The guide will be a user-friendly document with practical
suggestions to help principals, teachers, and parents identify what types of early signs to look for
before youths become violent; how to properly intervene once troubled youth have been
identified; and how to respond to crisis once violence occurs. The guide will be posted on the
Web the day of the radio address, and 250,000 will be mailed out to schools and communities
before the start of the school year.

        Crime -- Brady Law Statistic: We thought we should clarify a statistic on the
effectiveness of the Brady Law that you referred to in California. Background checks have a
stopped nearly a quarter ofa million (or 242,000) prohibited handgun purchases since the Brady
Law took effect in February of 1994. And last year, about 62 percent of the 69,000 rejections
that occurred were based on felony convictions or indictments. Thus, about 42,780 felons -- or
an estimated 18 per day -- were stopped from purchasing handguns in 1997.

         Drunk Driving -- Record Low in 1997: On Friday, the Transportation Department
announced that, in 1997, the rate and number of alcohol-related fatalities dropped to their
lowest levels since the Transportation Department began record-keeping in 1975. Last year, the
rate of alcohol-related crashes fell from nearly 41 % in 1996 to 38.6% in 1997 -- the first time that
the rate dropped below 40% -- and the fewest number of alcohol-related fatalities. Since 1982,
the number of alcohol-related fatalities has dropped by more than a third. The 1997
Transportation data also shows that alcohol-related deaths among 16 to 20 year-olds dropped 5%.
 The data is from DOT's Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS), which documents all
traffic-related fatalities in the 50 states and D.C. There was a very small decline in the overall
number oftraffic-re1ated fatalities, from 42,065 in 1996 to 41,967 in 1997. Sixty-three percent
ofthose killed on the highways were not wearing seat belts.

       Welfare Reform -- New Caseload Numbers and Study to Mark Anniversary: At our
suggestion, HHS will release new welfare case load numbers on Friday to coincide with the
two-year anniversary of the welfare refonn law on August 22nd. We do not have the numbers


                                                 2
                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion

yet (HHS is still collecting them as we write this memo) but if trends continue the three
additional months of data (April-June 1998) should show reductions of several hundred
million from the 8_9 million level you announced in May_ HHS will also announce $1.6
million in technical assistance grants to help states promote job retention and
advancement.

       On August 20th, the Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation will release
an encouraging study of welfare reform in Los Angeles, funded in part by HHS. In 1995,
Los Angeles shifted to a job-focused welfare program, based largely on the positive results
from nearby Riverside county. The early results from Los Angeles are promising: after
six months, welfare recipients in the program were 34 percent more likely to be employed
and had 46 percent higher earnings. The program reduced welfare costs by just under 10
percent.

        The Los Angeles study adds to the multitude of evidence contained in the new
T ANF report to Congress which shows welfare reform is working. The report, which you
announced August 4th, shows that two years after the signing, no race to the bottom has
materialized -- nine states have increased benefits, only eight have cut benefits. Almost
every state requires personal responsibility contracts, and most states have adopted a
work-first model, with 32 states expecting clients to work within six months. For the first
time, half of all low-income single mothers with children under six -- the population most
affected by welfare policy -- are working, a dramatic increase from 35% in 1992. State
evaluations of welfare programs show employment increases of 8 to 15 percentage points.
So far, welfare changes do not appear to have put nearly as much pressure on the foster
care system as some critics feared. For example, a Maryland study found that less than Y2
of 1 percent of families leaving welfare placed a child in foster care, and most of those
families had already been under investigation for abuse or neglect.

        Food Safety -- Food Safety Council: We expect the National Academy of Sciences to
release next week a highly anticipated report recommending that the government's food safety
structure be much better coordinated and that resources be more evenly allocated between FDA
and USDA. DPC staff will attend a briefing by the NAS on Tuesday regarding the contents of
the report. We have been working with the agencies and NPR to prepare an appropriate
response. All of the agencies agree that we should welcome the report, study it, and use the
opportunity to push for continued progress on food issues. We are preparing an executive order
setting up a Food Safety Council which will review the NAS study and report back to you with
recommendations for longer-range strategies. The Council would consist of the relevant
agencies, HHS, USDA, EPA, OSTP, DPC, NPR, and Commerce. In addition to preparing a
long-term report, the Council would serve as a coordinating body, charged with setting food
safety priorities and helping to produce a coordinated food safety budget each year. The
agencies are anxious about this approach, fearing it may lead to a single food agency or a
diminution of their ability to act unilaterally on budget issues. However, in light of on-going
appropriate criticism that the government's food safety efforts are too fragmented, we view the


                                               3
                                                                              Automated Records Management System
                                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion

     Council as a useful coordinating mechanism that could also set the stage for preparing a
     thoughtful long-term solution. We plan that you could announce this Council in early
     September at an event with the relevant agencies.

             Campaign Finance Reform -- Free TV Time Commission: The co-chairs of the
     Public Interest Advisory Commission on the Public Interest Obligations of Broadcasters in the
     Digital Age (Moonves-Omstein Commission), have requested an extension on the deadline for
     their report which was originally scheduled for October 1. The request is consistent with our
     internal conclusions that it is our interest to extend the deadline to increase the likelihood that in
     a less politically-charged environment, the members of the commission will present a more
     meaningful set of recommendations. OVP, DPC, OMB, and Commerce will continue to track
     the work of the Commission.

             Education -- Young Women's Leadership Academy in NYC: The Education
     Department has been working for the past six months with the NYC schools to develop a
     rationale and evidence to support the continued operation of the Young Women's           .
     Leadership Academy. DPC, WH Counsel, and the Education and Justice Departments
     initially believed that the most promising approach, consistent with p'revailing'
     interpretations of Title IX and the Equal Protection clause, would be to find evidence
     supporting a "remedial" rationale for the school. However, the Department has concluded
     that the necessary evidence to support this approach does not exist for this school.
     Nonetheless, DPC, WH Counsel, Education and Justice Department staff all agree that our
     policy goal is to allow continued experimentation with single sex schools, and that no
     enforcement or other steps should be taken to close the school, force it to admit boys, or
     force NYC to open a boys school. Instead, our goal now is to work cooperatively with the
     NYC schools to provide evidence that both boys and girls in coed schools are afforded
     learning opportunities comparable to those in the all girls school, while at the same time
     continuing to evaluate the effectiveness of the Leadership Academy.
