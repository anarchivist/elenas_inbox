DRAFT --- NOT FOR RELEASE
September xx, 1998
(House)

H.R. 4579 - Taxpayer Relief Act of 1998
(Archer (R) Texas)

The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 4579.    If the bill were presented
to the president, he would veto it.

H.R. 4579 would cut taxes by $85 billion over five years and $176 billion
over 10 years. With the exception of only one offsetting provision, none
of the billO,s costs have been paid for.  This blatantly violates the
pay-as-you-go fiscal discipline of the Budget Enforcement Act --
discipline which has been an essential component of our remarkable
economic revival.   The President will veto any tax cut or spending bill
that changes the budget rules in order to evade fiscal discipline.

In addition,   the billions of dollars this bill would drain out of


projected budget surpluses violates the presidentD,s unwavering commitment
to save Social Security first.  None of the projected surpluses should be
touched until the long-term solvency of Social Security has been fully
secured. We must not squander this unique opportunity to save Social
Security.

Last February in the FY 1999 Budget, the President proposed tax cuts
targeted to help American families -- and proposed offsets to fully pay
for the tax cuts. The Administration urges the Congress to return to the
path of fiscal responsibility and to consider only tax cuts which have
been fully paid for.

Pay-As-You-Go-Scoring

H.R. 4579 would affect revenues; therefore it is subject to the
pay-as-you-go requirement of the Budget Enforcement Act.   Under the Budget
Enforcement Act, OMB would be required by law to impose automatic spending
cuts on Medicare and other non-exempt mandatory spending programs in
amounts sufficient to offset the revenue losses projected for FY 1999.    In
the absence of offsetting legislation, these automatic budget cuts would
be triggered again in each of the following four years.   These automatic
cuts would affect:   the special milk program, vocational rehabilitation,
Stafford loans, foster care and adoption assistance, Medicare (up to 4
percent), and could also affect CCC, Child Support Enforcement, Social
Services Block Grants, Immigration Support, Crop Insurance, Veterans
Education and Readjustment Benefits, and others.
