TEXT:
It looks like the House Labor HHS bill will go to the Rules Committee
tomorrow, and to the floor on Tuesday, along the following lines:

Currently, the bill contains an Istook provision which requires parental
consent for Title X family planning.

1)  Greenwood will be allowed to strike the Istook language and offer his
friendly substitute which emphasizes that Title X providers should
encourage minors to abstain from sexual activity and involve their parents
in their decision to seek family planning services. Unfortunately,
anti-choice members will be able to second degree this amendment with
whatever they want. This is a bad procedural situation -- the vote-on the
second degree will come first, so if it passes Greenwood does not get a
vote.

2)  Brady will be allowed to offer an amendment saying that states can
pass their own legislation requiring parental consent, thus overriding
existing federal requirements guaranteeing confidential services to
teens.  The pro-choice side apparently will be allowed to offer a
substitute (the groups are drafting language and talking to Castle about
offering it) .

3)  Tihart will be allowed to offer an amendment saying that Title X
clinics which perform abortions must have both financial and physical
separation between the title X and abortion services. Currently, there
must be financial separation.  The pro-choice side apparently will be
allowed to offer a substitute (the groups are drafting language and
talking to Nancy Johnson about offering it).

So this means that there will be at least 6 votes on family planning, and
·

    a lot of opportunity for confusion among members.
