Message Creation Date was at 30-JUL-1997 12:21:00

Below is language revised to take into account (a) the negotiations between
Nita Lowey and Henry Hyde and (b) the fact that we've agreed to different
language on Medicaid managed care to deal with the "conmingling of funds"
issue.  If you have any difficulties with the language below, please page me.
Thanks.

An amendment is made in order that would include a prohibition on the purchase
of health benefit coverage that includes abortion.   The President believes that
abortion should be safe, legal, and rare.   However, the amendment would not
only maintain, but further limit the range of conditions under which a womanD,s
health would permit access to abortion.   Furthermore, it and would require a
physician to make a legal determination that the woman met these conditions
have been met.  The Hyde amendment might also be construed to curtail the
availability of State-only and privately funded abortion services.   Most States
purchase health coverage for Medicaid beneficiaries from managed care
organizations (MCOs).  This amendment might be construed as prohibiting States
from contracting with MCOs that offer abortion services to any woman, even
using private or State funds.  The Administration opposes this attempt to
constrain further the availability of abortion services and strongly urges the
House not to adopt the Hyde amendment.    For this and other these reasons, the
Administration prefers the Lowey substitute. We understand that there may be
negotiations to develop an alternative to both proposals. The Administration
believes that it is important that any legislation in this area be clear that
limitations on the use of Federal funds to provide abortion services under
managed care plans do not affect in any way the ability of states to provide
such coverage using their own funds, nor the ability of managed care providers
to participate in Federally-funded programs while also offering other coverage
paid for by state or private funds.
