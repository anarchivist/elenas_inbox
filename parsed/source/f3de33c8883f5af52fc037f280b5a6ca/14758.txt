TEXT:
I talked to Ed of Congo StenholmD,s office to ask if they had looked into
the employee end of things on the Texas proposal.  He didn't have much at
all in the way of detail on types of employees or functions, so I suspect
Comptroller Sharp's office would be a better source.   (I seem to recall
that someone was going to reach out to Sharp's office .... )

He again indicated that he believes the state is open to middle ground
solutions.

Here's what he did know:

There are currently 15,000 employees involved in "processing."   The
stateD,s assumption is that, even in absence of contracting out, the
process of moving to the new computerization and integrated enrollment
would probably lead to about 1/3 attrition, i.e., going down to 10,000
employees.

He says that their expectation is that the new consortia will hire some
significant portion of the public workforce.   The RFO does require the
various bids to address the issue of whether they are going to keep on
current workforce, find other employment for them, etc.

They are assuming that the federal government still has approval over the
final contract, and so we would know how employees are being treated
before the contracts are final.  He said that that would be the point when
we could "try to work something out".   (Sounds like he means make sure
they have some job, if not necessarily in the same union or any union.  I
assume that if contractors hire these folks, they are certainly no longer
in the same union, if any union at all.)
