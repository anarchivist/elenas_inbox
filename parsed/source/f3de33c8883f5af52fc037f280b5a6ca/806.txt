TEXT:
2pm is fine for the interagency meeting -- I'll set it for 2pm on Tuesday,
2/18.

Also, we're setting up a meeting on the elusive HHS adoption report for
tomorrow -- internal WH meeting at 5:00pm (rm 100), with HHS folks joining
us at 5:30pm, so that we can give them united WH comment.  I'll have
Olivia fax the report to me when it's ready today and have copies walked
around to the usual suspects.
