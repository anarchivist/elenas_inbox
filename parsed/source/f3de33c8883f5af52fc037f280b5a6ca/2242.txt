TEXT:
The only challenge by the Capitol Police managment was a procedural
challenge brought before the Board of Compliance and was dismissed earlier
this year. At that time the Board of Compliance specified that only those
officers actively involved in security details would be exempted.   I'm
trying to get a copy of anything the Board put in writing about who would
be exempted. Currently, less than 10 percent of capitol police are
exempted, and it includes people like Gingrich's and Lott's personal
security details.
