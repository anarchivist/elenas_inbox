TEXT:
FYI --

On Thursday June 25th, the Senate Committee on the Judiciary is scheduled
to markup S. 1645, the child custody/abortion bill. This bill is almost
identical to HR 3682, which is currently being marked up in the House.
Did a copy of the Chief-of-Staff's June 17th letter go to Senator Hatch?
If not, are we planning to send the Senate Committee a letter prior to
Thursday's markup? Thanks.
