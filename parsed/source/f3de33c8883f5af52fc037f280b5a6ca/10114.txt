TEXT:
The current plan is to preview the VP's WTW event w/ AP Thursday p.m. to
appear Friday a.m. We'd provide an overview of the grants, and highlight
one or two juicy examples (still figuring out which those would be ... VP's
office suggests CA, FL, or TX).  DOL has also suggested giving a story to
Judy Haveman since she has closely followed WTW grants and did a nice
piece on the 1st round of competitive grants.  Bruce, do you want to do
these calls?
