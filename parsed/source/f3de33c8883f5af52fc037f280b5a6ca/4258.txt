      TEXT:
      Jose asked me to pass along the highlights of the meeting we had a couple
      weeks ago on background checks for day care workers.

      While a few federal laws have been passed to either facilitate or
      encourage such checks, they have had little impact and substantial
      obstacles remain:

      * No national standards exist for background checks. "Background checks"
      can mean either a criminal history name check, a fingerprint check, or a
      civil records check. Moreover, states vary widely on who they check
      (part-time/full-time employees) and the scope of crimes they are checking.

      * There is no single database for background checks. The feds and the
      states have their own information systems and many criminal justice
      records remain decentralized at the local level.   In addition, these
      information systems may not collect all of the relevant information
      relevant for day care workers (e.g.,   sex offender registry may identify a
      convicted child molester but not a child abuser) .

      * Cost of background checks. The cost of checks can be substantial.
      Fingerprint checks are at least three times as expensive as name checks,
      but are more reliable: Concerns were raised about passing these costs
      along to the customers, many of whom may already find child care costs
      prohibitive. Moreover, child care facilities have a high rate of employee
      turn over.

      Since the Supreme Court's decision the Brady Law, there is a heightened
      sensitivity to imposing mandates on states in this area, particularly
      without providing additional funding.   Our discussion on moving forward
      was focused on an Interstate Compact bill which the Justice Department is
      preparing the send to the Hill this month.  Under the Compact-- which must
      first be passed by Congress and then by individual states-- the FBI would
      maintain an index of all of the state-maintained criminal history records
      and the ground rules for states to share their information.

      This would be a solid first step to expand the availability of criminal
      history records for "non-criminal justice purposes." The downside is that
      each state needs to ratify the compact if they want to participate-- which
      could take a long time.



     The next meeting will continue to focus on other options to expand access;
     privacy concerns; and recommendations.
