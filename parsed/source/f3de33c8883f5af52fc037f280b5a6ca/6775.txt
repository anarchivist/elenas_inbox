 TEXT:
 Sorry I missed the dialogue. Would someone send me a copy of the memo
 that is either b/4 the POTUS or on its way there.

Also, JJS told the VPOTUS that he would love for him to do an event, and
would love to be there w/him.  I know this creates a scheduling.night-mare
since JJS is not available on Friday-- but I wanted you to know that this
was spinning.

 also, podesta said something about a Sec Herman event on Thursday -- I
 know the VPOTUS cannot do Thursday

 thanks
