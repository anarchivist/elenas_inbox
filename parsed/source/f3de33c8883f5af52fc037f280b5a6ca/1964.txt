TEXT:
Game plan is that O'Hara will fax a draft POTUS statement to Lindsey from
NC shortly after 11:00 am tomorrow, followed by the text of the decision.
I think we just need to get key people there -- or in some other central
location -- at 11:00 to do any revisions to draft and Q&A right then, and
run text back by NC crowd. Does that make sense? If so, I suggest you
propose that on the call.
