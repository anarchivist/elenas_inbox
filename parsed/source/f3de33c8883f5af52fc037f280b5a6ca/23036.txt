                                     Police Abuse and Misconduct
                                        Policy Announcements

            1. Increase funding for police integrity and ethics training. Currently, the federal
    government invests only a limited amount of funds on the issue of police integrity and ethics --
    an issue that is central to community policing and the changing nature of policing in America.
    For instance, of the approximately 25 regional training centers funded by the Justice
    Department's COPS Office, only 2 specialize in this discipline. By increasing the percentage of
    funds in the President's COPS program that can be used for training, we can make police
    integrity and ethics a priority in all 25 of our regional training centers.

            2. Develop early warning systems to detect abuse and misconduct. Studies show
    that many of the police officers who engage in serious misconduct and abuse tend to have had a
    disproportionate number of complaints filed against them. Local police departments can and
    should do much more to implement early warning systems that allow them to identify and
    discipline problem police officers -- before its too late. Funds should be authorized to help
    police departments put such systems into place.

            3. Develop a national system to track serious misconduct and abuse. The federal
    government should establish a national database that tracks police officers who are found guilty
    of serious misconduct or abuse. State, local and federal law enforcement agencies could then
    consult this database as they screen new officers, helping to prevent against the re-hiring of
    abusive or corrupt police officers.

             4. Enhance police recruitment of minorities. Former New York Police
    Commissioner William Bratton has recommended that police department diversify and improve
    their workforce by aggressively recruiting and educating minority candidates. He has proposed
    offering 12-to-14 year-olds summer jobs and training, establishing public safety high schools,
    and continuing to pay for the education of police cadets in the City College system. Our Police
    Corps and/or COPS program could be amended to support such long-term minority recruitment
    efforts.

           5. Raise police force education levels. A fundamental reform in policing that is
    supported by both police management and labor is an overall increase in the education level' of
    America's police, Our budget this year already includes $20 million for such scholarships.

            6. Establish citizen police academies. In some cities, police departments offer a
    version of their police academy training to citizens and community advocates. The goal of this
    training is two-fold: (1) for police to better understand the concerns of its citizens; and (2) for
    citizens to better understand and experience the training received by police and how they make
    decisions, such as when to use deadly force. Our COPS program could help more communities
    to establish these citizen academies.

             7. Promote tough enforcement of our laws. Tough enforcement of our laws must be
     a central element of any plan against police misconduct and abuse. Our budget includes an
     increase of more than $1 million dollars (and 10 new attorneys) for this purpose .- the largest
     ever proposed.

             8. Complete the transition to community policing. Any plan to reduce police abuse
     and misconduct must be coupled with a long-term commitment to affirmatively strengthen the
     bond between police and the people they serve. There is no better way to do this than to renew
     the President's COPS program, which has helped to sow the seeds of change in thousands oflaw
     enforcement agencies throughout the country. If the President's COPS program is not renewed
     this year, or replaced with a block grant, we w~lliose all the leverage we have gained over the
     past 5 years to promote changes in law enforcement at the local level.
