TEXT:
Update on the Hate Crimes conference and Race


1. Legislation expanding hate crimes. Ogden has four options to present
to Reno with a recommendation, I believe this week.   I'm setting up a
meeting with him and public liason for tomorrow afternoon to make sure his
recommendation is one that will satisfy us, the groups and Senator
Kennedy.

 The proposed legislative package on enforcement and statistics looks ok,
I'll send you a copy.  *The only difficulty might be they've left an
education provision in which looks like they intend to send some possible
curricula to schools.  I'd like to relay strong concern about that. You
had mentioned this problem to Ogden in a meeting, and so had I.

2. On civil rights agencY,reform. Can I get a copy of the memos recieved
and put together a backgrounder on them-- what problems they seem to have
addressed what they left out?   I'd suggest we sit down with the most
vital ones separately (EEOC) and do a general meeting for the others.  I
got a call from OMB asking if we had funding requests base don the memos
we requested from the agencies, and reminding us that if we were going to
ask for more money we should do so soon.

3. On my cryptic "international tobacco" e-mail. Sherman Boone at the NEC
seems to have been collecting stuff on international tobacco and just
wanted to know if he should be writing something or getting more
information together.

Regards, Tom
