         I. COUNTERING THE WASHINGTON POST ARTICLE
         - David Garrow, the pulitzer prize winning historian and author of Liberty &
         Sexuality: The Right to Privacy, has an op ed in today's Philadelphia Inquirer
         and also in the Chicago Tribune calling for Senators to "affirm the President's
         judgment and reject a dangerously radical effort to impose Congress' medical
         ideas in place of the best professional conclusions of accredited physicians."
