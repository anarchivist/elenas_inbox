    MEMORANDUM FOR ELENA KAGAN

    FROM:          Julie Fernandes

    CC:             Cynthia Rice

    RE:            Public Charge -- remaining legal issues

    DATE:January 11, 1999

    Recent changes in the welfare and immigration laws, along with changes in the Medicaid
    program, have created some confusion about how Medicaid and Food Stamps should be
    considered in the determination of whether an alien is or is likely to become a "public charge."
    Determination as a "public charge" has significant consequences for an alien -- it can cause them
    to be denied admission to the United States, deported, or denied permanent residency. By
    statute, the INS and State Department are required to consider the alien's age, health, family
    status, assets, resources, financial status, education and skills when considering whether he or she
    is or is likely to become a public charge.

    There have been documented instances in which aliens have been denied re-entry to the U.S.
    because they had received Medicaid or Food Stamps. Moreover, aliens have been told that
    receipt of Medicaid and/or Food Stamps will have a negative effect on their immigration status.
    These cases have translated into widespread concern in immigrant communities about legal
    receipt of these benefits, even where the beneficiary is a U.S. citizen child. The concern about
    negative immigration consequences associated with the legal use of Medicaid and Food Stamps
    interferes with the President's goals of increasing insurance coverage and improving public
    health.

    After much discussion and debate, the INS and the State Department have agreed to issue
    guidance that past or current use of Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP),
    or Food Stamps (or their state analogs) is not to be considered in determining whether a person is
    likely to become a public charge for purposes of admission to the U.S. or adjustment of status,
    except where an alien has received long-term institutionalized care funded by Medicaid.

      However, we have not reached resolution on how these programs should be treated for purposes
      of deportation based on having become a public charge. Section 237(a)(5) ofthe INA states that
    . "[ a]ny alien who, within five years after the date of entry, has become a public charge from
      causes not affirmatively shown to have arisen since entry is deportable." Under the INS's current
      policy -- informed by a 1948 decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), Matter of B.
      -- if an alien is subject to the new binding affidavit of support (post-December 1997 aliens only)
      and (1) receives a public benefit (like Medicaid or TANF) within five years after entry, (2) there
      is a demand for repayment ofthe value of that benefit from the benefit-granting agency, and (3)
      the sponsor refuses to pay, the alien can be subject to deportation for being a public charge. The


                                                     1
                                                                                        ~;.·J~ITIP ConvUlsion


      theory is that since the new affidavit of support creates a binding obligation on the part of the
      sponsor to support the alien, a failure on the sponsor's part to meet that obligation creates an
      unpaid debt for which the alien is responsible, and thus the alien is deportable as a public charge.


      With regard to the receipt of federal welfare benefits, this rule has almost no application -- most
      aliens entering the U.S. are not eligible for Medicaid and/or Food Stamps for the first five years
      (unless, of course, we manage to restore some benefits to post-Welfare Act aliens in FY 2000).
      However, states are free to provide welfare-like benefits (including state-only food and health
      benefits) to post-Welfare Act aliens. Thus, aliens in jurisdictions where state-only benefits are
      available may be deterred from taking advantage of these programs if they believe there may be
      deportation consequences down the road. In addition, some states do not make clear whether
      benefits offered are state-only or federally financed, and thus some aliens may be deterred from
      taking advantage of any medical and/or food benefits for fear of the possible deportation
      consequences.

      Issue #1

      We would like to be able to assure legal immigrants that legal use of Medicaid, CHIP, and Food
      Stamps -- or their state analogs -- would never lead to deportation. The legal question that we
      have posed to the Department of Justice is how we can get to this result in light ofthe
      aforementioned BIA case (Matter ofB.) that sets out this multi-part test. for when a finding of
      public charge is triggered. According to DOJ, the binding affidavit of support creates just the
      kind of debt that Matter ofB. contemplated.

      The Department has indicated that in order for the Attorney General to take certain programs
      (like Medicaid or Food Stamps) off the table for purposes of triggering the Matter of B. test, she
      must issue a regulation. However, they have suggested that it may be possible to issue interim
      guidance that directs INS officers not to consider Medicaid or Food Stamp use as a basis for a
      debt that could trigger deportation, pending the issuance of a regulation that effects this change.
      OLC is looking into whether this option is legally permissible.

      Issue #2

      We would like the INS's guidance to layout a clear analytical distinction between those
      programs that should be considered for purposes of the public charge analysis, and those that
      should not.

      The current version of the guidance lists examples of those programs that should be considered
      in the public charge analysis (TANF, SSI) and those that should not be considered (Food Stamps,
      Medicaid, WIC, etc.), but does not articulate the basis for distinguishing one group from the
      other. Thus, if an immigration or consular officer is presented with an alien who is receiving
      benefits from a program not listed, there is no guidance to that officer about whether to consider


                                                       2
                                                                                  Hex-Dump Convti,siJn

this program for public charge purposes.
HHS has made the argument to the INS that the distinction should be between cash and non-cash
benefits (with an exception for those who reside in a long-term care institution; though the
benefit they receive is non-cash, they are wholly dependent on it for food and shelter). The State
Department, while not endorsing any particular framework for the overall distinction, has long
relied on the conclusion that Food Stamps are "supplemental" for determining that receipt of
Food Stamp benefits should not be considered for purposes of public charge.

According to DOJ and INS, they have not yet concluded whether they can -- in light oftheir past
administrative decisions re: public charge -- separate programs based on a cash/non-cash or a
supplementaVnon-supplemental distinction.
