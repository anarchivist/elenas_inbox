THE WHITE HOUSE

Office of the Press Secretary


For Immediate Release
January 14, 1999


RELIGIOUS FREEDOM DAY, 1999



BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

A PROCLAMATION


        On Religious Freedom Day we commemorate a landmark achievement in
the history of our Nation:  the adoption in 1786 by the Virginia
legislature of a religious freedom statute. This historic legislation,
drafted by Thomas Jefferson and co-sponsored by James Madison, was
designed to prevent religious discrimination and to protect Virginians
from pressure to join or support any church.  It served as the model for
the First Amendment of our Constitution, the guarantee of freedom of
religion that has beckoned so many people fleeing persecution to seek
sanctuary in this land.

        Americans are a deeply religious people, and our right to worship
as we choose, to follow our own personal beliefs, is the source of much of
our Nation's strength. Our churches, synagogues, mosques, temples, and
other houses of worship are centers of community service and community
life. They preserve and promote the values and religious traditions that
have infused our efforts to build a civil society based on mutual respect,
compassion, and generosity.   They provide our children with the moral
compass to make wise choices.

        America's reverence for religious freedom and religious tolerance
has saved us from much of the hatred and violence that have plagued so
many other peoples around the world. We have always been vigilant in
protecting this freedom, but our efforts cannot stop at our own shores.
We cannot ignore the suffering of men and women across the globe today who
are harassed, imprisoned, tortured, and executed simply for seeking to
live by their own beliefs.  Freedom of religion is a fundamental human
right that must be upheld by every nation and guaranteed by every
government. The promotion of religious freedom for all peoples must
continue to serve as a central element of our foreign policy.

        Reflecting our steadfast commitment to this goal, last fall the
Congress passed, and I was proud to sign into law, the International
Religious Freedom Act of 1998. This legislation enhances our ability to
advance freedom of religion for men and women of all faiths throughout the
world.  It also establishes a new position at the Department of State --
the Ambassador at Large for International Religious Freedom -- to ensure
that religious liberty concerns receive consistent and appropriate
attention at the highest policymaking levels.

        On Religious Freedom Day, let us give thanks for this precious
right that has so profoundly shaped and sustained our Nation, and let us
strengthen our efforts to share its blessings with oppressed peoples


     everywhere.

             NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON i President of the United
     States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the
     Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby

     more

     people of the United States to observe this day with appropriate
     ceremonies, activities, and programs, and I urge all Americans to reaffirm
     their devotion to the fundamental principles of religious freedom and
     religious tolerance.


             IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this
     fourteenth day of January, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and
     ninety-nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America the
     two hundred and twenty-third.



                                                     WILLIAM J. CLINTON
