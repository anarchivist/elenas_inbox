     Q:   What is your response to the Medicare prescription drug benefit initiative (the
          Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage Act of 1999) being unveiled today by
          Senator Kennedy (RockefellerlDingeIIfStarklWaxman)?


     A:   We welcome any proposal that thoughtfully addresses one of Medicare's major
          shortcomings -- the lack oflifesaving prescription drug coverage. The Medicare
          Prescription Drug Act includes several important elements designed to address short and
          long-term cost burdens faced by elderly, disabled and low income beneficiaries. Weare
          reviewing it to determine coverage adequacy, administrative feasibility, and affordability
          -- both to beneficiaries and to the Medicare program.

          Senators Kennedy and Rockefeller and Congressmen Dingell, Stark and Waxman deserve
          praise for their constructive contribution to this debate. Their leadership in improving
          and strengthening Medicare has been longstanding and consistent. The President looks
          forward to working with them and others as we develop an affordable prescription drug
          benefit that will be included and financed in the context the broader reform package he
          intends to release in the near future.

          BACKGROUND: The President has long advocated for adding a meaningful
          prescription drug benefit to the Medicare program. He discussed it in the 1992
          Campaign, included in the Health Security Act, and referenced it in his State of the Union
          Address -- in the context of broader Medicare refonn. Not only are prescription drugs an
          essential part of modem medicine, but providing coverage through Medicare is more
          efficient and equitable than today's inadequate, unstable, expensive patchwork payment
          system. Over 15 million Medicare beneficiaries have no coverage whatsoever and those
          with coverage are experiencing declines in benefits and increases in costs.


     Q:   When will the President introduce his plan and will his drug benefit resemble that
          being unveiled by Senator Kennedy today?

          The President is reviewing options on every element of Medicare reform. He has made
          no decisions at this time, but plans to release his proposal in time for the Congress to
          consider it this year. (If pushed, you can say weeks not months -- with an emphasis on
          the plural). The Medicare Prescription Drug Act includes several important elements
          designed to address short and long-tenn cost burdens faced by elderly, disabled and low
          income beneficiaries. We are reviewing it to detennine coverage adequacy,
          administrative feasibility, and affordability -- both to beneficiaries and to the Medicare
          program.
