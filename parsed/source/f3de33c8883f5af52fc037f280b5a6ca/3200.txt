TEXT:
Elena:

Please give either Emil Parker or me a call when you get the chance to
discuss the POTUS memo.  We want to be sure to (I) get you timely
information on Gene's thoughts regarding the community empowerment process
and (2) show a draft of the memo to Gene so that he can sign off.

Thanks very much.

Jon
