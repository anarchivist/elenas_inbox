I spoke with Dawn Chirwa in the counsel's office last night about this.
There is no meeting planned right now.  It sounds as if the ball is, for
the moment, in DOJ's court.  Next steps are for Walter Dellinger to have a
conversation with Judy Winston, after which DOJ will send a clarification
letter to ED and ED will send a clarification letter to TX.

Bill
