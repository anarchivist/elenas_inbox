TEXT:
thanks for the memo.  I have one question: does the memo mean we are not
going to do anything to collect data. And, if so, is the only reason we
are not doing this is because of the Republican react?    I understood
this to be the most important piece for labor/women--if we are not doing
it, what are we doing substantively. After reading the piece it seemed a
bit light to me for a VP announcement.
