                     Executive Order No.   *****
         Fairness in Law Enforcement:   Collection of Data

We all must work together to build the trust of all Americans in
law enforcement. We have great confidence in our federal law
enforcement officers and know that they strive to uphold the best
principles of law enforcement in our democratic society.

Stopping citizens on the basis of their race is not effective law
enforcement policy, and it is inconsistent with our commitment to
equal protection under the law for all persons. To begin addressing
the problem of racial profiling, it is essential to collect more
data at all levels of law enforcement to better define the scope
of the problem. Tracking the race, ethnicity, and gender of those
who are stopped or searched by law enforcement will help to determine
where and whether problems exist, and guide the development of
appropriate solutions.

WHEREAS the principles on which our Government is based require the
fair administration of law enforcement activities throughout the
Federal establishment, without discrimination because of race,
ethnicity, or gender; and

WHEREAS traffic stops, searches, and examinations of persons entering
the jurisdiction of the United States from other countries are vital
to federal law enforcement and to maintaining the integrity of our
borders;

WHEREAS the systematic collection of statistics and information
regarding federal law enforcement activities can increase the
fairness of our law enforcement practices;

NOW, THEREFORE, by the authority vested in me as President by the
Constitution and laws of the United States of America, including
[specific statutes provided by WH/OMB], it is hereby ordered as
follows:


Section 1.   Data Collection Field Tests

      (l)the Department of Justice,

system field test, including the law enforcement agency components,
sites, data sets, training, and other methods and procedures to be

sufficiently detailed to permit an analysis of actions relevant to
the activities of the included law enforcement agencies by race,
ethnicy, or gender.   Such actions may include traffic stops,

customarily conducted with entrants to the United States, requests
for consent to search, or warrantless searches.

recommendations for improving those programs, policies and
practices.

of the statistics and information collected during the first six
months of its field test to the Attorney General within 90 days of
the end of the first six month period. The report shall include
a summary of any civilian complaints received alleging bias based
on the race, ethnici ty or gender of the complainint in law enforcement
activities, the agency's process for investigating and resolving
such complaints, and the outcomes of any such investigations.

plan for extending the system to other components and locations in
his or her agency.  The report shall include a summary of any civilian
