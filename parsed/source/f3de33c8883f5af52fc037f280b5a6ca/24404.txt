TEXT:
We are looking to nail down a date for the 1999 State of the Union
speech.  The dates for previous State of the Union addresses were:

Tuesday,   January 25,   1994
Tuesday,   January 24,   1995
Tuesday,   January 23,   1996
Tuesday,   February 4,   1997
Tuesday,   January 27,   1998

The President is confirmed to greet the Pope on his arrival in St. Louis
on Tuesday, January 26, and the Vice President has been asked to greet the
Pope on his departure on Wednesday, January 27.

Therefore, we would like to look at the following dates as options for
this year's State of the Union address:

Tuesday, February 2, 1999
OR
Wednesday, February 3, 1999

Please note that the annual National Prayer Breakfast on Capitol Hill will
take place the morning of Thursday, February 4, 1999.

PLEASE EMAIL KARIN KULLMAN WITH ANY COMMENTS OR CONFLICTS WITH THIS DATEBY
COB TODAY.
  I.
