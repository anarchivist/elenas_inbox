Yes.  Politically neither the 6 months extension nor the below-50
employees extension is nearly as appealing as the
doctor-visit/teacher-conference extension.

One other wrinkle y'all ought to have on your radar screen: how 'bout
changing Unemployment Compensation to allow parents to collect
unemployment comp while they're out on FMLA leave?
