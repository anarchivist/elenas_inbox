TEXT:
       1. Safety Rhetoric. Here is a paragraph of saefty rhetoric, taken
almost
directly from the last radio adress.
"Child safety seats are the most effective safety device to
protect very young children.  In car crashes, they reduce the risk of
death or serious injury to infants by 70 percent.  They cut the fatality
and injury rate for children aged 1 to 4 in half.  But while all 50
states have car seat laws, studies show that 40 percent Of the time
young children do not even ride in safety seats; and even when they are
placed in child safety seats, 80 percent of the time children are either
not fully secured or the car seats are not properly attached."   [They are
misinstalled
over 70% of the time, "not fully secured or attached over 80%]


2.    Builds on the PresidentD,s Efforts to Protect Travelling Americans
This step is one of a series of actions by President Clinton to promote
safety on the road.  In May 1995, The Administration launched a
comprehensive plan to preserve the benefits of air bags while eliminating
their risks.  In June 1995 the President called on Congress to pass
legislation requiring all states to pass zero tolerance laws for youths
drinking and driving or risk losing highway funds.  Congress passed that
legislation, the President signed it, and today all states now have zero
tolerance laws.  In November 1998, the Administration announced a Blue
Ribbon Passenger Safety Panel that will recommend strategies to increase
the use of booster seats for children 4 to 8 years and the use of seat
belts for children 8 to 16 years.
