TEXT:
1. High school service scholars -- The President could announce that his
new High School Service Scholars has just completed a successful launch
year, and it is awarding 1,620 high school juniors or seniors a $1,000
college scholarship based on their exemplary community service. He can
also praise those who have provided the needed matching funds, including
Kiwanis, Rotary, PTAs, Minnesota state legislature, a foundation that paid
for all of San Francisco's, and Sallie Mae, which provided match for all DC
 schools. Attending the event would be students, sponsors, and
principals. The President could encourage even more schools to take
advantage of this next year, through a letter to high school principals
and superintendents.

This event could be ready right away.

2. Event to launch Administration's proposal to reauthorize
Corporation/AmeriCorps programs -- The President could probably launch
this new proposal as early as mid-July, with a bipartisan group of
supporters present. He could talk about AmeriCorps' successes and also
use the occasion to announce the granting of some new "scholarship-only"
AmeriCorps scholarships of the type announced at the Philadelphia summit.

Potential minuses:
Kennedy and Jeffords recommend waiting until September to avoid the debate
on the Hill on AmeriCorps appropriations, which will be very active in
July.  Al From and Harris Wofford feel that we should not let this dictate
the timing, and having both reauthorization and appropriations out at the
same time might work.
There will be 2 or 3 negative reports from the Corporation's Inspector
General during July, and
Rep. Hoekstra may seek an oversight hearing during the appropriations
fight.

There is some danger the actual legislative language won't be ready by
mid-July, but we could
go with a framework if necessary, if folks don't think that's too tacky.

3. Do an event with Powell and CEO's to emphasize there has been progress
made since the
summit in terms of more commitments. Powell's people wouldn't be ready


    for this in the next
    few weeks, but they recognize they need to get ready soon.   So this could
    be August.

    three on health too.  and if we had one or two on service, that wouldn't
    be bad.
