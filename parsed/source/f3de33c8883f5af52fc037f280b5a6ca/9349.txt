TEXT:
Jen suggested that I write up some details of the idea of a POTUS kids'
health outreach event that you discussed at the last Team Leaders'
meeting. Here, specifically, is what we might do:

1. Release first annual report on states' progress in implementing CHIP.
Expect to have 2.5 milliion kids covered by then; probably all but 5 to 8
states approved; will include in the report lots of local stories about
what states are doing.

2. Tentatively announce commitment by Americorps to help with children's
health outreach. Gene Sperling had suggested this and we are trying to
figure this out now.

3. Announce collaboration with NGA and America's Promise on
public-private media campaign.  We are running paid radio ads, including
one with the First Lady, in 9 states: Colorado, Delaware, Idaho, Indiana,
Massachusetts, Ohio, Okalahoma, Pennsylvania, and Utah.   This is
beginning in early October and running through mid-November, as a ramp-up
to a nationwide effort in January. We also have a TV spot with the First
Lady that we could show at the event, although we are not airing it until
January.

NGA definitely wants an event, but would rather have it in Delaware or
Pennsylvania than DC.  Tentatively think that they can get health
co-chairs: Carper and Levitt.    Not clear if Powell is interested in
attending. This event would have to be between October 1 and the 6th or
7th, since the radio ads begin running around October 1.

Thanks, Jeanne
