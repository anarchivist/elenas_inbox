            THURMAN A STRONG CHOICE TO LEAD OFFICE OF
                NATIONAL AIDS POLICY, HRC SAYS

           Combines Leadership Skills, Commitment, Access

WASHINGTON    The Human Rights Campaign commended the selection today of
Sandra
L. Thurman as the new White House "AIDS czar."


     "Sandra Thurman is a solid choice to take the Office of
National AIDS Policy to the next level," said Elizabeth Birch, HRC's
executive
director. "She brings the right mix of leadership, political skills and
commitment to the fight against HIV and AIDS."

     Winnie Stachelberg, HRC's legislative director, said Thurman has the
experience to design and execute the administration's programs in the
changing
struggle to end the HIV/AIDS epidemic.

     "Thurman was intricately involved in the creation and enactment of the
Ryan
White CARE Act in 1990 and its reauthorization in 1995," said Stachelberg,
who
is a member of
the executive committee of the. umbrella group National Organizations
Responding
to AIDS.   "She knows AIDS policy and politics from the inside--a critical
combination of skills for this job."

     Thurman becomes the third person to hold the position known
informally as
the national AIDS czar. She replaces Patsy Fleming, who stepped down after
President Clinton's re-election.

     Thurman, a native of Atlanta, is past executive director of AID
Atlanta,
the Southeast's first and largest AIDS service provider. Under her
stewardship,
AID Atlanta tripled in size, becoming a multimillion-dollar direct service
agency with 90 staffers and more than 1,000 volunteers, serving thousands
of
individuals and families with HIV and AIDS.

     Most recently, Thurman was a White House appointee to the U.S.
Information
Agency, responsible for cultural and professional exchange programs.

     Thurman has a history of political and public service. In 1996, she
held a
variety of positions with the Democratic National Committee and the
Clinton-Gore
re-election campaign.

     From 1993 to 1996, Thurman was director of advocacy programs at the
Task
Force for Child Survival and Development in Atlanta. The task force is
sponsored by such respected organizations as UNICEF, the World Health
Organization and the Rockefeller Foundation.

     Thurman's AIDS-related activities include serving on the Presidential
Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS; on the Georgia State AIDS Task Force; the
Fulton
County HIV Planning Council; and the executive committee of Cities
Advocating
Emergency AIDS Relief.  In addition, she has served on the board of
directors of
the National Episcopal AIDS Coalition, Sisterlove Inc. and the Atlanta AIDS
Interfaith Network. In 1995, Thurman testified


before Congress with Elizabeth Taylor on federal AIDS programs and
priorities.

     Before joining AID Atlanta in 1988, Thurman was public affairs
director for
AmeriPlan Health Services, Georgia's largest health maintenance
organization,
and as a job placement specialist working with ex-offenders at the Georgia
Department of Labor, Correctional Services Division. She holds a bachelor's
degree in human resources administration and management from Mercer
University
in Georgia.

     The Human Rights Campaign is the largest national lesbian and gay
political
organization, with members throughout the country. It effectively lobbies
Congress, provides campaign support and educates the public to ensure that
lesbian and gay Americans can be open, honest and safe at home, at work
and in
the community.
