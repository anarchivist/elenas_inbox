     TEXT:


Justice is requesting clearance of their previously circulated letter on
H.R. 22, the Postal Reform Act, without the second-to-Iast paragraph
commenting on the billD,s proposal to designate USTR as the u.s.
representative at meetings of the Universal Postal Union.  The letter was
circulated on July 10 under LRM MNB201.

Please advise no later than COB today whether you have any objections to
clearance of this letter.  If I do not hear from you, I will assume you
have no objection and will clear the document.

Please call (5-7887) if you have any comments or questions, or need a copy
of the letter. Thanks!
