TEXT:
Bruce, I've finally confirmed that the drop in births to unmarried women
is not new data.  Ironically, it's not even in the census report (sloppy
journalism). The 95 data showing a 4% drop was the first year it dropped
so this must be the same number you remember that we talked about before.
It was released in preliminary form in 10/96 and in a final vital
statistics report from NCHS in 6/97.

  Weekly:  I don't think I can do justice to POTUS question on areas where
  people are leaving the rolls without jobs in time for this week's weekly .
. Elena, it came up again in POTUS meeting yesterday with CEOs.  I'd done
  Q&A on Brookings report on caseload decline in cities but I;ve talked to
  them and they did not correlate with unemployment (as you suggested we
  should in your note to me yesterday Bruce).  It'll take a little doing to
  do that and I think it's worth doing--for states and cities both.   Instea
  d, I am doing a quick piece on reinvesting TANF savings, which he also
  talked about yesterday, based on Fiscal Survey of States released
  yesterday. will send along by 6 (cuz I need to leave then today) .
