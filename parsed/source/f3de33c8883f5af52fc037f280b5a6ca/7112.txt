Elena,

 FYI. Yesterday, I met with folks from the EEOC and WH Leg. Affairs
 (Tracey Thornton and Martha Foley) to discuss our legislative strategy for
 obtaining passage of the President's proposed increase in funding for the
 EEOC. According to both the EEOC and the Leg. folks some of his strings
 could prove contentious -- depending on the particulars of the language or
.commitments the Republicans want.  Martha expressed concern that the
 Republicans might want to include limitations on the ability of the agency
 to bring certain kinds of cases, etc. EEOC staff is meeting with Rogers
 and Fawell's staff (and possibly some Dems) on Friday to better determine
 where they are headed. After that meeting, we should know more.

Julie
