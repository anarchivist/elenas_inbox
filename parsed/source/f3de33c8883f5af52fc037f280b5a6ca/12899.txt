      TEXT:
      Bob o 'Harrow, the Washington Post reporter who is most closely following
      the privacy debate is working on an extended piece about the conflict
      between our database network for deadbeat parents and our effort to
      protect people's private financial information.

      Here's how the story goes. He has been in touch with our Office of Child
      Support Enforcement, which is building the database of information to help
      track down deadbeat parents. He claims their operation is very
      far-reaching.  They have names, SS #'s, and wage reports for virtually-
      every working American; these records are currently matched against
      outstanding child support orders.  This database is also about to
      incorporate information from virtually every bank and mutual fund in the
      country about existing accounts. O'Harrow ackowledges that this database
      is very effective and the additional financial info will make it even more
      so.

      What he is concerned about is how this stacks up against our commitment to
      protecting financial privacy. O'Harrow thinks this is probably the
.   ,

    largest data collection operation in the last 50 years and the largest
    hi-tech surveillance operation ever. We have put a heavy emphasis on
    notice, opt-ins and choice in financial records, yet few Americans realize
    that their wage (and soon their bank and mutual fund records) are being
    routinely cross-checked in this way.  the only real notice has been in the
    Federal Register.

    Anyway, he wants some official government (White House) reaction this
    week.  I don't know who is the definitive point person on this issue, but
    let me know how we should proceed. O'Harrow's stories tend to get pretty
    prominent placement, and we should make sure we have a tight response.
