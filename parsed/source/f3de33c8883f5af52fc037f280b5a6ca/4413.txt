TEXT:
Geri Pallast raised an interesting idea last week. She says that in her
conversations with mayors and local officials she has repeatedly been
asked whether there's a guidebook of   federal programs and resources
available for welfare reform which would include information from all the
major agencies.  Perhaps I could find someone willing to put something
together that we could review, perhaps under the rubric of the VP's
Coalition to Sustain Success. Do you think this is worth exploring?
