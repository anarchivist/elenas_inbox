TEXT:
Elena,
I just got off the phone with James Costello from the Justice Dept. They
would like to get something from us that describes our process and
conclusions to prepare the Commissioner for her March 31st oversight
hearing.

Justice is also contemplating putting together a report from the AG to
Congress, pursuant to the 1998 appropriations language that required the
AG to report back by April 1st on the CIR recommendations, and may want to
use this communication to assist in writing this report.   I had understood
that the Commissioner's testimony would serve as the required "report" to
Congress, but Costello thinks that the AG may be contemplating something
more.

We have not yet decided what form our communication to the AG re:
conclusions from our review should take. Is it a memo from Bruce to the
AG? Or something more informal? How should we proceed with this?
Thanks.

julie
