JONES PUSHES HEALTH CARE BENEFITS
FOR HETEROSEXUAL LIVE-IN COUPLES    [Excerpt]
by Chinta Strausberg
    Seeking fairness for all city workers, Ald. Virgil Jones (15th) Thursday
began lobbying for passage of a bill that would allow heterosexual city
couples who live together to obtain health benefits just as their same-sex
peers.
    Jones said his bill, when passed, would amend the same sex Domestic
Partner Act that allows gay and lesbian city worker[s] to have city health
insurance.
    Ald. Jones said many women "take care of a man's children and that's an
honorable profession being a homemaker.    That's a job in itself and if you
have that kind of job, don't you think they should receive some kind of
benefits?"
    Jones said all children "are born of a legitimate, not illegitimate act"
and denied he and the other aldermen are promoting immorality by pushing
the
legislation.
    "We have to wait and see the financial impact and whether there's any
litigation that's filed" from the passage of a similar bill for gay and
lesbian city workers who are living together, Finance Chairman Aids. Edward
M. Burke (14th) said.
    "When African Americans did not choose to marry and lived common-law, we
still acquired (joint) bank accounts and charge cards, but they still did
not
allow us to get insurance with that city employee," Ald. Carrie Austin
 (34th)
said.
    "If you're going to allow city health benefits for same-sex partners,
then
it's only fair to allow it for unmarried heterosexual couples."
    Austin said when she got remarried she "went through heck and high
<


    water"
    with the administration to get her husband on her insurance, including a
    brief interruption of coverage.
        "Why should I have to go through all that when they (same-sex partners)
    only have to sign an affidavit?" Austin queried.
        "I think we should have universal healthcare, " Ald. Walter Burnett Jr.
    (27th) said, adding that in the interim, allowing city health benefits
    should
    be afforded unmarried heterosexual couples.
        He denied the aldermen would be sending the wrong message to children if
    this bill is approved. Burnett said the issue is a "double-edged sword.
        "It's prevalent in the African American community ... a lot of people
    stay
    together, take care of each other, but don't get married," Burnett stated.
     "A lot of women in our community have children from other relationships
    and
    fathers aren't around. They're dead, in jail."
