TEXT:
As I raised this morning, there appears to be an increase of startling
proportions in teen suicides in many segments of the population.  This has
been a longstanding problem in Indian country, where the suicide death
rate for 15 to 24 year olds is 2.4 times the corresponding rate for U.S.
all races--it 'is 31.7 per 100,000 compared to 13.0. There has been a
recent epidemic at Standing Rock Reservation that skews this figure.

In addition, we've seen the reports in the papers of a dramatic increase
in suicide among African-American teen-agers. In 19801, the suicide rate
for young whites was 157% greater than it was for young blacks.  Today,
it's 42% greaters.  The suicide rate of African Americans between the
ages of 10 and 19 has increased by 114% since 1980, according to the
report done by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  The rate
in southern states of young blacks has grown by 214%.

Yesterday, we saw in the New York Times, the story about the rash of
suicides among young people in Pierre, So. Dakota.    They are experiencing
a rate 13 times the national rate among white teens .

. From time to time, we have seen dramatic increases in white middle class
  teen suicides during very tough times.  In the economic downturn of the
  80's, there was a large increase on campuses in Iowa--kids of farm
 ,families that were losing the family farms.  But today, with good
  times--it's puzzling and troubling.

I'd like to propose that we take action on this--both as public policy
and part of the Race Initiative.  I think an event with the President and
families in which he asks the appropriate Federal agencies to undertake an
in-depth look at this problem and report back to him would be both a
compassionate and important activity.  I suspect that the answers are not
the same for the different ethnic/racial groups, but the questions
certainly bear asking.


Please let me know what you think, and how we might proceed.
