TEXT:
I believe the best approach at this point is to advise Tom that it
would be inconsistent with our policy on agency contacts for the
White House to have any discussions with the Justice Department
 (including a local u.S. Attorney's office) about this matter. At
the same time, you should note that while CEQ is in the EOP, it is
not part of the White House, and therefore is not Subject to our
policy. Tom would need to determine with CEQ counsel whether the
proposed contact is appropriate under their policy.   I think it is
important that CEQ's status as a separate agency be recognized in
all that we do. Thanks.
