TEXT:
Gov Carnahan will be in DC on May 24 and wants to see both HHS and WH
officials on the provider tax issue.  I think he would be satisfied with
an HHS mtg only if it was senior (Shalala or Thurm ).

I think we can't say no to this .... but I also don't sense that we know
specifically what we will say to him.
