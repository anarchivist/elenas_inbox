Mr. Chairman, and Members of the Committee:'

          As you know, in 1989 the Supreme Court held in Texas v. Johnson! that a state could

not, consistent with the First Amendment, enforce a statute criminalizing flag desecration

against a demonstrator who burned an American flag.               In 1990, in United States v. Eichman/

the Court held that the First Amendment prohibited the conviction of demonstrators for flag

burning under a federal statute that criminalized mutilating, defacing, or physically defiling an

American flag.



     · In 1995, Walter Dellinger, Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legal Counsel, provided substantially
similar testimony to the Subcommittee on the Constitution, Federalism, and Property Rights of the United States
Senate Judiciary Committee regarding S.J. Res. 31, A Bill Proposing an Amendment to the Constitution of the
United States to Grant Congress and the States the Power to Prohibit the Physical Desecration of the Flag of the
United States.

                                                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion


         For nine years, then, the flag has been left without any statutory protection against

desecration. For nine years, one thing, and only one thing, has stood between the flag and its

routine desecration: the fact that the flag, as a potent symbol of all that is best about our

country, is justly cherished and revered by nearly all Americans. Chairman Hatch has

eloquently described the flag's status among the American people:

        The American flag represents in a way nothing else can, the common bond

        shared by a very diverse people. Yet whatever our differences of party,

        politics, philosophy, race, religion, ethnic background, economic status, social

        status, or geographic region, we are united as Americans. That unity is

        symbolized by a unique emblem, the American flag. 3

        It is precisely because of the meaning the flag has for virtually all Americans that the

last nine years have witnessed no outbreak of flag burning, but only a few isolated instances.

If proof were needed, we have it now:         with or without the threat of criminal penalties, the

flag is amply protected by its unique stature as an embodiment of national unity and ideals.

        It is against this background that one must assess the need for a proposed constitutional

amendment (S.J. Res. 14) that would provide Congress with the "power to prohibit," and

presumably impose criminal punishment for, the "physical desecration" of the American flag.

The amendment, if passed, would for the first time in our history limit the Bill of Rights

adopted over two centuries ago. It would thus run counter to our traditional resistance, dating

back to the time of the Founders, to resorting to the amendment process. And it would do so

to restrict the liberties that the Bill of Rights currently protects. Whether other truly exigent

circumstances justify altering the Bill of Rights is a question we can put to one side here.     For

you are asked to assume the risk inherent in crafting a first-time exception to the Bill of Rights

in the absence of any meaningful evidence that the flag is in danger of losing its symbolic

value. Moreover, the amendment before you would create legislative power of uncertain

dimension to override the First Amendment and other constitutional guarantees.          For these

reasons, the proposed amendment -- and any other proposal to amend the Constitution in order

to punish a few isolated acts of flag burning -- should be rejected by this Congress.

                                                  I.

       At the outset, I would like to emphasize that the Administration's views on the wisdom

of the proposed amendment does not in any way reflect a lack of appreciation for the proper

place of the flag in our national community. The President always has and always will

condemn in the strongest of terms those who would denigrate the symbol of our Country's

highest ideals.

       The President's record reflects his long-standing commitment to protection of the

American flag, and his profound abhorrence of flag burning and other forms of flag

desecration. In 1989, after the Supreme Court invalidated the Texas statute at issue in

Johnson, then-Governor Clinton responded promptly by recommending enactment of a new

state law prohibiting all intentional destruction of a flag.   The President worked hard to craft

legislation that would survive Supreme Court review, and his view was that the statute was

consistent with the First Amendment. As you know, however, the Supreme Court's

subsequent decision in Eichman, invalidating the federal Flag Protection Act, appears to

                                                - 3-           DRAFT March 10, 2010 (8:51AM)
                                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion

foreclose legislative efforts to prohibit flag burning. In the wake of Johnson, then-Governor

Clinton also instituted a state-wide "flag respect" program to teach school children proper

appreciation for the flag. Working with veterans groups in Arkansas, Governor Clinton

created a program that went on to win awards from the Veterans of Foreign Wars and the

Vietnam Veterans of America.



                                                    II.

         The text of the proposed amendment is short enough to quote in full:      "The Congress

shall have power to prohibit the physical desecration of the flag of the United States. ,,4 The

scope of the amendment, however, is anything but clear. Because the proposed amendment

fails to state explicitly the degree to which it overrides other constitutional guarantees, it is

entirely unclear how much of the Bill of Rights it would trump.

         By its terms, the proposed amendment does no more than confer affirmative power

upon Congress and the States to legislate with respect to the flag.    Its wording is similar to the

power-conferring clauses found in Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution:      "Congress shall

have power to lay and collect taxes," for instance, or "Congress shall have power ... to

regulate commerce ... among the several states." Like those powers, and all powers granted

government by the Constitution, the authority given by the proposed amendment would seem

to be limited by the Bill of Rights and the Fourteenth Amendment.




    4   SJ. Res. 14. See also HJ. Res. 33 (same).


                                                    -4-       DRAFT March 10,2010 (8:51AM)
                                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion

         The text of the proposed amendment does not purport to exempt the exercise of the

power conferred from the constraints of the First Amendment or any other constitutional

guarantee of individual rights. Read literally, the amendment would not alter the result of the

decisions in Eichman or Johnson, holding that the exercise of congressional and state power to

protect the symbol of the flag is subject to First and Fourteenth Amendment limits. Rather,

by its literal text, it would simply and unnecessarily make explicit the governmental power to

legislate in this area that always has been assumed to exist.

         To give the amendment meaning, then, we must read into it, consistent with its

sponsors' intent, at least some restriction on the First Amendment freedoms identified in the

Supreme Court's flag decisions. What is profoundly difficult is identifying just how much of

the First Amendment and the rest of the Bill of Rights is superseded by the amendment. Once

we have departed, by necessity, from the proposed amendment's text, we are in uncharted

territory, and faced with genuine uncertainty as to the extent to which the amendment will

displace the protections enshrined in the Bill of Rights.

         We do not know, for instance, whether the proposed amendment is intended, or would

be interpreted, to authorize enactments that otherwise would violate the due process "void for

vagueness" doctrine. In Smith v. Goguen,5 the Court reversed the conviction of a defendant

who had sewn a small flag on the seat of his jeans, holding that a state statute making it a

crime to "treat contemptuously" the flag was unconstitutionally vague. We cannot be certain




    5   415 U.S. 566 (1974).


                                               - 5-             DRAFT March 10,2010 (8:51AM)
                                                                                      eX-Dump Conve.'sion

that the vagueness doctrine applied in Smith would limit as well prosecutions brought under

laws enacted pursuant to the proposed amendment.

         Nor is this a matter of purely hypothetical interest, unlikely to have much practical

import. The amendment, after all, authorizes laws that prohibit "physical desecration" of the

flag, and "desecration" is not a term that readily admits of objective definition. On the

contrary, "desecrate" is defined to include such inherently subjective meanings as "profane"

and even "treat contemptuously" itself. Thus, a statute tracking the language of the

amendment and making it a crime to "physically desecrate" an American flag would suffer

from the same defect as the statute at issue in Smith:   it would "fail[] to draw reasonably clear

lines between the kinds of nonceremonial treatment that are criminal and those that are not. ,,6

                                               - 6-          DRAFT March 10, 2010 (8:51 AM)
                                                                                         Hex-Dump Conversion

         The term "flag of the United States" is similarly "unbounded, ,,7 and by itself provides

no guidance as to whether it reaches unofficial as well as official flags, or pictures or

representations of flags created by artists as well as flags sold or distributed for traditional

display. Indeed, testifying in favor of a similar amendment in 1989, then-Assistant Attorney

General William Barr acknowledged that the word "flag" is so elastic that it can be stretched to

cover everything from cloth banners with the characteristics of the official flag, as defined by .

statute,8 to "any picture or representation" of a flag, including "posters, murals, pictures, [and]

buttons" .9 And while a statute enacted pursuant to the amendment could attempt a limiting

definition, it need not do so; the amendment would authorize as well a statute that simply

prohibited desecration of "any flag of the United States." Again, such a statute would

implicate the vagueness doctrine applied in Smith, and raise in any enforcement action the

question whether the empowering amendment overrides due process guarantees.

         Even if we are prepared to assume, or the language of the amendment is modified to

make clear, that the proposed amendment would operate on the First Amendment alone,

important questions about the amendment's scope remain. Specifically, we still face the

question whether the powers to be exercised under the amendment would be freed from all, or

only some, First Amendment constraints, and, if the latter, how we will know which

constraints remain applicable.

          An example may help to illuminate the significance of this issue. In R.A.V. v. City of

St. Paul,lO decided in 1992, the Supreme Court held that even when the First Amendment

permits regulation of an entire category of speech or expressive conduct, it does not

necessarily permit the government to regulate a subcategory of the otherwise proscribable

speech on the basis of its particular message. A government acting pursuant to the proposed

amendment would be able to prohibit all flag desecration,ll but, ifR.A.V. retains its force in

this context, a government could not prohibit only those instances of flag desecration that

communicated a particularly disfavored view; statutes making it a crime -- or an enhanced

penalty offense -- to "physically desecrate a flag of the United States in opposition to United

States military actions," for instance, would presumably remain impermissible.

          This result obtains, of course, if and only if the proposed amendment is understood to

confer powers that are limited by the R.A. V. principle. If, on the other hand, the proposed

amendment overrides the whole of the First Amendment, or overrides some select though

unidentified class of principles within which R.A. V. falls, then there remains no constitutional

objection to the hypothetical statute posited above. This is a distinction that makes a

difference, as I hope this example shows, and it should be immensely troubling to anyone


     10   112 S. Ct. 2538 (1992).

      1\ Even a statute that prohibited all flag desecration would be in tension with the principle of R.A. V.

Although a few acts done with a flag could be considered a "desecration" in all contexts, that would not be the
case with burning, for example. Only some burnings could be prohibited by statutes adopted under the proposed
amendment. Respectful burning of the flag will remain legal after the amendment's adoption as before. See 36
U .S.C. § l76(k) ("The flag, when it is in such condition that it is no longer a fitting emblem for display, should
be destroyed in a dignified way, preferably by burning. "). What may be prohibited is only that destruction of a
flag that communicates a particular message, one of disrespect or contempt. The conclusion that a particular act
of burning is a "desecration" may require in most instances consideration of the particular message being
conveyed.

considering the amendment that its text leaves us with no way of knowing whether the rule of

R.A.V. -- or any other First Amendment principle -- would limit governmental action if the

amendment became part of the Constitution. 12

         I have real doubts about whether these interpretive concerns could be resolved fully by

even the most artful of drafting. In my view, any effort to constitutionalize an "exception" to

the Bill of Rights necessarily will produce significant interpretive difficulties and uncertainty,

as the courts attempt to reconcile a specific exception with the general principles that remain. 13

But even assuming, for the moment, that all of the interpretive difficulties of this amendment

could be cured, it would remain an ill-advised departure from a constitutional history marked

by a deep reluctance to amend our most fundamental law.                  The Bill of Rights was ratified in

1792. Since that time, over two hundred years ago, the Bill of Rights has never once been

amended. And this is no historical accident, nor a product only of the difficulty of the

amendment process itself. Rather, our historic unwillingness to tamper with the Bill of Rights




      12 Another proposed amendment, contained in H.J. Res. 5, provides: "The Congress and the States shall
have power to prohibit the act of desecration of the flag of the United States and to set criminal penalties for that
act." Not only does the phrase "act of desecration" appear to be broader, and more vague, than the term
"physical desecration" in S.l. Res. 14 and H.J. Res. 33, but H.J. Res. 5 also grants the power of prohibition to
the fifty states and an uncertain number of local governments. That raises, of course, the interpretive question
whether state legislatures acting under the amendment would remain bound by state constitutional free speech
guarantees, or whether the proposed amendment would supersede state as well as federal constitutional.

reflects a reverence for the Constitution that is both entirely appropriate and fundamentally at

odds with turning that document into a forum for divisive political battles.

         The Framers themselves understood that resort to the amendment process was to be

sparing and reserved for "great and extraordinary occasions. ,,14 In The Federalist Papers,

James Madison warned against using the amendment process as a device for correcting every

perceived constitutional defect -- a practice that could not help but undermine the role of the

Supreme Court. 15 Of particular interest here, Madison objected especially to amendment on

issues that inflamed public passion, fearing that such actions might threaten "the constitutional

equilibrium of the government. ,,16

         The proposed amendment cannot be reconciled with this fundamental and historic

understanding of the integrity of the Constitution. I think perhaps Charles Fried, who served

with distinction as Solicitor General under President Reagan, made the point best when he

testified against a similar proposed amendment in 1990:

        The flag, as all in this debate agree, symbolizes our nation, its history, its

        values. We love the flag because it symbolizes the United States; but we must

        love the Constitution even more, because the Constitution is not a symbol. It is

        the thing itself. 17

                                                    IV.

        Americans are free today to display the flag respectfully, to ignore it entirely, or to use

it as an expression of protest or reproach. By overwhelming numbers, Americans have

chosen the first option, and display the flag proudly. And what gives this gesture its unique

symbolic meaning is the fact that the choice is freely made, uncoerced by the government.

Were it otherwise -- were, for instance, respectful treatment of the flag the only choice

constitutionally available -- then the respect paid the flag by millions of Americans would mean

something different and perhaps something less.
