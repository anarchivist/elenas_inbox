TEXT:
NEC wants to make sure everyone is comfortable with the paragraph in the
Labor letter on the Worker Paycheck Fairness Act discussing the bill's
financial reporting and disclosure provisions.  The concern is that the
Administration may be vulnerable to criticism for applying a different
standard on disclosure and reporting to unions than it does in the context
of campaign finance reform.

The paragraph in question reads as follows:

"The bill would also impose burdensome new financial reporting and
disclosure requirements on unions, by amending the Labor-Management
Reporting and Disclosure Act.  In 1993, the Department of Labor rescinded
comparable regulations, because they would have imposed unwarranted costs
on labor unions (particularly labor organizations), without providing
corresponding benefits to union members. Under current law, workers who
object to paying full dues under a union-security clause are already
entitled to union financial information, under procedures that do not
burden labor unions unnecessarily. "
