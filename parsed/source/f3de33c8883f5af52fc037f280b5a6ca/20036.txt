TEXT:
At this point, it sounds'like Eli and Shalala will be available for
briefing press on event. We're trying to get Herman to be there--she had
planned to do press roundtable with grantees back at DOL.  It would be
good for her to be here since she's best person to talk about WTW grants.
Is it possible that Elena could be available for briefing since Bruce
isn't?
