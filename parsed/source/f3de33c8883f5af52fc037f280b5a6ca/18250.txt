TEXT:
Do either of you have a copy of the holiday schedules we submitted to
Cathy several weeks ago? Donna Geisbert, the new assistant for welfare
and health teams, started today, and it would be helpful for her to know
schedules for the health folks.  She's sitting in Room 216 and can access
Chris Jennings email there, but I don't believe she's gotten her own
account yet.  If you send me information I'd be glad to give it to her.
