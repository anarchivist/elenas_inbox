Here is the latest version of the operative policy grafs.     Can you give
them a look? thanks.   paul and june


The greatest and most obvious of these is time.  In our round-the world,
round-the-clock economy, there just donD,t seem to be enough hours in the
day for parents to do everything they need to at home and at work. I am
proud that the first bill I ever signed into law was the Family and
Medical Leave Act.  Since 1993, millions of Americans have used it to take
up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave to care for a newborn or sick relative
without losing their jobs.  But the current law meets just a fraction of
the need. Too many people and too many family obligations are not covered
by this law. And too many families cannot take advantage of the law at
all because they simply cannot survive without their paychecks.

We must think bigger. On the eve of the 21st Century, let us set a goal
that all working Americans can take the time they need to care for their
families without losing the income they need to support their
families.

This would mark a significant shift in how our nation helps families
succeed at home and at work.  It will require enormous thought, creativity
-- and a willingness to experiment.   It must be done in a way that gives
families flexibility, and promotes a dynamic and growing economy.

Today, using my executive authority as President, I am taking important
steps toward these goals.  I am directing the Office of Personnel
Management to allow all federal workers to use the sick leave they have
earned for themselves to take time off to care for their sick family
members. Currently, the most sick leave a worker can use in these cases
is 13 days. With the new policy I am proposing today, federal employees
will be able to take up to 12 weeks paid sick leave to nurse an ailing
child or parent back to health.

Just as the federal government was the first major employer to desegregate
its workplaces, today, our government can blaze a path toward paid family


leave that the private sector can follow.   If every company in America
that offers sick leave to its workers adopted the policy we are adopting
today, TK percent of all American families would have this important
benefit.
We must find other creative new ways to help more working Americans use
benefits they already have to finance the time off they need for their
families.  Several states have asked the federal government if it would be
possible to try a bold experiment: Allow employees to draw unemployment
insurance payments while they are off work caring for a newborn.   This is
a promising experiment. Today, I am directing the Secretary of Labor to
take the first steps toward allowing states to conduct this experiment.   I
am asking the Secretary to craft regulations and model legislation that
will enable states to put the unemployment insurance system at the service
of new parents, in ways that do not undermine the fiscal soundness of the
system or undue burdens on business.
