TEXT:
I wanted to check in with you guys about the message for the California
trip next week.  I believe our final California message meeting with
happen later today.  The advance team is leaving tomorrow for California,
so we need to make a decision soon.

I believe the current state of play was to do guns in San Francisco (Brady
regs and Feinstein anti-clip legislation) and an event supportive of the
tobacco tax/child care initiative in LA.

Other options that I am aware of include:          food safety, signing the
credit union legislation, safe drinking water.

Elena -- what are you views on the tobacco/child care initiative?        Are
you guys okay with that? thanks.

So -- how are you feeling about doing tobacco/child care in LA?
