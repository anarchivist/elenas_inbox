  also suggested that they create materials resulting from these panels that could be geared

      Lewis, Paul Begala, Stacie Spector, Stephanie Streett, and Jennifer Palmieri to discuss the
      President's race-related activities for November and the 12/3 town hall meeting. Among
      the issues discussed were:

             Sometime in November the President meeting with cable industry leadership,
             brought together by Bob Johnson, to discuss and announce two projects--a late
             February Presidential or Vice Presidential Town Hall meeting which would be
             produced by BET and telecast simultaneously by all cable networks, and a series
             of specialized programs on race to be telecast by individual cable networks;

             The activities proposed by the Youth Working Group--Ietter from the President,
             radio address, PSA's, briefing for non-traditional press--will all be focused around
             the 12/3 Presidential Town Hall meeting. Furthermore, an optional format
             discussed for the Town Hall meeting is to pattern it after the Little Rock
             Economic Summit. Under that option a panel of authors with diverse .views
             would be invited to participate along with a panel of young people. The venue
             would be a college campus in the midwest or southwest and there would a
             possibility of Vice-Presidential participation, as well.
