                                         January 28, 1998 (Draft)


     MEMORANDUM FOR THE CHIEF OF STAFF

     FROM:                 BRUCE REED
                           ELENA KAGAN
                              TOM FREEDMAN

     RE:                         Tobacco Strategy Update

             This memo updates the status of our strategy for the enactment of comprehensive tobacco
     legislation as called for by the President on September 17th and reaffirmed in his 1998 State of
     the Union address.

     I.     BACKGROUND

             The Administration is in a good position, despite some obstacles, to push tobacco
     legislation through Congress over the next year. When the President announced the five key
     elements in his plan for comprehensive tobacco legislation on September 17, 1997, he brought
     together support from the public health community, attorneys general, and many members of
     Congress. The President placed himself in a solid strategic position to aid Congress without
     having a specific Administration legislative product that would be a target-for diversionary
     tactics by opponents.

             For a number of reasons, the Administration continues to have strong leverage in shaping
     and enacting tobacco legislation. First, there continues to be bipartisan political recognition that
     the American public wants tough action to limit smoking. Second, the President continues to be
     the most powerful and popular voice against the tobacco industry and in support of the public
     health community. Finally, a number of legislative proposals and players are competing with
     each other in Congress, suggesting that the Administration has the ability to negotiate among the
     proposals to create a compromise we support. The legislation currently underway includes a
     Democratic leadership bill being formulated by Senator Conrad, a Republican leadership process
     under the direction of Senator Nickles, specific tobacco bills already introduced by Senators
     Kennedy, Ford, and Hatch among others, and hearings set by many committee chairs.

              Since September, we have maintained contact with parties on all sides of the issue,
     including members of Congress, industry representatives, and representatives of the health
     community, assuring them of the Administration's commitment to passing bipartisan, effective,
     legislation. In addition, the Administration has provided technical support for drafting
     legislation to any member of Congress who has requested it.




                                                                      Automated Records Management System
                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion
congressional agenda and the Administration will face several emerging obstacles and
opportunities. Challenges to the Administration's position will likely come from factions on
both the right and left: the right (Lott and McCain}will argue that the Administration has failed
to provide a complete proposal, the left will suggest either there should be no legislation because
documents reveal the industry's moral turpitude or that legislation shouldn't contain any liability
protections for industry-- likely killing the possibility of passing a bill.

         Nonetheless, we believe chances for passage of an effective bill remain good. The
Administration can quiet criticism thaUt is not doing enough to promote passage of legislation
by upgrading the President's visibility on the issue and engaging in serious negotiations with
Senate Republicans (many of whom are allies ofLott and genuinely want a bill). Arguments
against a bill from the left will eventually be defeated by the health rationale of the legislation--
this is a unique opportunity to help lengthen the lives of over 300,000 children a year.
Ultimately, opinion leaders in the field such as Dr. Koop and Dr. Kessler, who stood with the
President in his call for legislation on September 17th, recognize the great value and need for
effective comprehensive legislation.

       There will soon be an opportunity to move to more active participation in the legislative
process and improve the chances for passage of effective legislation. Legislation by Senate
Democrats and Republicans is beginning to take shape, and Senator McCain will be holding
hearings and raising questions about relevant Administration positions. In order to answer these
questions, take advantage of the competition among congressional bills, and maintain
Presidential momentum we recommend the following strategic steps.

II.     NEXT STEPS

A.       Presidential Events
         To maintain his leverage as the key advocate for change, it is important the President take
a visible role highlighting newsworthy tobacco issues. The President's comments and radio
address on the release oftobacco documents, as well as his State ofthe Union speech, were noted
by health groups, the news media, and Congress. We recommend three events over the next two
months to demonstrate continued Presidential leadership on the issue. [Insert three ideas here]
First, a town hall meeting on tobacco issues including children, researchers, health advocates like
Dr. Koop, and farmers. Second, a Presidential endorsement of legislation that has
tobacco-related effects-- such as provisions regarding international cooperation on the issue or
indoor air quality legislation. Finally, a Presidential invitation to Congressional leaders to return
to the White House to update him on progress that has been made on the issue since their last
meeting.
B.       Congressional Strategy
         We have been following a four-stage legislative strategy: (1) laying out the President's
principles; (2) reassuring congressional leadership of our interest in bipartisan legislation and
providing technical assistance; (3) helping to shape legislation and working to form bipartisan
consensus; and finally (4) openly intervening on behalf of certain bills and provisions and
working for enough votes for passage.
assistance of stage two into the more active role of stage three working with leaders on the issue
to form bipartisan consensus. To accomplish this we will be meeting separately this week with
the staff of Senators Conrad and Nickles. In each case, we hope to encourage them to create
legislation that meets the tough goals of the President's plan, but does not rule out liability
protections or raise the cost of legislation so as to make passage impossible. Senator Conrad is
circulating specific plans for legislation already and several Republican Senators in addition to
Nickles (Hatch, McCain, Chafee) are pushing for movement. We believe sometime in the next
month it would be appropriate for the President to invite congressional leaders back to the White
House to put increased pressure on this process, demonstrate his own commitment to this issue,
and create a public timetable for Congress to consider legislation.

       In late February and early March it seems likely that there will be a need for the White
Houseto become more directly involved in negotiations, perhaps forming a working group with
appropriate Hill leadership and inviting them to working meetings in the White House.

C.      Internal Structure
        Currently, the primary tobacco planning process is via the Tobacco Strategy Group.
Bruce Reed chairs the regular Thursday meetings which include representatives from HHS,
VPOTUS, OPL, CEA, Legislative Affairs, Treasury, USDA, and DOl. The function of the
group is to coordinate planning including resolution of policy issues such as Medicaid funds for
states, Hill briefings and testimony by agencies, and press and event opportunities. The DPC also
holds bi-weekly meetings with theVice-President's stafffor event scheduling and strategy. In
addition there are regular meetings with Mike Moore's group including Moore, Scruggs, Myers,
and Coale.

        Beginning next month, we plan to broaden the Tobacco Working Group to include
representatives of Legislative Affairs and the Communications' offices.
