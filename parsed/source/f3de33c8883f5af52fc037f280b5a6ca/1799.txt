    MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

    THROUGH:                       ERSKINE BOWLES

    FROM:                          MARIA ECHA VESTE

    SUBJECT:                       FDR MEMORIAL CONTROVERSY - STATUS REPORT


    On May 2, you will speak at the FDR Memorial dedication ceremony. The disability
    community, dissatisfied that the Memorial fails to depict FDR in a wheelchair, is planning
    a protest at the ceremony.

    Following a March 24 decision memo that recommended calling upon the FDR Memorial
    Commission to incorporate into the Memorial an additional sculpture of FDR in his
    wheelchair, Erskine called Senator Inouye, Chairman of the FDR Memorial Commission,
    to discuss our position. After Senator Inouye disapproved of having the Commission
    modify the Memorial, we consulted with the Department ofInterior and determined that
    only Congress, through legislation, has the authority to modify the Memorial.

    We are planning several steps to defuse the controversy. First, after we place a courtesy
    call to Senator Inouye informing him of our actions, we plan to begin a dialogue with
    Senator Harkin (D-IA) and Cleland (D-GA) on introducing legislation to modify the
    Memorial. We will then accept a request from leaders of the disability community to
    discuss this issue at the White House with senior staff. At this meeting, we will
    communicate our support for efforts in Congress to modify the Memorial. We will also
    release a Presidential statement prior to the
    May 2 ceremony endorsing an additional Memorial sculpture of FDR in his wheelchair.

    This week, we received a statement from sixteen of FDR's grandchildren calling for, "a permanent,
    meaningful portrayal in the Memorial of FDR's disability." President Bush, President Carter, and
    President Ford have written to expressed their support for depicting FDR in his wheelchair.
