TEXT:
The McCain bill ends local lawsuits with the tobacco industry without
including local governments as beneficiaries of industry payments.  In
addition, the bill does not repeal current law which prohibits state and
local governments from enacting tougher advertising restrictions.  However
the bill allows state and locals to enact tougher access restrictions.
