             10 KEY EXECUTIVE ORDERS, MEMORANDUMS, AND PROCLAMATIONS
                                       1996-1998


       1.      Protecting Patients' Rights. Executive Memorandum, February 20, 1998. Directed
       Secretaries of Defense, Labor, Health and Human Services, Veterans Affairs, and the Director of
       the Office of Personnel Management to ensure that all Federal health plans, which serve over 85
       million Americans, come into substantial compliance with the recommended protections in the
       Health Care Consumer Bill of Rights ("Patient Bill of Rights").

       2.      Creating A National Monument. Proclamation, September 18, 1996. President Clinton
       created by proclamation the Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument in Utah, thereby
       protecting 1.7 million acres of spectacular red rock canyon lands, artifacts from three ancient
       cultures, and the most remote site in the lower 48 states.

       3.     Banning Imported Assault Weapons. Executive Memorandum, November 14, 1997. In
       response to this memorandum, the President announced in April 1998 that the Treasury
       Department had found that more than 50 kinds of modified assault weapons are generally not
       importable because they accept large capacity military magazines. Up to 1.5 million rifles
       whose importation had been temporarily suspended may be affected this decision.

       4.     Increasing Child Support. Executive Memorandum, June 18, 1996. Strengthened child
       support operations by toughening paternity establishment requirements for applicants for welfare
       and by enabling states to locate, and withhold wages from, obligors who have taken a job in
       another state -- reforms that became law along with other tough new rules as part of welfare
       reform. The Clinton Administration collected a record $12 billion in child support in 1996
       through tougher enforcement, an increase of $4 billion, or nearly 50%, since 1992.      In 1996,
       the number of child support cases with collections also rose to 4 million, an increase of 43%,
       from 2.8 million in 1992.

       5.    Protecting Children from Handguns. Executive Memorandum, March 5, 1997.
       Required that a child safety lock device be issued to every Federal employee who carries a
       firearm on official duty. By October 1997, all federal agencies with law enforcement agents
       reported that they were in compliance with the President's directive, including approximately
       30,000 Justice Department employees from the FBI, DEA, INS, and Marshals Service, and about
       20,000 Treasury law enforcement personnel. Also, under the President's leadership, 8 major
       handgun manufacturers, who make the vast majority of handguns in the country, have agreed to
       provide child safety devices with each handgun sold.

Creating a Sexual Offender Registration System. Executive Memorandum, July 25, 1996. Improved the
       safety and protection of children through creation of a national sex offender registry. As of
       December 1, 1997, 20 states, representing 44.2% of the U.S. popUlation, have contributed to the

                                                                       Automated Records Management System
                                                                       HilX.Dwnp Convonion

Promoting Adoption. Executive Memorandum, December 14, 1996. The Memorandum directed
the Department of Health and Human Services to develop a plan to double, by the year 2002, the
number of children in foster care who are adopted or permanently placed each year. On
February 14, 1997, HHS presented its report called Adoption 2002. The Adoption 2002 report
formed the basis of Administration work with Congress toward the development ofthe Adoption
and Safe Families Act of 1997, which incorporated nearly all of the recommendations outlined in
the Report and the Memorandum. The President signed the Adoption and Safe Families Act
into law on November 19, 1997 less than one year after the Executive Memorandum was issued.

Encouraging Welfare-to-Work. Executive Memorandum, March 8,1997. The President directed
federal agencies to use existing hiring authority to hire individuals off the welfare rolls into
available federal jobs. In April 1997, agencies identified commitments to hire a total of 10,000
individuals by 2000. To date, the federal government has hired nearly 7,100 welfare recipients,
67 percent of its planned hires.

Improving Food Safety. Executive Order, August 25,1998. Created the President's first-ever
Council on Food Safety chaired by the Secretaries of Agriculture, Health and Human Services,
and the Director of the Office of Science and Technology to develop a comprehensive strategic
plan for Federal food safety activities and to take the next steps to advance Federal efforts to
implement a science-based strategy to improve the safety of the food supply and enhance
coordination among Federal agencies.

to deter school violence, promote discipline, and foster a better learning environment by

           and evicted tenants in public housing authorities (PHAs) who have engaged in illegal drug use or
           other criminal activities. The guidance permits PHAs to institute and enforce tough rules to
           protect the safety of families living in public housing. Of the 1,859 out of 3,192 (58%) total
           PHAs responding to the Department of Housing and Urban Development's Office of Public and
           Indian Housing March 1997 survey, 1,392 PHAs had implemented "One Strike" programs.

       Making Tobacco Documents Available to the Public. Executive Memorandum, July 17, 1998. The
              Executive Memorandum directed the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to
              coordinate a public health review of tobacco industry documents and develop a plan to make
~   documents more accessible to researchers and the public.

              Helping Uninsured Children. Executive Order, February 18,1998. President directed the seven
              Federal agencies with jurisdiction over children's programs to establish a multi-agency effort to
              enroll uninsured children. As a result, 10 agencies are implementing over 150 activities to
              educate families on enrolling uninsured children.

       Ensuring Opportunity for all Children. Executive .Order, April 17, 1996. Launched the "Computers
              for Learning" program, which is a unique partnership between federal agencies, schools, and
              non-profits across the country to move more than 70,000 computers into the nation's neediest
              classrooms.

    Keeping Guns Away From Kids. Executive Memorandum, July 8, 1996. Traced approximately 93,477
             guns from 27 communities (17 original sites and 10 new sites) through the use of an innovative
             computer software system that examines crime gun trace information and provides law
             enforcement officers with crucial investigative leads about the sources of these guns.
