TEXT:
If the memo that TJ refers to is not yet signed, I think that it would be
a very good idea to put the words "a healthy environment" or "a safe
environment" right before safe housing.  Jeanine is checking on signature.

This is a good example of where can integrate consideration of the
"environment", which the public health community defines very broadly,
into the consideration of other domestic issues. Environmental hazards
like lead, abandoned industrial sites, and developmental toxins can have a
profoundly negative influence on kids. At the same time investment in
parks and recreation, scientific education that starts with the
environment, and infrastructure that accounts for the environment can make
a strong positive contribution to healthy children.

thanks.

Subject:         Early Childhood Presidential Memo

Has any thought been given to whether "environment" ought to be included
in the Presidential memo that is to be issued in the next couple of days?
I just saw it in WH Staffing Clearance. While its main emphasis is on
health care, parental support, and nutrition, it does also mention "safe
housing" .

To the extent that this is shaping the agenda for the April conference, it
would be good to get environmental risks included.  I'll leave it to you
to decide in the context of the rest of the initiative you're working on.
