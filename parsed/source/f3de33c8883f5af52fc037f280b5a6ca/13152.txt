ALERT
HR 1833, legislation banning partial-birth abortions is
tentatively scheduled for full House Action next week     as early
as Tuesday, October 31.  Floor action will be subject to the bill
getting a rule.
In anticipation of floor action, are we going to do a SAP on this

position is going to be.
Please let me know at your earliest convenience.  Thanks.
