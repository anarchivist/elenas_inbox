TEXT:
The Senate began consideration of the Agriculture FY99 Appropriations bill
and will resume debate tomorrow, Friday, June 19.  please review and
provide comments/clearance by 10:30am tomorrow (5-4790).  Thank you.

S. 2159 -- AGRICULTURE, RURAL DEVELOPMENT
FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, AND RELATED AGENCIES
                                       APPROPRIATIONS BILL, FY
1999
(Sponsors: Stevens (R), Alaska;                 Cochran (R), Mississippi)


        This Statement of Administration Policy provides the
AdministrationD,s views on S. 2159, the Agriculture, Rural Development,
Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill, FY
1999, as reported by the Senate Appropriations Committee.  Your
consideration of the AdministrationD,s views would be appreciated.

         The Administration appreciates efforts by the Committee to


accommodate the PresidentO,s priorities within the 302(b) allocation.
However, because the Congress has not adopted the PresidentD,s user fee
proposals, the allocation is simply insufficient to make the necessary
investments in programs funded by this bill. As a result, a variety of
critical programs are underfunded, as discussed below.

        The only way to achieve the appropriate investment level is to
offset discretionary spending by using savings in other areas.  The
PresidentD,s FY 1999 Budget proposes levels of discretionary spending for
FY 1999 that conform to the Bipartisan Budget Agreement by providing
savings through user fees and certain mandatory programs to help finance
discretionary spending.  In the recently enacted Transportation Equity
Act, Congress -- on a broad, bipartisan basis -- took similar action in
approving funding for surface transportation programs paid for with
mandatory offsets. We want to work with the Congress on
mutually-agreeable mandatory and other offsets that could be used to
increase high-priority discretionary programs, including those funded by
this bill.  In addition, we urge the Congress to adopt the user fee
proposals included in the PresidentD,s budget, which would enable over
$600 million to be directed to important initiatives such as those
proposed for food safety, nutrition programs, rural development, and
conservation.

        Below is a discussion of our specific concerns with the
Committee-reported bill. We look forward to wo.rking with you to resolve
these concerns as the bill moves forward.

Civil Rights

        The Administration is working to include in the bill a provision
that waives the statute of limitations for individuals who have previously
filed a discrimination claim against USDA.  The President is personally
committed to righting any wrongs committed by USDA employees in years
past, and a great many individuals who were discriminated against will
have no recourse unless the statute of limitations is waived for them. We
will continue to work to identify appropriate offsets for the cost of this
waiver.

        In a number of areas, the Committee has reduced funds to assist
the most needy farmers and members of the rural community. The Committee
does not provide the requested increase for the Outreach for Socially
Disadvantaged Farmers program, which was a key recommendation of the Civil
Rights Action Team (CRAT) report last year. With the additional $7
million requested, USDA could support 35 projects to assist 10,000 small
family farms and stem the continuing reduction in the number of minority
farmers and ranchers.

          Another recommendation in the CRAT report is to increase the
  amount of farm ownership loans, a portion of which are targeted to
 minority and beginning farmers.   The Administration urges the Senate to
 provide the additional $3 million requested for this program by the
  President, which would permit another 290 limited-resource farmers to
. finance real estate purchases. This increase could be offset by
  eliminating the Forestry Incentives Program, which promotes timber
 production on private lands. The elimination of this program was
  requested and included in the House bill.

Food Safety Initiative

        The Administration is deeply concerned that the Committee has not


fully funded the PresidentO,s request for Food and Drug Administration
 (FDA) and USDA activities to enhance food safety, providing only $2.6
million out of the $101 million the President has requested for these
activities, $96 million of which is requested in this bill.    American
consumers enjoy the worldO,s safest food supply, but too many Americans
get sick, and in some cases die, from preventable. food-borne diseases.
The PresidentO,s budget increase would expand food safety research, risk
assessment capabilities, education, surveillance activities, and food
import inspections. We want to work with the Congress to explore user fee
options within FDA and USDA that can be used to offset the cost of the
needed increases in these programs as well as provide funds to modernize
further the meat and poultry inspection system.

Women,   Infants, and Children

         The Committee bill would freeze funding for the Special
Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) at
the FY 1998 level of $3.9 billion, $157 million below the PresidentO,s
request.   This would only support a participation level of between 7.3 and
7.4 million women, infants, and children, and, based on FY 1998 year-end
projections, would mean cutting off over 100,000 needy participants from
the program. The PresidentO,s request would maintain participation at 7.5
million, fulfilling the bipartisan commitment to fully fund WIC.   The
Administration strongly encourages the Senate to fund WIC at the
PresidentO,s requested level.

Arms Export Control Act Modification

        The Administration supports section 738, which will ensure that
American farmers can continue to export wheat and other commodities to
India and Pakistan through USDA export assistance programs. As the
President recently announced, in the sanctions the U.S. is applying toward
those countries, we are attempting within the constraints of the Act to
minimize the humanitarian impact on their people and adverse effects on
American agriculture.   Cutting off the supply of U.S. wheat would only
hurt the citizens of Pakistan and India, as well as American farmers,
without furthering the goal of nuclear nonproliferation.

Rural Development Funding

         The Administration strongly objects to the CommitteeO,s blocking
the mandatory Fund for Rural America from being used in FY 1999. The Fund
provides additional resources for rural development and innovative
agricultural research that are vitally needed to improve the quality of
life in rural America and increase the productivity of U.S. farmers.   The
intent of Congress in creating the Fund in 1996 was to boost the overall
Federal investment in these activities, not to offset discretionary
spending in them. Furthermore, Congress recently passed by overwhelming
margins. the Agricultural Research, Extension, and Education Reform Act of
1998, which extended the authority for the Fund while increasing its
resources. We urge the Senate to strike this provision.

        In addition, the Committee has not fully funded the PresidentO,s
request for the Rural Community Advancement Program (RCAP), under funding
direct loans for water and wastewater and for community facilities.   These
loans provide the community infrastructure needed to improve the quality
of life of rural Americans, and often finance the vital ingredient for
diversifying the rural economy. The Committee bill would result in an
estimated 35 fewer water and wastewater facilities serving 50,000 rural
residents, and 75 fewer rural health clinics, police and fire stations,


and child care facilities being built.   Furthermore, for the RCAP program
to be adaptable to unique local economic development needs, as envisioned
in its 1996 Farm Bill authorization, the Senate should strike the
CommitteeD,s limitation on the flexibility to transfer funds among
programs and allow the program to be implemented as authorized.

Food and Drug Administration

        The Administration strongly urges the Congress to provide the full
$1,251 million in resources to fund the program level proposed for the
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the PresidentD,s budget. The
Administration is deeply disappointed and concerned that the Committee has
not funded the PresidentD,s request for FDAD,s tobacco enforcement
activities. This funding is vital to the AdministrationD,s plan to reduce
youth smoking. [We understand that CongressD, delay in passing
comprehensive tobacco legislation is constraining the totals available for
the CommitteeD,s spending allocation and has also deferred serious
consideration of alternative solutions. We will continue to work a
ggressively with the Congress to enact comprehensive tobacco legislation
and to find ways to fund the AdministrationD,s request for high priority
programs.] Needs to be updated.

Agricultural Research

        The Committee bill includes over $50 million in unrequested
earmarks for lower-priority research while funding competitive grants
through the National Research Initiative (NRI) at $33 million below the
PresidentD,s request.  The rejection of additional funds for competitive
research grants for national and regional priorities, in favor of
earmarked grants for more local or industry-specific requests, will slow
progress toward addressing the most pressing needs of American agriculture
and food consumers, and we urge the Senate to reverse this course of
action.  It can do so not only by reducing earmarked grants in the bill,
but by reducing the $9 million in unrequested increases for the
Agricultural Research ServiceD,s buildings and facilities program. A task
force created by the 1996 Farm Bill to review the NationD,s agricultural
research facilities comprehensively is due to report to Congress next
year, and further construction should be minimized until the
Administration and Congress have had the opportunity to review the report.

Other Issues

        Additional funds are needed for the farm labor housing program to
improve the living conditions many farm labor families endure. The
CommitteeD,s level of $16 million in direct loans is more than 50 percent
below the AdministrationD,s request and, when coupled with the billD,s $3
million reduction below the request for farm labor grants, would mean that
over 350 fewer housing units would be built compared with the request. We
urge the Senate to increase funding to assist these needy members of our
society. This could be achieved by shifting $11.5 million from the amount
in the bill that is in excess of the PresidentD, s request .for multi-family
housing direct loans.

        The Committee bill includes a $20 million reduction to the
PresidentD,s request for the mandatory Emergency Food Assistance Program
(TEFAP), which purchases commodities for individuals greatly in need of
assistance. Given reported increases in need for food assistance through
food banks and soup kitchens, the Administration is concerned,that this
reduction from the authorized level would mean less food will reach the
most vulnerable Americans.



            The Administration is opposed to the CommitteeD,s elimination of
    funds to carry out a Conservation Farm Option program. This program
    provides technical assistance for full farm planning to eligible farmers
    and ranchers to address wetlands, wildlife habitat, soil, water, and
    related natural resource concerns on their lands in an environmentally
    beneficial and cost-effective manner. This program will achieve solutions
    to natural resource issues related to farms, ranches, and rural lands
    through implementation of conservation program practices on eligible
    lands. The Administration urges the Senate to allow the program to go
    forward this year as authorized.

            The Administration objects to section 721 of the Committee bill,
    which would limit Executive Branch review of USDA responses to
    congressional inquiries. Congress expects the Administration to be
    responsible for agency activities. This provision erodes that
    responsibility and is contrary to the widespread congressional view that
    more, not less, accountability is needed for improved management results.
    The Administration urges the Senate to delete the provision.

            The Administration objects to section 735 of the Committee bill,
    which would prohibit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) from
    consolidating laboratory operations. The proposed consolidation offers
    the opportunity for better efficiency and mission coordination, and it is
    part of FDAD,s overall streamlining goals. This provision would force FDA
    to spend funds on infrastructure that could otherwise be used more
    directly to protect public health. The Administration urges the Senate to
    delete this provision.

            The Committee has provided none of the requested $22 million
    increase for the Inspector General as part of the AdministrationD,s law
    enforcement initiative. This USDA initiative would save taxpayers
    millions of dollars lost through fraud in the food and nutrition programs,
    in USDA disaster, multi-family housing, and other programs, as well as
    improve the integrity of USDA programs. The Administration urges the
    Senate to increase funds for this important initiative.


            The Committee bill provides funding for research on nutrition programs
    within the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS). The Administration is very
    pleased that funding for these activities is returned to the FNS, where
    research on nutrition programs will occur in the context of the programD,s
    administration.
