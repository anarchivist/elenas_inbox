TEXT:
Deborah Mohile of Public Liaison wholeheartedly agreed we need a full vet
before we support this bill. Due to the holidays, this is still underway.

Also, we caught one part of DOJ mistakenly undoing the work of another
part of DOJ.   The Special Investigations unit wanted to propose an edit
to the Hill that would result in the "federal public benefits" denied to
Nazis as slightly different than the "federal public benefits" denied to
immigrants.  Once I pointed this out to the DOJ policy shop, they
persuaded Special Investigations to use the same definition.
