TEXT:
I was sure everyone would need an interpretive reading of the
remarks by POTUS and had tried to get this email off
earlier ... here goes! I will put any comments I have as to follow
up in ( ) and we can then talk next week when I am back in
office, okay?
Page 1:
CRasco:   looks good
          but see notes-
                    BC
Also should stay in touch with counties and cities
 (I had earlier today put on email to intergovernmental that we
need to talk about how to work with counties and mayors groups now
that we are working regularly with NGA/APWA/NCSL)
Page 2:
oRegulations
Q: Can we require states to offer, or allow local gov't to offer,
wage subsidies to private empllyers plus local govt's?
oApproved Waivers
Can we at least condition waivers on work participation rate to

I want to discuss time limits issue before a decision is made and
announced OR leaked.
oOther issues


Agree- I want to discuss before decision made.
Page 3
CHILD SUPPORT ENFORCEMENT
Regarding the FPLS he drew arrow and said:
Important
All agreed to this
On the $50 issue he wrote:
I didn't know this!
IMMIGRANTS
oFood Stamps
Can we slow walk this on reevaluation grounds-(this memo was read
before he got our follow up memo on issuing the directive to
Glickman ... we don't need to do anything further here}
oSSI
Take the year and work with INS on these to get as many citizens
as possible.
Page 4
oNaturalization
Left side:    Should do this ASAP
Right side: How big an increase over last year? (Isn't it nice he
will be so pleased with the huge increase' over last year?)
SSI for Children:
We must use REAL care on this-
 (I can assure you this hit him very seriously and that is why we
must have careful, thorough memo to him that I have requested
previously ... 1 must review the memo before it is sent and co-sign
some kind of cover sheet or he will return it to me asking what I
think. )
Medicaid:
This one did not copy well on my copy of memo and I don't have the
full writing; however it appears he' is saying we should discuss
what this does with Wisconsin .... what this says to me is that we
need to make SURE POTUS is briefed on the proposed letters to
Wisconsin before HHS sends them.
Child Care:
Good-
do ASAP as we must show POSITIVE aspects of law
 (Diana: This says to me we should definitely ask Child Care folks
to a meeting of the coordinating group in two to four weeks as we
discussed earlier)
Monitoring and Evaluation:
Agree
JOB OPPORTUNITIES
Should give discretion [he abbreviated the word] to cities (this
was taken care of in the formatting of his jobs initiative)
NEED FOR LEGISLATION
1st paragraph:    YES
Second paragraph:
+What about Joe Califano's concern in Sat. 8/25 New York Times?
 (Can someone look up that article and see what it is about ... 1
missed it)

==============NOTE: On any of these where he said he wants to
discuss, .etc. it will mean more than likely we need to do a good
decision memo. AGain, I will be in on Monday, will be reading
email from the road on Thursday afternoon and sometime midday on
Friday.
Let's talk ... thanks.
