TEXT:
We (Mary and Richard Socarides and I) met with David Ogden this afternoon
and he outlined 4 options which he will brief the AG with on how to deal
with expanding gender, sexual orientation, and disabilities to the hate
crimes categories.

The options range in restrictiveness using the commerce clause to ~void
having all assualts against women becoming hate crimes and requiring FBI
follow-up.  He wanted to get the AG's read in case she felt dramatically
in favor of one of the extremes before we started vetting with the
groups/kennedy.    I could have been swayed in favor of three of the
opitions. Do you have a minute, perhaps after the hectic tobacco business
tomorrow, to evaluate the choices and see if we should push one of them
more actively?   Thanks, Tom
