MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:          Bruce Reed
               Elena Kagan

RE:            DPC Weekly Report



        1. Welfare - Permitting States to Purchase Food Stamps for Those Losing Federal
Benefits: As part of the supplemental appropriations bill, Congress has agreed that states that
wish to continue food subsidies to certain individuals losing Federal food stamps because of the
welfare reform law can do so by purchasing food stamps from the federal government. This
includes both legal immigrants and unemployed non-disabled childless adults. A few months
ago, Washington State asked the Department of Agriculture if it had legal authority to sell
coupons to states to provide benefits for legal immigrants. Unfortunately, the Department's
legal analysis indicated that it did not. However, we assisted the state in drafting a legislative
proposal, and it has been agreed to by the conferees, with the option also applying to
non-disabled childless adults subject to the new food stamp work requirement. Maryland and
Massachusetts are among the states planning to take advantage of this new option for legal
immigrants.

Note to Elena: I previously told you states with EBT (Maryland) were out of luck on this
legislation, but I was wrong: any state can take advantage of this.

       2. Teen Pregnancy - National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy You asked
whether we have any continued involvement with the National Campaign to Prevent Teen
Pregnancy, which we helped get started. On May 2nd -- the same day you announced the budget
deal -- the First Lady marked the Campaign's first anniversary in an East Room ceremony
recognizing 12 individuals working to lower teen pregnancy rates. During its first year, the
Campaign has focused on building its organization, engaging the media to promote pregnancy
prevention messages, establishing linkages with state and local groups, and commissioning
research on the problem and promising solutions. Former Gov. Thomas Kean, the Campaign's
chairman, spoke along with the First Lady at the May 2nd event.

[Elena -- I assume the following will be an add-on to your weekly on the NGA letterJ:
                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion

         3. Welfare Maintenance of Effort and the Contingency Fund The governors also
expressed concern about an issue involving maintenance of effort and the welfare contingency
fund. In the welfare law, there are maintenance of effort requirements for both the TANF block
grant and for the contingency fund states can access during recessions. There are two major
differences between the MOE for the contingency fund and for the TANF block grant: states
must maintain more of their historic state spending to access the contingency fund (100% vs. 75
or 80%) and they can count fewer kinds of state spending to meet the contingency fund MOE. It
is the latter difference the governors propose to change. They argue that because states plan
their programs around the definition for the basic T ANF block grant, they may not be eligible for
the contingency fund when they need it. They propose to unify the MOE definitions by adopting
the easier-to-meet TANF definition which allows states to count state spending in programs for
families that are not programmatically connected to the TANF block grant. We have generally
resisted any attempts to weaken the maintenance of effort requirement and opposed accepting
this change in the welfare technical corrections bill.

        4. Immigration -- Impact of Immigration on the U.S.: A study released by the
National Research Council found that immigration benefits the u.s. economy overall-- by as
much as $10 billion annually-- and has little negative effect on the income and job opportunities
of most native-born Americans. Only in areas with high concentrations oflow-skilled, low-paid
immigrants are state and local taxpayers are paying more on average to support the
publicly-funded services that immigrants use. While on an annual basis new immigrant families
receive more in publicly-funded services than they pay in taxes, over the long term, the majority
of new immigrants and their descendants will add more to the government coffers than they will
receive during their lifetimes. In recent decades, however, the wage gap between new immigrants
and native-born workers has grown substantially. The gap is largely attributable to the lower
educational and skill levels of newer immigrants.

The study was funded by the u.s. Commission on Immigration Reform. The National Research
Council operates the National Academy of Sciences and National Academy of Engineering.
