TEXT:
Sean Darragh from USTR called to say that they are getting Hill inquiries
on country of origin labeling.   We should probably have a deputies
meeting just to make sure that we are all on the same page before the
appropriations conference starts ( which is expected to start next week) .
I can set this up for Tuesday or Wednesday.  Let me know.  Thanks,
Mary
