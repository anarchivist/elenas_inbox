Subject:         Re: Child care

Johnson is holding a child care hearing on March 16th, and Cardin wants to
introduce the pieces of the Administration's child care bill in the
Committee's jurisdiction (which is everything except after-school) before
the hearing, at which Olivia will testify.   Finally, some movement on
child care ...

OMB has the HHS pieces of the bill in its clearance process but Treasury
needs to finish its specs, and we had a meeting last week in which we set
the week after next as our goal for getting Cardin these pieces. We are
trying to get Tauscher to work with Cardin on this project, instead of
doing her own thing.

I don't imagine that we would do a big press event around the
introduction, but rather issue a Presidential statement -- do you agree?

Are you hearing rumblings about Cardin wanting to introduce an
Administration bill on this in early March? Is that something we would
want to do? If so, I will see if we can speed up our processes on child
care.  Please let me know.  Thanks.
