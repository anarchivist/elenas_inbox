TEXT:
On Wednesday, Mayor Corradini of Salt Lake City, new president of the US
Conference of Mayors told the President that the USCM was planning to
convene a Safe Schools Conference in October and wanted his participation.
They are considering Chicago as the site.  This Conference will follow a
Sept 24 meeting in Salt Lake City of mayors, police chiefs, and others to
address this issue. Corradini has declared that reducing youth violence
will be her priority as president.  I will circulate their memo on it. The
President wrote himself a note.
