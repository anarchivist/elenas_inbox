TEXT:
BR/EK:

Treasury had ATF counsel call me late tonight to protest our commenting on
the Chicago case.    I didn't give them any commitments one way or the
other, but told them that senior staff would discuss the issue in the
morning, and their concerns would be raised.   We should let Jim Johnson
know what our decision is either way. He wasn't a happy camper when I
spoke to him tonight may complain if we "stick to our guns" on
this ... hee ... hee

Treasury's concerns:

(1) They're opposed to singling out the Chicago lawsuit.  Have we ever
done this before? Troublesome to focus on a single complaint the day
after it's been filed.  Don't know anything Chicago investigation and
implicated parties.

(2) Strongly oppose language implying that most or many gun dealers are
not law abiding.  ATF surveys show that the vast majority -- 90% plus --
comply with the laws and want to crack down on illegal gun traffickers,
too.  If we have to say anything at all about gun dealers, we should say,
"While most gun dealers comply with our laws ... "

(3) Might undermine our gun dealer support for gun show crackdown.
Legitimate dealers are proponents of gun show legislation and are likely
to support our recommendations in the next 60 days. Why alienate them
over this?

Jose'
