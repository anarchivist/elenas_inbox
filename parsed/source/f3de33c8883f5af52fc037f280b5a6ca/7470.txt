TEXT:
In thinking through other strategies on the State opt-out provision in
McCain:  the State opt-out could be rewritten to allow opt-out for States
that pass laws that are "at least of as effective" as the provision and
the implementing OSHA standard.  This would essentially allow
Federally-enforced OSHA States to come up with OSHA state plans for
tobacco only, while being consistent with the way current OSHA State plan
States do business.   It preserves the concept of an opt-out, which may be
important to McCain, while ensuring that States don't replace it with a
weaker approach, and OSHA has experience ensuring that the "at least as
effective" structure works (they approve the State Plan)).

If it's helpful I can call Emily Shekitoff at OSHA and bounce this off.
