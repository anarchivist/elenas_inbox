                         DRAFT: STATEMENT BY THE PRESIDENT



Nearly a year ago, I committed to working with Senators' Jeffords and Kennedy to pass the
Work Incentives Improvement Act. In January, in my State ofthe Union Address, I urged the
Congress make this historic, bipartisan legislation a top priority and fully funded it in the budget
I sent to Congress. And on June 4th, I challenged the Congress to send the Work Incentives bill
to me by July 26 th , so I could sign this legislation into law on the 9th anniversary of the
enactment of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).

Today, in an overwhelming 9x to x vote, the Senate passed the Work Incentives bill. This
impressive vote sends a strong signal that all Americans, including people with disabilities,
should have the opportunity to work. Americans with disabilities can and do bring tremendous
energy and talent to the American workforce, but the unemployment rate for all working-age
adults with disabilities is nearly 75 percent. One of the most glaring problems is that people with
disabilities frequently become ineligible for Medicaid or Medicare if they go back to work. This
puts people with disabilities in the untenable position of choosing between health care coverage
and work. The Work Incentives Improvement Act would improve job opportunities for people
with disabilities by increasing access to health care and employment services.

Senators Jeffords, Kennedy, Roth, and Moynihan deserve special recognition for their leadership
on this historic legislation. I urge the House to follow their lead. Under the leadership of
Congressmen Bliley, Dingell, Waxman, and Lazio, I am confident that it will. I also hope and
expect the Senate and House to find offsets for this bill that are acceptable to all parties. This bill
will provide critical work opportunities to people with disabilities, and I look forward to signing
this groundbreaking legislation.
