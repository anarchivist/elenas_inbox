TEXT:
I don't know if you're keeping up on the content of the Business
Roundtable speech, but you'll recall that in our Sylvia conversation we
said that it might be an appropriate point to mention the service summit
in passing.

I am hearing that it's a "hard-nosed economic speech" including China-MFN,
the budget. Do you think I push with Waldman, Gene, etc., or give this
one a miss because the topic is too far afield?
