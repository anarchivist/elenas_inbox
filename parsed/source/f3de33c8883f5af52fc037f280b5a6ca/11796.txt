Debate Opens Over HMO Rights

                             By LAURA MECKLER Associated Press Writer

                             WASHINGTON (AP)    Partisan differences over how
far
                             Congress should go to protect patient rights
were on full display
                             Wednesday as the year's debate began in earnest
over regulating
                             HMOs and other managed health care plans.

                             Democrats were sure to lose on every major point
as
                             deliberations began Wednesday in the Senate
Health, Education,
                             Labor and Pension Committee. The panel was
expected to
                             approve a GOP-backed bill as soon as Thursday.

                             President Clinton said the GOP bill --falls far
short"     of what's
                             needed.

                             --Today represents the first test of whether
this new Congress is
                             serious about providing Americans with a strong
enforceable
                          patients' bill of rights to assure quality
health care, " Clinton said in
                          a statement. --I urge the committee to do
everything it can to pass
                          this test and give Americans the health care
protections they
                          need.' ,


                         But Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., was already
looking past
                          the committee vote, promising reporters: "We'll
win on the floor
                         of the Senate.' ,

                          Indeed, the committee's deliberations were a
good indication of
                          the arguments likely to be heard on the Senate
floor when the
                          legislation is considered this spring.

                         The GOP bill would offer a grab bag of popular
protections,
                          including the right to reasonable emergency room
payments,
                         direct access to gynecologists for women and
prohibition of
                         much-maligned, but virtually nonexistent "gag
rules"   that prevent
                         doctors from discussing all options with their
patients.

                         But those protections would be given only to 48
million Americans
                          covered by federally regulated health insurance
plans.
                         Republicans noted that other patients are
covered by state
                          regulations, and numerous states have adopted
many of the same
                         provisions.

                         At the same time, the GOP bill would cover
another 75 million
                         people -- all Americans in employer-sponsored
health plans -- in a
                         key provision that would give patients the right
to take disputes
                         over payments to an independent group of experts
outside the
                         health plan.

                         Democrats say all Americans should be covered by
all of the bill's
                         provisions.

                          "Millions of Americans should not be held
hostage to the hope
                          that their state might pass legislation
providing these protections, ' ,
                          Clinton said.

                         Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., agreed: "Your
rights ought to
                         be guaranteed no matter where you get your
insurance.   I   I




                         The Democrats also want to give people new
rights to sue their


                                health plans over bad decisions and to require
    plans to pay for
                                what doctors determine to be --medically
    necessary"   care.

                                Committee Chairman Jim Jeffords, R-Vt., argued
    that more
                                lawsuits are not needed and emphasized that the
    GOP bill would
                                add hardly anything to health insurance premiums.

                                --Our goal, "   Jeffords said,   --is to give
    Americans the protections
                                they want and need in a package they can afford
    and that we can
                                enact.' ,
