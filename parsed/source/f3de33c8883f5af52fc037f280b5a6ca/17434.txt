Bruce and Elena--

Following up on your question from the staff meeting this a.m, this is a
draft Q&A that NEC
has put together.  Does this approach look ok to you?

Q. A STORY OVER THE WEEKEND SHOWED THAT COLLEGE PRESIDENTD,S MAKE
NEARLY $350,000 PER YEAR. DOES THE ADMINISTRATION CONSIDER THAT
EXCESSIVE?

A. As they do in the news media, the stars of higher education
are paid well.  The $333,000 figure from the Chronicle of Higher
Education study is for the largest, private, research
universities.  The average salary at four-year colleges was about
half that, $170,000. But again, as with other professions, the
Federal government does not tend to get involved.
