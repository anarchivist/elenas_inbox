      TEXT:
      Staff Sec and Scheduling would like to pull together a Short Term
      Scheduling Meeting to deal exclusively with requests for bill signing
      ceremonies. Currently, we have 76 bills in our office, all of which must
      be signed in the next 2 weeks; 47 more bills are on the way (you see the
      need for some planning) .  If interested, please attend or send someone
      from your office.

      The meeting will be tomorrow, Friday, at 10:30 a.m. in the Sit. Room.      We
      have a number of requests for signing ceremonies already, but any
      additional requests should be sent to me and Karin Kullman today, or
      should be brought to the meeting tomorrow.  Thanks.
