TEXT:
Shireman tells me that Gene and Erskine spoke to POTUS about Coverdell,
and his decision is to maintain our previous position--a clear veto
threat.

NEC is notifying Treasury, and asking Rubin to make some calls to
committee Dems before mark-up.  I've talked to Education. Barbara Chow is
putting a Riley/Rubin letter they had been sitting on into the system for
quick clearance and release.
