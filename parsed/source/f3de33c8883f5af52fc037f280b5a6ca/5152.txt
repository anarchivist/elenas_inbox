TEXT:
At our 4:00 meeting, Ray Uhalde was resisting holding the reg for 10 days,
but is still checking up his food chain.  I will call a few other people
there and try to get them excited, but we may need you to call Herman.
Elena, what do you think?

I'm leaving a bit early tonight, so page me if you want to talk more about
this.
