TEXT:
FYI -- Currently, there is talk about having the Equal Pay event on April
2 on the Hill with VP rather than here. We are endorsing the Daschle bill
in this announcement (and it is the main part of the announcement), but
there are other announcements the Administration is making like a
self-audit for the federal agencies to make sure that they are monitoring
themselves on equal pay and other announcements on technical assistance
and best practices.
