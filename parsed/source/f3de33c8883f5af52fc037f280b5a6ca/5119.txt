       Welfare Regulations Almost Complete -- Within the next few weeks, we expect to
complete and publish welfare regulations for both the $3 billion welfare to work program that
was part of the Balanced Budget Act and for the entire Temporary Assistance for Needy Families
program established by last year's welfare law. We are considering releasing them both on
November 1'7th, the day you are scheduled to inaugurate Cessna's new welfare to work facility in
Wichita.

        While the regulations for the $3 billion program are fairly straightforward (the important
issues were well defined in the statute), the TANF regulations are more complicated because they
involve the fundamental issues offederal versus state roles in the new welfare system. We are
focusing our efforts on ensuring that we hold states accountable for outcomes, particularly
putting welfare recipients to work, while maintaining state flexibility in designing and
implementing welfare reform efforts.

        We are attempting to resolve three major issues with HHS. First, we are working to
ensure that states may not use their flexibility to circumvent the work participation rates.
Because states can use their state share of funding (their maintenance of effort) to establish
separate programs that are not subject to work requirements or time limits, we are concerned that
they may segregate their hardest-to-employ cases in state programs in order to meet the work
rates in TANF. We also want to ensure that states don't reclassify families with parents living in
the home as "child only" in order to avoid work rates and time limits (the law rightfully exempts
child only families to avoid imposing requirements on grandparents and other non-parent
caregivers). Second, we are trying to structure a penalty system that is firm, fair, and credible and
will actually impose penalties when states -- after being given an opportunity to come into
compliance -- fail to meet key requirements. Third, we are concerned that states with waivers
will have an easier time meeting the work participation rates and may be able to exempt most
people from time limits. (The waivers established tougher rules than those in AFDC, but in
many cases ones less stringent than in the new law). Therefore, we are seeking to encourage
such states to drop their waivers in favor of the law's tougher standards by limiting their ability
to get high performance bonuses, caseload reduction credits, and breaks on penalties.

        Welfare: Senator Murray's Domestic Violence Amendment: As you may know, Senator
Murray has long advocated a proposal that would exclude victims of domestic violence from the
welfare work requirements and time limits. This week, the conferees voted not to include her
amendment in the Labor-HHS bill. We have always had serious reservations about her
approach because we believe it would allow states to largely escape the new welfare law's work
rules and time limits while failing to provide victims of domestic violence with the services they
need to get on the road to self-sufficiency.

        Currently, states can exempt victims of domestic violence from work requirements and
time limits, so long as they put 30 percent of their overall caseload to work and enforce the time


                                                                        Automated Records J>.!anagement System
                                                                          Hex-Dump Conversion
    limit for 80 percent of their caseload. Senator Murray's approach would change the law by
    allowing states to grant exemptions to these women wholly independently of the overall work and
    time requirements. This approach would significantly weaken the welfare law's emphasis on
    work: for example, if 15 percent of the case/oad were granted domestic violence waivers, then
    only 15 percent of the total caseload would have to work. At the same time, Senator Murray's
    proposal would do nothing to ensure that victims of domestic violence actually get the intensive
    assistance they need to become self sufficient; indeed, the proposal might well lead states to
    wholly ignore these women.

            We believe we have developed a better approach. Our draft regulations will clarify that
    HHS will not subject states to penalties if they fail to meet the work rates because they have
    exempted victims of domestic violence, so long as their exemptions are temporary and the state
    also provides services to help these women become self-sufficient. We are still discussing with
    HHS the issue of excusing states granting domestic violence waivers from the 5-year time limit as
    well as from work penalties and hope at the staff level to develop a middle ground approach.

             Welfare Indicators Report: HHS has prepared the first annual report on Indicators of
    Welfare Dependence, required by a 1994 law authored by Senator Moynihan, and plans to send
    it to the Hill next week. The report reflects the advice of a bipartisan advisory board created by
    the act, which includes state welfare directors (Gary Stangler, Gerald Miller, Eloise Anderson),
    researchers (Judy Gueron, Marvin Kosters, Kristin Moore) and advocates (Bob Greenstein, Wade
    Hom). The law required HHS and the advisory board to develop a definition of welfare
    dependence and to track, through an annual report, changes in the incidence of dependence.
    This report defines a family as "dependent on welfare" if more than 50 percent of its total yearly
    income comes from TANF, food stamps, or SSI and this income is not associated with work
    (i.e., no one in the family is working in a subsidized or unsubsidized job at the same time).
    This first annual report shows that 4.8 percent of Americans were dependent on welfare in 1993
    (the most recent year for which the data were available).

            Welfare: Justice Dept. Issuing Guidance to Programs that Must Verify Immigration
    Status - Next week, the Department of Justice will release guidance to help programs
    understand the welfare law's requirements for verification of immigration status. Under
    the law, legal immigrants are barred from receiving certain benefits, while illegal
    immigrants are barred from a broader list of programs. This guidance will help programs
    that receive federal funds understand the law and implement it in a fair and
    non-discriminatory fashion. Shortly thereafter, we expect that UUS will announce which
    of its programs are included on the broader list of programs not available to illegal
    immigrants
