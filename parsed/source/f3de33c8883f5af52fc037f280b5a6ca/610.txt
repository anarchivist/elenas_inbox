TEXT:
You may recall some discussion on a White House welfare web page.  It was held
up because of a little HHS snag and then it dropped off the radar screen for
awhile. Well, if you still think it is a worthwhile thing to do - I have left a
draft for you to take a look at - we can make it happen.
Basically the page is a link to all the agency pages on welfare.  There is no
orginial content from the White House. There can be - but their isn't right now.
Orginally, a staffer from HHS was to work on the page, but as of yesterday they
were pulled off the assignment, so the page is designed for little to no daily
updating.
Let me know if this is something that you would like to move forward on or put
on hold until the DPC reorg is complete. Thanks.
