TEXT:
House full committee is marking up the Foreign Operations bill tomorrow
morning; therefore, we need to send this letter to the Hill tonight.
Sorry for the very short turnaround, but please provide comments/clearance
by 7pm tonight. Thanks.

The Honorable Bob Livingston
Chairman
Committee on Appropriations
U.S. House of Representatives
Washington, D.C.  20515

Dear Mr. Chairman:

        The purpose of this letter is to provide the AdministrationO,s
views on the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs
Appropriations Bill, FY 1999, as reported by the House Subcommittee. As
the Committee develops its version of the bill, your consideration of the
AdministrationO,s views would be appreciated.

        The Administration appreciates efforts by the Subcommittee to
accommodate certain of the PresidentO,s priorities within the 302(b)
allocation. However, the allocation is simply insufficient to make the
necessary investments in programs funded by this bill. As a result, a
number of key programs are seriously under-funded, which raises issues of
congressional support for an effective foreign policy, a strong national
security policy, and continued economic prosperity.  In addition, the full
request for the International Monetary Fund is not approved, and there are
a number of objectionable restrictions on funding in the bill.  If the
bill were presented to the President in its current form, the PresidentO,s
senior advisers would recommend that he veto the bill.

        This legislation is a critical element of America's national
security budget. At the dawn of a new century, America faces unique
challenges and unprecedented opportunities to strengthen our national
security, enhance our global leadership, extend the reach of our
democratic values, and deepen our own prosperity. The challenges we face
are formidable.  If this bill in its current form were to become law,
however, it would erode our ability to promote effectively critical
American interests at home and abroad.  It would require us to walk away
from problems that can and must be solved. The responsibility of
safeguarding our national security and exercising U.S. leadership cannot·
be bought on the cheap.  We urge the Congress to provide the leadership
needed to keep America safe, strong, and prosperous.

        The only way to achieve the appropriate investment level for the
programs funded through this bill is to offset discretionary spending by
using savings in other areas.  The presidentO,s FY 1999 Budget proposes
levels of discretionary spending for FY 1999 that conform to the
Bipartisan Budget Agreement by making savings through user fees and
certain mandatory programs to help finance this spending.  In the
Transportation Equity Act, Congress -- on a broad, bipartisan basis
took similar action in approving funding for surface transportation
programs paid for with mandatory offsets. We want to work with the
Congress on mutually-agreeable mandatory and other offsets that could be
used to increase funding for high-priority discretionary programs,
including those funded by this bill.


International Monetary Fund

         ~~ile the Administration welcomes the SubcommitteeD,s efforts to
provide funding for the International Monetary FundD,s (I1-1FC,s) New
Arrangements to Borrow (NAB), we are very concerned by the SubcommitteeD,s
failure to include in its bill the requested appropriation for the $14.5
billion U.S. share of the IMFD,s critically needed quota increase.    Since
February of this year, the President has repeatedly called on Congress to
approve the full amount of his $18 billion supplemental budget request for
the IMF.   To reject or delay this funding not only would undermine
AmericaD,s leadership in the world, it also would expose American workers,
savers, farmers, and businesses to unacceptable economic risks.

        The IMFD,s financial resources are nearing historic lows,
especially after the recent commitments to Russia, which necessitated the
activation of the IMFO,s emergency credit lines, the General Arrangements
to Borrow (GAB), for the first time in twenty years.   Without the entire
$18 billion in new funding, composed of the quota increase and the U.S.
share of the New Arrangements to Borrow (NAB), the IMF -- and hence the
United States and the world -- will remain vulnerable if new, escalating,
or spreading systemic crises occur.  To protect AmericaD,s economic
strength Congress must act now to pass the full quota.  The
SubcommitteeD,s bill further proposes several conditions on IMF funding
that, while directed at objectives we share, are unworkable in their c
urrent form and, therefore, could have the effect of delaying indefinitely
the availability of these critical resources to the IMF. Neither the
quota increase nor the NAB can go into effect without the participation of
the United States; conversely, the rest of the world would act swiftly
once the U.S. agrees.

New Independent States

        Completing the peaceful transition of the New Independent States
(NIS) to stable, market democracies is vital to the U.S. national
security, a goal that Congress has shared and strongly supported up to the
present. The current political/economic situation in Russia and the
enormous economic potential of the Caspian Basin represent great
opportunities to advance our mutual goals.   Therefore, the cuts embodied
in the Subcommittee's funding level for USAID assistance programs to the
NIS are especially unfortunate.   These cuts would make it extremely
difficult to push for market reforms and support democratic forces across
the region. With respect to continued restrictions on U.S. assistance to
Azerbaijan, the Administration strongly favors repeal.   These restrictions
are a disincentive for securing peace in the Caucasus and do not serve
U.S. national interests.

Middle East Assistance

        The Administration welcomes the efforts of the Subcommittee to
work with us in encouraging changes in traditional levels of assistance to
countries in the Middle East. We believe that Israel's initiative to
reduce Economic Support Fund (ESF) assistance provides an important basis
on which to build future assistance programs that meet our needs in the
Middle East and beyond.  However, due to the very constrained funding
levels for international affairs programs, the Administration has proposed
an accelerated approach to the reduction of Israel's ESF.  We would
encourage the Committee to give strong consideration to such an approach
as the bill proceeds through the process.  Finally, we favor maintaining
Foreign Military Financing funding levels of $1.3 billion for Egypt in FY
1999.



Economic Support Fund

        The Administration is concerned with the overall funding level for
the ESF account. At the Subcommittee mark, the account would not nearly
have sufficient resources to continue supporting economic and political
stability in Latin America, and in other emerging democracies in Africa
and Asia. We strongly encourage the Committee to support a higher funding
level for the ESF account as the bill moves forward.

Global Environment Facility

         The Administration is concerned with the refusal of the
Subcommittee to fund our request for the Global Environment Facility
(GEF) , which is helping to reduce long-term environmental risks that will
affect all Americans. Our $300 million request for GEF (of which $192.5
million is arrears) is needed to assure that the GEF does not run out of
resources in FY 1999. Concerns that funding the GEF would prejudge debate
on the Kyoto Climate Protocol are misplaced:   the new replenishment
agreement is funded at the same level as the prior one, and the GEF will
continue with precisely the same broad work program that it had prior to
Kyoto.   The GEF is among the best vehicles that the u.S. has to encourage
developing countries to shoulder greater responsibility for protecting
both the local and global environment.   It is manifestly in our interests
to clear our arrears and keep the GEF running, and the Administration
strongly urges the Committee to restore funding for this critical program.

Nonproliferation, Anti-terrorism, Demining, and Related Programs (NADR)

        The Administration is concerned with the $64 million, or 30 percent, cut
to the $216 million request for NADR. This reduction undermines the
multi-prong effort that NADR supports to reduce the proliferation threat
to U.S. national and global security. Specifically, we strongly oppose
the unacceptable certification language and inadequate funding level for
KEDO, a cornerstone of our nonproliferation policy. Lack of funding for
the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) Preparatory Commission would harm
U.S. national security interests as it guts planned improvements in our
ability to monitor nuclear testing worldwide. The recent Indian and
Pakistani tests are a stark reminder of the importance of this
monitoring. As well, we would be forced to reduce support for NIS science
centers, demining efforts, and other related activities.

Peacekeeping Operations   (PKO)

        The Subcommittee has reduced the $83 million request for PKO by 25
percent. PKO provides vital assistance and support for many important
national security and foreign policy activities, including commitments in
Bosnia, conflicts in Africa, and potential trouble spots such as in the
Balkans. This reduction would severely limit the PresidentD,s ability to
respond to these and other evolving events.

Trade and Investment Financing

         The Administration appreciates the SubcommitteeD,s effort to
increase substantially the funding for the Export-Import Bank and to
support the Overseas Private Investment Corporation and the Trade and
Development Agency (TDA).   However, Export-Import Bank funding still falls
short of the level needed to meet the expected demand of U.S. exporters in
FY 1999.   Support for TDA, at 17 percent below the presidentD,s request,
is insufficient to allow the agency to remain engaged around the world,


especially given its growing program in the Caspian region.

n  <:'
U.o,J.   lI.gency for International Development (USAID) Operating Expenses

        The Administration is concerned with the $24 million cut in the
request for USAID Operating Expenses.  This reduction would not only make
it impossible for USAID to carry out Presidential initiatives in Africa
and Latin America, but also would interfere with the agencyO,s ability to
manage its ongoing programs effectively, including congressional
priorities in areas such as infectious diseases and child survival, as
well as to address management priorities such as Year 2000 conversion.
Even if USAID were to begin closing missions and eliminating additional
positions immediately, the fixed costs of doing so would prevent AID from
achieving the savings necessary in FY 1999 to respond to this cut.  For
these reasons, we urge the Committee to restore funding for USAID
Operating Expenses.

International Disaster Assistance

        In light of the continuing needs created by both natural disasters
and ongoing civil conflicts, we urge the Committee to provide a higher
level of funding for this account.  The Subcommittee mark would cripple
our efforts to respond expeditiously and effectively to countries in
transition from crisis caused by political and ethnic conflict.

U.S. Agency for International Development Credit Programs

         The Administration is concerned that the Subcommittee has not
funded the modest $6 million request for credit subsidy for the Urban
Environment (UE) credit program, or provided transfer authority for
USAIDD,s Development Credit Authority (DCA). As the Congress and the
Administration agreed in the FY 1998 appropriations legislation, USAID has
taken substantial steps towards developing the capacity to manage both its
existing and future credit portfolios. We urge the Committee to restore
the transfer authority for the DCA and the subsidy request for the UE
program.   Failure to do so would limit the ability of USAID to use credit
to promote development in urban areas and to encourage the development of
needed private sector financial mechanisms.

U.S. Agency for International Development Child Survival,       Diseases, and
Basic Education

        The prohibition on the use of funds from the Child Survival and
Disease Programs Fund for non-project assistance, which is specifically
authorized in the Foreign Assistance Act, would compromise USAIDD,s
current leadership position with bilateral and multilateral donors to
encourage and support policy reforms in sub-Saharan African countries.

Exchange Stabilization Fund

        The Subcommittee bill contains a provision that would limit
unacceptably the PresidentO,s ability to utilize the Exchange
Stabilization Fund as necessary to protect AmericaD,s economic and
security interests.  For this reason, and because the Exchange Sta
bilization Fund is not germane to the purposes of this appropriations
bill, the Administration opposes this provision.

Treasury International Affairs Technical Assistance Program

           The Administration is disappointed that the Subcommittee has not


funded the $5 million request for this program, which could significantly
enhance the transition to stronger private sector-led growth and more
efficient, transparent, and better supervised financial institutions in
emerging economies, including reforming countries in Africa and financial
crisis countries in Asia. Given the large potential benefits and modest
cost of this program, which provides technical assistance in tax policy,
development of domestic capital markets, and privatization of state
enterprises, we urge the Committee to fund the request.

International Organizations and Programs (IO&P): U.N. Population Fund
(UNFPA)

        The Subcommittee bill reduces the request for IO&P by $55 million and
unfortunately eliminates funding for UNFPA, which provides support for
women in family planning matters in a number of countries not served by
U.S. assistance programs. UNFPA does not fund abortions.   The overall
reduction in IO&P would limit U.S. ability to participate and support a
number of international organizations.

Peace Corps

        The Administration regrets that the bipartisan Peace Corps
initiative to fund 10,000 volunteers by the year 2000 has not received the
full request of $270 million from the Subcommittee.  However, we are
heartened by report language stating that the Subcommittee is prepared to
approve a further increase should there be a reallocation of funds later
in the appropriations process.

Community Adjustment and Investment Program (CAIP)

        The Administration is concerned with the Subcommittee's failure to
fund the Community Adjustment and Investment Program, a program initially
funded through the North American Development Bank, a multilateral
development bank. The CAIP was established to help communities affected
by adverse trade patterns associated with implementation of the North
American Free Trade Agreement. To date, the program has assisted in more
than 120 loans in 20 states, leveraging private sector financing of over
$70 million.  The $37 million requested would significantly bolster the
CAIPD,s ability to continue this work, as well as to support technical
assistance, grants and microlending. The Administration urges the
Committee to restore funding for this innovative program.

Year 2000 Conversion

        The need to conform with Year 2000 conversion requirements
mandates the additional investments in information technology and credit
management that are included in the requests for USAID Operating Expenses,
Peace Corps, and the other agencies funded in this bill.  It is essential
to make Year 2000 funding available quickly and flexibly.  The House
action striking the emergency fund in the Treasury and General Government
appropriations bill is very troubling, particularly in light of the
decision of several Subcommittees, including this one, not to fund the
base request for Year 2000 conversion.

        We look forward to working with you to address our mutual concerns.

                                                Sincerely,



                                                  Jacob J. Lew
                                                  Acting Director
