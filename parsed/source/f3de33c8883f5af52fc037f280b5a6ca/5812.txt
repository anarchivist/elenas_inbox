   TEXT:
   Cynthia asked me to update you on child support enforcement (CSE) issues
   in her absence.

   Block grant. As you know, OMB has been assuming a child support
   enforcement offset of $60 million in FY 1999 and $300 million over five
   years. OMB proposes to achieve these savings by converting the CSE
   program, under which the Federal government reimburses States for 66
   percent of their child support collection costs (without a cap) and
   provides incentive payments, into a block grant.  Under the current
   structure, many States make a profit on the child support enforcement
   program--Federal payments (matching and incentive) and the State share of
   TANF collections exceed State child support enforcement spending--making
   the program an attractive target for savings.       .

   A proposal to convert the CSE program into a block grant would likely be
   poorly received by both States and child support advocates. The OMB
   proposal would endanger the AdministrationD,s hard-won and well-deserved
   legacy in the child support area; I. also doubt the Congressional
   Republicans would embrace this approach.   Cynthia and I are in complete
   agreement that there are better ways to achieve this relatively modest
   level of savings from the CSE program, and we have urged.HHS to develop an
   alternative package that generates comparable savings.

  with Barbara Chow away for vacation, I have been unable to determine the
  status of the OMB proposal.   There is a rumor that OMB is no longer'
  carrying the $'300 million in savings but that the policy change remains
  very much alive.   To my knowledge, none of the principals in the budget
  process except possibly Director Raines has focused on this issue.    To put
  forward a block grant proposal without any external or even much internal
  vetting would be most unwise.

   Systems penalty.  On another note, HHS staff met with Ron Haskins today to
   provide technical assistance regarding his child support enforcement
'.r      '.,
  automated systems penalty proposal. His approach is quite similar to the
  options we have been discussing internally--replacing the current penalty
  (termination of Federal child support enforcement and possibly TANF
  funding) for failure to put an automated system in place with a smaller
  sanction. The proposed penalty would start at 4 percent of FY 1997
  Federal CSE matching funds and rise by4 percentage points each year, up
  to a high of 20 percent in the fifth year and thereafter. We were
  contemplating somewhat larger penalties--5 or 10 percent. Under the
  Haskins proposal, a State would earn back 75 percent of the most recent pe
  nalty (but not earlier penalties) once its system was certified--this is
  also similar in principle to the approach under consideration internally.

  Haskins was r~ceptive to the HHS comments, which were largely technical in
  nature (e.g., would the new reduced penalty apply to failure to enact
  required legislation, as well as to automated system development--answer
  was no; could States enter into multi-year corrective action plans--answer
  was yes). He intends to hold a meeting including Republican and
  Democratic House and Senate staff, States, advocates and the
  Administration on January 8 to discuss his systems penalty proposal.
  Health and Human Services would like to arrive at a firm Administration
  position prior to that meeting; they suggest a pre-meeting on January 6.

      Please let me know, if you have questions.
