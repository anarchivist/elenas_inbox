TEXT:
Elena

Have you written a decision memo for the President on racial profiling and
the executive order? Does it (or will it) include the option I favor and a
presentation of the pros and cons?

Or would you prefer that I write to POTUS separately?

What is the timetable? This issue has been around for many weeks, and some
campaign-related things are developing.
