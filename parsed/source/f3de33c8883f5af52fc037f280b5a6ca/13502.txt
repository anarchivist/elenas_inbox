TEXT:
USDA will be rev~s~ng its draft guidance to the field as a result
of a meeting held this afternoon with TJ Glauthier, CEQ, DOJ, DOl
and NMFS. TJ has asked that I circulate the revised version to
you. You should be getting it about 4:30 and we need a quick
turn around in order to try to get it out today.
Because of outstanding legal concerns raised by DOJ, the guidance
will be limited at this time to the 5 released sales that are the
subject of current controversy. This includes the First and Last
sales.
In order to guide policy making on replacement timber for other
environmentally damaging sales, DOJ has been charged with
providing answers to the following legal questions:
        1) Do we have the authority to unilaterally cancel 318
contracts under their original contract provisions? (analysis
underway since last week) .
        2) a. Can we provid, for k(1) sales, replacement timber
that doesn't comply with environmental laws and Forest plan
standards and guidelines?
           b. Can we provide, for k(3) sales, replacement timber
that doesn't comply with environmental laws and Forest Plan
standards and guidelines? (the general consensus is that the
answers to these questions may be different) .
        3) Do we have the authority to offer Forest Plan timber as
replacement ,t imber under k (3) ?
        4) Do we have the authority to buyout a 318 contract in a
voluntary agreement with a purchaser?
