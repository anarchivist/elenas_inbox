TEXT:
ACOGs Executive Board recently met to reaffirm position.

"continues to affirm the legal right of a woman to obtain an abortion
prior to fetal viability. ACOG is opposed to abortion of the healthy
fetus that has attained viability in a healthy woman. Viability is the
capacity of the fetus to survive outside the mother's uterus. Whether or
not this capacity exists is a medical determination, may vary with each
pregnancy and is a matter for the judgment of the responsible attending
physician. "
