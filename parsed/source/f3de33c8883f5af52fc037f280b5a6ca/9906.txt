What ideas do you want dpc/nec to consider--that's where this should be
taking place--I of course, will review their memos on weds and see if
there's anything in there, but I suspect that there might not be much on
race --which is why I thought your conversations/meetings with policy
shops about the policy work for the book is how any race ideas for
sotu/budget would be generated.  Is there something you have been
proposing that is not being paid attention to-why don't you email bruce
and gene with your ideas--by copying them on .this email, I am asking them
to consider, think about and otherwise be creative on
race/sotu/budget--but I thought that's what you were doing by working with
their staffs.

I have no idea what the DPC and NEC will say to POTUS about their
recommended policy issues, because there is no process I'm aware of that
will give me an opportunity to see what Bruce and Gene give to the
President. So the fact that our staffs have talked amicably, and that
we've had several excellent meetings, is almost no assurance at all.


The PIR transition meeting discussion of race & the SOTU is fine, but I
doubt that anyone is going to come with much of an idea, because no one
was given an assignment to do so.

My own sense of it is that when POTUS reviews the book during Xmas season,
he'll be in a position to decide what if anything he wants to say about
race. So a dicus'sion now strikes me as premature.

It's just a speech. The real issue is the budget.

So, again: Can there be a process, please, to make sure that POTUS gets an
opportunity to consider race ideas? If yes, then how and when?

Thanks.
