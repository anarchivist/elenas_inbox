      HHS/ACF did background briefing this morning on the two reports
      referenced in release below. Michael Kharfen said it went well.
      Reporters attending were: Laura Meckler, AP; Judy Haveman, Post; Rich
      Wolf, USA Today; Ina Jaffe, NPR.  Barry, I wouldn't think you'd get press
      questions, but if you want Q&As, let me know.   We did a weekly item
      already on the MDRC study of Portland.  I'll do one this week on Urban
      Institute 5-state study though it's primarily a snapshot, and not an
      impact evaluation.

     FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                Contact:   Michael Kharfen
     Tuesday, June 23, 1998                                          (202) 401- 9215


     REPORTS EXAMINE SUCCESSFUL WELFARE-TO-WORK EFFORTS

             HHS Secretary Donna E. Shalala today released two reports that
     examine
     successful programs in five states and one city helping welfare recipients
     move into jobs.

              "As states and localities develop their own welfare-to-work
     programs,
     they need to know how successful programs are achieving results," Secretary
     Shalala said.   The efforts outlined in these reports are excellent examples
     of programs that work."

               One   of the studies,   "Building an Employment Focused Welfare
     System, "
     prepared by     the Urban Institute, examines how welfare reform is being
     implemented     by Indiana, Massachusetts, Oregon, Virginia and Wisconsin
     five states     that have experienced caseload declines well above the national
     average.

              The second report prepared by the Manpower Development Research
     Corporation, "Implementation, Participation Costs, and Two-Year Impacts of
     the Portland (Oregon) Welfare-to-Work Program," looks at Portland, Oregon's
     welfare-to-work program, which reduced welfare expenditures by 17 percent
     over a two-year period, while increasing recipients' earnings by 35
     percent.

             "I am encouraged that these programs report substantial numbers of
     welfare parents working, and significantly in jobs paying more than the
     minimum wage," said Olivia Golden, HHS Assistant Secretary for Children and
     Families.  "Moving from welfare to work must mean opening new doors of
     opportunity for families."

             The five-state study focuses specifically on experiences
     implementing
     "Work First," the philosophy that most welfare recipients are capable of
     obtaining employment, that any job is better than no job and that the best
     way to succeed in the labor market is to join it.

             The five states studied in the Urban Institute report were already
     restructuring their welfare systems to emphasize work when Congress passed
     major federal welfare reform in 1996. That legislation eliminated
     traditional open-ended cash assistance provided by the Aid to Families with
     Dependent Children (AFDC)  program and the Job Opportunities and Basic
     Skills Training (JOBS) program. Congress replaced these programs with the
     Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, which provides block
     grants to individual states, and which requires work for welfare
     recipients.

              "There has been a shift in welfare-to-work programs across the
     country,
      from relying on providing education and training as the major route to
     self-sufficiency, to programs which embrace a Work First philosophy," said
     Pamela A. Holcomb of the Urban Institute. "The point of this report is to
     show how states are accomplishing this shift."
"



            Typical practices, the researchers report, included (1) making a
    job
    search the first and central activity, (2) limiting participation in
    education and training, (3) imposing stricter participation and work
    requirements, including greater use of unpaid work experience (4) enforcing
    stiffer penalties for noncompliance and (5) placing time limits on
    assistance.

            While the Work First programs in all five states shared common
    features, each state combined elements to create its own unique version of
    welfare reform.   For example:

    u Virginia provided recipients with the greatest opportunity to combine
    assistance with employment but also applied severe penalties for
    non-cooperation;

    u Both Virginia and Massachusetts imposed work requirements sooner than the
    other states and relied more extensively on community service programs to
    engage recipients in some form of work;

    u Oregon developed the most successful program for creating subsidized
    employment opportunities for welfare recipients.

            By tracking a sample of recipients over a one year period, the
    five-state study found that 31-44 percent of the participants at the end of
    the year were still receiving cash assistance or back on welfare, with or
    without a job.

            "The Portland results provide valuable lessons on how to not only
    get
    more people working, but also get them better jobs, and on how to succeed
    with those typically considered hard to place in jobs," said Gayle Hamilton
    of the MDRC.  "The program emphasized getting a job quickly, but also used
    some education and training as tools to get· there."

            Portland, Oregon's efforts have been among the most effective among
    large-scale mandatory programs, according to the report prepared by the
    Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation. By the end of the study
    period, just 41 percent of program group members were receiving welfare,
    compared to 53 percent of control group members.  The proportion of people
    working at full-time jobs increased by 13 percent, and the proportion with
    employer-provided health benefits increased by 10 percent.

            The Portland program used a mixed-services strategy: most people
    participated in job search, but many also participated in short-term
    education, vocational training, work experience, and life skills training.
    Failure to participate resulted in welfare grant reductions.

             One important feature of the Portland program is that it increased
    job
    quality.   Participants were encouraged to look for and take "good"
    jobs--full-time jobs, paying more than the minimum wage, with benefits and
    potential for advancement.

               The studies suggest that states will need to adopt a greater range

and
mix of services and strategies to help the least employable welfare
recipients, Assistant Secretary Golden said.
