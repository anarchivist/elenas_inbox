TEXT:
Shaw wants SSA comments on a package to get tough on 881
fraud/overpayments.   SSA, OMB, and I have developed positions on his
30-odd proposals.   But there are 3 close calls where we might need to
disagree with SSA/OMB and advocate a tougher stand. Do you agree?

If someone gives information that they knew or should have known was false
or misleading to get SSI benefits, Shaw wants penalties of 1 year for the
1st offense, 10 years for the 2nd, and lifetime ineligibility for the
3rd. SSA wants to say that lifetime sanctions are "too harsh and
inflexible", and wants lesser penalties of 6 mos, 12 mos, and 24 mos.

But food stamps already has a penalty structure of 1 yr/10 yrs/lifetime
sanctions, so I'm not sure how we justify opposing this for SSI.   Do you
agree?

Likewise, Shaw wants to impose a 10-year eligibility ban on someone who
claims u.S. residency when they really live outside the U.S.  SSA wants to
oppose penalizing this false statement more harshly than other false
statements. But I think Shaw's model is TANF's 10-year ban for those who
claim residency in two states.

 SSA wants to oppose Shaw's proposal to bar anyone convicted of 2 felonies
 from SSI for 10 years, and have a lifetime bar on anyone with 3 felony
 convictions. The best argument against this is someone who commits 3
 felonies at 18, goes to jail and cleans up act, and then is injured 20
 years later.  I don't like this one, but I'm nervous about opposing.
·Maybe we should push for a modified version.
