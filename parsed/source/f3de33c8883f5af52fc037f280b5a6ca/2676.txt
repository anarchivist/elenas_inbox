TEXT:
pending Senate staff confirmation, the products liability meeting with
Congressional staff is scheduled for 3 pm on Monday in 472 OEOB.
Attending will be Bruce Gwynn and Dave Schuler from Congressman Dingell's
staff and Jim Gottlieb from Senator Rockefeller's office.  I appreciate
everyone's patience in pulling this meeting together.

           Preliminary thoughts on the agenda:

       1)      Emphasize the need for confidentiality of
Administration/Hill discussions

        2)      Hill staff report on status of products legislation in
the House and Senate

        3)      Statement of the Adminstration's position regarding the
President's position on                 products liability legislation and
his desire to respect H.R. 956's veto message           and the
cases of those who acompanied him during the veto ceremony

        4)      Report on the status/progress of the Administration's
working group on products               liability reform (e.g. review
of state actions on punitives and joint and several
                liability)

        5)      Broad discussion of "options" on state preemption,
elimination of joint liability for               noneconomic damages,
capping punitives, statute of repose and negligent
                entrustment   (must emphasize that all options are very
preliminary and do not          represent any Administration position)

        6)        Discussion of future process for Hill/Administration
discussions
