TEXT:

I was asked to contact you to work with you and OMB on the
analysis comparing the noncitizen benefit provisions of the
immigration and welfare reform bills -- specifically what could
come out of the immigration bill conference that would be even
more objectionable than what is in the welfare reform legislation.
Could you let me know how we can work wifh you on this memo and
generally be helpful on this?
Ken has a couple of issue-spotting memos from different sources
that are quite useful in getting started.   If you do not have
them, let me know.
Thanks.
