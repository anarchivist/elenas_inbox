TEXT:
This is a draft agenda for the first meeting of the Food Safety Council
(not for the public meeting tomorrow) .  The first meeting of the Council
has not been scheduled yet, but we discussed having it sometime in October
or November. Cliff has drafted an agenda with Bruce speaking for 10
minutes on the executive order creating the Council (and to emphasize the
President's commitment).  Bruce, are you OK with speaking? Thanks, Mary

Subject:         draft Council Agenda

Please get your comments to me by COB today if possible on the following
draft agenda for the first council meeting.  Please comment on whether you
think this meeting should be open or closed.  If we talk seriously about
budgets at least that portion needs to be closed- -right OMB? I have a
conference call with Woteki and O'Hara tomorrow to discuss this.  Thanks
