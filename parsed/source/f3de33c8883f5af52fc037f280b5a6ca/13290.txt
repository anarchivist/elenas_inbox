TEXT:
There was some uncertainity at the end of last week as to whether
Justice would move for a stay and appeal on the high bidder cases
we lost (do we have to offer sales under 2001(k) if the higher
bidder is out of business or no longer qualifies) .
Env. Division HAS recommended an appeal of the denial of the
motion to stay and an appeal on the merits.  The recommendation is
the S.G.'s office, who is expected to approve the recommendation.
