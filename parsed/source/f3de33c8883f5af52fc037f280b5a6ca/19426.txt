                   OF COMPREHENSIVE TOBACCO LEGISLATION
                                 April 9, 1998

Today, the President traveled to Carrollton, Kentucky to meet with tobacco farmers and to
address students at Carroll County High School. The President's trip highlights his
commitment to reducing youth smoking and protecting farmers, which are key elements of
the bipartisan comprehensive tobacco legislation the President has called on Congress to
pass this year.

Roundtable with Tobacco Farmers and Members of the Farming Community
The President held a roundtable discussion in the Kentuckiana Tobacco Warehouse with
tobacco farmers and members ofthe community, including a student and tobacco
warehouse owner. The panel also included Rod Kuegel, the President of the Burley
Tobacco Growers Cooperative -- an organization that represents 150,000 tobacco farm
families in five states -- and Bill Sprague, the President of the Kentucky Farm Bureau -- the
largest farming organization in the state. This roundtable provided an opportunity for the
President to listen to the concerns of farmers and the community regarding comprehensive
tobacco legislation.

Addressing Students at Carroll County High School
The President also addressed approximately 2200 students and adults at the Carroll
County High School where he emphasized his commitment to reducing youth smoking.
The President was joined by Senator Ford, Governor Patton, and Agriculture Secretary
Glickman. The President noted that every day 3,000 children will become regular
smokers, and 1,000 will die prematurely as a result, and he urged Congress to pass his plan
for comprehensive tobacco legislation which will save one million lives over the next five
years.

President's Key Principles
On September 17th, President Clinton announced the five key principles that must be included in
any comprehensive tobacco legislation. They are:

I.     Tough penalties and price increases to reduce youth smoking. Price increases of up to
       $1.50 if necessary over the next ten years.

2.     Full authority for the FDA to regulate tobacco products, including authority of the
       manufacture, sale, and advertising of tobacco products.

3.     The tobacco industry must change the way it does business, including stopping
       advertising to children.

4.     There needs to be progress towards other public health goals including cutting
       second-hand smoke and increasing funding for health research and cessation programs.
     suffer economically because of this legislation.
