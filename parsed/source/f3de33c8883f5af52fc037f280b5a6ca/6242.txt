TEXT:
Kevin Gordon, Marty Tokunaga, and, Vernon Billy from the California School
Board asked to come to the White House while they were in town on business
to brief interested parties on some June ballot initiatives in California
such as the Ron Untz Initiative, and the 95-5 Initiative sponsored by the
United Teachers of Los Angeles.

Right now we have scheduled this meeting for Wednesday the 4th at 9:30 am
in Room 113.  Please let me know if this is not a good time as we may be
able to change the time for tomorrow.
