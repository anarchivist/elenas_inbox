TEXT:
OMB is working on a budget proposal on detention and are proposing to
offset the cost of the detention with a reintroduction of the 245(i)
proposal that would generate funds.   I don't see any problems with this
and it is better than cutting some other current program.

please let me know if you have any concerns or questions.   Thanks.
