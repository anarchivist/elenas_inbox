OK, this time I really do mean Hill calls ...

HUD/VA approps conference committee is supposed to start Thursday.  It
would be helpful for key appropriators to hear directly from us that WTW
housing vouchers are a priority, we want more rather than less, and we
want the language in the House bill (see attached one-pager).  Bruce, any
calls you could make to Bond, Mikulski, Lewis and Stokes would be great.


In addition, if you haven't already called Cuomo reo the message on
vouchers (per Paul's earlier note or conversation), that would also be
helpful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; ATTACHMENT   1 ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

            President Clinton and Vice President Gore Call for 50,000 Housing Vouchers to Help
                                   Those Moving From Welfare to Work·
                                                   September 4, 1998


        The House and Senate have both recognized the important connection between housing vouchers
        and welfare reform, but so far have not provided sufficient funding for this critical initiative. The
        HUD/VA Appropriations bill passed by the House provides $100 million for 17,700 Welfare to
        Work Housing Vouchers. The bill passed by the Senate provides only $40 million for 7,000
        housing vouchers. In addition, the Senate bill earmarks most of the vouchers, whereas the House
        proposes an open, competitive process that would foster local innovation. The Congress should
        increase the number of vouchers funded and adopt the competitive grant process proposed by the
        President and adopted by the House. This will increase the number of communities who can
        access vouchers and increase their effectiveness by giving communities more flexibility to align
        housing and welfare reform strategies.

        The President's FY99 budget proposed an important additional step to promote work and welfare
        reform through a plan to provide 50,000 new housing vouchers to welfare recipients who need
        housing assistance in order to get or keep a job. Families could use these housing vouchers to
        move closer to a new job, to reduce a long commute, or to secure more stable housing to
        eliminate emergencies that keep them from getting to work every day on time. These targeted
        vouchers will give people on welfare a new tool to make the transition to a job and succeed in the
        work place.

        The $283 million proposal would help address the problem, in many regions, that jobs are being
        created far from where many welfare recipients live. Currently, about two-thirds of new jobs are
        being created in the suburbs, but three of four welfare recipients live in rural areas or central cities.
          The funding for the Administration's Access to Jobs initiative in the Transportation Equity Act for
        the 21st Century (TEA-21) will assist states and localities to develop flexible transportation
        alternatives for welfare recipients and other low income workers. But in some cases it makes
        more sense for someone to move closer to work -- and this new proposal will make that move
        from welfare to work possible.

        How It Will Work
        These vouchers will provide States and communities with a new flexible tool to help families who
        need housing assistance in order to achieve self-sufficiency.
        ·      The additional vouchers will be available on a competitive basis to local housing agencies
               and Indian tribes through their tribally designated housing entities. Applications must be
               developed in consultation with the state, local, or tribal welfare agency and the local
               Welfare-to-Work formula funds grantee (typically the Private Industry Council), to ensure
               that services are coordinated.

        ·       The vouchers will be used where they are essential to a successful transition from welfare to
                work--that is, where housing assistance is critical for a family to get or keep a job.
                                                                             Automated Records Management System
                                                                             Hex-Dump Conversion
         ·      Families who receive the vouchers must be eligible for or currently receiving Temporary
                Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) or have received TANF within the past year.

         The initiative recognizes the direct link between affordable housing and self-sufficiency. Along
         with the Administration's proposal to increase the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit, this initiative
         will make decent, affordable housing available to more Americans.
