TEXT:
Got an interesting welfare-to-work idea out of our mail (of all
      places). An upstate county commissioner suggests that cars seized in
      asset forfeiture proceedings (you know, from drug rings etc.) be given
      to welfare-to-work programs to help out welfare moms with
      transportation issues.   I can imagine bureaucratic resistance from law
      enforcement.   (I think they sell the cars now and keep the dough.)
      But it does have a nice political spin -- take the cars from criminals
      and use them to help people leave welfare -- and might even do a bit
      of good.
