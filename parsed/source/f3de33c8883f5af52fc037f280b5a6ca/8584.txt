'"    '.
     We are semi-on-track for at least two patients' bill of rights events for
     the President. The first would be on Wednesday with the AMA for a
     roundtable discussion with patients, doctors, and perhaps nurses to
     document the real-life tragedies that have resulted from
     actions/non-actions by managed care plans. We spoke with AMA reps over
     the weekend and they assured us that they want to work with us to deliver
     a good event.   (At this event, we could also announce the implementation
     of the Presidentially-ordererd appeals rights at the DVA.)

     On Thursday, we are currently contemplating a POTUS Democratic unity event
     on the Hill that would likely include the release of a new Families USA
     report.  This report documents how many Republican Governors and
     legislatures have already enacted many of these rights.   (The report
     undermines charges that a PBo'R bill represents a Government take-over,
     all-the-while also emphasizing the need for uniformity and how far short
     the state-passed protections go.)  It could also include the release of
     the CBO numbers for the Dingell-Ganske bill.   (As of this writing,
     however, the Hill is currently targeting Tuesday for the release of the
     CBO numbers.)
     The Hill also has asked the AMA to attend, but the association is nervous
     and thinks it is politically unwise to make this a Democrats-only unity
     event. They believe (and I agree) it undermines the success that Senator
     Kerrey and others have had -- as recently as on "THIS WEEK" -- in
     characterizing this as a bipartisan bill that the Republican Leadership
     and their followers are tying up.  Perhaps we should suggest that Ganske
     and other Republicans (who we think helpful and appropriate) should come?

     The Democrats on the Hill are tentatively preparing at least three events:

     1.  Tuesday -- The Hill Democrats have just recently concluded that it
     would be advisable to release the CBO numbers on the Dingell-Ganske bill
     on Tuesday. They thought it should be a separate news story.   (I think
     this is an unwise decision and hope that we can push back the release of
     these numbers a couple of days;
     I fear that an early release will be the big news story of the week and,
     although the numbers should be viewed fairly positively, they will not get
     a free ride from the the Republican Leadership OR the press.

     2.  Wednesday -- The Hill mock hearings appear to be locked in. Our only
     outstanding question is how we assure that the hearing does not coincide
     with the POTUS AMA event; the Hill doesn't want our event to swallow their
     hearing.

      3.  Thursday -- The Hill event with the'president in conjunction with the
     release of the Familes USA state-by-state report is getting locked down.
     I do think, however, that we need to discuss the potential downside of
     doing this with no Republicans. It could play right into the media
     perception that we are looking for an issue -- not a strong, bipartisan,
     enforceable bill.   (If we decide that we would be better served by the
     release of the CBO numbers on Thursday , it is possible we could convince
     the Hill Dems to hold off until then; should we do a quick Hill
     consultation call later today?)
