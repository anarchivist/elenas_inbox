 Subject: kids and guns funding

 We have reviewed DPC's proposal and analyzed our funding situation in
 light of the recent mark-up of our appropriations bill in the Senate.   It
 might be useful to do a conference call or meeting tomorrow to settle any
 remaining issues, but here's where we are:

 1. Contrary to Senator Campbell's comment, Treasury Enforcement was
 not funded above the President's request.  In fact, it left out important
 infrastructure investments (e.g., ATF's new headquarters).

 2. We have determined that the $11 million from the Customs Foreiture
 Fund can still be made available, although it cannot be used to hire FTE's.

 3.    We have looked at DPC's proposal for expanding the tracing center
 by 13 tracers and for placing 3 (vs. 6) agents in each city. We do not
 believe that the 13 tracers are sufficient to expand the tracing program to
 the additional 10 cities and to boost tracing beyond the 37% level. Also,
 ATF continues to maintain that these cases are labor intensive and, if
 pressed, would rather put 6 agents in half as many cities than to put 3
 agents in all of the cities. Therefore, we have the following proposal to
 make:

     We think the President in his radio address could announce the
,L




      following:  a) we will expand tracing to 10 additional cities (using the
      $11
      million from the Customs Forfeiture fund for equipment and contract
      employees), b) we will work with local and state law enforcement
      officials to strengthen their capacity to work with gun traces (assuming
      the $3 million in Justice money is available), and 3) we will work with
      Congress to get further support for agents to investigate these gun
      cases.

      4. That "support" could come in the following forms:    a) permission to
      increase Treasury's carry-over authority from 50% to 100%, or 2) some
      other means that our appropriators might suggest. We also would need
      a commitment from OMB to approve the request for the necessary
      additional agents for the 25 'cities in FY 99 and beyond.

      5. We will not be able to promise agents in the 25 cities, and we should
      not raise expectations about numbers of cases, etc., but this
      announcement could help build support for further agent funding.
