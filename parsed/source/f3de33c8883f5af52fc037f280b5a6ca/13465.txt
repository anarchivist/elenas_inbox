TEXT:
Earlier today we sent you a revised Justice letter on a proposed
Simpson amendment to S. 1394. The amendment would require persons
registering to vote to present certain documents to prove that
they are citizens. This amendment would essentially repeal the
mail registration option provided by the National Voter
Registration Act.


Originally the Justice letter opposed the amendment. The revised
Justice letter now states that:
         "If Congress sends the President immigration reform
legislation which effectively repeals the National voter
Registration Act, I [the Attorney General] would be forced to
recommend that he veto it."
Justice is informally negotiating with Simpson's staff to try to
get Sen. Simpson to withdraw the amendment.  If they are
unsuccessful, WHLA (Thornton) has advised that they will want to
release the veto threat letter ASAP.
I would therefore appreciate if you would let me know if you have
any comments on the letter by Spm tonight.
Thanks
