TEXT:
Susan Carr is sending a draft civil rights cross-cut to you and Michael
Deich this afternoon. She is putting a place holder in for our across the
board enforcement provision.  I tenatively asked for a $100 million
special fund to do the new things (mediation, technology, compliance) we
discussed.   Other than that, we could add $84 million to the total if we
just gave the lead agencies what they asked for.   Susan's draft is
recommending $39 million of what the agencies asked for.  The total budget
of the agencies is $574 (the biggest being EEOC at $240 million FY'98
enacted). The agencies have been slo~ getting back to us, but OMS wants
to sit down with Raines middle of next week so we need to have a
justifiable figure soon ...
