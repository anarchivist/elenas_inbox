TEXT:
The VP received a letter from several high-tech type Members of Congress
(bipartisan) asking if they could sit down with him and appropriate White
House staff to craft a consensus measure on H1b visas.   Don Gips suggested
that I contact you two and get your recommendations.   Don thinks it would
be a good idea to get the input of this group.

Given that they are headed out to recess, perhaps we could set up a
meeting with the relevant staff rather than the Members themselves.    I
think I would prefer that.  I will fax you the letter -- please let me
know what you think. Thanks, Kay.

PS The two lead signatories on the letter are Jim Moran and David Dreier.
Also signing are:  Jennifer Dunn, Darlene Hooley, Christopher Shays, Earl
Blumenauer, Ralph Hall, James Rogan and Tom Campbell.  Interesting crowd.
