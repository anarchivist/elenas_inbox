TEXT:
OMB would like to know if you think the guidance due date should be moved
to December from the already announced date of October 2. OMB and USDA
have concerns that the guidance will not be ready in October because it is
a 'complicated process. OMB is also concerned about releasing guidance
that may be controversial before the election.  OMB would like to know
whether we want the guidance due date to be October as promised or
December to give the agencies more time.

In addition there are two other issue that OMB is trying to resolve with
the agencies in a meeting that they are going to hold tomorrow:

1)      Risk   assessment.  USDA wants risk assessment procedures (a
cost-benefit   analysis) to be incorporated into the guidance process and
OMB agrees.    However, they still need to finalize the specific way that
this will be   incorporated in the report.

3)      Also FDA wants an entire section on establishing
commodity-specific guidance. USDA, OMB, and the groups believe this would
be very controversial, and furthermore, we never promised
commodity-specific guidance.

What is your reaction to the due date for the guidance?    Thanks, Mary
