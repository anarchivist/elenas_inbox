TEXT:
Could you have OMB run a few penalty scenarios to see how much they cost?
We need 10 and 25-year numbers, as well as year-by-year totals. We should
also figure out both pre- and post-tax cost (i.e., how much the industry
must earn in order to pay the penalty).  I don't know what tax rate to
assume; the companies say 42%.

1.  Two-tier penalty structure, as follows:
        * If industry misses target by less than 10%, each point costs $80
million, and is tax-deductible.
        * If industry misses target by more than 10%, each point (above
the first 10) costs $160 million, and is not tax-deductible.
        * Eliminate the cap.
        * Keep the double counting provision as written.
2.   One-tier penalty, but not tax-deductible:
        * Each point costs $80 million
        * No cap.
        * Keep double counting provision.
        * Find out the pretax cost to the company
3.   Higher one-tier penalty, but tax-deductible:
         * $160 million a point
         * No cap.
         * Keep double counting provision.
4.   Excise tax trigger:
         * $80 million a point, tax-deductible.
         * Keep $2 billion cap.
         * Keep double counting.
         * If industry misses target in year 5, it triggers 10 cent a pack
tax.   If target missed in year 7, that tax rises to 20 cents a pack.  If
target missed in year 10, rises to 30 cents a pack.


That's probably enough scenarios for now.    Thanks.
