                            Tobacco loot brings flood of spending ideas




                            The Associated Press
                                   TALLAHASSEE -- Gov. Lawton Chiles is
finding all
                            sorts of new friends who want to help him spend
the $750
                            million in tobacco.money that Florida won in·
court.
                                  The list includes former shock-TV host
Morton
                            Downey Jr., physicians doing scientific
research,
                            cartoonists hoping to create an anti-Joe Camel,
retirees
                            wanting money to clean cigarette butts off of
beaches to
                            broadcasters seeking a slice of the advertising
pie. The
                            governor's office is being deluged with
marketing ideas for
                            fighting cigarette smoking among young people.
                                  There are pens and baseball caps, posters
and
                            T-shirts, computer games and MTV-style cable
                            campaigns -- even interchangeable floor tiles
to drive
                            home the "don't smoke" message for school
children who
                            walk with their heads down.
                                  All the anti-smoking trinkets and
detailed advertising
                            game plans are being indexed and filed in the
governor's
                            office.
                                  "There·are a lot of people who say they
have a way to


                             help us spend some of the money, a very
effective way,"
                             Chiles said.   "As of now, we haven't looked at
specific
                             proposals because it's too early to do that."
                                   When Florida settled its
Medicaid-liability lawsuit
                             against tobacco companies for $11.3 billion on
Aug. 25, it
                             was the lead item in every newscast and
newspaper
                             across the nation. Unsolicited ideas poured in
from
                             advertising agencies, health   or~anizations,
educators, and
                             people with a product or gimmick they hope to
sell.
                                   Most of the suggestions do not have price
tags
                             attached to them.
                                   Of those that do include costs, the most
expensive
                  ~
                             proposal is a $200 million plan by the
Legislative Black
                             Caucus to target anti-smoking messages at the
same
                             minority neighborhoods where cigarette
billboards and
                             tobacco-sponsored events such as the Kool Jazz
Festival
                             have been disproportionately visible.
                                   Tallahassee's Odyssey Science Center
offered to take
                             the anti-smoking message into public-housing
projects,
                             Boys Clubs and Girls Clubs. Odyssey's offer said
                             museums can reach kids because "they are viewed
as
                             nonthreatening institutes."
                                   Lawyers are fighting over fees, so the
first $750
                             million installment is being held in escrow.
Meanwhile,
                             Chiles, legislators and Department of Health
officials are
                             deciding how to use the loot. The Department of
                             Corrections proposed a $485,480 program to get
young
                             offenders to kick the habit. The prison system
plan
                             included classroom training about dangers of
tobacco and
                             physical education classes.
                                   Morton Downey Jr., who used to smoke on
his TV
                             talk show, is now an anti-tobacco crusader
and he's
                             o~fering   his celebrity services· to the state
campaign.
                                   The governor's office is preparing a $200


million
                    budget amendment, for approval by House and S
enate
                    leaders, for release of the first money early
next year.
                    Chiles has already screened some anti-smoking
television
                    spots for teen-age focus groups, and he plans
to hold a
                    "Kids Congress" in 1998 to· approve· or reject
ideas.
