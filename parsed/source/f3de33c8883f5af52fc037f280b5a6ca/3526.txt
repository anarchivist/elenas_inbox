National Testing Initiative: There were several related develepments affecting the national
testing initiative this week. The House appropriations subcommittee mark-up includes a
provision requiring the National Academy of Sciences to complete an evaluation of the
development and field-testing of the national tests before we can proceed to administer the tests.
This provision was inserted at the request of Mr. Goodling. The Education Department had
already been planning to contract such an evaluation with NAS, so there is no fundamental
objection to this provision. We are working with Mr. Obey's staff to ensure that the timelines for
completing the study are reasonable given the work to be done, and will produce information in
time for next year's appropriations process. We believe this can be accomplished.

Second, Diane Ravitch and Checker Finn have launched an attack on our testing effort -- through
an article in the Weekly Standard and in a letter reported in the Washinton Times. They have
criticized the Administration for failing to provide a governing role for NAGB over the national
tests. This is a step we would like to take, but haven't yet because it would require new
legislation. At the request of Frank Riggs, who chairs the relevant subcomittee and who
supports the testing initiative, we have not submitted legislation pending our collective ability to
move Mr. Goodling to a more favorable stance on the tests. Both Checker and Diane are fully
aware of the need to work with Riggs and Goodling on this issue.

While we do not believe these attacks have yet caused significant harm, we are concerned that
they could over time. Therefore, we are exploring the possibility of providing NAGB with the
needed statutory authority through the conference on the appropriations bill, and have begun to
discuss this prospect with key Senate staff.

National Testing Initiative and Civil Rights Groups: Secretary Riley met last week with Chris
Edley and representatives of a number of civil rights groups, to listen to their concerns about the
testing initiative. Their concerns included (1) the possible use of the tests for tracking students,
(2) the prospect that too many students would be excluded from taking the tests; (3) the prospect
that the tests would be used for high stakes purposes without also relying on additional
information from other tests and from classroom performance; (4) the need to provide parents
with information about how they can use test score information to help their children and to hold
school accountable; and, (5) their view that the Education Department should require
participating states and school districts to disaggregate the test score results by school district,
school and demographic subgroup.

While few of these concerns are new or unique to our tests, there are several specific responses
we can make. The Education Department is developing material that will provide information to
parents about how to use the test results. With regard to reporting requirements for participating
states and school districts, while we and the Education Department agree with the idea of
disaggregating the data, we have been reluctant to add specific reporting requirements to states or
cities that use the tests. Further, it is increasingly common practice among states and school
districts to report disaggregated data at the school and district level, and the Title 1 requirements
reinforce this. While we don't think our policy should change, it could be helpful if your
rhetoric about the tests emphasized that the results should be incorporated into school report
cards and used for accountability purposes. You could do this almost immediately -- next week
                                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion
