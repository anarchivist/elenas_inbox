Just got your note written on Staff Secretary's 3/7 memo to POTUS re:
Welfare to Work event requested by Eli Segal, asking if we've put in a
request, and if not, let's do. This must have gotten delayed getting over
here. We did submit request on Monday.   I believe Laura showed it to you
before it went in. Thanks.
