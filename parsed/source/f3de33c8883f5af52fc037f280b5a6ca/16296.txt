             ATTRACTING AND PREPARING TOMORROW'S TEACHERS:
                INVESTING IN QUALITY FOR THE 21ST CENTURY
                                                  July 17, 1997

        To have the best schools, we must have the best teachers... and, we should challenge more of our
       finest young people to consider teaching as a career.
                                           -- President Clinton, 1997 State of the Union Address

Today President Clinton proposed a $350 million initiative to attract talented people of all
backgrounds into teaching at low-income schools across the nation, and to dramatically improve
the quality of training and preparation given to our future teachers. This new initiative will help
bring nearly 35,000 outstanding new teachers into high-poverty schools in urban and rural areas
over the next five years -- nearly 10% of the number needed. In addition, it will support 10-15
national models of excellence for teacher preparation, and will help upgrade the quality of
teacher preparation at more than 150 institutions of higher education in partnership with local
schools. The President's initiative will help recruit and prepare teachers nationwide to help our
neediest students succeed in the 21 st century.

A NATIONAL CHALLENGE: RECRUITING AND PREPARING THE BEST
TEACHERS FOR THE CLASSROOMS WHICH NEED THEM THE MOST.

Nationally, two million teachers must be hired over the next decade to accommodate rapidly
growing student enrollment and an aging. teaching force, according to the National Commission
on Teaching and America's Future. The most severe shortages will be found in high-poverty
urban and rural schools, which must hire 350,000 teachers over the next five years.

Urban and rural schools serving high percentages of poor students face especially serious
challenges in their teaching forces, with many teachers arriving without the qualifications or
preparation needed to succeed and with high rates of attrition. In urban districts, up to 50% of
teachers leave the profession within the first five years. In high poverty schools across the
U.S., one-third of students take math from teachers with neither a major nor a minor in
mathematics. Meeting our national challenge requires providing a sufficient number of
well-prepared teachers to fill the expected vacancies in urban and rural schools.

MEETING THE CHALLENGE: RECRUITING 35,000 OUTSTANDING NEW
TEACHERS INTO HIGH-POVERTY SCHOOLS AND IMPROVING THE
PREPARATION AND TRAINING OF FUTURE TEACHERS

National Teaching Fellowships to Help Talented People from All Backgrounds Teach in
Our Nation's Poorest Schools. The President's initiative will provide five-year competitive
grants to institutions of higher education with high-quality teacher preparation programs, in
partnership with local schools and others, to offer scholarships and other support to prepare
prospective teachers who commit to teach in underserved urban or rural schools for at least 3
years. Scholarships could cover costs of tuition, room, board, and other expenses of completing
the teacher preparation program -- as well as some costs of mentorship or additional preparation
for scholarship recipients in their first two years of teaching. The President's proposal will help
                                                                                     Hex-Dump Conve:-sion ·


recruit nearly 35,000 teachers over five years, meeting nearly 10% of the need for new teachers in
high poverty urban and rural communities.

Scholarships for young people and adults making a career change into teaching. Eligible
scholarship recipients would include undergraduate and graduate students, former military
personnel, education paraprofessionals or teacher aides desiring full teacher certification, and
other mid-career professionals looking to enter into the teaching profession.

 A commitment to bringing outstanding new teachers into high-poverty schools. Eligibility
would be limited to those making a commitment to teach in high-poverty schools for at least
three years. Scholarship recipients who do not complete the full three years would repay the
institution of higher education from which they received their teaching credentials.

National Models of Excellence for Teacher Preparation That Will Provide Direct
Assistance to Help 150 Institutions of Higher Education Better Prepare Tomorrow's
Teachers.
The President's initiative will support 10-15 national lighthouse models of excellence to
demonstrate world-class strategies for preparing future teachers. Five-year grants would be
awarded through a highly competitive process to institutions of higher education operating the
highest quality teacher education programs in partnership with local schools and others. These
lighthouse models would set the highest standards for preparing new teachers.

 Drawing on research and best practices, and holding institutions of higher education
accountable for performance. Grant recipients would draw on research and best practice for
preparing future teachers, including such critical strategies as: forging strong links between
schools of education and their universities' departments of arts and science, providing future
teachers with mentors and structured opportunities for teaching in elementary and secondary
school classrooms, and incorporating the use of educational technology into teacher preparation.
 Continuation grants will be given to institutions making demonstrable progress toward clearly
defined objectives.

 Helping improve the preparation of future teachers at 150 institutions of higher education
across the nation. Each institutions receiving a lighthouse grant would commit to using a
majority of these resources to help 8-15 other institutions of higher education and local school
systems improve their teacher preparation programs.
