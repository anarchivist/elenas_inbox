TEXT:
OMB has called asking where we stand on the two open issues in the Ed-Flex
SAP:

1)  which option we prefer for the langauge discussing strengthened
accountability.  It seems in the absence of any specific information on a
manager's amendment, we should use Option 1.

2)  the sunset provision.
OMB is awaiting guidance from us on conversations that they thought Bruce
may have been having with Mike regarding the language in the SAP on
sunsetting ed-flex when ESEA is reauthorized.  I have a call into Mike to
see where the Dept is on this language. Are you ok with it?

Subject: Draft SAP on S.280 - Ed Flex bill

The draft SAP for S. 280, the Education Flexibility Partnership Act of
1999, is influx right now.  The version below has two options.  In
general, option 1 is more vague and is recommended to be included if we
don't find out any details about the possible manager's substitute
amendment & the bill hits the floor.  Caroline/Broderick-can you keep us
posted on whether a manager's substitute amendment is going to be offered
and whether we support.  The Dept. of Education prefers Option 2.

The timing of the bill is also questionable, but the Senate Democratic
cloakroom expects S.280 to come up next week on Monday or Tuesday (the
Senate should stay w/ S.4 today & tomorrow along with a human rights
resolution with only morning business on Friday).  We should have time to
work on this SAP; however, in the event that the bill pops sooner on the
Senate floor, I need to have your comments for a quick turnaround.   This
SAP will also need to be cleared with all of the relevant principals.

please note, there is also an issue on the "sunset" issue that is noted in
the 1st paragraph (in bold) below the stars.  I will need closure on that


as well.     I look forward to your guidance on how to proceed.   Thank you.

S. 280 - Education Flexibility Partnership Act of 1999
(Sen. Frist (R) TN and 35 others)

The Administration has long supported the concept of expanding ed-flex
demonstration authority to permit all States to waive certain statutory
and regulatory requirements of Federal education programs in a manner that
will promote high standards and accountability for results, coupled with
increased flexibility for States and local school districts to achieve
those results.

   OPTION #1 The Administration will support S. 280 as long as the bill's
accountability provisions are strengthened to ensure that State waivers of
Federal requirements enhance children's educational achievement. 1

   OPTION #2 The Administration supports Senate passage of S. 280 only if
the Senate adopts the pending manager's substitute that would strengthen
the accountability provisions of the bill, to ensure that children's
educational achievement is enhanced by State waivers of Federal
requirements. 1

The Administration also urges adoption of an amendment that would
terminate a State's authority to grant waivers on the effective date of
the reauthorized Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA), so
that the Congress can ensure consistency, during its upcoming
consideration of the ESEA, between ed-flex authority and the
accountability provisions of the ESEA.

The Administration strongly supports an amendment that is expected to be
offered to S. 280 that would implement the President's proposal for a
long-term extension of the one-year authority to help school districts
reduce class size in the early grades, which the Congress approved last
year on a bipartisan basis.  In order to hire qualified teachers, arrange
for additional classrooms, and take other steps that are necessary to
reduce class size, school districts need to know, as soon as possible,
that the Congress intends to support this initiative for more than one
year.

(DO Not Distribute Outside Executive Office of the President)

This draft Statement of Administration Policy was developed by LRD (Connie
Bowers) in consultation with the Department of Education (Riddle), EIML
(Chow/White/Mustain), and DPC (Schnur).   The second paragraph (liThe
Administration also urges adoption.     .") was drafted by ED staff at the
request of OMB/EIML (Barbara Chow), but ED (Michael Cohen) has not agreed
to its inclusion and may be discussing it with Bruce Reed.

OMB/LA Clearance:

BACKGROUND

The Education Flexibility Partnership Demonstration (IIEd-Flex") Act was
enacted in 1994 as part of the Goals 2000 legislation in order to test the
idea of giving States authority to waive Federal statutory and regulatory
requirements that impede the development and implementation of education
reforms in the State. Originally limited to six States, this
demonstration authority was extended to 12 States by the Omnibus Budget


Reconciliation Act of 1996.

During the 105th Congress, a similar bill (S. 2213) was considered, but
never voted on, by the Senate.  S. 2213 differed from S. 280 in that it
would have amended the Goals 2000 Act to expand its education flexibility
programs. S. 280 is a freestanding bill that authorizes a new Ed-Flex
program. The Administration did not issue a SAP on 2213 because ED opined
that most Democrats were not supportive of the legislation.

SUMMARY OF S. 280

S. 280 would authorize the Secretary of Education to carry out an
education flexibility program. Under the program, all States (as opposed
to the 12 allowed in the current demonstration authority) could apply to
waive for at least five years Federal statutory or regulatory requirements
applicable to specified education improvement programs, if they
demonstrate those requirements could hamper efforts to improve stud~nt
achievement. To provide accountability, the bill would require States to
adopt academic standards and provisions for holding schools accountable
for student achievement.  The bill would also require that States have
authority to waive their own comparable requirements as well.

OTHER CONSIDERATIONS

Congress is scheduled to work this year on the Elementary and Secondary
Education Act (ESEA)  reauthorization.  The Administration is developing
an ESEA reauthorization proposal that will contain accountability
provisions to strengthen the ESEA and student achievement. By authorizing
every State to waive rules, S. 280 as drafted could undermine an ESEA
proposal that stresses accountability.

PAY-AS-YOU-GO SCORING

According to EIML (Mustain), S. 280 would not affect direct spending or
receipts; therefore, it is not subject to the PAYGO provisions of the
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act.
