    TEXT:
    Fabulous notes. Geez.




    Small comments, in no particular order:



    a.   I would say that MAYBE these need elevation to'POTUS. I favor

    developing the memo (with all the work that entails) and dropping out or

    adding as that process indicates. In other words, this shouldn't be viewed

    as a final list.



    b.   We really are killing four birds with one stone, and it makes sense to

    bear that in mind. The birds are:    (1) updating POTUS on a few items;   (2)

    plotting Administration priorities for the next two years and getting the

    needed policy signals to accomplish that;    (3) flagging anything that has

    budget implications for FY 2000;    (4) getting some bold thinking in front of

    POTUS for his race book.



    c.   In regard to the last item, b(4), we need a mini-working group not only

    to help process the memo, but also to think about ideas that may not be

    federal, or that may be longer range, or whatever. And,   I dunno, maybe

    there's something about Native Americans. Maybe discrimination in the

    context of immigration enforcement. Anyway, I'd like a little working

    group, with charter not only to assist with Eddie's POTUS memo, but the

    broader brainstorming I need for the book.



    d.   I don't want any of this morning's discussion to leave the impression

    that I am anything but wildly enthusiastic about biting the bullet on 8(a)

    and SDB programs -- or at least putting before POTUS the option of doing

    so. I believe Maria agrees. BUT I DID NOT LEAVE THE DISCUSSION WITH A SENSE

    OF WHO HAS THE LEAD IN DRIVING 8(a) REFORMS FORWARD. If not WH COUNSEL,

    then who? Would be nice to get something signed off on by the time of the

    book. Erskine and Cassandra designed a package of changes that are sitting

    on the shelf to consider.



    e. I just want to reiterate that there is serious intellectual work

    involved in many of these issues. There is hard conceptual stuff that ought

    to be framed in a way with the general way POTUS will discuss racial and

    ethnic justice, etc. Obvious point, but when the lawyers in the basement

    start arguing about everything, we'll have to remind folks to keep the big

    picture in mind.      (Once we paint it.)



    f.   THis is a large agenda. I urge Eddie to make use of Jacinta Ma, an

    attorney with a strong civil rights background, from the PIR staff. In

    addition, Maria will have a White House Fellow starting in September, who

    is an attorney with some civil rights experience and interest.
