 TEXT:
 Hatfield's press release regarding this language states that, "We
 have been working with the White House to build greater
 flexibility into the salvage law." It goes on to argue that the
.language does give us that flexibility and that it addreses the
 concerns raised recently by the President.  It also states that he
 has received input from Administration officials.
A story running in today's Oregonian repeats Hatfield's statements
 to the effect that this proposal will give the administraiton what
 it needs, while quoting an anonymous WH official as looking at it
 negatively - that it could make things worse.  Furse and enviros
 are quoted criticizing it and the timber industry is cited as
 suggesting the industry could accept the language.
 I am told by USDA that Hatfield personally feels he has done what
 the Administration has asked for, and that if we reject his
 language, we're not acting in good faith.
