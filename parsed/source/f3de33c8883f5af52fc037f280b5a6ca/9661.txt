TEXT:
Esteemed Colleagues:

Just got off the telephone with Peter and DOJ about the juvie crime bill.
DOJ is much more upbeat about the prospects of getting a workable bill
than most others we've talked to; however, they had not spoken withe
Senate Dems.

Peter and I remarked that while the. bill was not too offensive, it did not
include enough of a victory·for the President (juvie Brady, more on
prosecutors/Boston, or other crime/drug proposal we've introduced) -- and
was still likely to be offensive to key Dems.   We gave them a list of
things to float by the R's, and said they needed to check with the Senate
Dems, too.

Afterwards, I received the attached e-mail from Leahy's office. Doesn't
look the Senate Dems think we're as close as DOJ does.  Still, we should
remain vigilant; Hatch could throw an agreement into the mix at the last
minute.

Jose'

Jose --- sorry I've been so hard to reach.  I thought I'd try to
email blc its late and I'm also losing my voice!

negots wi the senate repubs broke down today blc Hatch and
Sessions can't live wla disprop. minority confinement mandate
even one as soft as that in hr 1818. they are double checking
w/their bosses but negotiations are likely off for good.

democrats in house and senate think it is essential to keep this
protection. otherwise, we were getting real close to what is
accepatable to us ... but unlikely we'll get a bill. K

by the way, I'm sending this at 7 pm on thurs --hope it gets to
you this eve.
