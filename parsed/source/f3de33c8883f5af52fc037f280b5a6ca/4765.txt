TEXT:
Bruce, if you talk to Roemer you can mention that there is a working group
(includes DOL, ED. OSTP, VP) on the virtual university idea ("Learning .on
Demand) and that when he/Levitt are in town it would be helpful for
either/both of them to sit in and discuss what would help these kind of
schools.
