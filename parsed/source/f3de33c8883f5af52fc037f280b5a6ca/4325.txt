·TEXT:
 Here are four options I can see for the Senate Ag. Cmtte Hrngs on Thurs.
 We should get back to them soon, especially if we want option 3.

1. We can clean up their testimony. They shouldn't talk about the
settlement as ending tobacco programs for farmers etc. They could affirm
the President's pledge to make sure farmers aren't negatively effected.
Problem: Right now the testimony needs work, and even once corrected there
would be an Administration spokesperson answering questions who might not
be the best at outlining future administration policy the day after the
POTUS announcement.

2. USDA asked if Bruce would like to testify. I think it might be a good
locale.  It would mostly be about farmers, but he could also clarify
misunderstandings that might have arisen in the day after the announcement.

3.   We could ask them to postpone the hearing or not send someone.

4. They could send someone else, someone more junior who would be vague
or Glickman or someone who could affirm the commitment.
