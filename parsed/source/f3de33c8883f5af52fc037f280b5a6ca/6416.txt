TEXT:
The news from today's hearings is that both chairmen said they will mark
up their bills
next week -- the dates weren't specific, but both implied next Tuesday.

I think we may need a meeting on the FDA jurisdiction issues Jeffords bill
raises -- i.e., do we oppose/support creating a separate title for tobacco
and switching jurisdiction from FDA to CDC? HHS seems to oppose both.
