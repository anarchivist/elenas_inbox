TEXT:
Gene mentioned this morning in Senior Staff that NEC and DPC have been
working with the Presidential Task Force on Employment of Adults w/
Disabilities to look at possible policy announcements or actions involving
disability policies that might be made on July 26 in conjunction with the
anniversary of ADA.  Gene also seemed to make a comment indicating that
these discussions might be complicated by a variety of issues -- and that
a late July event / announcement might not be a sure thing.

Alexis Herman has requested that Erskine meet with and Tony Coelho, Seth
Harris and Becky Ogle to discuss the Task Force's work.  In a short memo
from Sec. Herman's office, four discussion topics were listed for the
meeting:

1)   Task force progress;
2)   President's participation in Second Task Force Meeting;
3)   Collaboration with White House Officials; and
4)   Presidential Directives.

It sounds like the meeting's agenda is to get a commitment from Erskine
that the White House will try to have the President attend the Task
Force's July meeting and make an announcement endorsing the principles
underlying Kennedy-Jeffords, as well as a commitment to work with the two
Senators to produce a mutually agreeable bill the President could sign.

In light of Gene's comments, we wanted to check:

   Should Erskine attend the meeting? Can we do it in a way that won't
disrupt the already working process?
-- Who should be part of the meeting from the White House?  (Chris
Jennings, Diana Fortuna)
-- Is there any paper we can give Erskine when we give him this request
that will help him understand what's been happening from a WH perspective?

Thanks guys. k
