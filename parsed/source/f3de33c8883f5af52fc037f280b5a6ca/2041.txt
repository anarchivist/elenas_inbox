               U.S. Sentencing Commission Report on Crack Cocaine
                                  April 29, 1997

                                  Questions and Answers



Q.     What did the Sentencing Commission recommend today?

A.     The United States Sentencing Commission issued a report today to Congress that
included a recommendation to amend federal law to reduce the disparity between sentences for
crack cocaine and powder cocaine.

        The Sentencing Commission recommends that the triggering amount for the 5-year
mandatory minimum for crack be changed from 5 grams to somewhere between 25 and 75 grams
and that the triggering amount for the 5-year mandatory minimum for powder cocaine be
changed from 500 grams to somewhere between 125 and 375 grams. In other words, they
recommend a "pinch" - - reduce crack cocaine penalties a little and increase powder cocaine
penalties a little to reduce the sentencing disparity. This is only a recommendation to amend
federal law and Congress is not required to act on it.


Q.     Why did the Sentencing Commission recommend this?

A.       Part of the motivation for the Sentencing Commission's proposed recommendations
relates to a concern about the racial impact arising from the current policy structure.

        In addition, the Commission contends that the current 5-graml5-year mandatory sentence
for crack does not properly target serious drug dealers who deserve such a sentence; five grams is
more indicative of a retail or street dealer and not a mid-level dealer. They also contend that the
information and data suggest that some decrease in powder cocaine is warranted and note the
ease with which powder is converted to crack cocaine.


Q.     What is the Administration's position on these recommendations?

A.     The President commends the Sentencing Commission for moving forward on this issue
from their last report. However, this is a very complex issue. He wants the Attorney General
and General McCaffrey to review comprehensively the Sentencing Commission's new report--
which we have just seen -- and then report back to him in 45 days.




                                                 1
                                                                                   Hex·Dump Conversion

Q.     Isn't this the second time that the Commission has had to report on this issue?
       What is the prior history on this issue with the Commission?

A.     The 1994 Crime Bill directed the Sentencing Commission to issue a report and
recommendations on cocaine and federal sentencing policy. On May 1,1995, by a 4-3 vote, the
Sentencing Commission sent to Congress proposed changes to the sentencing guidelines
including reducing crack cocaine penalties so that there would be no disparity between crack and
powder cocaine sentences -- a 1-1 ratio. All 7 members agreed that the sentences should be
equalized but differed over additionally recommended "sentencing enhancements" for violence
and other harms disproportionately associated with crack cocaine.

         Sentencing Commission recommendations to Congress become law unless disapproved
by an Act of Congress within 180 days. In this instance, the Administration sent to Congress
legislation disapproving of the Sentencing Commission recommendation, which Congress passed
and the President signed on October 30, 1995.


Q.     What is current law?

        Current federal sentencing structure pegs mandatory minimums to specific quantities of
drugs distributed. The quantities differ for various drugs and in some cases for different forms
of the same drug. For example, current law treats powder cocaine differently than crack cocaine
by establishing a 100-1 quantity ratio between the two forms of cocaine.

       Thus, a person convicted of selling 500 grams of powder cocaine is subject to the same
5-year mandatory minimum sentences as a person selling 5 grams of crack cocaine, while a
person convicted of selling 5,000 grams of powder is subject to the same 10-year mandatory
minimum as a person selling 50 grams of crack.

       In addition, there is a mandatory minimum penalty for simple possession of crack
cocaine, the only such federal penalty for a first offense of simple possession of a controlled
substance.

        The 1994 Crime Bill included an exception to the mandatory minimum drug penalties --
the "safety valve" -- for certain first-time, non-violent, low-level drug offenders. Thousands of
 defendants have benefitted from the safety valve exception.


Q.     Isn't current drug law discriminatory against blacks?

        It is true that part of the motivation for the Sentencing Commission's proposed
recommendations relates to a concern about the racial impact arising from the current policy
structure.


                                                 2
                                                                          Hex-Dump Conversion

       In 1993, Whites accounted for 30.8 percent of all convicted federal drug offenders,
Blacks 33.9 percent, and Hispanics 33.8 percent. Blacks constituted 88.8 percent of crack cocaine
offenders, while powder cocaine cases involve sizeable proportions of Whites (32%), Blacks
(27.4%), and Hispanics (39.3%). In addition, it should be noted that methamphetamine
offenders are 84.2 percent White.

        It is true that blacks comprise the largest percentage of those affected by the penalties
associated with crack. This doesn't mean that the penalties themselves are racially motivated--
the penalties apply equally to similar defendants, regardless of race. Many criminal statutes,
when enforced, yield a pool of defendants that are not entirely representative of the racial
composition of society or" even of those who break criminal laws. Moreover, Congress did not
act with discriminatory intent in setting different penalties for different forms of cocaine.


Q.     Aren't crack and powder cocaine the same drug?

A.       No. Crack is more psychologically addictive than cocaine powder.       In its last report
to Congress on this issue, the Sentencing Commission concluded that: "[T]he higher addictive
qualities associated with crack combined with its inherent ease of use can support a higher ratio
for crack over powder," and that "crack dealers generally tend to have a stronger association with
systemic violence and are more likely to possess weapons than powder cocaine dealers."


Q.     What is the United States Sentencing Commission? Is it composed of Clinton
       appointees?

A.      The U.S. Sentencing Commission is an independent agency in the judicial branch of
government. The Commission is responsible for developing and monitoring sentencing policies
and practices for the federal courts. The Commission is also charged with promulgating
sentencing guidelines that prescribe the appropriate form and severity of punishment for
offenders convicted of federal crimes. These guidelines are then subject to Congressional
review.

        The Commission's seven commissioners are appointed by the President and confirmed by
the Senate. There are also two non-voting ex-officio members. At least three of the
commissioners must be federal judges and no more than four can be members of the same
political party.




                                                3
                                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion

Q_     What penalty structure does the Administration support? Does the President agree
       with the ranges proposed in the Commission's report?

A.      The President has stated before that there is too great a disparity in the current sentencing
structure. He has also stated that the penalty for trafficking in (powder) cocaine should be
raised. The Commission's recommendation to equalize the penalties for crack and powder
cocaine-- by dramatically lowering the penalties for trafficking crack-- were the wrong approach
then, and are the wrong approach today.

        The President would like to work with Congress to address this issue in a deliberate
manner. In the meantime, the President has asked Attorney General Reno and Director
McCaffrey to undertake a serious review the penalty structure proposed by the Commission and
report back to him with their recommendations in 45 days.


Q.     If the President believes that the current sentencing structure is unfair, does he
       support lowering the penalties for crack cocaine? Does he only support raising
       penalties for trafficking in powder cocaine?

A. This is an extremely complex issue. Simply raising the penalties for powder cocaine
violations will dramatically impact the costs to the federal government of increased incarceration.

        For example, increasing powder penalties to a 5-year mandatory minimum for 100 grams
from the current 500 grams (as the Senators Hatch and Abraham and others propose) could cost
the government about $500 million in the first five years in extra prison expenditures. This
figure could increase to $4.7 billion over 20 years and $9.5 billion over 30 years. So, obviously,
we will need to be mindful of the cost implications as we deliberate over what is the most
appropriate sentencing structure.


Q.     Aren't high crack penalties important for prosecuting dangerous and violent gang
       members? Doesn't the Sentencing Commission new recommendations make it
       easier for dangerous criminals to go unpunished or under punished?

A.     The report's recommendations leave substantial federal tools in place to focus on violent
and dangerous drug trafficking offenders. The Commission's report does not undermine the
ability to seek substantial penalties for crack cases, called "penalty enhancements," when there is
organized drug dealing, if weapons are used, where minors are used in drug trafficking, or the
drugs are sold near schools.
