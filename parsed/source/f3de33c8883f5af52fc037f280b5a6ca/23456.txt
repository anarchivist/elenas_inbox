TEXT:
After talking with Stacie, we would like to use the following words for
the backdrop of the Equal Pay event:

Equal Pay for America's Working Families

Elena, Karen, and Ann -- are you ok with this language?
Communications will need to go to print with it early on Monday, so please
let me know if you have any concerns.  Thanks!

                     "
