Suggested Script:

It is my pl~asure to extend warm greetings to the members of the
National Abortion Federation, as you gather in San Francisco for
your 20th Annual Meeting.   I'd like to congratulate your
outgoing President, Lynne Randall, on a very successful term. I'd
also like to congratulate your Executive Director, Vicki Saporta,
and your incoming President, Joan Coombs, on the new energy and
initiative they bring to your organization.
As the physicians, nurses, counselors and other health care
professionals who work to provide abortion services, you dedicate
your lives every day to making choice real for American women and
their families. Without your medical expertise, your skill, your
compassion, and your commitment, the right to choose would be
just a hollow promise. Today, you celebrate 20 years of
commitment, as NAF once again brings abortion providers together
to pursue the highest standards in medical care.
I'm very proud that, in 1994, we were able to come together and
pass the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act. This law was
desperately needed to curb the rising tide of anti
o
-abortion
violence, and thanks to NAF's vigilance, years of detailed
information about the extent of this violence helped to convince
 "
even many anti
o
-abortion legislators to support the law. I know
that a number of you present today worked hard to help pass the
bill and even came to Washington to testify. The FACE law has
worked. Although threats and violence against abortion providers
do continue, I am pleased to know that NAF's 1995 report on
anti
o
-abortion violence and disruption shows declines in several
types of violence, including death threats. I am also very proud
that the FBI and the Justice Department were able to prevent more
deadly violence by arresting a man in Wisconsin who had amassed
an arsenal of weapons, planning the murder of abortion providers.
Thanks to the FACE law, we have been able to save lives and
protect the rights of women.
I want you to know that, despite news reports to the contrary,
the u.s. Justice Department remains committed to the
investigation and prosecution of acts of anti
o
-abortion violence.
We know that this investigation, and the heightened presence of
law enforcement in the field, has helped to prevent acts of
violence and we hope that it will also bring more criminals to
justice.  Investigations like these are usually slow and
cumbersome, and I know that when you are under siege, it can feel
like nothing is being done. Please be assured that it is a top
priority of my administration to put an end to acts of
anti
o
-abortion violence.

As you know, I have studied the H.R. 1833 issue and prayed for
the families who must face this awful· choice. I have heard and
read the words of families that the National Abortion Federation
has brought forward, families who have gone through the
devastating experience, and I was deeply moved by their
heartbreaking testimony. Families who discover late in wanted
pregnancies that tragedy has struck, robbing them of their hopes
and dreams for a healthy baby, are confronted with one of the
most agonizing ordeals imaginable.   Hillary and I will continue
to include them in our prayers.
I'd like to thank NAF for inviting me to send this message to you
today. I know that your jobs are not easy. It is a terrible thing
to face condemnation, harassment, violence, and even the threat
of death because you act on your principles. I want you to know
that as your President, I honor your courage and believe we have
a duty to find common ground.   I pledge to you that I will
continue to use my office to make sure that legal abortions,
those abortions that the Supreme Court ruled in Roe v. Wade, are
protected. I wish you a successful and productive conference.
