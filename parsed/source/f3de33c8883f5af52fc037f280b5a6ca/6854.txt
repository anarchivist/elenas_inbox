TEXT:
We are trying to arrange a child care/health care event for the First Lady
on April 8. We would release the Medicaid Outreach Manual for Child Care
Workers.  Secretary Shalala really wants to be there, but is doing tobacco
visits that week for the White House. Melissa Skolfield says that Shalala
can be in Washington on the morning of the 8th to do the child care· event
and then go off to do more tobacco stuff and asked that you mention that
to Rich on the calls you are doing with HHS to plan the tobacco week.
Thanks.
