DOMESTIC VIOLENCE/WELFARE REFORM MEETING
Thursday, September 5
4:30-5:50
211 OEOB
As you all know, the Justice Department and HHS have been working on approaches
to highlight the Wellstone domestic violence amendment in the welfare reform
legislation. One idea is to issue an Executive Order modeled after NOW's
document; another is a Presidential statement; still another is a directive to
Sec. Shalala and the Attorney General to issue state guidelines for implementing
the provision.
I'm pulling this meeting together to discuss a) the various options being batted
around; b) the most effective of these options; c) and the best follow-up
procedure.
Sorry for the last minute notice -- it just became clear that there are a couple
of different paths people are taking. We just need to make sure we are all on
the same path.
The following are confirmed for the meeting.  Please let me know if you are able
to attend.
HHS, Confirmed
--Peter Edelamn

HHS, Not Confirmed
--Ann Rosewater
Justice, Confirmed

Thanks.
