 TEXT:

 In summary of yesterday's meeting:
 We will plan to hold a mtg with the CA folks during the week of February


 9-- One question I have is whether we should consider holding this meeting
 in CA and flying out someone from DPC, OPL, IGA, Dept of Ed.  The thinking
 is-- it's easier to move four people than to bring 12-15 people to D.C.
 Just a thought .... Please tell me what you think by COB Friday.

 2.    Those previously   identified, as listed below:

Deborah Escobedo, education lawyer, META
Rosalia Salinas, Former President, CABE
Richard Ross, Ross Communications
Mary Hernandez, San Francisco MALDEF Board
Gloria Molina, LA County Supervisor
Delaine Easton, State Superintendent of Education
Art Torres

CA Legislature:
Cruz Bustamante
Antonio Villaraigosa
Mike Honda
Dede Alpert
Hilda Solis

 Based on our meeting, the following additional people should be invited:

Labor CTA/AFT (Karen Skelton: would you work with Karen Tramontano on this
component)
Business   (I will work w/Cheri Carter on a BRT--or other business
persons-- with views on bilingualism)
CA School Board Association (Mike: will you coordinate how we obtain their
input since they will be in town in late January)
Sarita Brown, Executive Director/Commission on Hispanic Education Board
Members from CA     (Mickey and I are working on this)
Mayor Serna (per Mickey)

3.      Congressional Input: The following members will be solicited for
their input per Legislative Affairs' outreach plan:
Maxine Waters
Xavier Becerra
Bob Matsui
Bobby Scott
Ruben Hinojosa
Patsy Mink

4.      We also agreed that we should solicit input from those who
support the UNZ initiative and meeting with the following was proposed:
Ron Pacheco
Doug Laskers
Jaime Escalante
Gloria Mata Tuckrnan

4.      We also agreed that we should speak with the following persons:
Mayor Riordan
Linda Chavez (I am planning to meet with her)
Legislative Affairs: will you also identify those against bilingual ed
w/whom we should speak?

5.      DPC will circulate its one-pager to POTUS on this issue,
hopefully by the end of the week.

6.      Mickey and I will work with Delia Pompa and Sarita Brown to allay the


 concerns of the Chair and Vice Chair of the Commission on Hispanic
 Education regarding this initiative.

 7.      Questions: We need to agree on when to start inviting these
 people-- and who will be inviting whom--
 My suggestion is that we start making calls at the end of this week or
 early next week.  IGA should be responsible for inviting the elected
 officials and OPL should invite Labor and the other constituencies.

 I thinks this is the basic summary of the decisions and assignments we
 made-- Please let me know if there is anything I left out.

 Thank you.
