TEXT:
Not sure what we're planning to do with this, but Anne Lewis (NEC) and I
are working to get it ready to go by mid April. As you know, our
legislative proposal extends the FMLA to cover an additional 24 hours for
school activities, well-child check-ups, and care of an elderly relative
won't.   You should know that a memo from the President asking agencies to
implement this policy administratively won't give federal employees any
completely new benefits -- under existing law, supervisors can give
employees leave without pay for these activities at the supervisors'
discretion. Still, supervisors often say no, and OPM, Anne and I think
that a memo from the President to the agencies stating they should
implement this policy will make it much more likely that supervisors will
approve leave requests.  We recommend sending the memo, but not
over-selling it.  Not sure how newsworthy it is.   (The legislation gives
employees and entitlement to leave for these activities if they give 7
days notice; we can't give them that legal entitlement w/out legislation).
