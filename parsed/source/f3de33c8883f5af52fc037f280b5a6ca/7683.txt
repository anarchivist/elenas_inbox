         "Our country's law enforcement officers put their lives on the line every day to make our communities safe and
healthy places to raise a family_ Today, we must continue to do everything possible to empower and honor America's law
enforcement officers. "

                                                                            Vice President AI Gore

Today, Vice President Gore joins Attorney General Reno, Secretary Rubin, and Fraternal Order of Police
("FOP") President Gil Gallegos, to honor fallen police officers. In his remarks, the Vice President
announces new legislative proposals to protect law enforcement officials and our families.

TAKING ACTION TO PROTECT OFFICERS AND PUNISH CRIMINALS. The Administration remains determined
to build on initiatives which have helped to reduce crime and protect those who enforce our nation's laws.
Today, the Vice President announces three Administration initiatives: 1) a call for increased prison sentences
for criminals who commit federal crimes while wearing bulletproof vests; 2) legislation to provide funding
for the purchase of bulletproof vests for state and local police officers; and 3) endorsing the FOP's proposal
to create a law enforcement medal of valor to honor those federal, state, and local law enforcement officers
who fall in the line of duty.

INCREASED SENTENCES FOR CRIMINALS THAT WEAR BULLETPROOF VESTS. President Clinton and Vice
President Gore are calling for legislation that provides for sentence enhancement, including an increased
maximum penalty and a minimum mandatory penalty, for any individual who commits a federal crime while
wearing a bulletproof vest. The Administration is also calling on governors and state legislatures to pass
similar legislation.

MORE BULLETPROOF VESTS FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS. The Administration supports the concept
advanced in legislation sponsored by Senators Patrick Leahy (D-VT) and Ben Nighthorse Campbell (R-CO)
and Congressman Peter Visclosky (D-IN) that would establish a federal grant program to help state, local
and tribal law enforcement agencies purchase bulletproof vests for their officers.

A LAW ENFORCEMENT MEDAL OF VALOR FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS. President Clinton and Vice
President Gore are calling for legislation to create a law        enforcement medal of valor to honor those
federal, state and local officers who die in the line of duty, while also inspiring those men and women who
