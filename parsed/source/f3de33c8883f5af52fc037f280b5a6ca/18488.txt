TEXT:
Elena,

As you know, Tom and Mary have been meeting with OMB and the various
agencies to discuss the changes that the EEOC has proposed to how it
processes its federal sector cases.  Sally Katzen headed up an interagency
effort to review the concerns of the affected agencies.  She then sent an
e-mail asking for their views on specific parts of the proposed rule.   OMB
received 10 agency comments in response to her e-mail.  OMB has been
working with the EEOC to make changes to their proposed rule that address
some of the concerns raised by the agencies.  EEOC has agreed to all of
the changes suggested by OMB except the one that addresses the standard of
review for appeals to the OFO (EEOC appeals of AJ decisions) (See Mary's
e-mail of 01/16 that spells these concerns out).

Tomorrow, Danny Warfel from Sally's office is going to call the agencies
that commented on the rule to let them know of the changes EEOC has made
to the rule since the agencies have last seen it. At that time, he will
inform them that they should elevate any further concerns to the GC or
Deputy Secy level and that Sally will have a meeting with any GC's or
Depty Secys that want to voice their concerns. That meeting is going to
take place Monday, January 26th at 2pm.  OMB has invited DPC and EEOC to
attend as well. The place is TBD.   I will let you know as I know more.

Julie
