    Todd-my apologies for not getting to this yesterday as requested--it turned
    out it was not humanly possible, at least not for this human.

    I've reviewed the relevant sections of the book chapter, and my concerns
    about the proposed compact undermining our ESEA proposal are even stronger
    now than before, for the following reasons.

    1.  As you have already indicated, the chapter gives short shrift to the
    ESEA proposal in contrast to the compact proposal, so that the overall
    effect is to convey that a few changes were made to the basic old federal
    program, and then some exciting new ideas are put forth in the compact
    idea.

    2. There is nothing in the chapter that makes the case for doing ESEA now,
    and the compact later, so it will be quite easy for anyone to pick up the
    book and (1) use it to demonstrate the President's support for greater
    flexibility in federal education programs and (2) ask why this idea is not
    incorporated into the President's ESEA proposal.

    3. Over and above the way in which the compact can be used to undermine the
    proposal the President transmitted last week, I still think the compact as
    described has significant flaws on its own terms.

    * First, I simply don't believe we are going to convince many local
    school systems to sign up for an initiative that will lead to a reduction
    in
    federal funding (both new funds and existing ESEA funds) if they don't make
    measurable progress.  I don't see that we are offering a very powerful
    incentive for districts to put a portion of their current flow of federal


funds at risk,  unless the compact offers them a significantly increase pot
of new funds.
* Nowhere does the chapter make the case for why greater flexibility,
with existing or new funds, is a necessary ingredient of the compact.   I
understand and am sympathetic with the approach Chris is advocating, but
the
fact is that 94% of the funds school districts spend on education (state
and
local funds) already are flexible or have only state and local requirements
attached to them. They come with no federal requirements. They are also
less likely to be targeted to the schools and districts with large
concentrations of poor .kids than are federal funds. The compact's new
funds
would be as flexible as what they already have; its not clear how these new
funds will fuel the improvements Chris is looking for, if the total control
that states and districts have over state and local funds hasn't gotten
that
job done.  In fact, there is a pretty good argument to make that strategies
that will lead to increased achievement, such as high quality professional
development for teachers, almost always get short shrift in local budgets
and will not be adequately financed without federal funds dedicated to that
purpose.


Hope this helps, and hope it isn't too late
