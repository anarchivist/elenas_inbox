TEXT:
Below is the VA/HUD FY99 Appropriations Senate SAP.  The Senate expects
to begin consideration TODAY around noon. Therefore, please provide
comments/clearance no later than 12:30pm. Thank you.

S. 2168 -- DEPARTMENTS OF VETERANS AFFAIRS AND
HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT, AND INDEPENDENT AGENCIESAPPROPRIATIONS
BILL, FY 1999                                            (Sponsors:
Stevens (R), Alaska;            Bond (R), Missouri)


       This Statement of Administration Policy provides the
AdministrationD,s views on S. 2168, the Departments of Veterans Affairs


and Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies Appropriations
Bill, FY 1999, as reported by the Senate Appropriations Committee. Your
consideration of the AdministrationO,s views would be appreciated.

        The Administration appreciates efforts by the Committee to
accommodate the PresidentO,s priorities within the 302(b) allocation.
However, the allocation is simply insufficient to make the necessary
investments in programs funded by this bill. As a result, a variety of
critical programs are underfunded, as discussed below.

        The only way to achieve the appropriate investment level is to
offset discretionary spending by using savings in other areas.  The
President's FY 1999 Budget proposes levels of discretionary spending for
FY 1999 that conform to the Bipartisan Budget Agreement by making savings
in mandatory and other programs available to help finance this spending.
In the recently enacted Transportation Equity Act, Congress -- on a broad,
bipartisan basis -- took similar action in approving funding for surface
transportation programs paid for with mandatory offsets.  The Committee
has used part of one such offset in its version of the bill, and we
encourage the Congress to take advantage of such additional offsets.

        Below is a discussion of our specific concerns with the
Committee-reported bill. We look forward to working with you to resolve
these concerns as the bill moves forward.

Department of Housing and Urban Development

        The Administration is deeply concerned about the funding levels
provided for key programs within the Department of Housing and urban
Development, particularly for welfare-to-work vouchers and other programs
such as the Community Empowerment Fund that would expand job opportunities.

         The Administration is very disappointed by the Committee's
decision to fund only 7,000 incremental vouchers through a $40 million
"Self-Sufficiency" housing vouchers pilot program that earmarks funds for
seven specified cities.   In light of recent studies that show historically
high unmet housing need among very low-income Americans, however, the
Administration believes it is critical for the Congress to fund the entire
50,000 welfare-to-work housing vouchers provided for in the President's
request.    Moreover, these welfare-to-work vouchers should be made
available in a way that ensures vouchers are distributed to places with
both the greatest need and the most effective program design.   Full
finding for welfare-to-work housing vouchers will support implementation
of welfare reform by assisting those welfare recipients who need housing
assistance to get or keep a job.

        The Administration encourages the Congress to fund fully the
President's request for $400 million for a Community Empowerment Fund to
generate jobs in distressed communities. The Committee provides only $85
million as a set-aside within the existing CDBG program, with over 75
perce~t earmarked for specific projects.

        The Administration appreciates the Committee's decision to fund a
number of programs at the levels requested and to renew all expiring
Section 8 contracts. Likewise, we appreciate the Committee's decision to
increase funding for Homeless Assistance Grants above FY 1998 levels. We
would strongly oppose, however, a rigid set-aside for permanent housing,
which would reduce the ability of each local entity to adopt the most
effective response to the homeless challenge unique to that area.
Further, the Administration is disappointed by the absence of funding for


     Regional Opportunity Counseling, a voluntary effort to expand the housing
     and employment opportunities available to low-income families.   We urge
     the Senate to provide additional resources for the Fair Housing
     Initiatives Program in order to reduce housing discrimination that remains
     all too common. The Administration encourages the Senate to fund fully a
     number of other areas -- Brownfields, Regional Connections, Office of Lead
     Hazard Control, and the Partnership for Advancing Technologies in Housing
     (PATH) Initiative.

             The Administration appreciates the Committee's decision to raise
     the limit on FHA single-family loans. The Administration urges the
     Congress to provide even greater homeownership opportunities by increasing
     FHAO,s loan limit to the GSE "conforming" limit.   In addition, the
     Administration urges the Congress to adopt the Administration's proposal
     to reform HUD's single-family property disposition program, which would
     produce substantial savings by improving the efficiency of FHAD,s property
     disposition processes.

             Finally, the Administration is concerned about the Committee's
     decision not to fund $304 million in FHA administrative expenses.
     Appropriated funds are FHA's only source for contracting for vital
     management services for its insurance funds.

     Environmental Protection Agency

             The Administration has several major concerns with the
     CommitteeD,s mark for the Environmental Protection Agency.   In particular,
     the Administration strongly objects to the action of the Committee to
     reallocate approximately $600 million of funds that were already agreed to
     last year to accelerate Superfund cleanups. This reduction would delay
     cleanups at sites nationwide and needlessly jeopardize public health. The
     Administration urges the Senate to restore Superfund to the levels agreed
     to last year for FY 1999 and to delete restrictive language preventing use
     of brownfields funding for revolving loan funds.

             While the Administration appreciates the increases provided for
     the Clean Water Action Plan, we urge the Senate to provide the
     PresidentO,s full request to prevent pollution run-off and protect public
     health.  In addition, the Administration strongly urges the Congress to
     restore the $50 million request to help improve water quality in Boston
     Harbor and prevent beach closings.

             The Administration strongly opposes the CommitteeO,s $91 million
     reduction in EPA funding for the Climate Change Technology Initiative.
     This high-priority program should be fully funded to cut energy usage,
     save consumers money, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We will work
     with the Congress to restore requested funding as the bill moves forward.
     The Administration is also concerned about the report language relating to
     this initiative, which is so broad that it could be interpreted to
     preclude or terminate many on-going activities that are already authorized
     by existing laws and treaties.  In addition, the Administration objects to
     the report language requiring a detailed Government Performance and
     Results Act (GPRA) plan relating to Climate Change activities.  Such a
     plan is premature and app
