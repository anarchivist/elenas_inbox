 TEXT:
 I think the agenda is good.   I think we need a couple of tangible products
 that can be distributed to officials speaking for the Administration: (1)
 a common theme statement that everyone uses on why we need the bill --
 like Medicare, Medicaid, Education, and the Environment (a crack at it is
 below) ;  (2) uniform responses to common attacks on the bill that we know
 from polling works; and (3) being prepared for rapid response generally --
 including creating lists of issue·s and target reporters to get materials
 and responders to.


 1. Identify a common theme.

 The most popular list of reasons for a bill I have is: ads, FDA, second
 hand smoke, and $1.50 with net lives saved.

  "We need strong comprehensive legislation that stops advertising to kids,
 regulates nicotine under the FDA like the drug it is, and restricts deadly
 second-hand smoke that kills non-smokers. If we do these things and raise
 the cost of cigarettes by $1.50 a pack with tough penalties on companies
 we can save XX million kids over the next 5 years."

 2.     Need Defenses on Issues such as:

      Drugs

      Lawyers Fees

      Black market

      Immunity

      Medicare, tax cuts, other spending ideas

      skinny bill would work fine


 3.  Rapid Response-- monitoring, preparation of answers, and response to
 targeted reporters




       4.   Background to Communications

       * People want stern measures

       *  Saying our bill does everything a skinny bill does and more, beats the
       skinny bill (simple but true).

       *    Public believes we need more than a $1 a pa,ck increase.

       * Tying opposi·tion to the tobacco industry controlling Congress or R' s
       playing politics works but might cut against bipartisanship so should be
       used carefully.
