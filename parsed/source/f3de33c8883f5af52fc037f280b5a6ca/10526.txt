 CARE INITIATIVE TO SUPPORT FAMILY CAREGIVERS AND HELP ADDRESS GROWING
                          LONG-TERM CARE NEEDS
                               January 4,1999

Today, President Clinton is unveilipg an historic new initiative to support Americans with long-term care
needs and the millions of family members who care for them. This four-part, $6.2 billion (over five
years) initiative takes important steps to address complex long-term care needs through: (1) an
unprecedented $1,000 tax credit that compensates for formal or informal costs Americans of all ages with
long-term care needs or the family caregivers who support them; (2) a new National Family Caregivers
Support Program that provides a range of critical services for caregivers such as respite, home care
services, and information and referral; (3) a national campaign to educate Medicare beneficiaries about the
programs' limited coverage and how best to evaluate long-term care options; and (4) a proposal to have
the Federal government serve as a model employer by offering quality private long-term care insurance to
Federal employees at group rates.

The President is being joined by the First Lady, Secretary Rubin, Secretary Shalala, and OPM Director
LaChance to unveil this initiative at the White House and the Vice President and Mrs. Gore are
participating from an adult day care center in California, one of four States with model statewide family
careglvmg resource programs.

MILLIONS OF AMERICANS HAVE LONG-TERM CARE NEEDS

        More and more Americans have a range of long-term care needs. Over five million
        Americans have significant limitations due to illness or disability and thus require long-term care.
        Approximately, two-thirds are older Americans. Also, millions of adults and a growing number
        of children have long-term care needs because of health condition from birth or a chronic illness
        developed later in life.

        The aging of Americans will only increase the need for quality long-term care options. The
        number of Americans age 65 years or older will double by 2030 (from 34.3 to 69.4 million), so
        that one in five Americans will be elderly. The number of people 85 years or older, nearly half of
        whom need assistance with everyday actiyities, will grow even faster (from 4.0 to 8.4 million).

  MULTI-FACETED INITIATIVE TO SUPPORT FAMILY CAREGIVERS AND ADDRESS
. GROWING LONG TERM CARE NEEDS. The President is unveiling a four-part initiative that is
  designed to address the broad-based and varied long-term care needs. It will: provide immediate support
  and assistance for the millions of Americans who care for family members with major long-term care
  needs; educate the elderly and people with disabilities about long-term care issues and options; and
  promote new promising strategies directions for long-term care policy for the twenty-first century. The
  President also called on the Vice President to host a series of forums around the nation to raise awareness
  about the need to support family caregivers and address the growing need for long-term care options.




                                                                       Automated Records Managemem ·)v ,,'
                                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion

       Supporting families with long-term care needs through an historic $1,000 tax credit. This initiative,
       for the first time, acknowledges and supports millions of Americans with long-tenn care needs or
       the family members who care for and house their ill or disabled relatives through a $1,000 tax
       credit. This new tax credit supports the diverse needs of families by compensating a wide range
       of fonnal or infonnallong-tenn care for people of all ages with three or more limitations in
       activities of daily living (ADLs) or a comparable cognitive impainnent. This proposal, which
       supports rather than supplants family caregiving, would provide needed financial support to about
       2 million Americans, including 1.2 million older Americans, over 500,000 non-elderly adults, and
       approximately 250,000 children. It costs $5.5 billion over five years and phases out beginning at
       $110,000 for couples and $75,000 for unmarried taxpayers.

       Creating an unprecedented National FamiJy Caregiver Support Program. Recent studies have found
       that services like respite care can relieve caregiver stress and delay nursing home entry, and that
       support for families of Alzheimer's disease patients can delay institionalization for as long as a
       year. This new nationwide program, strongly advocated by the Vice President, would support
       families who care for elderly relatives with chronic illnesses or disabilities by enabling states to
       create "one-stop-shops" that provide: quality respite care and other support services; critical
       infonnation about community-based long-tenn services that best meet a families' needs; and
       counseling and support, such as teaching model approaches for caregivers that are coping with
       new responsibilities and offering training for complex care needs, such as feeding tubes. This
       program, which costs $625 million over five years, would assist approximately 250,000 families
       nationwide.

·      Launching a national campaign to educate Medicare beneficiaries about the programs'
       limited coverage of long-term care and how best to evaluate their options. Nearly 60 percent
       of Medicare beneficiaries are unaware that Medicare does not cover most long-tenn care, and
       many do not know what long-tenn care services would best meet their needs. This $10 million
       nationwide campaign would provide all 39 million Medicare beneficiaries with critical
       infonnation about long-tenn care options including: what long-tenn care Medicare does and does
       not cover; how to find out about Medicaid long-tenn care coverage; what to look for in a quality
       private long-tenn care policy; and how to access infonnation about home-and community-based
       care services that best fit beneficiaries' needs.

       Having the Federal government serve as a model employer by offering quality private
       long-term care insurance to Federal employees. The President also called on Congress to pass
       a new proposal that allows aPM to use its market leverage and set a national example by offering
       non-subsidized, quality private long-tenn care insurance to all federal employees, retirees, and their
       families at group rates. This proposal, that costs $15 million over five years, will provide
       employers a nationwide model for offering quality long-tenn care insurance. OPM anticipates
       that approximately 300,000 Federal employees would participate in this program.
