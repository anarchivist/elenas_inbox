                               Talking Points on DC Vouchers
                                DRAFT -- September 17,1997



General Points:

·      The Administration strongly opposes any legislation allowing the use of Federal taxpayer
       funds for vouchers, including in D.C.

·      Instead, we need to focus on strengthening the public schools that serve the vast majority
       of students and expanding choice within the public education system, such as through
       charter schools that only stay open as long as they do a good job.

·      Vouchers would siphon critical dollars from neighborhood public schools that are already
       short on resources in order to send a few selected students to private schools, and would
       distract attention from the hard work of reform needed to change failing schools into
       good schools and good schools into outstanding schools.


Q:     Doesn't the failure ofthe DC schools to manage so basic a task as to open their schools
       on time call into question the capacity of the school system here to improve? Shouldn't
       vouchers be allowed here at least?

A:     The delay in opening the DC schools has been very unfortunate. However, vouchers
       would do nothing to speed the process of repairing DC schools, and would accomplish
       nothing for the vast majority of students who will continue to attend these schools.
       Instead, we need to confront the real problems that DC and many other urban school
       systems have, by raising standards, putting into place effective reform strategies, and
       holding students, teachers and schools accountable for their performance. Establishing
       vouchers in DC would set a dangerous precedent for using taxpayer funds to support
       schools that are unaccountable to the public.
