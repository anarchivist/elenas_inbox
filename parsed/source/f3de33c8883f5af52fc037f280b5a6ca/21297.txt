TEXT:
I. attended a meeting this morning with Maria E. to discuss the issue of
the African Burial ground that was discovered in lower Manhattan.

Some years ago, during construction of a federal building in lower
Manhattan, an African burial ground was found (from 17th or 18th
century). GSA (who was the builder) has been managing the removal of the
remains and other "mitigation" efforts since then, including the
development of a research project (with Howard Univ.), and a memorial.   In
1992, Congress specified that $3 million should be set aside to manage
this project.  Since then, the project has grown in .scale and is now
projected to cost close to $16 million.  Some advocates want more to be
done, including an environmental impact study and an extensive on-site
archeology project. There is interest in this issue from some members of
Congress (Lewis, Hilliard, D'Amato, Nadler) and some advocates.

The questions for us are: (1) who should be managing this project, with
options including both federal govt. agencies, state govt., local govt., a
private historical society, a university (GSA -- understandably -- wants
to get out of managing this); (2) what should be the scope of the project;
and (3) how do we manage the relations with Howard Univ. (who have been
involved to date and who have an interst in the forensic part of the
project) .

As next steps. OMB is going to figure out how much GSA has spent and
determine whether they have notified Congress (as they are supposed to) on
expenditures in excess of 1.6 million.  David is also going to talk to
Michael D. and Josh G. about where (within the federal govt.) this may be
best managed.  Broderick is going to check in with members of Congress.
