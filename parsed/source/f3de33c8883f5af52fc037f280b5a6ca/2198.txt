TEXT:
Rahm is going to meet with Gil on May 14th. He is prepared to take on the
issue of collective bargaining and let Gil give him hell on it. Rahm did
confirm that he thinks the President should be given the memo today or
tomorrow if it is ready.  He thinks the President should be up to speed on
the issue, but Rahm's hope is that by meeting with Gil first the issue
will not come up when Gil meets the President on the 15th.
