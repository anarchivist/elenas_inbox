Should have forwarded this to you as well as to Bruce.     Bruce had seen a
clip on this, and asked if we could put a stop to it.

As you will tell, nothin's easy.

Attached FYI.

ED basically has   (1) a legalistic defense (the special ed law mandates
that we provide these captioning services to certain classes of programs;
they changed the law but it won't take effect for a few years, etc.); a
(2)  deaf-people-have-rights-to-watch-trash defense; and a (3) we-don't
decide the tv-shows-we-just-provide-the-$ defense.

Riley is pretty firm on not doing anything to restrict the programs that
are selected for closed captioning--I went through this argument with him
two years ago when a similar flap erupted when it was discovered that ED
was paying for closed captioning for Baywatch.

On the legal side, I've asked for clarification as to whether ED is
required under law to fund closed captioning for all programs in the areas
listed below, or if there is some discretion within those categories.

On the political side--it will take a strong press from here, with a lot
more juice than I've got on my own, to force Riley to change positions.
In addition, he testifies before Senate approps and before one other
committee today; the extent to which this issue comes up and how it is
handled will either force him to reassess, or convince him that the storm
will blow over.

I'll stay on top of this--you need to figure out how hard you want to
fight on this.

Subject: Background on Jerry Springer

      As you may know, there have been some recent news stories related to
a
       letter sent to Secretary Riley by Senators Coates and Lieberman
       expressing concern about federal funding for tv captioning of the
       Jerry Springer show. Here is some background on the issue and a Q/A
      'we've done for the Secretary should this topic come up during
       Congressional testimony today.

      After meeting with the Secretary on this issue yesterday, the
      Department's position remains the same as in the past when this topic
      has arisen over controversial programming such as Baywatch -- we
      cannot deny access to the deaf community for tv programming which is
      otherwise available to those who can hear.  As mandated by Congress
      under the IDEA act, ED provides funding for grants to organizations
      which provide closed captioning for television programs nationwide.
We
      are mandated to provide captioning funding for educational and
      cultural programming including news and public information, movies
and
      special programs, childrens shows, and syndicated daytime programs
      (Springer falls under the later) .

      Judy Heumann convened a meeting yesterday of members of the deaf
      community and deaf staffers who adamantly agree with ED's position on
      this issue and do not think they should be denied access to any tv
      programming but should have captioning available to them so that they
      can make informed decisions about what to watch on tv.

      ED grants funds to organizations for captioning recommended by a
      review panel from the deaf community. The deaf and hard of hearing
      community are deciding what should be captioned -- not ED.

      You should also know that under the reauthorization of the IDEA act,
      which takes effect October 2001, ED will no longer fund captioning
for
      programs under the "culture" category. The grant in question was
      awarded in 1996, prior to a change in statute.

      Q. Mr. Secretary. some Senators have raised concerns about the
      Department's funding of closed captioing for the Jerry Springer show.
      What do you have to say in response?

     A. From what I've been told. the Jerry Springer show is not something
      I'd choose to watch either but members of the deaf community should
      have the opportunity to make this determination for themselves.   This
      is an issue that the deaf' community feels very strongly about.  If I
      were a deaf parent and my children wanted to watch shows like this.
      I'd want to know what it was to judge it for myself.   The FCC is the
      proper forum in which to address concerns about proper tv
programming.
·
      Closed captioning was created more than thirty years ago to give
      members of the hearing impaired community access to American
      television. We provide funding for 40% of closed captioning services
      nationwide, for tv programs from CNN's Burden of Proof to Barney,
      including C-Span and Sesame Street, news, sports and movies. Given
the
      fact that persons who are deaf or hard of hearing want to watch the
      same television programs as their hearing peers, it is not our role
to
      deny access to those programs available to the general population.


      Call me if you need anything else from us. I'll fax you over some
      clips on this too.
