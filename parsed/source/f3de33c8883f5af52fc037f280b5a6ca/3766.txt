1_ Impact of 1993 Economic Plan
2. Impact of 1997 Balanced Budget Agreement

III.   Implementing New Initiatives in Balanced Budget Agreement

Welfare lobs Initiative -- The reconciliation bill includes the President's proposal to create $3
billion Welfare to Work Jobs Challenge to move long-tenn welfare recipients into lasting,
unsubsidized jobs. These funds can be used for job creation, job placement and job
retention efforts, including wage subsidies to private employers, transportation and
other critical post-employment support services. The Labor Department will provide
oversight but the dollars will be placed, through the Private Industry Councils, in the
hands of the cities who are on the front lines of the welfare reform effort.

Welfare-to-Work Tax Credit -- This provision will give employers an added incentive to
hire long-term welfare recipients by providing a credit eqnal to 35% ofthe fIrst $10,000
in wages in the fIrst year of employment, and 50% ofthe fIrst $10,000 in wages in the
second year, paid to new hires who have received welfare for an extended period. The
credit is for two years per worker to encourage not only hiring, but also retention.

Brownfields Tax Incentive - The tax incentive will be available for three years. The
Treasury Department estimates that this $1.5 billion tax incentive will leverage more than $6
billion for private sector deanups nationwide, aUowing redevelopment of14,000 brownfields.
It is not yet clear whether EPA and HUD will be successful in securing funding for their
proposed expansion of the Brownfield pilot program

Increased CDFI Budget Allocation -- The House has agreed to fund the progrllJ11 at $125
million next year.

2nd Round of Empowerment Zones -- the reconciliation bill includes, a second round of
EZs -15 urban and 5 rural EZs. The new EZs will benefit from a different blend of tax
credits from fIrst-round EZs. They will be eligible for the BrownfIelds tax incentive,
special expensing of business assets, and qualifIcation for private-activity bonds. The
selection of the new Empowerment Zones is a major initiative on its own.

DC revitalization plan

IV. Possible New Initiatives

The Ten Best Mayors Tour -- The working group would identify the ten most successful
mayors, Democrats and Republicans, and go and meet with them and their staffs to discuss
their best economic development ideas: Lead DPCINEC.

Affordable Housing and Housing Mobility -- Look at a possible expansion of vouchers and
the difficult issues involved with housing mobility: Lead HUD.
                                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion
Expand Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC)-- The President fulfilled in 1993 his
commitment to make this credit permanent. LISC has proposed lifting the cap on the LIHTC
to allow for expanded use of the credit targeted to the development of housing for individuals
moving out of public housing. Lead Treasury and HUD.

Fannie MaelFreddie Mac -- Both of these organizations remain a still untapped resource of
housing for low-income individuals: Lead Treasury and HUD.

Serving the "Unbanked" -- Treasury is engaging in an effort to further expand lending,
investment, and basic banking services to the unbanked. This includes an initiative to
provide money to financial institutions to insure that A TM use is free for individuals living in
distressed communities, financial education programs, etc.: Lead Treasury.

Metropolitan Zones -- Proposals to encourage metropolitan planning: Lead OMB, CEQ.

Sustainable Development -- Brownfields is the best example this Administration has of
combining good environmental policy with sound economic development design. CEQ has
undertaken a large effort to review current best practices of sustainable development. The
working group needs to task them with coming up with their best ten ideas to promote the
cleanup of the environment and encourage private investment in our cities: Lead EPA, CEQ,
Treasury, HUD.
