TEXT:
Wednesday I will write you a more comprehensive note about child support
enforcement .... but I can't leave tonight without telling you that
apparently, as part of a directors review, Frank Raines brainstormed his
way to an idea of how to completely revamp the financial structure of the
child support system, and OMB wants to put this on the table for the
budget discussions. Before you get too jazzed, Elena, he does not want to
hand over responsibility to the IRS!

Below is a quick summary ... They view this as a possible saver in the
budget (although why we would want to be seen as cutting funding for child
support enforcement, I don't know).    Process-wise, I think it's critical
that we have an OMB-DPC discussion before this becomes part of the larger
budget discussion. HHS doesn't know any of this yet, but OMB wants to
tell them they're adding it to the list for consideration.

Current Structure
There are three basic parts to the current financial structure:

 1) The federal government reimburses states for 66 percent of their child
 support expenditures, with an enhanced match for certain expenses.

2) The federal government gives states incentive payments based on
performance. We have a proposal with bipartisan support on the Hill now
which would revise the measure·s on which performance is based.

3) At the same time as the federal government pays states funds for child
support, it collects from states a share of child support collections from
AFDC families -- under the theory that the federal. government helped
(through AFDC, and now TANF) to support these families when the absent
parent would not, and should therefore obtain a share of the support later
collected from that absent parent. Overall, the federal government gives
states about $1 billion more a year in child support funds than it obtains
in collections.

Proposed Structure
Raines' idea is to provide states with a block grant, and require them to


maintain their current spending in exchange for being able to keep all the
collections from welfare families.  In addition, the feds would distribute
incentive funds based on peformance. The block grant amount would be set
so that overall, the federal government saves money compared to current
spending. Keith Fontenot says that even though this would provide states
with l~ss money to collect child support, they could easily make up the
difference by add a fee to the child support collected from non-custodial
parents of non-welfare families.

It seems to me that this could get us into an enormous pissing match with
states just when we're trying to threaten, prod, and cajole them into
focusing on getting their state-wide computer systems up and running and
implementing the new child support rules we enacted last year.    Even if
we make the new structure revenue neutral at the national level, it will
not be revenue neutral at the state level, since a block grant will hurt
states incurring' large new expenses and help those that already invested,
say, in computer systems.
