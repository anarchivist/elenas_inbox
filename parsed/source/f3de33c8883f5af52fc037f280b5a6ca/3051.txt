authorize the use of Federal funds for needle exchange programs unless there is conclusive
evidence that they do not encourage drug use. Although there is strong evidence that indicates
that needle exchange programs help reduce the spread of AIDS, HHS is currently concluding its
review on whether these programs increase the use of drugs. Local communities remain free to .
use non-Federal funds to support such programs.

We are facing increasing pressure from the AIDS community and from the Mayors' Conference
in San Francisco for the Administration to conclude that there is no problem with increased drug
use and therefore authorize cities to access the CDC-allocated prevention block grant for needle
exchange programs. Because conservative Republicans are fearful that the Administration may
move in this direction, they are planning to take away the Secretary's authority to grant local
communities access to these dollars. We are pursuing legislative options through the
appropriations process to assure that the Secretary's discretion is retained. We will be
forwarding a memo to you in short order to review ways in which we might proceed. It will
include not only options to retain the current Secretaries discretion but also suggestions for how
to implement any decision that authorizes Federal dollars in this area.


Release of HHS Guidelines on HIV Treatment. Thursday, NIH released HHS guidelines on
HIV treatment procedures. This announcement was well received by the medical community
and the AIDS community as an important contribution which will help doctors provide
app'ropriate treatment. We encouraged HHS to downplay this announcement since we were
concerned that it would only provide AIDS activists with new reason to call for additional federal
funding to cover the recommended treatment. Not surprisingly, the AIDS activists succeeded
in turning this positive story into a rationale for why the Congress and the Administration should
appropriate more dollars for coverage of protease inhibitors. We can expect the drumbeat in this
area only to increase in the upcoming months, and we will have to determine whether it is
appropriate to propose additional funding in this area and if so decide what the best legislative
vehicle would be.

Congressional Action on Health Care. The Senate Finance Committee reported out its health
care provisions on Medicare, Medicaid and children's coverage expansions this week. The
Medicare provisions preserved many of the Administration's priorities including: new plan
options, such as preferred provider organizations, provider sponsored organizations; preventive
benefits (most of your mammography expansions excluding copayments, colorectal screening,
etc.) and traditional provider and beneficiary savings, which combined with your home health
care reallocation, will extend the life of the Medicare trust fund for at least a decade. It also
reduced the size of the MSA demonstration to 100,000. The committee did include a number of
reforms that exposed beneficiaries to additional costs, including a new income-related
deductible, $5 per visit home care copayment, and a proposal to phase in the Medicare retirement
from age 65 to 67. We anticipate that all three of these provisions will be dropped either on the
Senate floor next week or in the joint House/Senate conference.

    The Medicaid provisions included a Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) proposal that cuts
    payments to high DSH states much more significantly than either your original budget proposal
    or the House Commerce Committee. It also did not include a number of the low-income
    Medicare beneficiary investments, and it did not provide for the entire allocation of savings for
    the DC and Puerto Rico Medicaid provisions. The Administration will insist that those
    investments are fulfilled, consistent with the Budget Agreement. The initial indication from the
    Republican leadership is that they will try to helpful in this regard. Regarding the DSH cuts, we
    are attempting to find ways to moderate the impact on these states, but to date are having
    difficulty attracting much Congressional support.
