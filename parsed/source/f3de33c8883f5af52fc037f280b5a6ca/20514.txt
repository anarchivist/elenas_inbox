TEXT:
The Senate Full Committee is also marking up the Interior Appropriations
bill today at 2pm; therefore, we need your comments/clearance no later
than noon today.   (Don't worry about spacing) Thanks.

The Honorable Ted Stevens
Chairman
Committee on Appropriations
United States Senate
Washington, D.C.  20510

Dear Mr. Chairman:

        The purpose of this letter is to provide the Administration's
views on the Department of the Interior and Related Agencies
Appropriations Bill, FY 1999, as reported by the Senate Subcommittee.      As


the Committee develops its version of the bill, your consideration of the
Administration's views would be appreciated. These views are based on
incomplete information and are, therefore, necessarily preliminary.  Based
on preliminary information, due to inadequate funding levels for priority
programs and unacceptable language riders, discussed below, the
Secretaries of the Interior, Agriculture, and Energy would recommend that
the President veto the bill if it were presented to him as approved by the
Subcommittee.

         The Administration appreciates efforts by the Subcommittee to
accommodate certain of the PresidentO,s priorities within the 302(b)
allocation. However, the allocation is simply insufficient to make the
necessary investments in programs funded by this bill. The only way to
achieve the appropriate investment level is to offset discretionary
spending by using savings in other areas.   The President's FY 1999 Budget
proposes levels of discretionary spending for FY 1999 that conform to the
Bipartisan Budget Agreement by making savings in mandatory and other
programs available to help finance this spending.   In the recently enacted
Transportation Equity Act, Congress -- on a broad, bipartisan basis
took similar action in approving funding for surface transportation
programs together with mandatory offsets. The Administration urges the
Congress to consider such mandatory proposals for other priority
discretionary programs.

Departments of the Interior and Agriculture.

       The Administration objects to inadequate funding provided by the
Subcommittee for high priority programs, including:

  the Millennium program protecting artifacts of our National heritage;

 land acquisition providing protection for the Everglades;

 facilities maintenance providing safe visits to national parks and other
Federal lands;
 the Clean Water Action Plan to clean up AmericaO,s ground and surface
waterways;

 the Disaster Information Network providing enhanced data to protect
Americans;

 the Endangered Species Programs, including landowner incentive grants;
and,

 BIA education operations and the Indian Country law enforcement
initiative providing both opportunities and protection to tribal members,
particularly children.

        We stand ready to work with the Congress to achieve sufficient
offsets to support these investments with proposed savings identified in
the PresidentO,s budget.

        The Administration urges the Committee to report a clean bill that
does not attempt to roll back environmental protections and circumvent the
public hearing process by attaching riders to appropriation bills.
Unfortunately, based on our preliminary review, the Subcommittee bill
contains a number of problematic language riders. The Administration
strongly objects to language of the Subcommittee bill that would:

 unwisely terminate the Interior Columbia Basin Ecosystem Management


Project in six Northwest States;

         require timber sales from national forests to be 3.8 billion
board feet rather than the 3.4 billion board feet assumed in the FY 1999
Budget, thereby increasing timber sale administrative funding at the
expense of other priority programs;

         mandate a high timber sale level on the Tongass National Forest
in Alaska, which would supersede environmental laws;

 establish an easement across the Izembek National wildlife Refuge and
wilderness area in Alaska;

 prohibit Grizzly Bear reintroduction into the Selway-Bitteroot area of
Idaho and Montana;

 means-test tribes as a basis for redistributing Tribal Priority
Allocation funding;

 prohibit the regulation of commercial fishing in Glacier Bay National
Park in Alaska;

 place unnecessary limits on Federal land acquisitions in Alaska;

 delay or prohibit dam removals on the Elwha, Columbia, and Snake Rivers
in the Pacific Northwest;  automatically extend the term of grazing leases
that are undergoing review by the Bureau of Land Management; and,  delay
implementation of environmental protections for hardrock mining
reclamation on Federal lands.

Department of Energy

        While higher than the House Subcommittee mark, the Senate
Subcommittee's funding level represents a very objectionable $161 million
reduction to the President's request for Energy Conservation.  The
Subcommittee mark would be particularly damaging to the Partnership for a
New Generation of Vehicles and to new efforts to develop clean diesel
engines for light trucks.  It would also impede valuable cooperation with
industry on improved industrial energy efficiency.

        The President's budget requests $36 million for payment to the
State of California for the Retired Teachers System, which is not included
in the Subcommittee bill. The Administration prefers that this payment be
appropriated consistent with P.L. 104-106.

Indian Health Service

        The Administration is concerned that the increases requested for the
PresidentO,s Race Initiative, alcohol and substance abuse initiative, and
for first-year construction of the Fort Defiance Health Facility, is not
included. The Administration intends to work with the Committee to fund
these important initiatives within funds available for IHS.

Cultural Agencies

        The Administration appreciates the Subcommittee's commitment to funding
for the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA). We urge the Committee to
provide funding for NEA and NEH at the President's requested level of $136
million each and for the Institute for Museum and Library Services at the
requested level of $26 million.
·


             Likewise, the Administration appreciates the Subcommittee's
    support for the other cultural agencies funded by this bill, including
    funding for the National Museum of the American Indian and restoration of
    the Star Spangled Banner in the Smithsonian Institution, and the full
    request for the National Gallery of Art, the Holocaust Museum, and the
    Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.   However, the Administration urges
    the Committee to provide the full $40 million request for repair and
    restoration in the Smithsonian Institution, in order to allow the
    Institution to proceed with its plans for addressing critical
    deficiencies, particularly in the Natural History Museum, the American Art
    Museum and Portrait Gallery, the Arts and Industries Building, and the Smi
    thsonian Castle.

            We look forward to working with the Committee to address our
    mutual concerns.

                                                    Sincerely,




                                                    Jacob J. Lew
                                                    Acting Director




    Identical Letter Sent to The Honorable Ted Stevens,
    The Honorable Robert C. Byrd, and The Honorable Slade Gorton
