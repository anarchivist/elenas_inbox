TEXT:
Rahm/Elena/Karen:

Please let me know if you have any thoughts on the proposed crack letter.
Chuck B. gave me some minor edits. And Peter proposed softening up some
of the language, dropping the comment on Abraham's bill, and adding a
bullet specif ically on afterschoo·l programs.

I'll check-in w/Kent as well.

Jose'
