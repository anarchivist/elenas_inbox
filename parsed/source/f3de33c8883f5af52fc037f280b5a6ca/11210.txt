TEXT:
I just wanted to give you all a run down of the initial meeting yesterday
on next week's CHIP Outreach Event.

The event will be in the East Room, probably starting around 1:30pm or
2:00pm.

Speaking Program:
FLOTUS
Sec. Shalala
Gov. Carper
Gov. Leavitt
POTUS

In the Ann Lewis    meeting yesterday it was decided to keep the speaking
program to these    5 people, and not add a "real person". Also, members of
congress will be    invited to attend, but no speaking roles will be
offered/kept for    them.

The President will introduce the First Lady's PSA (and possibly others
from NBC or ABC), and the 1-800 number would be displayed on the tv
monitors while not being used to show the PSA.

There will be an audience of about 150-170 people consisting of those
people who have made commitments to the National Campaign, including media
types, corporates, religious organizations, etc.

Please let me know if anyone has any questions about the event.     Thanks!
