I included a follow-up memo in the VP's briefing book last night.  It
noted that both of the options presented in the decision memo included
time lines that begin soon after the President announces the 1999 budget.
Additionally, that regulations, guidelines and application materials are
all contingent upon which option is selected.

Ron is aware of the time sensitivity and is pressing for a decision.

I will let you know as soon as I hear.

Happy New Year!
