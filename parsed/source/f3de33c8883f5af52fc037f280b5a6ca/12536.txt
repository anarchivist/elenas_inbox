TEXT:
I went to the Troops to Teachers mtg today with Congressman Roemer
 (Indiana), Congressman Davis (Florida), and Education Department staff.

We briefed them on our "Troops to teachers:transitions to Teaching"
proposal, and they seemed extremely supportive.  In fact, they are so
supportive and enthusiastic that they would like to introduce legislation
apart from ESEA that includes this and perhaps other teacher recruitment
initiatives aimed partly at mid-career professionals.   Roemer expressed
skepticism about whether ESEA would move this year, and thought that
momentum could be created to pass this bill -- and/or include in some kind
of conference agreement at the end of the year, similar to class size last
year.

We said we would get back to them about" our view on this.
