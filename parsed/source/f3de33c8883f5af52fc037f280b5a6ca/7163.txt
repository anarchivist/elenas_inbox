     WASHINGTON, April 20 /PRNewswire/ -- The following statement should be
     attributed to Scott Williams, tobacco industry spokesperson, in response to
     the President's comments today regarding tobacco legislation:

         "There is a growing understanding across the country that Washington's
     real agenda is to fund a huge tax-and-spend program while saying it
     wants to pass comprehensive legislation. The industry has been open and
     honest about what it can and will do to transform the way tobacco
     products are manufactured, marketed, and sold in this country.  Instead
     of seeking a comprehensive solution that will work, Washington has
     decided that politics is more profitable for government. The industry
     does not expect to win a popularity contest, but the country does not
     like big brother government run amok.   The tobacco plan the
     Administration supports will raise over half a trillion dollars in new
     taxes to fund a host of programs and special interests unrelated to
     smoking and public health.    It will create 17 new federal
     bureaucracies, and force the price of a pack of cigarettes over $5 in
     five years, which will in turn create a huge black market that will have
     unregulated access to kids."
