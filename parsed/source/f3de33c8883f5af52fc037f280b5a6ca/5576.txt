TEXT:
I gather the education portion of today's budget discussion was
inconclusive (except for the Shireman/Kagan agreement to save $250 million
from Pell) After the meeting, Barbara Chow and Bob Shireman proposed that
I sit down with them tomorrow, and that the three of us try to come up
with a packet of recommendations for education that we can use to
structure a discussion with you and Gene, in order to try and reach some
agreement.

I accepted the invitation, for a meeting at 10:30 tomorrow.  I'm taking
home the materials OMB handed out today, and will check in with you before
my meeting tomorrow.
