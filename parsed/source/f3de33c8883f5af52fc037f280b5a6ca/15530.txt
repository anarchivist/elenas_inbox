TEXT:
ACOG is endorsing the legislative language of Daschle's substitute
amendment preferable to HR.1122.  I have a copy of the letter.

*       It provides a meaningful ban, while allowing an exception when it
is necessary for a women's health.  It preserves the ability of physicians
to make judgements about individual patients.
*       The amendment does not dictate to physicians which abortion
procedures can or cannot be performed.
