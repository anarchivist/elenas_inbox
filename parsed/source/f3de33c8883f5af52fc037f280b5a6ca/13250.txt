          SALVAGE LAW: GOP MAY SUPPORT "MODEST" REVISION
              Congressional GOPers "quietly are preparing" to revise the
        salvage law that exempts timber sales from most environmental
        laws. Under the proposed revisions, the Clinton admin. would not
        have to release for logging environmentally sensitive areas of
        public lands.   In exchange, the gov't would have to offer an
        equal amount of timber for sale elsewhere.    The language could be
        attached to a new FY '96 Interior Dept. appropriations bill.
              Sen. Slade Gorton (R-WA), chairman of the interior approp-
        riations cmte., is overseeing discussions.    But aide Heidi Kelly
        on 1/5 said nothing has been decided:   "Slade is willing to give
        the administration some additional flexibility."
                             THIS FAR, AND NO FURTHER
              "The revisions are aimed at appeasing President Clinton,"
        but the "modest" changes "signal that while Republicans are
        feeling some political heat, little chance exists for wholesale
        repeal" of the salvage law. Rep. Elizabeth Furse (D-OR)
        introduced a bill last month to repeal the law, with strong
        backing from Dems and enviros, who criticize it for opening up
        large tracts of healthy, old-growth forests to logging (GREENWIRE
        12/8) (O'Connor/Sleeth, Portland OREGONIAN, 1/6).
