TEXT:
According to DOT, a compromise has been offered by industry
representatives regarding the rights of foreign seamen to sue in
U. S. Courts. Under this proposal, foreign seamen would be able to
sue in U.S. courts regarding alleged violations of vessel owners'
obligation to provide "maintenance and cure" (i. e .· food, shelter,
and medical care.) Any other claims would still have to be
brought in foreign courts.
