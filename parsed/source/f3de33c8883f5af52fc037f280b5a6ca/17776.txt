TEXT:
The review with Raines on civil rights is going well -- from our point of
view.  Raines emphasized the notion of compliance/ADR as key -- making
employers feel like the process would be less difficult (adversial, slow)
for them.

OMB has made the four points of mediation, compliance, technology and data
gathering its theme, but the budget numbers arguably don't fully support
that storyline. Given what Raines said, I   think they will be ready to
move even more in that direction and we have 'the supplemental materials
from the agencies on how to do this.

The meeting   got about halfway through before Raines had to leave.
