    TEXT:
    Here's a one pager you can use to raise child support at the Feinstein
    pre-brief. Haskins is concerned the Senator will raise it and wants to
    make sure -- as we all do -- that the President does not commit to
    anything.  HHS, OMB, and DPC all agree on this point.

                               Child Support Computer Systems


Nine or more states -- including California -- are expected to fail to meet the 10/1/97 deadline for
to have in place state-wide child support computer systems. Under current law, HHS must
disapprove a state's child support plan if it does not meet the computer systems requirement--
thus withholding all federal child support funds from those states, a process that will take six
months or more. Senator Feinstein wants to enact a temporary moratorium on penalties to
states failing to meet this deadline.

HHS, OMB, and DPC oppose such a moratorium. Now -- just as welfare reform's tough new
child support rules are beginning to take effect -- is the wrong time to signal to states that we
are willing to let them off the hook. Instead, we proposed to accept the invitation of the Ways
and Means Committee to work with them to develop a legislative solution to develop a new,
more effective penalty system -- one that will impose tough, immediate penalties rather than
withhold all federal funds. We can develop this proposal and enact it before the current
penalties actually take effect.


                                            Background
Nine or more states are expected to fail to meet the 10/1/97 deadline for child support computer
systems. The 1988 Family Support Act required states to have "in operation a single, state-wide
automated data processing, information, and retrieval system" by 10/1/95; this deadline was
extended by two years in the last Congress.

The states expected to fail are California, Michigan, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Maryland,
D.C., Nevada, and Hawaii. Other possibilities include New York, Florida, Texas, Indiana,
South Carolina, and New Mexico. We won't actually know on October 1st how many states
have failed, because under the law states have until December 31 st to submit to HHS a state plan
amendment indicating that their child support system was completed and operating as of October
1st. HHS must then conduct certification reviews to assess states compliance. Under current
law, HHS must disapprove a state's child support plan ifit does not meet the computer systems
requirement -- thus withholding all federal child support funds from those states, a process that
will take six months or more. (The federal government pays 66% of administrative child
support enforcement costs, and 90% for computer systems costs before FY 1997 and 80% up to a
total of $400 million for costs thereafter.) In addition, HHS must reduce the TANF grant by
between one and five percent. California says it will lose $300 million in federal child support
payments and between $37 and $185 million in TANF payments.
