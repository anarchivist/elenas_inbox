          '(A) any member of a proposed plaintiff class is a citizen of a
State different
          from any defendant;

           '(B) any member of a proposed plaintiff class is a foreign state

     the district court may, in its discretion, abstain from hearing such
action.

     -(3) (A) Paragraph (1) and section 1453 shall not apply to any class

issuer; or

          -(ii) any recommendation, position, or other communication with
