            HONORING NATIONAL AND STATE TEACHERS OF THE YEAR
                               April 24, 1998

To have the best schools, we must have the best teachers . .. We should reward and recognize our best
                                                  teachers.
                                                             President Clinton, 1997 State of the Union Address

President Clinton honored the National and State Teachers of the Year in a ceremony held today
in the Rose Garden at the White House.

PRESIDENT CLINTON RECOGNIZES NATIONAL AND STATE TEACHERS OF THE
YEAR. Each April, the President introduces the National Teacher of the Year to the American
people in a ceremony held at the White House. The National Teacher of the Year program began
in 1952 and continues as the oldest, most prestigious national honors program that focuses public
attention on excellence in teaching. Cosponsored by the Council of Chief State School Officers
and Scholastic Magazine, the National Teacher of the year is chosen from among the State
Teachers of the Year by a national selection committee representing the major education
organizations. The 1998 National Teacher of the Year, Philip Bigler, will spend the year
traveling nationally and internationally as a spokesperson for the teaching profession. This year
marks the 47th year that the President has introduced the National Teacher of the Year to the
nation. Fifty-four State Teachers of the Year including DOD schools, Guam, Puerto Rico and
the District of Columbia will be represented at today's ceremony.

CHALLENGING CONGRESS TO STRENGTHEN OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS, AND
PROMISING TO VETO SENATE EDUCATION MEASURE. President Clinton
underscored his commitment to strengthening public schools by raising standards, increasing
accountability, expanding choice, and investing in quality. He called on Congress to support his
call for national standards and tests in the basic skills, smaller classes in grades 1-3, and a
national effort to address the education infrastructure needs of the Nation.        President Clinton
reiterated that he would veto H.R. 2646 as passed by the Senate yesterday, which is bad education
policy and bad tax policy. Instead of targeting limited Federal resources to build stronger public
schools, this proposal would divert needed resources from public schools. In addition, the bill
provides little financial assistance to average families, and disproportionately benefits the
highest-income tax payers.

The President also assailed Republican-majority led Senate votes- on several key amendments to derail
critical efforts to improve education. The Republicans:


·       Rejected support for modernizing 5,000 public schools. The Senate defeated an
        amendment which would have allowed for nearly $22 billion in bonds for modernizing
        public schools. This action leaves communities and states continuing to cope with
        record student enrollments and deteriorating public school buildings.

·       Rejected efforts to reduce class size. Voted down a sense of the Senate resolution
        supporting the President's plan to reduce class size to a national average of 18 students in
                                              Hex-Dump Conversion

       grades 1-3 by hiring an additional 100,000 teachers.

·      Blocked National tests. The Senate voted to deny parents infonnation about how their
       child perfonns academically compared to widely accepted national standards in the basic·
       skills, by halting the development of national tests in 4th grade reading and 8th grade
       mathematics -- tests that would enable parents, schools and students to identify areas of
       improvement in key subject areas.

REWARDING EXCELLENCE IN TEACHING AND SUPPORTING THE NATIONAL
BOARD FOR PROFESSIONAL TEACHING STANDARDS. President Clinton expressed
his concern about a House bill that would eliminate funding for the National Board ofr
Professional Teaching Standards, a nonprofit, nonpartisan, and nongovernmental body devoted to
strengthening the teaching profession by developing rigorous standards of excellence in teaching.
 The Board has been at the forefront of bipartisan efforts at the national and state level to
strengthen teaching in America, and has received bipartisan support in the Congress and in both
the Bush and Clinton Administrations. The House bill would derail the President's plan to help
100,000 master teachers seek board certification by the ear 2006--enough for one for every
school in the nation.

 By defining standards of excellence for experienced teachers, the Board helps to focus and
upgrade teacher training, recognize and reward outstanding teachers, and keep our best teachers
in the classroom where they are needed the most. Earlier this month, the House Education and
Workforce Committee included a provision in the Higher Education Act that would eliminate
funding for the research and development work of the Board. The President pledged to work
with Congress to delete this provision before the Higher Education Act reaches his desk. The
President's budget request of$105 million over 5 years would help the Board complete
assessments in 25 academic areas covering the fields of90% of the nation's teachers and help
defray the cost to teachers of taking part in the Board certification process.
