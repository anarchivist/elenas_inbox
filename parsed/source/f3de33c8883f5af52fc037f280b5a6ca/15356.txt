        New scientific discoveries and technological developments promise all kinds of benefits
to our society: longer and healthier lives; cures for what were once considered incurable diseases;
universal access to university libraries; up to the second information. The potential to improve
people's everyday lives is enormous. But at the same time, new science and technology raises a
host of ethical and moral questions that we are only just learning to ask, let alone come to grips
with and answer.

       Leading America into a national discussion of these issues -- asking the questions,
answering some of them, and laying down the moral markers that must guide us as we look for
more answers -- is a task ripe for the Presidential bully pulpit.

        There are two major categories of science and technology that raise distinct, although
often related, types of new questions: biology and medicine on the one hand, which raises
religious questions, questions about the nature of humanity, as well as privacy issues; and
information technology on the other hand, which raises all kinds of privacy questions, as well as
many civil liberty related issues.

        The President's speech could focus on both areas, but a thoughtful discussion would be
better advanced with a primary focus on one set of issues.

       There are a good number of policy options in the pipeline that could be used to provide
substance to the speech:

Genetic Screening: The President could propose major legislation to prohibit insurers from
using genetic screening information as a basis for denying coverage. It's worth noting that in the
early 70s some African-Americans were denied health care coverage by insurers and jobs by
employers because they were identified as sickle cell anemia carriers.

Cloning Report: NBAC's report is due a week later (May25); their final meeting is scheduled
for the day before (May 17). Presumably, if we pushed a little, the President could announce
their findings and comment on them. At this point, we expect their recommendations to be
essentially in line with the President's position.

Diabetes: It is possible, but unlikely, that a major diabetes announcement could be ready.

Tuskeegee: The President is currently scheduled to discuss the Tuskeegee experiments the week
before the commencement. Given the subject and the venue, he should certainly reiterate his
strong feelings against the kind of human testing that went on in Tuskeegee.

Information Technology: Ifthe President were to discuss information technology issues, he
could announce creation of an ELSI (Ethical, Legal, and Social Implications) grant program
housed at NSF, similar to the existing one housed at NIH, to explore looming information
technology questions and develop answers.
