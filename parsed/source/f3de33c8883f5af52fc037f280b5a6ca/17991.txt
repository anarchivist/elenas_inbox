TEXT:
Sylvia's assistant Nelson Reyneri is giving her an update today at 1:15 on
where SSA is on its children's SSI report, and he asked me to come along
to help. Hope this is OK with you.

Just to bring you up to speed: Basically, the content of the report looks
good.  It is similar to what we heard last month.   SSA concludes that
overall they did a good job on the redeterminations of children's
eligibility, but they identified three problem areas that they will
address: mental retardation, accuracy of redeterminations in some states,
and appeal rights.   As a result, they will review the cases of
approximately 60,000 children who were cut off, and give all of the 75,000
families who didn't appeal or request continuation of benefits during an
appeal a new opportunity to do so.   The big remaining issue is that the
report is not written well.  It does not provide clear answers to the most
obvious questions, and it is overly defensive in many places.   So we are
pointing out problem areas to them.

Timing-wise, they hope to release it next week or early the week after.
Sylvia doesn't want it to go too late.
