That's great. Let's put it in the weekly, along with whatever we're
planning to do for Girls Nation. POTUS should mention it in his Girls
Nation speech.

Also, could you keep your eye on what Mike and Elena are doing for the
NAACP mtg on Thursday -- a teacher incentive program for inner-city
schools. We should make sure it's consistent with the deal we announced
in Philadelphia.
