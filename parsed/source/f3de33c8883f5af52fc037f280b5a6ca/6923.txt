       Senate Budget resolution

       You will soon receive a draft letter ONDCP would like tot send to the
       Senate ASAP. The letter expresses support for a Sense of the Senate
       amendment that Federal funds should not be used to support the medicinal
       use of marijuana, except for research purposes.

       ·I will attached the amendment and a previously cleared letter on similar
        proposal to the ONDCP draft.

       Please respond ASAP after you receive the letter.   Absent objections we
       will clear the letter by noon today.
