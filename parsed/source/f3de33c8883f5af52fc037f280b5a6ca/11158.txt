TEXT:
BR/EK:

After speaking w/OMB, NSC and expressing big-time concerns w/a series of
folks at DOJ, I got a call from Eric Holder today making clear that DOJ
does not, in fact, intend to release any criminal aliens.  Holder said he
called an emergency meeting w/INS on this issue, and that he the AG will
make clear in her press availability tomorrow that no get out of
jail/detention cards will be issued.  In the meantime, Michael Deich's
folks are working w/DOJ to find some funds to re-program, and the NSC
folks have offered their support in finding funds and/or shutting down
INS' proposed release policy. Additionally, our soon-to-be-sent
supplemental approps bill will include more funds for INS detainees.
