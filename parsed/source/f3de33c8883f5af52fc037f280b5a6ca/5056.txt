TEXT:
See below: race staff is thinking about service connection to race and
wants to know whom to talk to at America's Promise. Our approach is to
work through the Corporation first, and think carefully about what we ask
America's Promise to do.  Should I share our thinking with Winston's
staff, or do you want to talk to Winston first?

Subject:         volunteer summit

Hi Diana,
I don't know if you remember me, but I worked briefly on the volunteer
summit when I worked at the Department of Education.  I am now working at
the Race-Initiative. Our director, Judy Winston, recently asked me to
think about connecting our efforts to the volunteer summit folks.  I am
wondering if you could chat with me about whether you think this is a
useful undertaking and if you could give me some names and phone numbers
of people who are leading the post-summit activities.  I also think that
Judy may be interested in meeting with Colin Powell at some point. Thanks
for your help,
Michele Cavataio tel. 5-1013.
