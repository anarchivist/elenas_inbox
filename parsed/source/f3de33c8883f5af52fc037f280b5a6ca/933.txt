TEXT:
Mayor Finkbeiner will be sending a letter requesting a meeting and'
specifying his issues for us.  I again told him that we could show no
favoritism in the selection process, and that he needed to work with his
Congressional delegation.

We therefore have no meeting date until we receive the letter, and
determine if we can or should meet with him.
