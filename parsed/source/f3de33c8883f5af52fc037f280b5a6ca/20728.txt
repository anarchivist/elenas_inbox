TEXT:
I just heard from Barbara Chow that Wyden and Graham are going to try to
attach their H2A legislation to the CJS appropriations bill in the Senate
this afternoon. Labor has drafted a statement in response (that they are
faxing over) that may not be strong enough. The Secretary of Labor issued
a veto threat on a similar bill introduced in the House several months
ago.
