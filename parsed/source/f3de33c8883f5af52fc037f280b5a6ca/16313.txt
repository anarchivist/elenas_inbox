Weekly Report -- July 17, 1997                              Hex·Dump Conversion

         Welfare -- Counties: "Counties are making welfare reform work," said a report released
this week by the National Association of Counties, by "using the flexibility granted in the new
law to develop innovative programs that are best suited to their local needs." The report profiles
successful efforts in four counties (Fulton County, GA; Santa Clara County, CA; Dade County,
FL; and Hennepin County, MN) to provide transportation, child care, and public sector jobs; to
assist legal immigrants losing federal benefits; and to create collaborative partnerships between
the public, private, and non-profit sectors. The report notes that NACo opposed the welfare law,
but commends the Administration and Congress for addressing counties' primary concerns,
funding for job creation and benefits for legal immigrants. The report also emphasizes that "the
need for transportation services is tremendous. It was the most common thread that linked all
counties and outpaced all other concerns as their most urgent need ... The reauthorization of the
Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act including new funds to help those who are
making the transition from welfare to work is therefore paramount."

[EK--the report never says "welfare reform is working"--its tone is "challenge and opportunity".]

        Welfare -- Budget Conference Update: The House and Senate conferees have
exchanged welfare reform offers, which settle some of the minor issues regarding the structure of
the $3 billion welfare to work program and benefits for legal immi~ants. However, all the most
contentious issues are still on the table: disability and health benefits for disabled legal
immigrants; minimum wage, worker protections, and hours of work for workfare participants;
privatization of Food Stamp and Medicaid operations; and whether the $3 billion welfare to work
program should be operated by HHS or the Department of Labor (the House agrees with us that
DOL should be the lead agency; the Senate so far disagrees). We have been working at all
levels to ensure that the Congressional negotiators understand our views on these issues.
