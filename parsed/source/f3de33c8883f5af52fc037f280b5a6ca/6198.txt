ADVISORY BOARD ACTIVITIES

     February Advisory Board Meeting. The next Advisory Board Meeting will be
     held in Northern California on February 10-11. On February 10, Advisory Board
     members will visit Promising Practices sites in the San Francisco, Oakland, and
     East Palo Alto communities. DOEd Secretary Richard Riley will participate by
     visiting a San Francisco Promising Practice site - - Glide Memorial Baptist
     Church - - that focuses on job training for the needy. The Advisory Board will
     end the day by hosting a 90 minute community forum in San Jose in which the
     public will have the opportunity to raise views and concerns on issues
     surrounding race.

     On February 11, Advisory Board members will convene in San Jose to conduct
     their sixth monthly meeting. The topic of the meeting is "Race and Poverty." The
     expert panel discussion will focus on the relationship between racial segregation,
     poverty, and the persistent lack of opportunities for those who live in poor,
     concentrated neighborhoods. The first panel will focus on national issues and
     invited participants include William Julius Wilson from Harvard University and
     Douglas Massey from the University of Pennsylvania. The second panel will
     focus on local issues and solutions and will include local, state and area program
     experts who can address welfare and community development issues.

     NAACP Legal Defense Fund. On January 23, Chairman Franklin addressed
     the Board of Directors of the New York Chapter.

OFFICE OF THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR

     COMMUNICATIONS

           Meetings. Members of the PIR staff met with four members of the
           International Association of Official Human Rights Agencies Board
           (IAOHRA), including its President, Bill Hale, of the Texas Human Rights
           Commission. IAOHRA's membership includes 95 percent of all human
           and civil rights agencies throughout the country at the city, county and
           state level. We discussed ways in which PIR could work with IAOHRA,
           particularly with regard to identifying promising practices and recruitment
           of leaders.

           National Press. The LA Bureau of CBS Evening News Weekend
           Edition has expressed an interest in producing a feature story on the


                                          2
    Specialty Press. National Newspaper Publishers Association and Ofield
    Dukes & Associates plan to run a feature story on me and my work with
    the PIR. The story will appear in minority owned - - mostly
    African-American - - weekly papers and magazines during the month of
    February. Their distribution market covers 200 media markets around
    the country.

OUTREACH

    Corporate Leaders. The third Corporate Forum occurred on January
    30, at the Biltmore Hotel in Los Angeles. It was hosted by Secretary of
    Commerce William Daley. Maria Echaveste and Advisory Board
    members Angela Oh and Robert Thomas participated as well.

    Meetings. Members of the Initiative staff met with a group of 35
    students and a Professor of Psychology representing Whitworth College
    in Spokane Washington. Their meeting with the PIR staff was the last
    stop of a three week, cross-country study tour focusing on prejudice and
    racism in American society. They shared ideas on how best to engage
    youth across America in the work of the Initiative, and they also agreed to
    participate in our Campus/Community Week of Dialogue in April. We
    plan to highlight their "Prejudice Across America" study tour as one of our
    Promising Practices.

RESEARCH AND POLICY PLANNING

    Letter Regarding the December Advisory Board Meeting. We
    forwarded a letter to you from Dr. John Hope Franklin which provides
    feedback on behalf of the Advisory Board on lessons learned at their'
    December Advisory Board meeting, which focused on issues of race in
    primary and secondary education. The letter expresses the Advisory
    Board Members' concerns about the continuing racial disparities in
    education and the Board's support for several upcoming policy
    announcements, including the college-school partnerships initiative. The
    letter also offers some additional education policy recommendations. A
    copy is attached.

    Campus/Community Week of Dialogue. We have expanded our
    conversations with the higher education community concerning our
    planned week of racial dialogue and activities on university campuses,
    which is scheduled for April 6-9. While we expect even greater
    participation, the Association of American Colleges and Universities
    (AAC&U) has pledged to promote active, substantial participation from at


                                  3
            students. We are finalizing our list of core activities for the week of
            dialogue and plan to meet with AAC&U, the

            American Council on Education, the National Urban League, and others
            next week.

FEDERAL AGENCY ACTIVITIES

     Department of Justice

            Hispanic Illinois Congressional District. On January 26, the Supreme
            Court summarily affirmed the district court's decision in King v. State
            Board of Elections, holding that Illinois' majority-Hispanic Congressional
            District Four did not violate the Constitution. District Four was adopted by
            the lower court after extensive negotiation by multiple parties in an earlier
            lawsuit.

            Racially Biased Poll Wo.rkers. On January 12, the court entered a
            settlement in DOJ's case challenging the racially-based actions of white
            poll officials in New York City. These officials gave white voters ballots
            on which the poll workers had written the name of a white write-in
            candidate, and urged voters to vote for her during a May 7, 1996, election
            for a community school board in the Bronx. The white candidate was
            among those who won (there were also minority and other white victors),
            while several minority candidates were defeated. The settlement
            provides that the white write-in candidate be required to run again in a
            fairly conducted election, that the poll workers in question not be allowed
            to participate in the re-run, and that the board of election closely monitor
            polling places during the elections to be held this year and in 1999.

     Department ofInterior

            Black History Month. On February 2, Eric Robinson will be the keynote
            speaker for the grand opening of the Old Courthouse at the Jefferson
            National Expansion Memorial in St. Louis, Missouri. A wide variety of
            special events, programs, and concerts will be offered at the Old
            Courthouse and Gateway Arch throughout the month of February.

            Frederick Douglass Observance. On February 13, NPS officials and
            D.C. Government officials will observe the 180th anniversary of Frederick
            Douglass with a musical tribute from various performers and school choirs
            during a wreath-laying ceremony. The annual observance also honors
            Black History Month.


                                           4

      Black History Month. On February 4, USDA will hold its Black History
      Month observance program in the Jefferson Auditorium in Washington,
      DC. The program and the month of February will be dedicated to Dr.
      George Washington Carver and his contributions to the field of
      agriculture. The keynote speaker will be Dr. Benjamin F. Payton,
      President of Tuskegee University.

      Civil Rights Training. USDA began mandatory civil rights training for all
      employees on January 15, implementing another recommendation from
      Secretary Glickman's Civil Rights Action Team Report.

      Commission On Small Farms. On January 22, Secretary Glickman
      held a news conference to accept the Small Farms Commission report, A
      Time To Act, which contains 146 recommendations to improve USDA's
      service to small and beginning farmers, including credit, risk management,

      "State of the City" address at City Hall, Mayor Dailey served notice of his intent
      to have a fair housing ordinance by the end of 1998. In calling for a fair
      housing ordinance, Dailey said he wanted a measure that would allow the city
      to hear local fair housing complaints that otherwise would be forwarded to HUD.

      ordinance would be the responsibility of the city's Racial and Cultural Diversity
