Marriage-minded gays need straights in wedding party
By Debbie Woodell

   What's taking so long?
   That question was put to Evan Wolfson, a lawyer with the Lambda Legal
Defense and Education Fund, who has been at the forefront of the struggle
by gay men and lesbians to gain the legal r.ight to marry in the United
States.
   The Hawaii Supreme Court has had the case for months.
   Gay people have been trying to plan trips to Hawaii ever since hopes.
rose that the nation's 50th state would become the first to give us the
same legal rights as straight people.
   So what's taking so long?
   "Actually," said Wolfson, Lambda's Marriage Project director, "it feels
like it's been a long time in Hawaii because we want it so urgently --
because much good is going to follow from it, and all of that -- but in
actual court terms, this has not been inordinately long."
   And, Wolfson said, it is ~onceivable a ruling will not come down for
several more months.
   The Hawaii case -- which began in 1991 when three couples sued the
state for the right to marry -- is the furthest along. A judge ruled in
our favor in December 1996 and the state immediately appealed it to the
Supreme Court.
   In Vermont, parties are amid final briefing in a similar suit before


 the state Supreme Court, which Wolfson said is expected to hear the case
 this fall. In Alaska, the state has just been told it must show why gay
people should not get married and is trying to get out of that bind.
    Despite persecution, religious people and organizations are
increasingly coming over to our side.
    Sadly, they often use such euphemisms·as "holy unions" or ·commitment
ceremonies" to help put out brush fires, but they're performing weddings.
    Gaining the legal right to marry would be the most significant victory,
the ultimate leveling of the playing field.
    But, Wolfson warned, we cannot sit and wait for the courts to make
everything right for us, to do "all the heavy lifting."
    "When Hawaii or any other state hands down this ruling, it's going to
open up a whole new chapter of possibilities and challenges," Wolfson
said.
    "And we will best be prepared for those opportunities and battles by
doing groundwork now to enlarge the number of non-gay people who have been
approached to think about and support our freedom to marry. The task at
hand -- today, tomorrow and every day -- is to enlist non-gay allies."
    Wolfson isn't talking about lobbying legislators, although that, too,
is important.
    He's urging us to talk with our clergy, our neighbors, friends,
professional organizations -- the folks who see us, work with us,
socialize with us in our everyday lives.
    "There are a lot of fair-minded non-gay people who have never been
asked to take a position, or even to think about it," he said. "Now is the
time to ask them to think about it, to take a position. It's our job to go
to them, not just to expect them to know the right answer."
    wolfson finds it puzzling that we appear so reluctant to ask straight·
people for help.
    "It's critical, but the funny thing is that non-gay people are far more
willing to help than gay people are to ask them.      . It's almost as if
we're afraid to go in and talk with them about our own equality," he said.
    "We're pretty good at demanding, we're not that good at asking. We need
to do both."
    Recruit{ng will build a strong foundation of support to fight the
inevitable backlash. Hawaii and Alaska gay people are already gearing.up
for a big ballot fight this fall. Some 29 states and the federal
government have some version of a defense-of-marriage law that denies us
equal rights to marry, Wolfson said.
    "Once people are able to marry, they will, and they will face both
discrimination and opportunities to show non-gay people what married
people look like when they're gay," Wolfson said. "And that's going to be
a tremendous educational opportunity and moment to gather a lot of
support."
    Wolfson, who makes his living in this legal arena, isn't naive enough
to think he'll be out of a job once the Hawaii ruling comes down.
    Couples who get married there will face new battles in their home
states. American gay men and lesbians who marry someone from another
country will have to fight for the right of their partners to live in the
United States. Many of those fights will wind up in court.
    But, Wolfson urged, "before everybody starts talking about suing, let's
talk about talking."
    So, folks, what's taking so long?
