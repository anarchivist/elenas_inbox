TEXT:
Can you clear this?

Q.      The GAO has concluded that the Commerce DepartmentD,s study on
the shortage of information technology (IT) workers has "serious
analytical and methodological weaknesses." WhatD,s the White HouseD,s
response?

The Commerce Department made it clear that their report was never intended
to be comprehensive analysis of the IT labor market -- they called it "at
best, a snapshot of a rapidly changing phenomena."

We do have projections from the Bureau of Labor Statistics that predict
that demand for workers with IT skills with increase by more than a
million over the next 10 years. However, the data on the supply of IT
workers is less clear    which is why the Com~erce Department concluded
that further research is needed.
