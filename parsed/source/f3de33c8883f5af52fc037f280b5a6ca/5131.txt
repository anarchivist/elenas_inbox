Domestic Partners
    Look for the White House to quietly oppose a bill by Rep. Barney Frank
(D-Mass.) to extend federal health and retirement benefits to the unmarried
domestic partners of federal workers and retirees. Officials say money is
the
reason Uncle Sam will object to providing coverage to live-in, unmarried
couples, straight or gay. The issue:
    Federal workers contribute to their retirement plans. But the amounts
don't begin to cover the costs of paying retirees and survivors lifetime
benefits that are indexed to inflation. Also, Uncle Sam (meaning taxpayers)
pays 72 percent of the total health premium of workers and retirees.
    Extending those benefits to a larger group would be costly to both
systems.
