TEXT:
There will be an H1-B meeting wednesday May 6 at 3:00 in Room 239.  This
is a meeting with several representatives from the Semiconductor Industry
Association.
They fully support raising the cap on H1-B visas as a means to relieve the
shortage of skilled engineers in the semiconductor industry.
If I receive more information, I will pass it along later today.

If you have any questions please call me at 6-2800.


Thank you,
Shannon
