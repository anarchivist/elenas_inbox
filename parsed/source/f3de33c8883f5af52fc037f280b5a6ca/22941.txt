TEXT:
We are finalizing the Administration legislation to give to Rep. Cardin,
who, as we've discussed, plans to introduce it as early as next week and
certainly in advance of the 2/16 child care hearing.   Cardin's strategy
was to introduce the pieces of the Administration's bill within the Ways
and Means jurisdiction --which of course excludes the after-school piece.

The HHS pieces of the bill (subsidies increase and the Early Learning
Fund) are in fine shape and haven't changed substantially from last
year.   As we discussed, we are not re-submitting the three discretionary
programs for which we secured general quality dollars in the budget last
year (i.e. the Standards Enforcement Fund, the Research Fund, and the
Scholarship program). Mary Bourdette strongly advises that to advance
legislation that adds strings to the money we won last year would
needlessly anger the appropriators.   We did, however, add "Standards
Enforcement" as an allowable activity in the Early Learning Fund, and
understand that the Dept of Education plans to include an early childhood
education initiative as a part of the ESEA reauthorization package.
Therefore, we have maintained markers in each of these areas.

On the tax side, Treasury is finalizing the specs for its three pieces
(DCTC, Stay-at-home DCTC, and Business Tax Credit), and we plan to sit
down with Treasury and Cardin staff on Tuesday.   We also plan to work
with Cardin to help identify other original co-sponsors for this
legislation -- Mary's thinking is to secure key Ways and Means members.
FYI, Janet Murguia has been in the loop on these discussions.
