TEXT:
I know several of us talked this morning about how to drive home the
difference between the R's HMO Bill of Rights and Ours --- one thought:
i doubt the R's have the whistle blower protections in their bill -- and
we have --thus far -- leaned away from this provision --- if we were to
lean in to this provision we would have a natural constituency--the issue
could be framed as a way to ensure quality --by health care workers who
are the direct service providers

one last note to Chris -- the afl-cio has been in conversation w/ Kennedy
and Daschle's folks about the remedy section of the bill --- the
mutli-employer plans have concerns w/ the state court enforcement remedy
section -- they are vetting a federal court enforecement --- I understand
that one of the differences between the R's bill and ours is the remedy
section -- I asked Gerry Shea to call you ASAP to discuss this -- my
obvious concern is that we ramp up the differences on the remedy section
and one of our strongest constituencies for the bill is trying to modify
that section as you are writing --- gerry can be reached at
637-5237--because it's an issue for the multi-employer plans this is a
labor/employer issue not just a labor one --
