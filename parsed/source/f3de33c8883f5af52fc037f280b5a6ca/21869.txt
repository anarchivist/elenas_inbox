I'm forwarding you the FDA one pager Bill Schultz has put together on what
specifically they are saying the food dollars would do.

INSPECTIONS

o   Establish a nationally integrated food safety system with Federal, state, and local
            authorities.

           For the first time in decades, FDA will ensure that every high risk food
                   manufacturer in the United States is inspected at least once a year.

           For other food firms, inspections will be twice as often as today (from once every
                  8 years to once every 4 years).

           For the first time ever, state and Federal inspection results will be shared, via an
           electronic connection, that will reduce overlapping efforts and greatly enhance the
           ability ofthose authorities to improve public health

o   FDA will have an enhanced international food safety program, which will include
    evaluations of other countries' food safety systems and provision of technical assistance
    to foreign countries who import to this country (thereby continuing the shift to ensuring
    that foods are safely produced before they arrive at our shores).

RESEARCH

o   FDA will be able to ensure the applicability and effectiveness of the new preventive
    control techniques used to ensure the safety of seafood, juices, eggs, fresh produce and
    other foods.

o   New detection tests will be developed for such dangerous contaminants as Salmonella in
    eggs and Cyclosopora in fresh produce, and test methods for E. coli 0157:H7 in foods in
    which it cannot now be detected.

OUTBREAK RESPONSE

o   With its increased surveillance, CDC expects an increase of 40% offoodborne illness
    from E. coli 0157:H7 and salmonella, and 10% for all foodbome illness. Funding is
    needed so that FDA will have the laboratory and staff capability to respond rapidly to
    those outbreaks when they occur--to track down their source and prevent further danger.

o   CDC's new PulseNet contaminant tracing system will be connected to FDA's
    laboratories, thus enabling FDA to use this state-of-the-art disease detection system to
    control foodbome illness at the source.



                                                                            \ ~(onagement S'jstem

o   CDC estimates that one-third offoodbome illness comes from retail establishments. A
    majority of states will adopt FDA's model food code that raises the standards for safer
    handling of food in restaurants, nursing homes, hospitals, and grocery stores. If funding is
    available, FDA can provide the necessary training and education to state and local
    inspectors (as well as industry) to implement those new standards.

EDUCATION

o   Targeted resources are needed so that the most vulnerable (e.g., elderly, very young, and
    pregnant women) will be taught how they should and can avoid contaminated food. The
    result will be that their behavior will begin to change so that the most severe illnesses and
    deaths can be prevented.

RISK ASSESSMENT

o   New information will become available about how much of a contaminant must be in a
    food to make people sick (such as Listeria) and how certain contaminants (such as
    Salmonella) can best be controlled.
