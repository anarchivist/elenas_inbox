TEXT:
1) Volume adjustment options -- Josh, Jon, and Karl will have paper
shortly, and are ready to discuss.

2) Youth lookback surcharge survey -- By 10:00 am I will have from Gary
Claxton language adjusting the base year for the lookback survey and
proposing other technical changes (i.e., the survey specifications that
should substitute for the Univ. of Michigan language now in the bill) .
HHS recommends that we provide a credit towards the youth smoking targets
based on how much we ·think the price increase would have reduced youth
smoking.

3) Effect of State Settlements -- Currently, every state is included in
the bill unless they opt out. However, the way the language is written
now, TX, FL, and MS could probably get paid twice if a) they did not opt
out of the bill and b) they argued successfully in court that the federal
legislation is not "substantially similar" to their agreements.
Minnesota's settlement agreement does not include this disputable
"substantially similar" language, but instead makes clear that companies
will get a credit against settlement payments owed Minnesota for funds the
state receives due to federal tobacco-related legislation which are "(i)
unrestricted as to their use, or (ii) are restricted to any form of health
care or to any use related to tobacco." DOJ is preparing language ASAP to
fix this possible double dipping problem.

4) Castano Lawyers -- Section 704(c) of the bill (p. 440-441)          settles the
Castano suits and establishes a 3-person arbitration panel to         award
attorneys fees and expenses.  Participating manufacturers pay         the awards
made by the arbitration panel -- outside of anything they pay         in the
annual assessment.

5) Document Depository -- DOJ has no objections to making the document
depository a non-profit entity.

6) International funding language -- as you asked, we faxed to Hollings
staff the language OMB drafted authorizing $200 million a year for
international tobacco control efforts, which allows the President to
transfer to any agency funds appropriated for this purpose.
