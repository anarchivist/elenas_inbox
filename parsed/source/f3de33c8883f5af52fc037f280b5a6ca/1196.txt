TEXT:
This is a little late, but if we still aren't getting from HHS what we
want, I think the following format is useful.  This information is clearly
outdated (it's something I wrote awhile ago)--but it will give you an idea.

Maryland

Background

Introduced by Gov. Glendening in January 1996 and passed by the state
legislature in April 1996, the Family Investment Plan will eliminate the
state's AFDC system and replace it with a new anti-poverty effort designed
to move the poor from welfare to work.

Program Components

The legislation effectively dismantles the federal AFDC program in
Maryland and replaces it with a system that would convert local social
service agencies into job placement centers. Cash aid would be guaranteed
to the poor only after all work avenues had been explored and would be
conditioned on weekly job interviews and attempts to secure child support
from delinquent parents. There are no time limits. Rather than one
state-run system, the legislation would allow Maryland's 23 counties and
the city of Baltimore to design their own initiatives, allowing a
tremendous amount of local flexibility in design and funding.

Further, DLC member, Rep. Sandy Rosenberg, has asked the Department of
Human Resources to report on the merits of initiating a competitive bid
process for employment services. The process would be open to state
agencies, local Service Delivery Areas, nonprofits, and forprofit
companies, and would include a pilot program under which capitated
payments would be made to vendors willing to serve the hardest to place
recipients.

Results

The Family Investment Plan is based on a similar pilot project undertaken
in Anne Arundel County that shifted caseworkers' emphasis from income
maintenance to helping recipients find jobs.  Supports such as day care
vouchers, transportation stipends, and cash grants for minor emergencies
helped welfare recipients not only find, but keep, employment. Since
September, Anne Arundel caseworkers have helped 320, or one-third, of all
applicants find jobs.

Evaluation

Maryland's welfare reform initiative is right on track. It is work-based
and radical. Rep.  Rosenberg's current work to initiate a competitive bid
process for employment services is especially encouraging. However, the
state could have required work up front, as in Work First, and should have
conditioned cash receipt on actual work, rather than weekly interviews and
attempts to secure child support from delinquent parents.
