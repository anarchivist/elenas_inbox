TEXT:
British want to do the education event, but also want to visit the FDR
Memorial. There is finally a consensus here to do an education event as
the main message event (and possibly drop-by the FDR Memorial).  NSC is
getting final confirmation from the British today so that we can begin
planning details of the event tomorrow. Ann is going to call a meeting.

Just wanted to let you all know the school the Blair advance folks liked
is the Yorktown High School in Yorktown, VA.  The school has been vetted
by the Dept. of Ed, it has good diversity, and while the test scores a
pretty good there's nothing outstanding about the school.  It is just a
typical American high school -- and the Blair folks particularly like the
cheerleaders and basketball team.  Begala had wanted there to be a heavy
emphasis on technology -- but there isn't a technology program at the
school to highlight.  I think it's fine -- the event would be a discussion
between the President and Blair to students about their similar commitment
to investing in education.  (Mike, they are checking now on elementary
school students that can be invited as well so we can talk about class
size.)  Craig Smith doesn't think we can include Gilmore in the event so
we are going to have to work out how to do a roundtable without him.

Let me know if there are other concerns we can try to resolve before the
next meeting.



School stats: 1,400 students 8-12, 17% hispanic,12%african-american,
9%asian.
15% receive free or reduced lunch. Extensive English assecond language -
high intensity language training,
90% of 8th graders passed Virginia's "literacy passport test" reading,
writing, and math.  11th graders reading scores weren't as good.
