TEXT:
Here is an item for the weekly on the bucket, in case you want it.

Sorry about this, but the college/work requirement item is really too
complex for the weekly, I think -- and I will get you a draft of a memo by
Monday morning.

    This issue may not be totally ripe, but here it is (and it's long and confusing, I know):

    Preserving Medicaid Coverage for Legal Immigrants Losing SSI -- We have been exploring how
    to preserve Medicaid coverage for legal immigrants who lose SSI. The welfare law requires SSI
    cut-offs for most legal immigrants in July and August. For Medicaid, the welfare law allows
    states to decide whether to continue coverage for legal immigrants. It is heartening to note that,
    to date, no states have opted to drop legal immigrants from Medicaid.

    Nevertheless, a problem remains because SSI automatically entitles you to Medicaid in most
    states. A person losing SSI may qualify for Medicaid through another route -- as a pregnant
    woman, very poor with children, medically needy -- or may not, depending on the individual and
    the features of that state's Medicaid program. Texas and Florida are particularly hard pressed on
    this issue: Texas has no medically needy program, while Florida's is very "bare bones." Either
    state could remedy the problem by getting the state legislature to add a new Medicaid state
    option, but they are reluctant to do so because it would be difficult to pass such a measure or to
    limit it to legal immigrants.

    We have come to an agreement on a partial solution: HHS will issue a change in its definition
    of a medically needy program that will preserve Medicaid for 31,000 people in seven states. In
    addition, HHS will issue a regulation to delay for one year the date when people lose coverage,
    so that H.HS has time to ensure that its interpretation of the law is correct. This would preserve
    coverage for 160,000 people for one year. (You should know that advocacy groups are arguing
    for a complete solution, but HHS is convinced that this is not legally permissible.)

    The cost of both items is $1.4 billion over five years. Virtually all of this cost is already in our
    budget, as part of our legislative proposal to preserve SSI and Medicaid for disabled legal
    immigrants. We plan to announce this in mid-April. OMB argues that our announcement
    should be low-profile because they fear we will face criticism on budget and policy grounds.
    Finally, you should know that this announcement could dilute some of the momentum for our
    legal immigrant "fix" package, because we will have solved (for one year) one of the most
    sensational situations -- people being evicted from nursing homes.
