BR/EK:

I got a copy of the last 13 pages of the Coverdell amendment.    The R's
shared the drug strategy piece w/ONDCP.    However, it includes a page of
miscellaneous prov~s~ons that seem to open up the Public Health funds to
drug educatin and prevention programs ... but I may be reading this wrong.

I'll fax a copy to 6-2878 for you folks.     CR:   I'll drop one in your box.

Jose'
