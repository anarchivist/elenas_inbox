     SOU (I added a little more detail in the first paragraph for your
     purposes).  I'm faxing the state-by-state numbers and a spread sheet w/

Caseloads Continue Their Record Declines: New caseload data show the welfare rolls have
fallen below 8 million for the first time since 1969 and have fallen nearly 2 million since last
year's State ofthe Union. The welfare rolls have declined by 43 percent since January 1993,
when they stood at 14.1 million, and by 35 percent since their August 1996. The percentage of
the u.s. population on welfare is at its lowest in 30 years -- 2.9 percent (in 1968 it was 2.8 ).
The number of people on welfare is at its lowest in 29 years (in 1969 there were 6.7 million
people on the rolls). [Note: we're counting years through 1998 since that's when data is
from -- we could probably add another year if we wanted to count through 1999 since
that's when we're releasing the data]
