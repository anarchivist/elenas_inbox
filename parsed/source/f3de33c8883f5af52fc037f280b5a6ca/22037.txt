TEXT:
I understand that we will include in this speech a principal from Chicago
and a parent.   FYI, in looking for a student to feature in the SOTU, I've
talked to the Chicago schools people and to the principal of Jenner
elementary, whom I talked to in the fall in writing a speech for the
POTUS' visit to that school.   She may have found the kids I'm looking for
 (held behind, placed in summer school, jumped a grade level in reading) .
