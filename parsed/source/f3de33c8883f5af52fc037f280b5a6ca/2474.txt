                Holocaust museum demands removal of

                crosses at Auschwitz



                JERUSALEM (AP)    -- Israel's Holocaust museum Sunday demanded

that

                Polish authorities immediately remove dozens of wooden

crosses put up by

                Catholics outside the former Auschwitz death camp.

                A statement from the Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial called

the erection

                of the Christian symbol a "provocative act" by "extreme

groups."

                    Yad Vashem said the act violated an agreement reached
  ,',

earlier this year

                   by the Israeli memorial, the U.S. Holocaust Museum in

Washington and

                   Polish government and church authorities. The agreement

said no religious,

                   ideological or political symbols would be erected on the

site.

                    "The placing of the crosses, after special efforts have

been made to reduce

                   tensions, may aggravate the situation and may prevent

further dialogue

                  -between the sides about the future of the site," the

statement said.

                    No response was available Sunday from Polish officials.

                    Last week, several dozen Catholics from Silesia placed a

three-metre

                   cross and about 50 smaller ones outside the walls of the

camp.

                    The wooden crosses surround a eight-metre cross erected

outside the

                   camp to commemorate a 1979 papal mass. Jewish groups have

said the

                   large cross, visible from the former death camp, disturbs

the memory of the

                   1.5 million Jews who died there.

                    The agreement reached earlier this year between Polish

authorities and

                   Jewish groups did not resolve the dispute over whether the

papal cross

                   should be   lef~   at the site.
.   "
                    Yad Vashem director Avner Shalev said Sunday that the

placement of the

                   new crosses was "a clear provocation" that was "very

painful for any

                   member of the Jewish people and many others."

                    Shalev said he hoped government and church officials in

Poland would act

                   immediately to remove the crosses.

                    "Everyone agrees and understands that Auschwitz should be

kept in the

                   authentic way that it was left," he said.
