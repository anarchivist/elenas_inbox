TEXT:
The initiative has decided to do one afternoon panel, with eight panelists
+ the board members that attend (5 or 6).  The following is the list of
panelists:

1. William Bennett
2. E.D. Hirsch (this is the "traditionalist" school reformer that Mike
recommended; not yet confirmed; Mike is calling today)
3. Gary Orfield (Harvard professor; has done a lot with deseg. and racial
isolation issues)
4. Diana Lam (Superintendant of the San Antonio public schools; system is
overwhelmingly Latino)
5. Deborah Meier (heads up the Mission Hill Charter School in Roxbury, MA)
6. James Comer (Yale University professor of psychiatry; well known
expert of school reform within education circles; African-American)
7. Jonathan Kozol (author of Savage Inequalities)
8. Waldemar ("Bill") Rojas (superintendant of San Francisco public
schools; very diverse system)

Mike, Tanya, Bill and I are reviewing the proposed questions (a copy of
which you received yesterday) and I am going to view the proposed 10
minute film -- hopefully today.
