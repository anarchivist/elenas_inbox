Rahm signed off on the proposed FBI statement for Sunday, with one
suggested change    adding "but not good enough" to the end of the first
sentence.

Please review when you get a chance this weekend, and see what you think.
The data is embargoed until 6pm Sunday, so we should be fine if we put
something out Saturday sometime. Also, can you go ahead and forward the
edited statement .to the press office?

Call or page me if you have any q's,
Jose'
