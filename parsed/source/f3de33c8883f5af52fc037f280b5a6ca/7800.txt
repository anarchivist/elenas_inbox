Honorable John McCain
Chairman
United States Senate
Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation
Washington, D.C. 20510-6125

Dear Senator McCain:

        I support your efforts in helping to pass comprehensive tobacco legislation which
dramatically reduces youth smoking and to remove Section 604 which requires Indian tribes to
collect state taxes on sales of tobacco products.

         Since the formation of the Union, the United States has recognized Indian tribes as
"domestic dependent nations" that exercise governmental authority over their members and their
territory. Where Indians manufacture tobacco products on their own lands, state taxes on
reservation-generated tobacco products would normally be pre-empted under the tribal
self-determination doctrine. Section 604, as currently drafted, interferes with this fundamental
principle. Even with respect to state taxes collected on sales of pre-packaged goods to
non-Indians, Section 604 violates traditional principles of comity and federalism, which demand
that state-tribal relations be developed based on dialogue and cooperation between states and
tribes.

        Section 604 establishes a complex scheme to address a problem that states and Indian
tribes have already resolved or have the means to resolve. At least eighteen states have entered
into state-tribal tax agreement with numerous Indian tribes. These agreements ensure that a
single tax is imposed, provide a stable tax framework, and ease tax administration significantly.
By unilaterally requiring Indian tribes to collect the state taxes and also adding the federal
government as an intermediary, Section 604 enormously increases the burden of collecting taxes,
without any substantial benefit to the states or the Indian tribes. Federal accounting, oversight,
and administrative costs will increase to implement this new legislative scheme.

        Agreements are the best mechanisms for mutually satisfactory resolution of tax collection
issues between states and tribes. Even if states and tribes are unable to reach agreement,
however, states may impose their taxes at the wholesale level to collect taxes on goods that are
destined for sale to non-Indians.

        As originally drafted, the McCain bill did not disturb the current system, which has
worked for both the tribes and the states. It permitted the states and the tribes to work together
to collect the state's revenues and to share revenues if they so desire. Moreover, it vindicated the
federal government's trust responsibility to Indian tribes and recognized their status as domestic
dependent nations.

       Thank you for your important work in this area.
Sincerely,           Hex-Dump Conversion
