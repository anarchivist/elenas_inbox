 On Thursday, Ron Haskins has asked HHS to a meeting in which he will give
 them legislative language for us to review which contains:
         1) Revised computer systems penalties language
         2) House passed incentives bill language, revised to make it cost
 neutral
         3) A proposal on state-wideness
         4) Proposal re: IVE penalties regarding inter-jurisdictional
 adoptions

 HHS will get one copy each to me, to Emil and to Keith/Edwin. My
 assistant Donna will schedule a meeting for us to discuss on Tuesday 1/20
 (probably 3: 00) .

           Jan. 29th hearing    inviting Judge Ross to testify
