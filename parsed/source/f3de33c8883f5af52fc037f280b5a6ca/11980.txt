TEXT:
Lee Satterfield at Labor informed us that Labor will not be able to
complete the wage gap report (which we announced last year at the Equal
Pay event) in time for our event this year.  They have had a year to do
it, and, if they release it after the event, it will not get as much
press.  In order to get it out, I think we would have to bump it up to the
Secretary level. Do you want to press the issue?
