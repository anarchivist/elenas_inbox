For Immediate Release                                            April 29, 1999


                          STATEMENT BY THE PRESIDENT

       I am disappointed that so few states are devoting tobacco settlement funds to
reducing youth smoking, as shown by the new report from the Campaign for Tobacco Free
Kids and the American Heart Association. This new report underscores why I strongly
oppose any legislation waiving the federal government's claim to tobacco settlement funds
without a commitment from the states to fund youth tobacco prevention efforts. In the
absence of such a commitment, states won't have to spend a single penny of the $246 billion
tobacco settlement to reduce youth smoking. We must act now: every day, 3,000 children
become regular smokers and 1,000 will have their lives cut short as result.

                                               ###
