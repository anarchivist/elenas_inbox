 TEXT:
 Attached below is an e-mail from Barbara to Gene (sent at his request)
 outlining the Head Start options for the President's FY 2000 budget. No
 decision has been made, but it's clear that OMB plans to up the Head Start
 budget to stay on track to serving 1 million children by 2002. Assuming
 OMB and HHS can find the budget authority for it, I would favor OMB's
 suggested resolution described below -- $5.267 billion for FY 2000 to add
 44,000 new Head Start slots, bringing the program to a total of 881,000
 slots.

 Subject:         Summary of Head Start options

 Following is an overview of options for the Head Start funding level for
 the FY2000 President's Budget. All options remain on the path toward
 serving 1 million children by FY02, including 80,000 infants and toddlers
 in Early Head Start. The options range in cost from $4,997 million to
 $5,395 million in FYOO, with five year costs that are $5.3 billion to $6
 billion over guidance levels. The table attached below summarizes the
 options proposed by HHS and considered by OMB.

 As you know,  the Head Start reauthorization greatly increased the
 set-aside for quality activities.  Due to this law change, as well as
 other program policies, the cost of new slots has risen dramatically.
 While the FY99 P.B. assumed that the request level of $4,660 million would
 create 30,000 to 36,000 new slots, this funding level as enacted will now


  only provide for approximately 15,000 new slots in FY99, for total
  enrollment of 837,000.

 In HHS' FYOO budget submission, the Department originally requested $4,997
 million ($337 million over FY99 enacted), and subsequently revised this
 request to $5,395 million ($735 million over FY99 enacted). The passback
 level was at guidance, and equal to their original request of $4,997
 million.

 In HHS' first appeal, the Department reiterated their request of $5,395
 million, proposing to add 54,000 slots, for total enrollment in FYOO of
 891,000.  Subsequently, HHS revised their appeal downward.  Their second
 appeal is in the same ballpark as the OMB proposed resolution of $5,267
 million. This funding level would create 44,000 slots, for total
 enrollment of 881,000.  There is a logic to adding 44,000 slots in FYOO,
 as the FY99 P.B. assumed the addition of 44,000 new slots in FYOO (albeit,
 to a higher base) .

 HHS' third appeal, a $100 million increase over passback to $5,097
 million, would provide for 29,000 new slots and a total enrollment of
 866,000.
