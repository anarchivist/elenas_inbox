Subject:         action ideas

We'd like to put together a master list of action/event ideas -- things
the President can do in all the areas we work on.  Please include actions
already in the planning stage, as well as ideas still on the drawing board
(or entirely in your own head). We'd like the first installment by
Thursday, but consider this a continuing project: as you think up or hear
about ideas, please keep feeding them in. Thanks.
