TEXT:
I'm being asked for planning purposes if May 10 will be an open press
event. Obviously it could conceivably be closed to show how serious it
is. But I assume part of it at least will be open. Does anybody have a
sense yet of how I can answer this? Is the answer that at least part of
it will be open with others besides the President speaking? Or we don't
know that yet?
