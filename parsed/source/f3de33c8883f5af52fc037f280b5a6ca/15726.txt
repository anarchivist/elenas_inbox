TEXT:
I sent you paper late yesterday that HHS wants to release showing how each
state would fare in hitting the minimum wage,and Mary Bourdette is really
pressing me to get this out. Have you had a chance to look at it?

One incredibly major thing I left out:  the brackets around certain text
in the summary page shows text that DOL recommends dropping, and HHS has
agreed we should drop.
