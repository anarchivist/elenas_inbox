        Tobacco -- Proposed State Settlement: On Monday, the eight Attorneys General that
have been negotiating with the tobacco industry plan to announce what they will characterize as
the industry's settlement proposal. States will have until Friday November 20th to decide
whether or not to sign onto the deal.· The settlement would provide an additional $206 billion
over 25 years to the states (in addition to the funds already committed to the four states with
settled suits). The $206 billion includes $183 billion over 25 years in annual payments, nearly
$13 billion over the next 5 years in upfront payments, nearly $9 billion from 2008-2017 in a
"strategic contribution fund" (distributed based on state contributions to the state resolution of
the lawsuits), $1.45 billion over five years for counteradvertising and public education, and $250
million over 10 years for a research foundation. The advertising restrictions are akin to those
adopted in the Minnesota settlement, banning billboards, paid product placements, and
promotional items with brand names or logos (such as hats and gym bags). While the settlement
would ban cartoon characters and forbid marketing targeted at children, it would not go as far as
the FDA rule in restricting images that appeal to children (the rule would limit advertising to
black-and-white text for all billboards, point of sale promotions, and publications, except those
with a predominantly adult readership or at adult only facilities). The proposed settlement
reportedly does not require companies to pass through the settlement costs to consumers, and
Wall Street analyst Gary Black predicts that companies will increase their price by $.15 per pack
rather than the full $.35. The settlement will not have any provisions for fanners.
