TEXT:
Below is a string of emails from the Education Department.  ED is
appealing to remove the work site schools initiative from their budget
based on direction from Mike Smith.  The concerns that the he has raised
are that (1) work site schools give an enrollment preference to children
of employees.  Charters and other public schools of choice have used
lotteries or first-come, first-serve admissions policies. (2) these
schools are out of sync with the fluid movement of employees in the
workforce and will be of limited appeal (actually, employers like these
schools precisely b/c they help employee retention); (3) due to their
small size, these schools might not adequately provide services for
children with disabilities or limited English skills (existing schools
either bring in the necessary teachers or transport the children to the
nearest full-size school for any needed service); and (4) the tax credits
might be difficult to administer.

     Tanya and Mike--

     Below is a message from Tom Skelly to Wayne Upshaw, appealing against
     inclusion of a worksite schools initiative in the 2000 budget, based
     on a message from Mike Smith (further below) .

       Mike Smith doesn't like the. Work-Site demonstration.   Please note
that
       we are appealing this item.

            If I'm not mistaken, the funding for this initiative comes
            out of the $16 million that we requested for the National
            Tests. OMB has suggested that we'll only need a small
            portion of that money for Tests and the rest will go to the
            worksite initiative. They have not specified the exact
            split, but Wei-Min did mention a figure yesterday of $3-5
            million for the Tests.

       Mike--

       This initiative was included in the OMB passback for FIE (although at
       an unspecified funding level) and the Department did not appeal
       against it.   If we want to get rid of it, we will have to act quickly.

        FYI -- Mike cc'd Mike Cohen on this email as well.   I've spoken with
Tanya
     since then, and she wants to have another meeting soon (at ED) to
discuss
     some of the remaining issues of concern on worksite schools.  I'll
tell you
     as soon as I hear any specifics.

        Kristi:   this is a generally bad idea for lots of reasons. The idea
of
      a separate tax credit makes it absolutely awful but insures that it
will not go far in Congress unless the administration is foolishly
adamant. I
agree fully wiht the concern about selection of students -- unfair to
limit
children in the area and foolish politically.   On most of the other
concerns
I assume that the LEA will be proposing against some sort of absolute
priority so liability, services to LEP and disabled kids etc. go away as
an
issue -- these are public schools, the responsibilities are the same as
with
other public schools. We do not want categories of public schools.
Regarding
business some will be for it -- others against it. The biggest problem
here
is that people are job mobile, sometimes on their own and sometimes
against
their will -- many employers do not want people to say that they can't
change jobs or work sites within the same company because they have a
school
near the old site etc.   The.model of the school at the work site builds on
a
middle 20th century model of industry - - where p·eople worked their
lifetimes
in one plant or office building. Mike

        Mike and Terry,
'.
     Ann asked me to update you on a new "work-site schools" proposal that
     Mike Cohen has been working with ED staff to develop in recent
weeks.

        WORK-SITE SCHOOLS BACKGROUND

     The White House is interested in promoting work-site schools --
public
     schools located on the facilities of a business or corporation -- as
a
     new public school choice option, because these schools promote parent
     involvement, relieve school overcrowding, and reduce transportation
and
     facilities costs for school districts.

      There are currently about 30 work-site schools in the US, and the
     majority are K-2 or K-3 schools (many have grown out of corporate
child
      care centers). Typically, the business pays the facilities and
      maintenance costs, and the school district pays for the teachers,
      curriculum, etc.

        Specifically, Mike wants to promote work-site schools through the
        following new initiatives:

        NEW INITIATIVES TO SUPPORT WORK-SITE SCHOOLS

        1. $10 to $20 million in the FY2000 budget for work-site school
        planning grants funded through FIE.  (avg $100, 000-$150, OOO/grant)

        2. $10 to $20 million in the FY2000 budget for a 25% tax credit for
        businesses that enter into cooperative agreements with school
        districts to provide facilities for a public school. The tax credit
        would be capped at $150,000 per taxpayer, and a limited number of
        credits would be available each year (starting with 30 or 60 and
        increasing over 5 years). The five-year cost is estimated at about
        $50 or $60 million. The tax credit would have to be authorized in
        whatever tax bill moves next year.

        3. ESEA Reauthorization. Work-site schools could be one of the
        models we identify as examples of "innovative schools of choice" in
        our proposal to create a broad new public school choice authority.

        (On a related issue -- Mike, OESE is working on a revised version of
        the new choice authority proposal now. They will send a memo for
your
        sign-off in about two weeks, but I would be happy to layout the
        framework of the revised proposal for you before then.)

        UNRESOLVED POLICY ISSUES

        ED staff have helped research and develop these proposals and are
        generally supportive, but there are still a few unresolved policy
        issues.

        Perhaps the biggest issue is that work-site schools would be the
first
     "choice" schools with restricted enrollment. Most charters and
magnets
    use a lottery to determine which students can attend.  In comparison,
·   ,.   oJ




              work-site schools usually establish a preference for the children of
              employees and also serve some children from the immediate area --
              somewhat counter to the definition of a "public school of choice."
              We are researching state laws now to determine whether there will be
              significant legal barriers to the growth of work-site schools on a
              national-scale.

              Other open policy issues:
              Liability issues;
              services to LEP and disabled students;
              How do we promote HIGH-QUALITY work-site schools;
              What does the business community think about work-site schools;
              Message -- can we sell these schools as a new choice initiative?

              Any comments or concerns?

              Thanks,
              Kristi
