FYI- WH Legis Affairs jumped the gun and started making calls to the Hill
today (Dingell and Bliley) but I stopped them before they called anyone
else.

Barbara Woolley and Eric Olsen were going to split up the industry calls.
You can reach Eric at home over the weekend at I P6/(b)(6) I

Jim O'Hara is going on vacation, and Liz Summy is the point of contact for
next week on the co-chair issue. Her number is I P6/(b)(6) I

I will be back at work on Monday morning. Let me know if you need
anything. The release and Q&A are pretty much done. Thanks, Mary
