Attached is a very rough draft of the two-pager for the press department.
Obviously, until we have our B:30 a.m. meeting and make some final
decisions on message, etc. this document won't be final.   However, I think
the basic format and information are there.   Comments, additions,
deletions?? (Q&A to come.)

Announcement

Today, President Clinton holds the first full cabinet meeting of his second term to receive each agency's
response to his March 8, 1997 directive asking all Federal agencies to develop plans to hire welfare
recipients. All of the 21 (777) Cabinet agencies as well as the 120 (77) Non-Cabinet agencies and
departments have submitted plans to the President through the Office of the Vice President. To date, the 21
Cabinet agencies estimate the combined number of welfare recipients they are able to directly hire into the
Federal government over a four year period totals 9,437.

Each head of a Federal agency or department was asked to assess its hiring capacity and to develop a hiring
plan suited to that particular agency's workforce, resources, and needs. All agencies have responded,
though some chose not to set out specific numerical goals and instead opted for more extensive surveying
and outreach to assess hiring capacity.

While every agency plan is different, most plans address the following elements: Agency hiring capacity
and available resources; plans for outreach to potential employees both within the Federal government and
in the private for-profit and nonprofit sectors through government contractors and grantees; job preparation
including formal training, job readiness and education; and plans to retain employees once hired including
addressing child care and transportation issues, as well as using existing Employee Assistance Programs
and creating mentoring or buddy programs to address personal issues that sometimes arise.

Background

On March 8, 1997, President Clinton directed each head of a Federal agency or department to use all
available hiring authorities to hire and retain welfare recipients in jobs in the government. The President
called for agencies to prepare individualized plans for hiring welfare recipients and asked the agencies to
explore and report on ways to help low-income employees gain access to the Earned-Income Tax Credit
(EITC), transportation subsidies, and affordable child care.

Since signing the historic welfare reform law, the President has urged businesses, non-profit organizations,
and religious groups across the nation to help make its promise of opportunity real by offering jobs to
welfare recipients. By taking this action, the President ensures that the federal government, as the nation's
largest employer, does its fair share to move welfare recipients to work.

The Clinton Strategy

The Federal government hiring effort is only one piece of President Clinton's larger strategy to make
welfare refonn a reality. First, the President is visiting state legislatures to share the country's best welfare
to work practices, including job subsidies to employers, and to encourage every state to rise to the
challenge he has laid out to them. Second, the President has enlisted key members of the business
community in his effort, soliciting pledges of help from Sprint, Monsanto, UPS, Burger King, United
Airlines, and Marriot, and others. Third, he continues to reach out to nonprofits and the faith community,
similarly urging them to meet his challenge and offering them infonnation and expertise on how to do so.
Finally, the President has included money in his FY 1998 budget for several welfare to work initiatives.
The President's plan includes: Tax credits and other incentives for businesses that hire people off welfare;
incentives for job placement finns and states to create more jobs for welfare recipients; and training,
                                                                            Hex-Dump Conve:-sioil ·
transportation, and child care to help people go to work.
