MEMORANDUM FOR ERSKINE BOWLES

THROUGH:                  Jack Lew

FROM:                     Don Arbuckle

SUBJECT:                   Heads Up Memo --EPA's OTAG SIP Call


        On Thursday, EPA will announce its final rule for the Ozone Transport Assessment
Group (OTAG) State Implementation Plan (SIP) Call. The rule will address the interstate
transport of pollutants associated with elevated ozone levels in many of the nation's major cities.
 This initiative was identified as a key next step in the President's memo ofJuly 16, 1997 to EPA
on the implementation of the revised ambient air quality standard for ozone.

         The OTAG SIP Call will require 22 eastern States and the District of Columbia to prepare
 State Implementation Plans to obtain substantial additional reductions in NO x emissions in order
to meet EPA-specified State NO x budgets. EP A has structured this regulatory initiative to focus
on reductions in the NO x emissions from fossil-fired --especially coal-fired-- electric utility
plants. EP A estimates the rule will impose costs of roughly $1.7 billion per year; electric
utilities would incur costs of $1.4 billion per year. EP A reports estimated benefits for the rule
ranging from one billion to four billion dollars per year. We completed our review Tuesday
evening and the Administrator plans to sign the package (and make a press announcement)
Thursday afternoon.

        This is a controversial rulemaking. EP A is using for the first time its authority under
Clean Air Act Section 110 to require States to control emissions that "significantly contribute" to
nonattainment problems in downwind States. Because of the importance of this rule, we expect
that some of the Midwestern and Southern States (&&, West Virginia, North and South Carolina,
Kentucky) and electric utilities operating in these areas will criticize the rule and challenge it in
Court. We understand that EPA has been reaching out to the Midwestern and Southern
governors and utilities over the last several weeks. They believe that they have succeeded in
tempering the response to the final rule. Some States (Georgia, Tennessee) will support the final
rule whiie other States in this area will remain neutral. The Northeast States strongly support
the rule.
