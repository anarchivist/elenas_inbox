   TEXT:
   Regarding the Kick Butts Day event tomorrow:



   1}         Remarks.    Andrei Cherny is working on the VP's remarks and is

   putting in a place-holder on the McCain part.             Who do we need to have look

   at the remarks and advise on that portion and can we get one point of

   contact for outside of OVP changes?          Thank you.     FYI: The VP is leaving

   the WH for another event at approximately lOam and then going straight to

   the KBD event.        Ideally, we'd send his final remarks before he leaves.



   2}         Briefing.    Ron Klain asked that either Bruce or Elena be in his

   hold at the school to brief him in person or by speaker-phone on the

   latest up-to-date information on what's happening on the hill on the

   tobacco legislation.       The event is at Hine Jr. High School, 335 8th

   Street, S.E. near Eastern Market.        The VP arrives at 12:15.       Please let me

   know who will be joining us.       Thanks.



   3}         Channel One.     The VP is announcing four small anti-youth

   smoking commitments from organizations: NEA/AFT, Channel One, the Girl
"

    Scouts and Girls Inc.    There was some initial concern   wi   an announcement

    on Channel One given the controversy of advertising in schools.        I checked

    wi   Mike Cohen who directed me to Terry Peterson at Education who told me

    that it was ok to announce as long as it was part of several other

    announcements.   Obviously, this was before the head of Channel One

    appeared on the Today Show this morning to be accused in a new report of

    costing the taxpayers millions of dollars.    We're kind of far down the

    line on having the VP at least mention this tomorrow, but I would like

    your opinion on this. Thanks.
