      As I think I mentioned to you, Bruce, OMB's lawyers have been scouring the
      Hutchison bill looking for loopholes and -- somehow -- they think it might
      not give up the federal claim to these funds or to all of them anyway.

      To preserve certain contingencies, they want to make an incredibly awkward
      change to the language (see below) which I've already told them is
      unacceptable.  I'll ponder this a bit more and let's talk at the staff
      meeting.

      Subject:         CHANGE TO RECOUPMENT LANGUAGE

      I am extremely disappointed that the Congress acted against recoupment of
      funds collected by the States from tobacco manufacturers and does not
      require States to use even a portion of those funds to prevent youth
      smoking.  Even though 3,000 young people become regular smokers every day
      and 1,000 will have their lives cut short as a result, most states still
      have no programs in place to reduce youth smoking. Congress passed up an
      important opportunity to protect our children from the death and diseases
      caused by tobacco. This is wrong.   I will closely monitor state efforts
      in this area and I will continue to fight for a nationwide effort to
      reduce youth smoking through counteradvertising, prevention activities,
      and restrictions on youth access to tobacco products.
