TEXT:
I have one revision to my earlier comments now that I have read the whole
Title I draft.   While not mentioned in their 2-page summary, the full
draft does have some language about states identifying and potentially
taking action in failing school districts.    I still don't think their
current language deals would effectively pressure change in failing and
mediocre school districts, and I'll share any additional ideas I can
develop on this.
