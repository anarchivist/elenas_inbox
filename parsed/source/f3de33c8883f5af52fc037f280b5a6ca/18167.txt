 TEXT:
 OMB has sent to HHS for comment three child support options, saying "a
·decision has been made to include the following items on a list of
potential proposals for the FY 1999 budget."

All the options would convert child support enforcement funding into a
block grant and require states to impose a $25 collection fee on
non-custodial parents from non-welfare families (states could pass
legislation to reduce or increase this fee).
Converting funding to a block grant may discourage state spending to
collect support for families, since states will have to pay 100% of any
"extra" costs.  The fee collection position is a reversal for the
Administration, which has apparently opposed such fees in the past, and
would likely to be opposed by women's and other advocacy groups (who
believe that since so many non-custodial parents don't pay the full amount
owed, families will end up with $25 less per month in child support, since
the fee will be deducted from the less-than-full-amount paid) .
The options would also let states keep all the collections from welfare
families and, as in current law, would distribute incentive funds based on
peformance.

Three Specific Options:   Within this framework, OMB has proposed three
options:

Option #1 would set the block grant at a level to save about $300 million,
the amount that states would collect through the new $25 fees.  In other
words,  since states would collect $300 million in fees, the federal
government would reduce its contribution to the states by $300 million.

Option #2 would set the block grant at a level to save about $1.8
billion.

Option #3 would set the block grant at a level to save about $3.0
billion.
