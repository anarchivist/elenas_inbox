Subject: DRAFT of "Play-by-the-Rules" Homeownership Proposal

Message Creation Date was at 12-DEC-1997 09:05:00

Please find attached a DRAFT of our memo to the President on our
"Play-by-the-Rules" Homeownership proposal. I know that we had originally
discussed a proposal of between $10-$20 million, but NRC came back with a
proposal to help 10,000 families costing $25 million. We can scale this
down,
but I believe that this is the right size. Since it looks as though we
will
have $30 million in the budget for this, the extra $5 million would go to
expand existing NRC efforts.

I need to get comments back by the COB today.  I am sorry for the short
turn
around, but we want to try to get it to the President as soon as
possible.  I
can be reached at 6-5367 or by fax at 6-2223.

MEMORANDUM FOR                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion

SUBJECT:               "Play-by-the-Rules" Homeownership Proposal


        The purpose of this memo is to layout a proposal we developed -- working with DPC,
OMB, HUD, Treasury, and the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation -- that would help
families who pay their rent on time, but have been stymied in buying their own home. This
proposal fits into your overall message of responsibility and opportunity: if a family is responsible
and pays their rent on time, we will help provide them the opportunity of homeownership. This
new initiative would be run by the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation -- a
quasi-governmental agency -- and would be funded by a $30-million increase in their budget
(included in the recommended Presidential initiative list).

Background:

       The Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation (NRC) is a Federally funded, non-profit
corporation which provides technical and financial assistance to community-based affiliates which
use homeownership creation as a neighborhood renewal strategy. These 177 community
organizations -- NeighborWorks Organizations (NWOs) -- serve inner-city communities,
mid-sized cities, and rural communities with programs tailored to serving the revitalization needs
of each individual low-income neighborhood. The NWOs extend credit and counseling to
lower-income and minority individuals if they buy or rehabilitate a home in the network's
designated area.

        In FY96, NRC's budget was $38.7 million. This was increased to $50 million in FY97
and $60 million in FY98. We would request $90 million in FY99. NRC's track record
suggests that a $90 million appropriation would yield over $1 billion in collective lending and
other direct investments byNeighborWorks organizations and financial institutions.
Importantly, the NRC is able to help a high-risk group of new homeowners, but still post a low
default rate. For example, the NRC has a riskier portfolio and its average borrower has a lower
income than those receiving mortgages through FHA. But, the NRC posts default rates that are
about one-half those of the FHA (3-4 percent vs. 6-8 percent).

        Moreover, this initiative could be part of your Initiative on Race. A majority of NRC's
new homeowners are minorities: over 60 percent in the last four years. These numbers are
particularly impressive when compared to the overall home mortgage market: only about 5
percent of all mortgages and about 15 percent of government-backed loans are given to African
Americans, yet 38 percent of NRC's go to African Americans. The numbers are similar for
Hispanics: 6 percent of all mortgages and 12 percent of govemment-backed loans go to
Hispanics, but 20 percent of NRC's new homeowners are Hispanic.

                                                 1
"Play-By-The-Rules" Homeownership Proposal:                              Hex-Dump Conversion

·     Families that desire homeownership are often trapped in situations where they pay so
      much for rental housing that little is left to save for downpayments. Therefore, this
      proposal would be targeted at the 15 million families that pay more than 30 percent of
      their monthly income on rent. In particular, this proposal would help the 7 million
      families that pay more than half of their income on rent. These families often pay their
      rent, utilities, car payments, and other bills on time, but are not able to save enough to
      make a downpayment or closing costs.

·   . The essential part of this initiative is that, in order to qualify, the family must have a
      perfect track record of paying their rent on time over the past 1-3 years. To ensure that
      we keep the default rate down, there will be other secondary screening mechanisms.

·     If a family has done their part and "played-by-the-rules/' we will help them meet the costs
      of becoming a homeowner. This initiative would cost $25 million and would help
      10,000 responsible families become homeowners.

·     In its first year, we would provide grants to 20 to 30 NeighborWorks organizations.
      While we have not determined how we would chose the organizations, we would target
      the program to areas where we could have the biggest impact (e.g., those with low
      homeownership rates).

·     The method of helping each family would differ, allowing the local NeighborWorks
      organizations to determine which method would work best. The following are five
      examples of how we would provide assistance to these eligible families. You should
      know that, in some cases, families would receive a combination of these services. In
      other cases~ families would receive just one of them:

      o      Downpayment Assistance. For many families that pay rent, the downpayment
             is the only obstacle to becoming a homeowner. This initiative would provide an
             average of $2,000 in downpayment assistance to eligible families. If necessary,
             the amount of downpayment assistance could be even higher, if the family meets
             certain requirements.

      o      Closing Cost Assistance. As with a downpayment, closing costs are often a
             hurdle that families can not jump over. We could pay the closing costs on the·
             family'S new home -- averaging $2,000. This amount could be higher or lower,
             depending upon the circumstances. Some families are able to pay the
             downpayment and the closing costs, but because there is a lack of affordable
             housing in their area we are unable to pay the full monthly cost of a mortgage.
             For these families, the NRC would buy down their mortgage rate -- for example,
             their mortgage rate would be 6.25 percent, instead of7.25 percent. This example
             would save a family about $500 per year.

      o      Debt Reduction/Second Mortgage. As with an interest rate buydown, some
             families can make the downpayment and the closing costs, but can not meet the
             monthly mortgage costs. In these cases, the NRC could also pay part of the


                                               2
                                                                       Hex-Dump Conversion
           principal, structured as second mortgage. For example, if a family needed a
           $60,000 mortgage, they would get a $40,000 conventional mortgage and a
           $20,000 mortgage from the NRC. This NRC mortgage could have special terms;
           for example, it could be a deferred loan paid back when the house is sold or it
           could have no payments for five years. The terms of this second mortgage would
           be determined on a case-by-case basis.

    o       Rehabilitation Loan. In many cases, families can make the downpayment,
            closing costs, and monthly payments on a mortgage, but can not also pay for the
            necessary renovation to a new home. These families decide, therefore, not to buy
            a home. Using flexible funds from locally controlled revolving loan funds, the
            NRC can provide low-interest loans to families to redo a kitchen, rebuild a deck,
            or any other renovation that increases the value of the home. Each
            NeighborWorks organization would have the flexibility to tailor the loans to fit
            the needs of the eligible family. This will ensure that the family can afford the
            costs of the loan, while making their monthly mortgage payments. In some cases,
            the NRC will provide families grants to renovate their homes, instead ofloans. It
            is important to note that this form of assistance is critical for inner-city
          . revitalization.

    o      Outreach and Marketing. To many low-income Americans who. are ready to buy
           their own home, conventional information and institutions to obtain a mortgage are
           not readily available. Thousands of families that pay their rent on time have been
           stymied in their pursuit of a homeownership opportunity by a lack of confidence or
           optimism, a lack of historic relationships or comfort with lending institutions, a
           lack of credit history or minor blemishes on their credit report, or other similar
           impediments. In each community selected for participation in this initiative, there
           will be a concerted outreach and marketing effort to address these problems.

·   All families in this program will be required to participate in counseling before they buy
    their home and in post-purchase counseling afterwards.

    o      Pre-Purchase Counseling. Since few American families undcrstand the full
           implications of budget and credit problems in purchasing a home, the NRC runs
           pre-purchase counseling programs for potential new homeowners. Prospective
           homebuyers will not simply be handed a manual to read. Rather, they will be
           required to engage in a process to strengthen their budgeting practices, helping
           families master the skill of paying a mortgage. For many, this will entail a simple
           one-day course.

    o      Post-Purchase Counseling. Post-purchase counseling can often have a significant
           impact for a new homeowner and their community. The shift from renting to
           owning has many rewards and many surprises. Basic home maintenance training,
           tool rental libraries, post-purchase reminders about credit pitfalls, and maintaining
           contact with new owners during the critical first year of ownership can pay large
           returns. Proactive outreach helps prevent delinquency in mortgage payments and
           is far more effective than intervention once a problem has occurred.



                                             3
     investor-owned. A first step to homeownership for many families can be achieved
     through the purchase of two- or three-family homes. In these cases, the family can use
     rent from the tenants in the basement or upstairs apartment to help make mortgage
     payments. This strategy has been particularly effective for new immigrants who often
     have limited credit history and limited income, but have a passion for owning a piece of
     the American Dream. Moreover, since homeowners are more likely to take better care of
     their own property, this approach helps to clean up a community (while providing
     families homeownership opportunities). This initiative will help families buy,
     rehabilitate, and operate these homes through training (e.g., landlord-tenant relations,
     maintenance, repair reserves) and the services mentioned above.

·    Since this is a new program, it is important that we collect data to demonstrate progress,
     experience, and results. Progress will be documented and assessed twice yearly. In
     addition, through a competitive process, NRC will seek an independent evaluation to
     examine the efficacy of this initiative.
