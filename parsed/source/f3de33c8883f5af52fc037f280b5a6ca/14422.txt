TEXT:
some in the choice community and on the hill are aware of the AMA/ACOG
resolutions and the folks i talked to at least are not at uncomfortable
with these.  i do detect some disagreement in terms of how folks think the
matter ought to be approached in the new Congress, but surprisingly, the
gulf is not that wide there. of course, i've only talked to a few folks.
i'm still trying to get to daschle's folks for meeting early this week on
language.
