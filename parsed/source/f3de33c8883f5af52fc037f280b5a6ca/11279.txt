 Subject: DGA Meeting this Saturday -TIME CHANGE TO 3:30PM

 The time for the for the DGA policy meeting has changed to 3:30pm.
 Someone will be waiting to meet your principal outside the room at the
 IntI Trade Building at 3:15pm so that the entire group can enter at
 3:30pm, which will be in the midst of the afternoon's meeting (2:30pm -
 5:30pm). The program will last an hour, and I believe that all WH staff
 and the two secretaries will be sitting at the same table with the
 governors.

 Page me if there are any problems please.

 Thanks.

Can you please confirm your principal's attendance at the DGA meeting this
Saturday from 3-4pm?

You should have received an invitation and agenda from DGA about the
event.  Let me know if you have not.  Basically, Josh, Ann, Bruce and
Steve will be there to back up the three main speakers (Podesta, Riley and
Shalala) and meet with the governors informally.  Please let me know as
soon as you can as DGA is working on programs. Thanks.
