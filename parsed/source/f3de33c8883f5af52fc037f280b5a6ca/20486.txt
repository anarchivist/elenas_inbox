 TEXT:
 This bill also includes changes related to Welfare-to-Work (as Diana's
 earlier note mentioned) and Access to Jobs. We're happy about the
 Welfare-to-Work changes and can live with the ATJ changes.

 welfare-to-Work Eligibility for Non Custodial Parents
 The bill clarifies two issues to facilitate serving non-custodial parents
 under WTW.
 1) As drafted, the BBA requires that in order for a non-custodial parent
 to be eligible for services, the custodial parent must mee~ 2 of the 3
 'hard-to-serve' criteria (educational deficit, substance abuse, poor work
 history). The bill clarifies that either the custodial or non-custodial
 parent can meet these criteria, thereby ensuring that the individual being
 served is the one with the barriers to employment and addressing the
 concern that the organization serving the non-custodial parent would not
 necessarily have access to information about the custodial parent.
 2) As drafted, the BBA requires that in order to serve a non-custodial
 parent, the custodial parent must be a long-term welfare recipient. The
 bill clarifies that either the custodial parent or the minor child of the
 noncustodial parent must be J,ong-term recipients. This addresses child
 only cases.
 DOL thought these amendments were needed, and we agreed.  Ron Haskins was
 very supportive (as was Wendell), but Dennis Smith was not.  The House
 prevailed.

 Access to Jobs Match
 As you know, Access to Jobs envisioned a fairly broad notion of match,
 including allowing other federal funds such as WTW and TANF to be used for
 match. Once W&M and Sen. Finance staff eventually started paying
 attention to ATJ, they raised a issues that were allover the map from
 concern about losing control of "their" TANF funds, to allowing states to
 transfer funds out of TANF to ATJ, to whether this might be a vehicle for
 states to use TANF funds to build roads.  They considered a variety of
 amendments to TANF in the child support bill to address these
 concerns--some real, some perceived. HHS managed to persuade committee
 staff to drop some of the weirder fixes, so what we ended up with is
 definitely better than what could have been, but it's not perfect. The


 provisions got pretty messy given multiple agencies and committee
 jurisdictions. There'll be an opportunity--and challenge--to work with
 HHS, DOL, and DOT to operationalize these provisions as DOT develops the
 criteria for Access to Jobs competitive grants.

 What ended up in the child support bill:
 1. TANF funds used as ATJ match must be used for new or expanded
 transportation services (and not for construction),   and the preponderance
 of Access to Jobs funds (including TANF match) must be spent on current or
 former TANF recipients and noncustodial parents (ATJ has a somewhat
 broader eligibility criteria--current and former TANF recipients, or those
 up to 150% of poverty) .
 2. Any TANF funds used as ATJ match are subject to the 30% cap on
 transferability.   In other words, even though there is no new authority
 for states ·to transfer funds out of TANF to ATJ, if they use TANF funds to
 match ATJ, this amount combined with any transfers to child care and SSBG
 cannot exceed 30% .. We were not thrilled with the principle --if a state
 identifies transportation as a major need,' why would we want to limit the
 amount they could use to leverage additional transportation resources?
 But,  this is not likely to pose a serious practical constraint since
 almost all states have plenty of room under their 30% cap and ATJ is so
 much smaller than TANF (ATJ = up to $140 M/year while TANF = $16 B)
 3. If someone receives transportation "benefits" through Access to Jobs,
 but is not receiving any other TANF assistance, these transportation
 benefits are not considered TANF assistance. This allows someone who just
 needs help with transportation, either after they have moved from welfare
 to work or in lieu of getting on welfare, to be served through ATJ
 (including TANF match) without invoking the time limits, child support
 assignment, and other TANF requirements.   While there is some slippery
 slope concern on the definition of assistance, it did not seem appropriate
 to fight this issue here after we'd been so vocal about the need for
 transportation.
