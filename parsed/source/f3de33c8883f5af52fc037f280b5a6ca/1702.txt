TEXT:
This is an update on possibilities for a charter school event.      We would
appreciate your thoughts on next steps.

Currently we see the following options:

I. Washington State bill-signing ceremony
There are two windows within which this event could occur:

1) The bill passed the House by a wide margin on Friday, and goes to the
Senate next.  If the bill receives final approval before April 20, the
governor has 5 days to sign, and we would have to move very quickly. We
think the earliest that the bill would be ready for signing is April 17;
the end of this period would be approximately April 24.

2) If the bill is passed on or after April 20, the Governor has 20 days to
sign.  If the bill is passed on April 21, then the Governor would have
until approximately May 11 to sign.   If the bill is passed on the last
day of the session April 27, then the governor would have until
approximately May 17.

Mike is going to be contacting the Governor Locke's office to let them
know that we are interested in doing something with them and ask them to
keep us updated on the progress of the bill.

In planning an event in Washington, we need to be aware that, by the time
a signing ceremony is arranged, the legislature could easily have gone
out.   Would we want the governor to call the legislature back into
session?

This would be a good place to announce some of our products, such as the
national study, the guidebook for school boards/chartering authorities,
and possibly the new grant competition; however, if we wanted to create 2
different events, we could separate out some of these pieces.

II. White House Event

This could either be a radio address or something else.  Ideally it would
occur close in time to (either just before or after) the WA charter bill
signing. We could use this as the occasion to announce our package of
charter schools products.

III. Another Event Connected to State Legislation



   Down the line, we may see other opportunities to visit legislatures, take
   part in charter bill signings, etc. As of now, we are not aware of any
   state where the combination of timing, quality of legislation and other
   dynamics are anywhere close to what they currently are in Washington.
   However, we will keep our ears to the ground.

   Please let us know how you think we should proceed.   Thanks.
