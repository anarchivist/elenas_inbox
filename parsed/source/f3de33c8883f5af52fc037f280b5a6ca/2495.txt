        To address a few concerns:



        This version is NOT more comprehensive than Local Flex bill last

year.



         That bill was govt-wide, and included regulatory agencies -- was a

        lot of opposition from regulatory side, particularly

        environmentalists.



        This version also includes only programs under jurisidiction of

        Labor-HHS-Ed Appropriations subcommittee - not justice, agriculture,

        et al.



        Strong opposition last year came from,   in addition to

        environmentalists, the education voucher issue (which needs to be

        addressed through exclusion) and from labor unions. Re: labor unions,

        the Admin's exclusions list for Local Flex addressed this ... a more

        specific list is part of the Workforce Flexibility provisions passed

        in approp. act last year. These were worked out with labor unions and

        include the following exclusions:
 ~.




      For Title I-III of JTPA (EXCEPTIONS for requirements relating to wage

      and labor standards, grievance procdures and judicial review,

      non-discrimination, allotment of funds (would not want this if want

      funding flexibility), and eligibility (don't recommend this; really

      restricts flexibilityO)



      For Wagner-Peyser Act (EXEMPTIONS FOR: requirements relating to the

      provision of services to unemployment insurance claimants and

      venterans, and to univesal access to basic labor exchange services

     without cost to job sekkers)==================== ATTACHMENT      1 ===============
