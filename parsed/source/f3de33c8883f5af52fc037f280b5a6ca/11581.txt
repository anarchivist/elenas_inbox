     6. FOOD SAFETY

     A. Congressional Action on Food Safety:
          Our major objective over the next several months will be to re-affirm the
          Administration's position as the leader in the fight for better regulation offood and
          place opponents in the spotlight for being against needed measures. We intend to
          highlight our pro-consumer position by supporting our food safety budget initiative,
          and pushing two legislative measures which will increase USDA's authority to
          regulate unsafe food production and provide better oversight of imported food.

                   I. Legislative Status: The food safety budget will be the subject of
            congressional hearings beginning in mid-March. The SAFER Meat and Poultry Act,
            which gives USDA the ability to recall products and impose civil fines, is included in the
            Senate Democratic Leadership package. Senator Harkin has the lead. Our bill to give
            FDA greater authority to halt food imports from countries that do not have adequate food
            safety inspection systems has been the subject of interest to Senator Collins, a key
            Committee chair. She has told the FDA that she would push for a compromise bill if
            the Administration agreed to support it. We have not responded to her. Ifwe agree,
            the bill could well pass. Ifwe do not, the bill is unlikely to leave committee.

                    II. Presidential Actions:
                     We are exploring events with new technologies in the food safety area that
            highlight the need for investments in prevention and surveillance. In addition, the July
            4th radio address is an excellent opportunity to urge passage of our budget request and
            food safety legislation.


                     III. Republican Agenda: Republicans in the past have opposed new spending
            in this area and our legislation to give agencies greater authority. Last year we were
            able to obtain most of our requested initiative funding following a Senate floor battle.
            We will likely have a similar dispute this year. On the imported food legislation,
            Senator Collins has held hearings on the problem and will likely continue to work on the
            issue seeking a bipartisan compromise. Republicans have indicated that under the
            Administration bill they are worried that farmers in the U.S. will be faced with new
            regulations.
