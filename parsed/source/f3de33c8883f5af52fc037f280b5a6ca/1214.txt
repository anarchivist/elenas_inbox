TEXT:
The following ideas were suggested for our review.  Some are half-baked,
some less so, and others may be worth pursuing. Could you look into them
and get back to Elena by COB Tuesday your advice on the ones in your area,
as well as any better ideas you may have? Thanks. This is the same drill
as before -- what's your guess as to whether it's l)advisable; and 2)
something we can get done, and how long will it take us to make a
recommendation.

Thanks. The more good ideas of our own we put in the pipeline, the less
of this we'll have to do.

1. Child care (Cynthia/Elena):  The govt runs the largest day care
operation in the country. Could we open govt day care centers to people
who don't work for the govt for a reasonable fee?   [Cynthia: We should
also look at other child care ideas that might make more sense, like
endorsing an expansion of the dependent care tax credit, underwriting a
major effort to build child care centers, etc.]

2. Environment (Diane/Paul): 1) Is EPA working on an expansion of right
to know laws to cover chemical waste in 7 additional industries? 2) When
will EPA develop the Safe Water regs requiring every water company to send
every consumer an annual statement showing test results of the quality of
water in their tap and any health concerns about drinking it? 3) Are we
expanding Brownfields?

·
    3. Education/Volunteerism (Diana/Mike): For the service summit, are depts
    considering adopting schools? Could every dept adopt 10 schools?   [OR
    could they sponsor charter schools? What would they do with a school they
    adopted?]

    4. Family Leave (Paul/Elizabeth/Elena): Could the President do an
    executive order to extend family leave for federal employees to cover
    routine doctor visits etc. (in line with our legislative proposal)?

    5. Education (Mike):  Can we do anything to provide monetary incentives
    for American students to take engineering courses?

    6. Aggressive Drivers (Elizabeth):  Is DOT working on a way to set up a
    system for people to call police from the road on phones to report the
    location of reckless or aggressive drivers?

    7. Criminal Checks for Nannies, Home Health Care (Dennis/Chris):
    Apparently a couple in NY whose nanny murdered their child is crusading
    for this. Do we have a database, registry, or background checks for
    this?  [Haven't we done this 10 times already? The Oprah bill, and the
    new home health care regs, etc.]

    8. Medical Records Privacy (Chris): Did you see the NYT story yesterday
    on the commission on this issue? Can the HC Quality Commission look at
    this sometime this century?

    Thanks.  We'll get a better system down soon.   I know it's a pain and
    occasionally goofy, but it's important.
