TEXT:
Yesterday, Judge Hogan issued his order on our request for an
extension of the stay from his earlier injunction to release all
timber sale units on national forests and BLM units in Oregon and
Washington for which the government's "known to be nesting"
determinations for marbled murrelets did not meet the criteria set
out in his decision in his January decision.  You will recall that
Judge Hogan granted a 60 day stay upon issuance of his injunction,
and that those 60 days ran out on March 25th. Argument on the
case before the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals is scheduled for May
7th. We asked that the stay of his injunction be extended until
such time as the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals issues it decision,
and, in the event that the court did not extend the stay, that
Judge Hogan grant a 5 day stay so that we may seek a stay with the
Court of Appeals.
We also suggested that if Judge Hogan refused to grant our first
request, he reconsider his determination regarding 22 particular
sale units for which the court's "known to be nesting" standards
were almost, but not quite met.
During the 60 day stay period, Judge Hogan had asked industry
plaintiffs to submit a list of those sale units which the
government had determined would not meet the "Hogan protocol" for
"known to be nesting" AND that the industry claimed had to be
harvested immediately in order to meet the Rescission Act's Sept.
30 deadline.


Of 100 sale units that the government had conceded would not meet
Hogan's protocol for "known to be nesting", industry plaintiffs
listed 75 sale units on which they contend they must commence
harvesting immediately to meet the Sept. 30th deadline.
In yesterday's decision, Judge Hogan acknowledged both his concern
that the judicial process will "trump the intent of Congress" as
well as his recongition that "irreparable harm.     . may result
from the harvesting of actual and potential marbled murre let
habitat." He also conceded that the 9th Circuit might modify the
standards he set out in his order, although expressing skepticism
that they will overturn it completely.
Based on his balancing of these equities, he ordered as follows:
o       as to the 25 sale units that the industry i"s not claiming
immediate need to harvest, the stay is extended another 60 days;
o       with regards to the 22 "close to meeting Hogan's standard"
sales, he has extended the stay for 14 days (presumably to allow
the agencies the opportunity to resurvey. Unfortunately,
murrelets are just now beginning to return to these units and it
may be very difficult to meet his standards. The full population
isn't expected until May.)
o       as to the 52 remaining sale units for which plaintiffs
claim an immediate need to commence harvest, the stay is extended
for 5 days (to let us get to the 9th Circuit.)
o       no stay is necessary for the 48 sale units that Hogan has
determined include "known to be nesting" murrelets, as the
industry has not challenged that determination.
DOJ will begin preparing the appeal.
