 TEXT:
 Today Graham, Murray, Bayh, and Leahy staff told us they see serious
 interest on Lott's part in moving the Hutchison bill and we better move on
 our negotiations with NGA.  Hutchison now has 36 cosponsors (including 7
 Democrats) and they foresee it reaching 50.

 Here's what I'd propose we do next:

 1)  Bruce should call Carper and Gregoire to try to jump start the
 process.  I think it would be to our advantage to have the AGs at the
 table. Does NCSL need to be there too?

 2) We need to get the sign off internally to move forward.  Because of the
 potential budget tradeoffs, Jack Lew (per Josh) wants there to be a
 Podesta level conversation.  So I propose we first have a meeting in
 Bruce's office to be followed by a Podesta meeting to decide:

 a) What menu are we pushing for.  (See below for proposal; BR/EK -- I've
 told Josh that you think his "federal piece" is unrealistic and
 inconsistent with what the President told the Governors.  The
 Graham-Murray-Bayh-Leahy I think helped persuade him.)

 b) Can we issue veto threats

 3) In the meantime we should continue to encourage bipartisan alternatives
 but so far I'm not encouraged by our success (besides Chafee no R has been
 receptive to any alternative). Conrad's staff is now thinking they may
 need to put out a D only alternative in order to get one on the table.
 They want our help in drafting.

  Settle the federal claim (57% of the tobacco settlement funds)   in exchange
  for a commitment that states spend the funds on:

   - Tobacco Related Public Health, No less than 15 percent of the funds
  must be spent in this area on:  cessation, prevention and education, and
  enforcement.
  - Tobacco Farmers
          - Public Health Services (e.g. community health centers and our
  new proposal)
          - CHIP Outreach
          - Maternal and Child Health Care
          - Substance Abuse Treatment and Education
          - Child care

  Maintenance of effort would apply.

  States would remit to the federal government the $2.9 billion CBO-scored
  cost ..

  Commitment would apply to all years of tobacco settlement (not just the
  five year budget window) .
