                               COMMUNITY COLLEGE EVENT

                               DATE:                  September 26, 1997
                               LOCATION:              San Jacinto Community College
                               EVENT TIME:            2:00 pm - 3:00 pm
                               FROM:                  Bruce Reed

     I.    PURPOSE

           To highlight the significance of the HOPE Scholarship and the Lifetime Learning
           Tax Credit in making two years of college available and affordable. You will
           announce the release of a Department of Education Report which identifies how
           these two items in the balanced budget help students in community colleges, and
           highlights how community colleges are providing a high-quality education that
           prepares millions of Americans to participate in the new economy.

     II.   BACKGROUND

           You will be addressing approximately 2,000 students and administrators from
           community colleges in the Houston area at the San Jacinto Community College in
           Pasadena, Texas. The school's three campuses serve a total of 19,500 students,
           ranging from recent high school graduates to professional adults with college
           degrees seeking additional training. the average student is 27 years old. San
           Jacinto is a comprehensive two-year community college that offers degrees in
           applied science, arts, and a certificate of technology. The school has partnerships
           with local companies - such as petroleum companies, automobile manufacturers,
           and NASA - to teach students the skills they need to enter directly into the work
           force and to train them on the most up-to-date technology. Tuition, fees, and books
           for the average San Jacinto student is $662 a semester and classes average about 25
           students per instructor.
           You will be announcing the release of the Department of Education Report on
           Community Colleges, which describes how these institutions provide a high quality
           education to a diverse array of students and underscores that they are now
           remakably affordable - the average cost next fall is expected to be $1,300. The
           report includes the following new projections for the 1998-1999 school year:

           ·     HOPE SCHOLORASHIP: The HOPE Scholarship will cover up to 88% of the
                 national average full-time costs of community colleges. In seven States, including
                                                                             Records Management System
                                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion

             Texas, HOPE will cover up to 100 percent of community college tuition and fees.
             In 35 States, HOPE will cover up to 75 percent or more of tuition and fees.
             5.8 million students are expected to benefit from the HOPE Scholarship for all
             types of higher education.

      ·      PELL GRANTS: 1.4 million community coUege students are estimated to receive
             PeU grants averaging $1,810. Pell Grants are available on a sliding scale based on
             income, and can be used to cover tuition and fees as well as college living
             expenses. The Balanced Budget includes your proposal for the largest increase in
             pell grants in two decades, to a maximum of $3,000.

      ·      7.1 Million Will Benefit from Lifetime Leaming Tax Credit. For students beyond
             their first two years of college, including those who are returning to school full or
             part-time, the Taxpayers Relief Act offers a 20 percent tax credit for the first
             $5,000 of tuition and fees paid by a student. It is expected that 7.1 million
             students will take advantage of the credit to help pay for postsecondary education.

      As you know, some adult students (those who are over 24 or veterans, and are either
      single or married without dependent children) can be quite poor, but still not
      eligible for a Pell Grant. And these students cannot get the full HOPE Scholarship
      because they do not have sufficient tax liability. Therefore, it is critical that
      Congress adopt your budget request to increase this group's eligibility for Pell
      Grants - as required by the Balanced Budget Agreement. Currently, the House has
      included a partial fix, but it would require further legislation, and the Senate has not
      provided any funds to address this "independent" student problem. This continues to be
      one of our top priorities in the continuing negotations over the Labor-HHS
      Appropriations Bill.
