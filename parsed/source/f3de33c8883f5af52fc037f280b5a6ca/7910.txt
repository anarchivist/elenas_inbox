MEMORANDUM FOR GENE SPERLING

FROM:                     JONORSZAG

SUBJECT:                  Policy Announcements for National Homeownership Week


         I believe that any remarks for Homeownership Week would (1) emphasize our
accomplishments over the past five years; (2) push for our housing agenda (welfare-to-work
vouchers, low-income housing tax credit expansion, "play-by-the-rules" homeownership
initiative); and (3) put forward a new policy announcement. A fourth potential component of
any announcement would acknowledge the efforts of Habitat for Humanity and their "House' that
Congres Built" effort. 1

         Over the past two months, we have held a number of homeownership meetings with the
goal of developing newsworthy initiatives that do not spend "new money." These meetings
have included representatives of HUD, Treasury, NEC, DPC, OMB, OTS, Federal Home Loan
Bank, Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation, Agriculture, aI?-d PIR (for the One America
initiative). Through this process, we have developed two potential announcements for
Homeownership Week: the first would be more of a. fair housing and homeownership
announcement; the second would be more about providing incentives to lower income
Americans to become homeowners.

Option 1: One America Announcement

        Last fall, HUD and NAR concluded a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) which sets
forth the broad outline of a One America housing initiative and the ii.ghts and responsibilities of
the parties. One potential policy announcement is the final details of this initiative.

         Over the past several months, HUD and NAR have been working through the details of
the initiative and they are about to be finalized. Under the terms of the final agreement, NAR
will develop a cultural diversity certification program which will reflect the letter and spirit of the
President's One America initiative and will be subject to approval by HUD. Upon approval,


         1 Millard Fuller, the founder of Habitat for Humanity wrote a letter to the President on Habitat's "The
Houses That Congress Built" (THTCB) program. June 6 will be Habitat's focus day for their THTCB program.
The Houses That Congress Build is a joint initiative launched by Habitat, the House of Representatives and various
funding groups to build at least one house in each of the 435 Congressional Districts. To date, about 400
Representatives have pledged their support to THTCB program, providing assistance in raising funds for the
building costs and anY other general help. On June 6, over 68 Representatives, as well as members of the Clinton
Administration, are scheduled to be on location at various sites to show their support for THTCB program.
                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion

HUD would pennit NAR to award the use of the One America mark and logo by real estate
professional who are free of fair housing violations and successfully complete the one-day
training program.

        HUD will promote the One America initiative in an advertising campaign on television,
in public service announcements, speeches, interviews, in FHA advertising, and on HUD's Web
page.

       The agreement goes on to spell out the tenns governing use of the One America mark and
logo by certified real estate professionals, restrictions on its use, and circumstances requiring its
surrender.

          A final draft of the agreement has been approved by NAR and is in final review by HUD.


Option 2: Individual Development Accounts

        As you know, Individual Development Accounts (IDAs) are a new innovative idea that
the Administration has supported in the past (but never put any money towards). They help
lower income American boost savings by matching each dollar the individual deposits with
public (or private) funds. The match, in some cases, is as high as eight to one, even though we
envision something more in line with two-four to one. The match could come from the
government, non-profit, or from a for-profit entity. Withdrawals from the IDA are generally
allowed for only buying a home; education and training; or starting a new business.
Participation would be limited to lower American families. In general, participation is limited to
those eligible for welfare or have an income below the EITC phase-out point, and have net worth
below $10,000.

          There is one main way that we can promote IDAs (and three more minor ways -- see
below):

         1.      Endorse Coats Legislation. Sen. Coats is the lead sponsor on a 4-year, $100
million IDA demonstration program -- the Assets for Independence Act -- under which states and
local agencies and/or non-profits would be funded to operate IDA programs providing a match of
no less than one to one and no more than eight to one for each odllar of earned income deposited
into the account. Under the Coats bill, preference in the application process would be given to
entities that are able to attract pledges of substantial non-Federal -- especially private sector --
funding to serve as a match for Federal dollars. In the Senate, the co-sponsors of this legislation
are: Harkin, DeWine, Abraham, Lugar, Levin, Moseley-Braun, Collins, Wellstone. In the
House, the legislation is sponsored by T. Hall and co-sponsored by conservatives such as Kasich
to liberals such as Olver.                                                           .

          You should know that the endorsement of Coats' bill would raise an issue about how we.


                                                 2
                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion

     are paying for our endorsement. While $25 million for FY99 is not much money, we may raise
     an issue about supporting legislation and not offering to "pay for it." In the past, we have
     offered to "work with Congress to find appropriate offsets." We could do this in this case, but it
     raises this issue.

            Moreover, supporting the Coats legislation makes it difficult for us to come forward with
     our own more comprehensive proposal in the FY2000 budget. While we will not be completely
     locked in, it would be any new proposal in our next budget less newsworthy.

           In conjunction with any announcement on IDAs, we could also make three other
     announcements:

     1.     FFIEC Letter to Clarify That Banks Can Receive CRA Credit for IDA Programs.
            The Corporation for Entreprise Development (CFED) has been at the forefront of this
            issue and they believe that a definitive, and inclusive, regulatory posItion statement is
            needed to encourage financial institution participation. To that end, OTS has worked
            with CFED to craft a request for an interagency (FFIEC) CRA interpretation on IDAs.
            OCC was awaiting a formal interpretation from a major bank, which they supposedly
            received last week. Therefore, the regulatory agencies are prepared to issue a formal
            interpretatiQn that states that IDAs, designed for the education, housing or business
            development benefit of low- or moderate-income individuals, serve community
            development purposes and would therefore be eligible for credit under the Community
            Reinvestment Act. This should allay concerns and facilitate partnerships among
            financial institutions.

     2.     Letter from HUD to State and Local Areas To Clarify That HOME and CDBG
            Funds Can Be Used To Establish IDA Programs. While HOME and CDBG funds
            can currently be used to establish IDA programs, many state and local areas do not know
            that this is an eligible activity. Therefore, HUD would issue a clarification letter that
            would state that HOME and CDBG funds can be used for IDA programs that benefit low-
            and moderate-income Americans.

     3.     Examples of IDA Programs. The Partners in Homeownership are also prepared to
            release a booklet of examples of current IDA programs. I would not suggest calling this
            a "best practices" booklet because we do not yet know how successful IDA programs
            have been. This book would solely be a book about how IDAs have been set up so far.
