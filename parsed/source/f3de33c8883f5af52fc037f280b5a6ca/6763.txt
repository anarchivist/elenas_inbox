TEXT:
        As Sally suggested, here is a tenative timetable we set at the
meeting today:

1.      Monday, March 23: Audrey, Sally and Elena will meet with Judy
Lichtman, Marcia Greenberger, Susan Bianchi, and others to get them on
board with supporting Daschle on the uncapped compensatory and punitive
damages, but removing or substituting something for Daschle's data
collection section. ,We all agreed that the issue of data collection
needs to be carefully looked at before we make any kind of announcement.
However, the BLS study would be part of any announcement the VP would make
on April 3. Audrey is setting this meeting up.

2.      Afterwards: Call to Ellen Varygas to let her know what the
women's groups agreed to.

3.     Mid-week: meeting with Daschle's staff to revise bill.      (Also
with Gephardt's staff as appropriate).

4.      As soon as we are agreed on our package, we need to let the
agencies know what they will have to complete before April 3 (the
self-audit for businesses and employees and the OPM Guide) .
