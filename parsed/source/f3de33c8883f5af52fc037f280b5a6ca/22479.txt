Subject:         NY welfare injunction

Ruling that the Giuliani administration had over1ooked·the "urgent needs"
of the poor in its zeal to implement welfare reform efforts, Judge William
H. Pauley III of Federal District Court in lower Manhattan issued an
injunction barring city officials from expanding their efforts to expand
new welfare policies and requiring a corrective action plan by February
10 ... The judge ordered the city to revise its training and procedures to
insure that workers are following federal law.    "The city defendantsO,
practices continue to endanger numerous individuals in need of public
assistance, including children, expectant mothers and the disabled," Judge
Pauley wrote in a 49-page decision issued this morning. The ruling
acknowledged that welfare workers had repeatedly violated Federal laws
that require them to allow people to apply for food stamps and Medicaid
without delay.
