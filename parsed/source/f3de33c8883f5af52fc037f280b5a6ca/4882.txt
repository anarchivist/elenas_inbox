TEXT:
Both before and after our meeting with Erskine last week, there was some
discussion about doing a cross-cut in the FY 99 budget on race.  Following
up on those discussions, how can we get that process going? Should we
call a meeting with the four of you, plus Frank Raines? Let me know how
you think we should proceed.
