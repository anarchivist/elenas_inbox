     THE EDITORS: GETTING TESTY

     By The Editors

     six years ago, then-President George Bush announced his support for
     national education
     standards--a single, nationwide 'set of criteria to gauge the performance
     of students and schools.
     Congressional Democrats shot down the plan. New tests, they argued, would
     serve only to
     stigmatize poor performance.

     TNR supported Bush's proposal in 1991, and we support the virtually
     identical national testing plan
     President Clinton proposed in this year's State of the Union address. But
     now, 10 and behold, it's the
     Republicans who are lining up against the idea. Lamar Alexander, who led
     the fight for national


performance tests as Bush's education secretary, now fulminates against
them. Alexander'S confusion
seems to have permeated his party. Chester Finn, a former assistant
secretary of education under
President Reagan who serves as the GOP's eminence grise on the topic,
first issued a ringing            ·
endorsement of Clinton's plan-- "better than Bush's"--then later announced
his modified, updated
view that "the president's proposal would do more harm than good."

Confused? So, obviously, are the Republicans. Their excuses for opposing
fourth-grade reading
tests and eighth-grade math tests seem awfully, well, excuse-like. The
tests would cost virtually
nothing--$15 million a year--but William Goodling, chairman of the House
Education Committee,
vaguely proposes to spend the money instead on "the classroom." New
federal pencil boxes for
every second grader!

House Speaker Newt Gingrich says that instead Clinton "ought to be
focusing on local parents, local
students and local teachers," but it's hard to understand what this phrase
even means. There is no
such thing as a parent, student or teacher who isn't local, since everyone
resides in a locality. If
Gingrich wants all initiatives to well up from the grass-roots, then
President Clinton can't very well
"focus" on them, since everything he proposes is by definition a national
initiative. If Gingrich is trying
to suggest that Clinton should not subject local government to federal
regulation, his objection is
groundless. Any school or state would have the right to opt out of the
tests.

Perhaps the underlying reason for Republican opposition is that national
tests will nationalize the
debate over education. Currently, parents have no objective measure by
which to compare the
performance of their child's school district with any other. National
standards would allow for
inter-district comparisons, -thus empowering parents to question the
backward and inefficient
practices employed by many local school boards. This in turn would expose
conservatism's local
control fetish. Critics of public education--those who wish to replace it
with vouchers, rather than
those who wish to improve it-- point to the superior educational
performance of foreign schools,
while failing to acknowledge that all other major industrial countries
have centralized, nationally run
public school systems.

Of course, should national testing spark a movement for real reform,
conservatives are not the only
ones who would be threatened. Many administrators and teachers from poor,
low-performing
school districts resist national standards. Diagnosing the problem, they
argue, is not a substitute for
treating it. True. But the public will never face up to public education's
..

inequalities and inadequacies
until the consequences of those inequalities are laid out in hard numbers.
National testing would not
only spur reform, it would also serve as an essential condition of reform.
Without testing, there's no
way to know if reform is actually working.

Clinton's plan, then, has no appreciable downside and could even be a
first step toward transforming
the political climate on education. But the promise of reform is not the
same thing as reform, and for
this reason Clinton's education plan, taken as a whole, doesn't quite
warrant the lyrical rhetoric with
which the president has surrounded it. After all, education was supposed
to be the cornerstone of
Clinton's second term. But, in pursuit of a budget deal with the
Republicans, he bargained away his
highly touted plan to spend $5 billion renovating dilapidated, inner-city
schools.

The one portion of his education package that he refused to negotiate--tax
deductions and credits
for college tuition--is a transparent political bribe and a grossly
inefficient method of increasing
access to college. That Clinton put a higher priority on tax pork for the
middle class than on far
cheaper, and more urgent, aid for the truly needy belies his grandiose
pronouncements. The only
thing worse than Clinton's settling for modest reform is the Republicans'
obtuse resistance to modest
reform in education.
