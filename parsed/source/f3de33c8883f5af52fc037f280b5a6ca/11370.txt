TEXT:
The following is the list of schools currently being considered for the
President's commencement schedule this spring. Any schools with
commencement dates that conflict with the President's current schedule
have been eliminated. The aim is for the President to deliver 3 or 4
commencement speechs this year. A decision has been made to hold off on
deciding what the specific messages will be at each commencement, but they
are proceeding with looking at specific schools and regions.

The group is aiming for including the following types of schools in the
group this year:
Annual Military Commencement                    Air
Force            June 2, 1999
Large State School
Elite School
* An address at Howard University is being seriously considered, and there
have been a lot of calls to the White House advocating for the President
to deliver a commencement address there.

They would also like to be able to do one address in the South and one in
the Midwest.

All that was said regarding potential message was that Waldman would like
to reserve speeches on l)race and 2) "third way".
