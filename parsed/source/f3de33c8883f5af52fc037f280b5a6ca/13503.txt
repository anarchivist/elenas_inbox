TEXT:
On Apr. 1st, I circulated a route slip regarding an OPM draft
bill, "Office of Special Counsel Amendment." Attached to this
route slip were the OPM draft bill and the comments that we have
received to date on that document.
Please note that the DOJ comments as contained in that package
were INCORRECTLY marked -- i.e., I inadvertently put the insert
in the wrong sentence of speaker letter.  The insert should be
placed 2 lines down in that same paragraph. The CORRECT DOJ
comment is the following:
-- On the 1st page of the Speaker letter, 2nd paragraph, last
sentence, strike out "proposing to take the action ordered," and
insert lieu thereof "initiating proceedings against the
employee,".
This is DOJ's only comment on the draft bill.  Please let me know
by COB Thursday, April 4th (when comments on due on the full
package) if you have any problems with the above comment.  If I
do not hear from you by then, I will assume that you approve of
the above DOJ comment.
Thanks.
