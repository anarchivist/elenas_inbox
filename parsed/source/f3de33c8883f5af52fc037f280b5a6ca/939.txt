TEXT:
TOBACCO:   February 27th -- POTUS/VP event w/FDA Commissioner Kessler to
mark the first effective date of FDA's tobacco regulation and Kessler's
departure.    Structure still under discussion.

HUMAN RADIATION EXPERIMENTS: March (?)    -- release of Administration
report, Building Public Trust: Actions to Respond to the Advisory
Committee on Human Radiation Experiments, and signing of EO on classified
human research.   (If we don't do POTUS event, we should get the report
out the door soon anyway) .
Event would include Secretaries of HHS, DOE, and possibly DOD, Hazel
O'Leary, Advisory Cmt Members, and a small number of stakeholders.

TRANSPORTATION SAFETY (reprise): March 7 DOT is supposed to deliver a
report the President requested January 23 outlining a plan to increase the
use of seatbelts nationwide.   DOT is working with a coalition of industry
and consumer types.  Report will push for state primary seatbelt laws and
greater enforcement of passenger restraint laws, and it may hold up North
Carolina's enforcement program as a model. We could do an eVent with
leading states and law enforcement types.

 FDA RULE REQUIRING COMPANIES TO TEST SAFETY OF DRUGS IN KIDS (not ready
 yet):  FDA is considering issuing a rule requiring that drugs be tested in
 kids for safety and efficacy before FDA approves them. Currently, 80% of
 drugs prescribed for kids have not been tested and approved explicitly for
pediatric use and are therefore not "labeled" for pediatric use. As a
 result, doctors often don't know what doses are safe and whether the drug
 will be effective, and Medicaid does not always reimburse their use in
 kids.  This is a big issue for the AIDS community and pediatric groups.
 I've been working with the VP and First Lady's offices to see what we can
 do short of regulation, but since incentive-based approaches have failed,
 FDA will recommend -- and the White House may support -- requiring
pediatric tests.   Drug companies will oppose, but have a hard case to
make.   I'll keep you posted.  If we do it, it has great event potential.
·Fits perfectly with the kids EO Diane is working on, but is on a separate
 track.
