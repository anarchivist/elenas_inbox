           SUBCOMMITTEE ON IMMIGRATION AND CLAIMS
               OF THE HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE

                        April 21, 1998


Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee:

     We appreciate this opportunity to share the views of the
Administration on whether this country's important
high-technology industry should be afforded increased access
to foreign workers to meet its growing demand for high skilled
workers.   In doing so, I also want to again call your attention
to the pressing need for reform of the H-IB nonimmigrant visa
program through which increased numbers of foreign workers are
being sought by the high-technology industry.

      The Administration believes that our information
technology (IT) industry is an essential element of our
continuing, strong economic growth and wider prosperity.    Our
interest in the industry's strength is evidenced by our
participation in a recent convocation in Berkeley that assessed
IT work force needs.  Further, as you know from Administration
proposals advanced beginning in 1993, we believe that the H-IB
program needs fundamental reform.   I would like to commend the
Subcommittee for its interest in these issues.

     We believe the issue of whether to afford the IT industry
increased access to foreign temporary workers should be
evaluated within the framework of the following three questions:

     (1)  Is there a shortage of skilled U.S. workers to fill
     jobs in the IT industry and meet future workforce needs?

     (1)  What would be the consequences of raising the cap
     on the number of foreign workers admitted under the H-IB
     program?
                                                    Hex·Dilmp Conversion

(3) . Can the current H-IB program provide the IT industry
appropriate access to foreign workers while still protecting
the job opportunities, wages and working conditions of u.s.
workers?

     I will address each of these in turn.


                 Tight Labor Markets Exist But
               U.S. Skills Shortages Are Unclear

      Proponents of allowing increased IT industry access to
foreign workers argue that this is necessary for the industry
to be able to overcome an acute shortage of skilled u. s. workers.
 While there is no dispute that there is strong growth in demand
for workers in the IT industry, i t is not at all clear that
there is a shortage of skilled u. s. workers to meet this demand
or that the domestic labor market won't be able -- as it has
over the last decade -- to satisfy projected job growth in the
next decade.

     u.s. employment has been growing rapidly, labor markets
are increasingly tight, and they are likely to remain so.
This is true for the national labor market as a whole -- given
our sustained economic expansion and low national unemployment
rate -- and IT labor markets appear to be particularly affected.


     Employment of computer systems analysts, engineers, and
scientists has been growing by 10 percent a year -- well above
the growth of comparable occupations -- and is expected to
continue growing at a comparable rate through 2006. The Bureau
of Labor Statistics projects that the u.s. will require more
than 1.3 million new workers in IT core occupations between
1996 and 2006 to fill job openings projected to occur due to
growth and the need to replace workers who leave the labor force
or transfer to other occupations.

     The underlying dynamics of the IT labor market and asserted
labor shortages are very controversial.     Industry advocates
say that more than three hundred thousand jobs cannot be filled
and that these vacancies are raising business costs and hurting
u.s. competitiveness. On the other hand, critics say the IT
industry:

     ·   drastically overstates any problem by producing
         inflated job vacancy data and equating it to skills
         shortages;
                                             Automated Records Management System
                                             .       Hex-Dump Conversion
     ·   continues to layoff tens of thousands of workers - -e _g _ ,
         Intel, Netscape, Cypress Semiconductor and Silicon
         Graphics recently announced large lay-offs; and

     ·   fails to tap reservoirs of available talent by insisting
         on unnecessarily specific job requirements and not
         providing more training to develop workers' skills_

     The Subcommittee should also take into consideration other
factors that bear on the question of the scope and duration
of any labor shortage in the IT industry:

     ·   The current "millennium problem" is certainly occupying
         thousands of IT workers for the short-term;

     ·   new technologies are being introduced that are making
         possible more efficient ways to produce software, store
         and retrieve data, speed up computations and in other
         ways improve the productivity of the IT work force;

     ·   the number of computer science degrees conferred
         (bachelors, masters and doctorates) has been rising
         since 1992; and

     ·   Most -- nearly three quarters -- of IT workers actually
         got their education and training in other disciplines.

     A point of contention is the equation of job vacancies
and actual skills shortages _ An industry association sponsored
survey indicates that there may be as many as 350,000 job
vacancies in the IT industry.  However, aside from the concerns
about the usefulness of this survey that you will hear from'
the GAO, this does not necessarily signal that there is an acute
shortage of skilled workers_ Most industries and firms have
job openings at any point in time reflecting worker turnover
and employment growth_

     Wages growing substantially faster than average can be
a reliable indicator of skill shortages, but the wage growth
record for the IT industry is mixed.  BLS wage trends for broad
computer-related categories show average wage growth between
1988 and 1997 for all categories, with above-average growth
in wages only in 1996 and 1997 in the lower-skill
computer-related categories, particularly programmers. At the
same time, a variety of industry wage surveys show larger wage
increases in 1996 and 1997 in more specialized, high-skill
occupations.

     Considering all of these indicators, we believe that there
                     4                            Hex-Dump Conversion

is simply no conclusive evidence of a shortage of skilled u.s.
workers to meet the labor demands of the IT industry. The need
for further analysis of this question is underscored by the
recent conclusions of the Commerce Department and General
Accounting Office (GAO) that much more needs to be known about
the demand and supply of IT workers. These conclusions were
reached by the Commerce Department in its September 1997 report,
and the GAO subsequent evaluation of that report. Both Commerce
and GAO findings were inconclusive on the issue of an IT U.S.
worker shortage and found that more information and data are
needed to understand and properly characterize the IT labor
market.

          Consequences of Raising the H-IB Visa CAP

      In light of the highly ambiguous information about the
state of the IT labor market, we strongly urge that any decision
to raise the H-1B visa cap must carefully consider the probable
adverse impact of such a move on the normal process by which
the labor markets adjust to a growing demand for workers.    The
proper first response to tight labor markets should be, in the
Administration's view, to let the market react rather than
introducing artificial factors, such as increasing access to
foreign temporary workers, that will delay, if not prevent,
the normal labor market adjustments.

     It is very important to remember that tight labor markets
are good for u.S. workers.    A tight labor market causes
employers to raise wages, improve working conditions, and
provide increased training to enable currently employed workers
to keep pace with technology and induce more workers to enter
the labor market.   The increased demand for trained workers
induces educational and job training institutions to teach new
skills. With more opportunities for training, workers acquire
skills needed to obtain better, higher-paying and more secure
jobs, thereby creating open jobs and career ladders for those
just entering or reentering the.labor market -- young people,
welfare recipients, displaced workers, and other disadvantaged
groups.   Indeed, the IT labor market has begun to respond to
these signals of increased demand. A survey of U.S. Ph.D.
departments of computer science and computer engineering showed
bachelor-level enrollments were up 46% in 1996, and another
39% in 1997 -- nearly doubling over the two year period.
Moreover, the high technology jobs at the center of this debate
are precisely the types of skilled employment Americans have
been led to expect will become available to them as a result
of globalization.

     Therefore, tight labor markets create incentives for
employers and workers to react in ways needed to achieve many
                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion

of the Nation's top priorities: moving welfare recipients,
out-of-school youth, and dislocated workers into jobs;
providing greater opportunities for lifelong learning; and
raising wages and reducing income inequality_

     However, labor markets can sometimes be slow to respond
to skills shortages. In these circumstances, it is often argued
that foreign temporary workers are needed in the short-term
to provide necessary skills while the labor market adjusts and
provides U.S. workers with the requisite
training.   Without needed foreign temporary workers, some argue
that the IT industry may adjust to skills 'shortages in ways
that do not serve the short-term or long-term priorities of
the country, either by reducing job creation or by moving jobs
overseas.   Further, the IT sector is so critical to our
competitive edge in an array of industries and services that
disproportionate harm could come to the U.S. economy if, in
fact, skill shortages do become problematic.

     Even in such circumstances the expanded use of foreign
temporary workers may well interfere with labor market
adjustments and may make achieving our other priorities more
difficult.  The presence of more foreign workers may reduce
the incentive for U.S. workers to acquire new skills, and fewer
employers and institutions may be induced to increase training
and education.   Such impacts could only be exacerbated by
increasing the current H-IB visa cap, without needed reforms.

     We must also be cognizant that raising the H-IB cap will
almost certainly increase both legal and illegal immigration.
 We know that nearly half of the workers who obtain permanent
residency in the u.s. as employment-based immigrants convert
from H-visa nonimmigrant status. And according to Immigration
and Naturalization Service statistics, nearly one-half of all
illegal aliens resident in the U.S. are visa over-stayers.
With the attachments they will form in the U.S. during their
nonimmigrant stay of 6 years (or more), one can expect many
of the additional H-IB entrants will eventually join the ranks
of visa over-stayers.
                      6                            Hex-Dump Conversion

     Mr. Chairman, we have heard a lot from advocates of raising
the H-1B visa cap that this would be good for the IT industry,
enhancing its growth, productivity and international
competitiveness and, in turn, U.S. economic growth and
prosperity.   We must pay close attention to these concerns.
But the public has heard little so far about the adverse impact
of raising the cap, such as the effect on workers who have lost
or are seeking jobs in the IT industry.     The Department,
however, has heard from many concerned individuals and groups
on this issue.   If I may, I would like to request that copies
of scores of letters we have received from opponents of raising
the cap be included in the record of today's hearing.

     The Administration believes it is essential to meet the
workforce needs of the IT industry first through the education
and training of U.S. workers.   Our first response should be
to provide the needed skills to U.S. workers to qualify them
for IT jobs to secure the growth and strengthen the global
leadership of this important industry.

     The Administration already has taken significant steps
to increase our capacity to enhance workforce skills.       The
President continues to pursue comprehensive reform of the
Nation's employment .and training system by working with Congress
to enact the principles embodied in his GI Bill proposal.
Moreover, in the historic balanced budget agreement of last
summer, the President insisted on and achieved the largest
increase in 30 years in the Federal investment to expand the
skills of American workers, including:

     ·   the largest Pell Grant increase in two decades;

     ·   Hope Scholarships to make the first two years of
         postsecondary education universally available;

     ·   the Lifelong Learning Tax Credit for the last 2 years
         of college and continuing adult education and training
         to upgrade worker skills;

     ·   a maj or increase in employment and training resources,
         including increases for dislocated workers and
         disadvantaged adults and youth; and

     ·   a $3 billion program to help long-term welfare
         recipients secure lasting, unsubsidized employment.
                                                     Hex·DiJmp Conversion ·

     Further, the Administration announced several new
initiatives at the recent Berkeley Convocation to help address
the growing demand for IT workers:

     ·   A Labor Department Technology Demonstration project
         to test innovative ways of establishing partnerships
         between local workforce development systems,
         employers, training providers and others to train
         dislocated workers in needed high tech skills;

     ·   The expansion and integration of America's Job Bank
         and America's Talent Bank to allow employers and workers
         to list and access job openings and worker resumes in
         one integrated system;

     ·   The convening of four town hall meetings by the Commerce
         Department to discuss IT workforce needs, identify
         innovative practices, and showcase successful models;
         and

     ·   A joint Education and Labor grant program to expand
         employer involvement in high technology school-to-work
         programs.

     Last week President Clinton and Secretary Herman announced
that grants totaling $1.6 million are being provided to proj ects
in four States to continue for another year highly successful
programs to train dislocated workers for high paying jobs in
information technology.

     We believe that there is more that can be done to move
u.S. workers into high technology jobs, and we welcome the
discussions that may be sparked by this hearing. We are
committed to pursuing a continued dialogue with the major
stakeholders in the IT workforce issue -- government, industry,
workers, and education and training institutions -- to better
define the workforce needs of the IT industry and develop
appropriate solutions to meet these needs domestically through
commitments from each of the stakeholders. Such a dialogue
is critical because increased immigration, if needed at all,
can be only a small part of the solution to the workforce needs
of the IT industry.

     In sum, Mr. Chairman, our assessment of the likely effects
of raising the H-1B cap reconfirms our strong conviction that
our primary public policy response to skills mismatches due
to changing technologies and economic restructuring, including
in the IT industry, must be to prepare the U.S. workforce to
meet new demands.   Importing needed skills should, at most,
                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion

be a short-term response to meet urgent needs while we actively
adjust to quickly changing circumstances.     Increased
immigration should be the last -- not the first -- public policy
response to skills shortages.

     Given this broader context, let me now turn to the third
of the issues I listed -- the pressing need for reform of the
H-1B nonimmigrant program.

            H-1B Nonimmigrant Program Must be Reformed

       The current H-1B program is broken and desperately in need
  of reform. As presently designed, it is simply not serving
  its intended purpose.   The role of immigration programs, like
  the H-1B program, in meeting temporary skills shortages is to
  allow employers to have access to temporary foreign workers
  with the requisite skills while the domestic labor market makes
  appropriate adjustments -- not to interfere with or to frustrate
  such adjustments.   The H-1B program does not focus available
  visas on temporary skills shortages. Nor does the program
  adequately protect the job opportuni ties and wages and working
. conditions of u.s. workers.

     The fundamental structural flaws in the current H-1B
program are well documented in a May 1996 audit report by the
Department's Inspector General (IG).  The IG's major findings
illustrate the problems with the H-IB program and I would ask
the Subcommittee to accept the IG's full audit report in the
record of today's hearing.

      The IG found that, despite the legislative intent:

      "          the [H-1B] program does not always meet urgent,
          short-term demand for highly-skilled, unique
          individuals who are not available in the domestic work
          force.   Instead, it serves as a probationary try-out
          employment program for illegal aliens, foreign
          students, and foreign visitors to determine if they
          will be sponsored for permanent status."

           The IG also found that "75 percent of the [H-1B
employees] .      worked for employers who did not adequately
document that the wage specified on the LCA [employer's
application] was the proper wage, and 19 percent of the aliens
were paid below the wage specified on the LCA." The IG also
found that "some [H-1B] employers use alien labor to reduce
payroll costs either by paying less than prevailing wage to
their own alien employees or treating these aliens as
independent contractors, thereby avoiding related payroll and
administrative costs."   It found, in addition, that "other
                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion
[H-1B] employers are 'job shops' whose business is to provide
H-1B alien contract labor to other employers." The IG concluded
that the H-1B program does little to protect the·jobs or wage
levels of U.S. workers and it recommended eliminating the
current program and establishing a new program to fulfill
Congress' intent.

     Mr. Chairman, any. consideration of even temporary
increases in the H-1B visa cap as part of the answer for the
tight labor market faced by the IT industry must include
much-needed reforms of the program.      In this regard, certain
conditions would have to be met for the Administration to support
any such step.    More specifically, besides requiring
substantial additional efforts by the IT industry to increase
the pool of skilled U.S. workers, needed improvements in the
H-1B visa program are a prerequisite for Administration support
for any modest, short-term increase in the number of H-1B visas.

     The H-1B program allows the admission of up to 65,000
workers each year (to stay for as long as six years), to meet
short-term, high-skills employment needs in the domestic labor
market.  In principle, this can be an appropriate purpose,
consistent .with our overall goal of giving priority to improving
the skills of U.S. workers.

      In practice, however, employers do not have to demonstrate
any type of employment need or any effort at domestic recruitment
prior to getting a foreign temporary worker.      In addition,
employers are entirely free to lay-off U.S. workers to replace
them with foreign temporary workers. Employers obtain H-1B
foreign workers by filing ~ labor condition application with
the Department affirming that they have complied with four
requirements:

     -that a wage (not less than the local prevailing rate)
     will be paid to the foreign workers;

     -that no strike or lockout exists involving the occupation;

     -that notification has been provided to U.S. workers or
     their union; and

     -that the employment of H-1B nonimmigrants will not
     adversely affect the working conditions of U.S. workers
     similarly employed.
                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion '
     By law, the Labor Department can do no more than review
these attestations for completeness and obvious inaccuracies
-- to determine whether an employer checked all of the boxes,
made no flagrant errors, and signed the attestation -- and
must do so within 7 days of receipt.

     As theIG found, the H-1B program often operates as a
"probationary" employment program where employers bring workers.
to the u.s. (or convert them from student status) and, if they
perform well, later sponsor them for permanent admission.    In
these circumstances, u.s. workers are never afforded the
opportunity to compete for the job.

     Many employers, to be sure, use the H-1B nonimmigrant
program for its intended purpose: to provide u.s. businesses
with timely access to the "best and the brightest" in the
international labor market to meet urgent but generally
temporary business needs.     I want to emphasize that the
Administration recognizes the need for this legitimate use of
the program.   But reform of the H-1B program is needed because
it simply does not provide the appropriate balance between
timely access to the international labor market and adequate
protection of U. S. workers' job opportunities, wages and working
conditions.

      Greater protections for u.s. workers are needed because
many employers use the H-1B program to employ not the "best
and the brightest", but rather entry- and journey-level foreign
workers.   Minimum education and work experience qualifications
for H-1B jobs are a 4 -year college degree and no work experience,
or the equivalent in terms of combined education and work
experience.   While some H-1B jobs are very high-paying jobs,
nearly 80 percent of H-1B jobs pay less than $50,000 a year
-- a good salary, but certainly at the low-end of the pay scale
for IT occupations even at the entry-level.

     The existing H-1Bprogram is broken in several respects.
 First, current law does not require any test for the
availability of qualified u.s. workers in the domestic labor
market.   Therefore, many of the visas under the current cap
of 65,000 can be -- and are - - used by employers to hire foreign
workers for purposes other than meeting a skills shortage_

     Second, current law allows aU. S. employer to layoff U _S.
workers and replace them with H-1B workers.    Third, current
law allows employers to retain H-1B workers for up ~o 6 years
to fill a presumably "temporary" need. We simply do not believe
this is right.

     The Administration asked the Congress in 1993 to amend
                      11                              Hex·D~mp Conversion


the H-1B nonimmigrant program to address these fundamental
structural problems. Unfortunately for many U.s. businesses
and workers, these amendments have not been enacted.    The
amendments requested in 1993 were carefully designed to ensure
continued business access to needed high-skills workers in the
international labor market while decreasing the H-1B program's
susceptibility to misuse to the detriment of U.s. workers and
the businesses which employ them.   Briefly stated, the
amendments would require employers which seek access to
temporary foreign "professional" workers to attest that:

     ·   they have taken timely and significant steps to recruit
         and retain U.S. workers in these occupations; and

     ·   they have not laid off or otherwise displaced U.s.
         workers in the occupations for which they seek
         nonimmigrant workers in the periods immediately
         preceding and following their seeking such workers.

      In addition, the Administration urged enactment of another
amendment to reduce the allowable period of stay under the H-1B
program from six to three years to better reflect the "temporary"
nature of the presumed employment need.

     Enactment of these amendments will help employers actually
facing skills shortages, including those in the IT industry,
obtain needed workers through the H-1B program.   Under existing
law, employers facing skills shortages are disadvantaged
because they must compete for available visas (up to the cap
of 65,000) on a first-come, first-served basis with other
employers that do not face such shortages.      Enactment of the
proposed amendments would reduce pressure on the visa cap by
screening out employers that are not faced with skills shortages
but have no interest in recruiting U.s. workers.

     If U.S. employers are to be delegated greater rights to
 decide when to import foreign workers to fill jobs in the U. S. ,
then the people have the right to decide under what conditions
such authority should be conveyed.   It simply makes sense that
these conditions include trying first to fill the employment
need from eithin the U.s. labor market, and assuring that U.s.
workers are not removed in order for their jobs to be filled
by foreign temporary workers.   Neither of these simple, common
sense requirements exists in current law.

These Reforms Will NOT Cause Delays

     Some employers contend that adding these requirements will
substantially slow down the admission process for foreign
                                                      Hex-Dump Conve;sion
    temporary workers and add many bureaucratic requirements to
    approval of their application for H-1B nonimmigrant workers_
     This contention is simply untrue_

          The Administration's proposed reforms would add two more
    boxes to be checked on the employer's one-page application.
    The Labor Department would still be subject to the existing
    requirements of law that the application be processed within
    seven days and only rejected where incomplete or where there
    are "obvious inaccuracies." There would be no new
    pre-adjudication process that could cause delays in processing
    and approval. The employer would simply attest that it had
    tested the u.s. labor market in attempting to fill the job(s)
    and that, during certain times, it had not or would not lay
    off u.s. workers in the same job.

         Employers in the IT sector repeatedly assert that they
    search exhaustively in the U. S. labor market to fill open jobs
    and that the tight IT labor market does not allow layoff or
    displacement of U. S. workers. Accordingly, attesting to these
    two common sense reforms would impose no additional burden on
    employers in the IT industry.

    These Reforms Will NOT Cause Excessive Government Oversight
    of Employers' Hiring and Termination Decisions

          Some employers contend that these reforms would -- after
    the application is approved and the nonimmigrants admitted --
    subject the employer's hiring and termination decisions to
    "second guessing" by the government. Such decisions are
    already subject to review in the context of enforcement of
    employment discrimination laws, including the
    anti-discrimination provisions of the immigration law.
    Employers' authority to import foreign workers is conditional.
     There are few impediments to the exercise of this authority
    by employers before the approval of the nonimmigrant admission.
     Employers' hiring and termination decision-making must be
    subj ect to scrutiny after-the-fact.  This scrutiny helps ensure
    that the employers are not discriminating against u.S. workers
    in favor of hiring foreign temporary workers.
'.                         13
                                                           Hex-Dump Conve:sion

           This is a straight-forward law enforcement issue.
     Employers that are delegated authority to decide to import
     foreign workers need to be accountable for abiding by the
     conditions attached; specifically, to give U.S. workers a
     legitimate first chance at the jobs for which foreign temporary
     workers are being sought.

           If the Administration's reforms are not implemented and
     the two new attestation elements are not added to the H-1B
     program, then the Labor Department will not be able to assure
     that the intended purposes of the program are actually served,
     regardless of any new enforcement authority granted by Congress.
      The H-1B program exists to assure that U. S. employers can access
     the international labor market when they cannot find U.S.
     workers.   Under current law, as the Inspector General has
     pointed out, the government is effectively powerless to assure
     that employers use the H-1B program for its intended purpose,
     and that purpose only.


                                Conclusion

          Mr. Chairman, let me conclude by restating that the growing
     workforce needs of the IT industry can only be met -- and the
     strength and growth of the industry secured in the long run
     -- if we take the steps needed to fully develop and utilize
     the skills of U.S. workers.    Increased immigration acts at
     cross-purposes with this goal, and therefore can at best only
     be a very small part of the solution and must be viewed as a
     minor complement to the development of the U.S. workforce.
     Further, let me repeat that reform of the H-1B program is
     integral and essential to eliminating abuses under the program
     and providing appropriate protections for U.S. workers.
     Enactment of these reforms would effectively allocate a greater
     share of H-1B visas to employers facing actual skills shortages.

          I appreciate the interest shown by the Subcommittee and
     staff in our views, and your thoughtful consideration of them.
      The Department looks forward to continuing to work closely
     and cooperatively with you and your staff on these issues.

          Mr. Chairman, that concludes my prepared statement.                I
     would be happy to respond to any questions.
