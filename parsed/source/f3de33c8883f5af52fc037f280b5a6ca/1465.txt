       This is the final request we turned in for the President to call into .the
       FOP meeting this weekend. There's a chance the call will be made today.
       If not, we will have to do another request for him to call Gil Gallegos
       next week -- and it will have to include briefing material on collective
       bargaining. Hopefully the call will be made today. Also, you should know
       that the issue of collective bargaining came up at their meeting and they
       are really furious that there hasn't been a resolution. We will need to
       deal with this next week. Thanks.
