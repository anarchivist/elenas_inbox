     TEXT:
     EK/Chris:

     After my earlier e-mail to you on the mar1Juana resolution, I received the
     attached e-mail from OMB looking for our input to help get an
     Administration letter out.  In brief:

     ONDCP doesn't want the resolution to be taken up w/out comment from the
     Administration;

     HHS wants the resolution to make clear that we're open to medical
     marijuana; and

     I agree with ONDCP that we should send up a letter, but feel it should
     "tweek" the Rs by saying we appreciate and support the resolution, but
     more importantly -- prefer that Congress pass our drug strategy/budget.
     Also, I certainly don't think we need to add any language to our letter
     to make it more favorable to medical marijuana.  The current draft already.
     says we're studying the matter.

     As for tobacco, I leave that decision to you, EK, and Bruce.  I've got
     mixed feelings about injecting it into this debate, though it's worth
     thinking about.  Let me know what you think, and I'll speak w/OMBabout it.

     Jose'

     Subject:         Checking for comments on ONDCP Letter on HRes 372, opposition to
     Legalizing Marijuana for Medicinal Use -- due at 10:00 AM this morning



I need an affirmative response from DPC before I can clear the ONDCP draft
letter on HRes 372 (circulated yesterday, Monday, March 9th as LRM
REJ388). At one point the Resolution was scheduled for floor action
tomorrow, subject to a rule. However, the Rules Committee has not yet
scheduled a hearing on the Resolution, although it could be added to
today's meeting on short notice.

FYI -- HHS has conditioned its clearance of a letter on ONDCP expressing
support for the general intent of the Resolution but not endorsing HRes
372.   HHS believes the Resolution strongly suggests that legalization of
marijuana, even for medical use, is permanently insupportable. They agree
that opposing legalization is appropriate at this time but want to keep
options open if future research presents evidence that legalization is
warranted.

 If you need another copy of the Resolution and the ONDCP letter, please
 let me know.

Thanks,
Ron Jones
