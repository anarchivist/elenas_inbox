TEXT:
Bruce you raised yesterday the issue of what we would say about tobacco if
we fail to remove Hutchison provision from the final bill.  It seems to me
that the President could either:     .

1) voice his continued opposition to this provision and pledge to keep
working for federal legislation that ensures every state funds a program
to prevent youth smoking; or

2) focus attention on the states, urging them to use their new flexibility
to ensure a new generation does not take up smoking, perhaps vowing to
seek legislation in the future if states fail to act.

We may also want to take the opportunity to have him urge Congress to
appropriate $20 million for a federal tobacco lawsuit. DOJ wants to come
talk to us about developing a plan to make this happen.
