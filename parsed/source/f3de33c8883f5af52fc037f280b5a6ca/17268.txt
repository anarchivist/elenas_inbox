TEXT:
The Department of Justice is requesting clearance of a letter identical to
a previously cleared DOJ letter to Labor-HHS-Education appropriations
conferees objecting to the prohibition on the use of federal funds to
supervise the Teamsters election rerun.   DOJ would like to send the same
letter to the Commerce-Justice-State appropriations conferees to protest
an identical provision in that bill.

Please advise no later than noon tomorrow (Wednesday) if there are any
objections to clearing this letter.

If you have any questions or would like a copy of the
Commerce-Justice-State letter, please call me at 5-7887.
