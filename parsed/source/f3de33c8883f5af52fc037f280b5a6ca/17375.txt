TEXT:

A heads-up:
The INS will announce on Monday the release of guidelines that for the first
time requires sponsors of certain immigrants to meet minimum income requirements
and for them to be financially responsible for immigrants that they sponsor.   An
immigrant's sponsor will be required to demonstrate an income level of at least
125% of the poverty level. The mechanism for establishing this will be a new
legally-binding affidavit of support that will be effective December 19, 1997.
This new requirement is mandated by the 1996 Immigration bill.
As background you should know that the Administration supported making the
sponsorship requirement legallly binding. Also, we worked during the
negotiations of the legislation to reduce the income level required for
sponsorship to 125% from much higher levels that would have created significant
barriers to legal immigration for family reunification.   (Even now, I believe
that INS has internal statistics showing the 125% threshold will have a sizable
and disproportionate impact on the ability of u.S. citizen families from Mexico
to sponsor their relatives for legal immigration.)
The usual preparations for roll-out are proceeding with briefings scheduled,
press conference and statement, etc.
