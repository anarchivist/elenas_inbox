TEXT:
As you know, Chuck Ruff is having a meeting tomorrow at 1:15pm with Josh
Gotbaum and Sally Katzen to discuss the issue of whether OFCCP's request
falls under the Paperwork Reduction Act, requiring the burden on employers
to be considered.  Sally and Josh both think that it falls under the
Paperwork Reduction Act. Chuck has told Tom that his instinct is that the
Act applies.  In case you are unable to attend the meeting, I or Tom were
going to say the DPC position is that it falls under the Act and that
burden needs to be considered. Let me know if you have a problem with
that. Thanks, Mary
