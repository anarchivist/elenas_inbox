JOINT COMMITTEE MAY BE FORMED TO REVIEW RULES, DO OVERSIGHT, AIDE SAYS
A new House-Senate committee may be in the works for the next session of
Congress to review rules emanating from federal agencies and to ensure that
several executive orders pertaining to the process of issuing rules are
followed, a House Republican aide told BNA June 14.
In the meantime, the House Government Reform and Oversight Subcommittee
on National Economic Growth, Natural Resources, and Regulatory Affairs will
assume those responsibilities, the counsel to the subcommittee said.
Specifically, the subcommittee wants to ensure that federal agencies are
complying with provisions in the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement
Fairness Act (P.L. 104-121). The act requires, am;ng other things, that before
agencies issue a major rule, they submit a report to the Government Accounting
Office and both houses of Congress containing an explanation of the rule, a
"complete cost-benefit analysis, " actions taken relevant to the Unfunded
Mandates Act of 1995, and any information relative to any other act or


executive order. Congress then has 60 session days to review major rules,
which could take effect after 60 calendar days.
House and Senate staff had been meeting informally to set up a bicameral
task force to coordinate the review of the rules and direct them to the
committees of proper jurisdiction. However, the effort to create that task
force bogged down with the resignation of Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole
(R-Kan) and the subsequent shift in Senate leadership to Sen. Trent Lott
 (R-Miss) .
Rules Change Required
Setting up a new committee would require a change in rules, which the
aide said the subcommittee would try to effect on the first day of the 105th
Congress.
The GOP aide said the subcommittee, chaired by Rep. David McIntosh
(R-Ind), especially is interested in ensuring compliance with President
Clinton's Executive Order 12866 calling for cost-benefit analysis and risk
assessment as well as several orders from the Reagan and Bush administrations
on private property rights and takings and on civil justice reform.
"Until Clinton repeals the Reagan-Bush executive orders, they are still
in effect, " the aide said.
The executive order on private property rights requires agencies to review
the effect of their rules on property rights and to assess whether a taking,
as defined under the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, has occurred.
The order directs agencies to draft rules in such a way as to avoid the taking
of private property, the aide said.
"When Clinton says we don't need property rights legislation because of
the executive orders, we want to see if they're being followed, " he said.
"We don't think they are. ' ,
The House passed a comprehensive regulatory reform bill (HR 9) in 1995
that failed to garner enough support in the Senate. Among the provisions was a
section on property rights that would make landowners eligible for
compensation if any portion of their property value is diminished by at least
20 percent because of regulations such as those governing wetlands protections
and endangered species. The Clinton administration opposed the bill, saying it
would be too costly, among other things.
The property rights requirements in the executive order are not as strong
as what was contained in HR 9, the aide said. "However, if we can show that
they're not doing anything, then we have an argument for the need for
legislation, " he said.
The aide predicted that no more legislation aimed at reforming
regulations would move during this session. However, he said, House
Republicans will try to push through a bill next session calling for agency
review of regulations that would be tougher than one (HR 994) that was
abruptly pulled from the House floor in early March.
