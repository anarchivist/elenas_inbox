TEXT:
The states and counties do well in the current Senate tobacco bill. NGA
and individual Governors will be writing letters of support, and of
course, the Attorneys General are very engaged in the Hill effort.

I think we should more to engage them.  I believe we should consider
inviting the NGA Exec Committee to the White House for a meeting on the
bill with the President and Vice President. We might include additional
elected leadership such as the Attorneys General and the national
leadership of the Counties (NACO).



 At a mlnlmum we should arrange briefings for them with senior
Administration officials so they fully appreciate the magnitude of their
"win" in this bill.
