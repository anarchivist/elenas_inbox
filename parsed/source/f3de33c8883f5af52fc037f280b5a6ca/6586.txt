TEXT:
USDA is sending draft langauge on reauthorizing the child nutrition act to
OMB today for clearance for next week. We've included a highights summary
and bill, the bill is modest and cost neutral. as you can see from the
highlights page, it also has some money for food and child care.   There is
another interesting 'change that is not quite newsworthy: making the
Homeless Child Nutrition program a government guarantee.   That means that
every homeless shelter that has a child under 12 can automatically get fund
s to pay for three meals a day for the homeless child.   But OMB estimates
that is less than $7 million over 5 years c- partly because they think
shelters won't be aware of the program. We asked them to go. back and see
how much it would cost if shelters did become aware of the program.
