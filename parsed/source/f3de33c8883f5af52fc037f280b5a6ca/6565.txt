                                  Key Concerns about S. 1415


Every day 3,000 kids start smoking and 1,000 of them will die from smoking related illnesses.
If we act now, we can prevent the premature deaths of almost 1 million children over the next
five years. The Administration applauds the Commerce Committee's efforts to forge a
bipartisan consensus to enact comprehensive tobacco legislation this year. To ensure that this
effort meets our goals of dramatically reducing teen smoking, S. 1415 should be amended as
follows:

Reaffirm FDA's Full Authority to Regulate Tobacco Products. The Administration supports
federal legislation that affirms efforts by the Food & Drug Administration (FDA) to regulate
tobacco like any other drug or device and that provides FDA with sufficient flexibility to meet
changing circumstances. Doing so will ensure that the tough advertising restrictions in the FDA
rule -- which limit most tobacco advertising to black and white text and ban tobacco ads near
schools, playgrounds, and parks -- will be implemented. S.l415 instead [NEED TO FILL INJ.


Include the Price Increases Needed to Reduce Youth Smoking. In September, the President
called for a combination of industry payments and penalties to increase the price of cigarettes by
up to $1.50 a pack over the next decade as necessary to meet youth smoking reduction targets.
Research shows that increasing the price of cigarettes is one of the best ways to reduce youth
smoking. S. 1415 would raise the price by only about $.62 cents per pack when fully phased in.

Strengthen Penalties Tied to Youth Smoking. The Administration believes legislation should
set ambitious targets to cut teen smoking by 30% in 5 years, 50% in 7 years, and 60% in 10
years, and impose severe financial penalties that hold tobacco companies accountable to meet
those targets. While S. 1415 sets the same ambitious targets as the President, this bill does not
include penalties -- on both the industry and specific companies -- that give the tobacco industry
the strongest possible incentive to st()p targeting kids. [CHECK THIS)

Guarantee Broad Document Disclosure. The Administration wants to ensure that any tobacco
legislation provides for broad document disclosure -- especially of those documents relating to
marketing tobacco to children -- and we would like to work with the Congress to revise these
provisions.

Ensure Minors Can't Buy Tobacco Products. Current law forbids retailers from selling
tobacco products to young people under age 18, and a strong licensing system is needed to ensure
compliance throughout the nation. The Administration would like to work with members of
Congress to include licensing provisions in the final legislation.

Strengthen International Efforts to Control Tobacco. The Administration strongly believes
that one of the elements of any comprehensive bipartisan tobacco legislation must be the
strengthening of international efforts to control tobacco. For example, the Administration
supports efforts to address the health risks associated with tobacco use at an international level by
funding multilateral and bilateral efforts. The Administration looks forward to working with
members of Congress of both parties in crafting comprehensive tobacco legislation that contains
international tobacco-control provisions.
