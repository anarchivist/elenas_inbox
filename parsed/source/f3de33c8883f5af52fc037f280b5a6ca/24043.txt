The Honorable Trent Lott
Majority Leader
United States Senate
Washington, D.C. 20510

Dear Mr. Leader:

       The purpose of this letter is to provide the Administration's views on S.557. As the
Senate acts on this legislation, your consideration of the Administration's views would be
appreciated.

        In the President's State of the Union, the President presented a budget proposal based on
core principles. He called for dedicating the new surplus to a lockbox that would lower the
nation's debt and extend the solvency of both Social Security and Medicare.      The major
elements of the fiscal program are: protecting the solvency of Social Security; saving and
improving Medicare; reducing our debt; investing in the future through investing in education,
research and development, the environment and national security; and providing targeted tax
relief.

        The Administration strongly opposes the budget process legislation announced by
Senators Abraham and Domenici and the Republican Leadership on March 10, which we
understand will be offered on the Senate Floor as a substitute amendment to S. 557. This
legislation fails to protect SoCial Security and would in reality put payment of Social Security
benefits at risk. For the reasons detailed below and in the attached letter from Secretary of the
Treasury Rubin, if the AbrahamlDomenici amendment or similar legislation is passed by the
Congress, the President's Senior Advisors will recommend to the President that he veto the bill.

        The AbrahamIDomenici amendment would establish declining statutory limits on debt
held by the public. As explained by Secretary Rubin in the attached letter, these arbitrary
limitations on the Treasury's ability to borrow funds could trigger periodic debt crises, placing at
risk the Federal government's ability to honor its financial obligations -- including payment of
Social Security benefits. The Secretary concludes that this mechanism would create
"uncertainty about the Federal government's ability to honor its future obligations .... potentially
threatening the ability to make Social Security payments to millions of Americans." These
concerns would exist even if the legislation is amended to include recession waivers, because any
unanticipated slowdown in the economy would cause a breach of these arbitrary limitations on
debt.

        Furthermore, the AbrahamIDomenici amendment would not extend the solvency of the
Social Security Trust Funds by a single day. The legislation is flawed because it fails to extend
the solvency of the Trust Funds, fails to ensure that the surplus is used to protect the payment of
benefits to Social Security beneficiaries, and contains an escape clause designed to allow the
Security beneficiaries nor reduce the debt.
        By contrast, the President has proposed a budget plan that substantially extends the life of
the Social Security Trust Funds and dedicates a large portion of projected surpluses for the
payment of Social Security benefits. The President's budget framework would reserve 62
percent of unified budget surpluses over the next 15 years to extend the solvency of the Social
Security Trust Funds. These surpluses would be fully dedicated to the Social Security Trust
Funds and would not be available for tax cuts or other spending programs. The independent
Social Security Administration actuaries have estimated that reserving 62 percent of unified
budget surpluses for Social Security would extend the life of the Trust Funds until 2059.

       Moreover, the Administration supports extension of the Budget Enforcement Act
pay-as-you-go requirements and discretionary spending caps, as additional insurance that the
dedicated surplus funds will not be used for purposes other than Social Security solvency. The
pay-as-you-go requirements and budget caps have been effective for the last ten years, and should
be extended without change until the Congress and the President have secured the long-term
solvency of Social Security.

        In addition to securing the future of the Social Security program, the President's budget
framework would lock away an additional 15 percent of total budget surpluses to extend the life
of the Medicare Trust Fund by at least a decade. As with the SoCial Security surpluses, these
funds would be dedicated to Medicare by investing the funds in Treasury securities and making
them unavailable for any other purpose. The Republican proposal, by contrast, does nothing to
guarantee extension of the Medicare Trust Fund and would seriously weaken the budget rules to
permit non-Social Security surpluses to be spent on tax cuts.

         [The Administration also has concerns about H.R. P59, the House-passed approach.
Although it adopts the principle that a substantial portion of the surplus should be dedicated to
debt reduction, it also does nothing to extend social security or Medicare solvency. At the same
time, it would promote an unwise and inflexible fiscal policy. It would create a process to force
spending cuts or tax increases during a period of economic decline, which would deepen and
lengthen an economic downturn.]

        The budget debate should be focused on concrete steps to secure the long-term solvency
of Social Security and to save and strengthen Medicare. Unfortunately, the Senate "lockbox
amendment [and H.R. 1259] would do nothing to move the Nation towards that goal and risks
bad fiscal policies that would threaten the health of our economy. The Administration urges the
Congress to re-focus its efforts on the goal of saving Social Security first and strengthening
Medicare.

                                              Sincerely,



                                              Jacob J. Lew
