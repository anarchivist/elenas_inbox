TEXT:
Bill Corr reported that HHS can have tobacco options to the White House by
"mid-week" next week.  He wasn't willing to commit to a day or time since
they weren't able to get started this week and he will need to engage the
Secretary.  I'm not comfortable with that -- anything else we should do
here?
