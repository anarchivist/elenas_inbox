TEXT:
I want to remind you of two facts about tobacco black markets that you
should pass on to reporters:   1)  RJR was found guilty of creating black
market trade in Canada.  I will circulate a news article that describes
what happened.  2)  There is already almost a $1.00 tax differential on
cigarettes today within the. U.S., due to the wide variation in state
excise taxes on cigarettes. As of January, state taxes ranged from a low
of $0.25 a carton in Virginia to $10.00 a carton in Alaska.
