               PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
              RADIO ADDRESS ON EQUAL PAY
              THE WHITE HOUSE
              January 30, 1999

                      Good morning.  Americans have always believed that people who work
              hard should be able to provide for themselves and their families.  That is
              a fundamental part of AmericaO,s basic bargain. Today, I want to talk to
              you about what we are doing to make sure that bargain works for all of our
              people, by ensuring that women and men earn equal pay for equal work.

                      We are living in a time of remarkable promise. Our economy is the
              strongest in a generation -- with nearly 18 million new jobs, the lowest
              unemployment in 29 years, family incomes rising by $3,500, and the
              greatest real wage growth in over two decades. We have an opportunity
              and an obligation -- to make sure that every American can benefit from
              this moment of prosperity.

                      One of the best ways to meet this challenge is by putting an end
              to wage discrimination.  When President Kennedy signed the Equal Pay Act
              35 years ago, women were joining the workforce in ever-increasing numbers


          -- but their work was undervalued. At the time, for every dollar a man
          brought home in his paycheck, a woman doing the same work earned only 58
          cents.

                  We have made a lot of progress since those days.  Last June, my
          Council of Economic Advisors reported that the gender gap has narrowed
          considerably -- in fact, we have nearly cut it in half.  Today, women earn
          about 75 cents for every dollar a man earns.

                  We should be proud of this progress    but 75 cents on the dollar is only
          three quarters of the way there.  Americans cannot be satisfied until we
          are all the way there.

                  One big reason why the pay gap persists -- despite womenD,S gains
          in education and experience -- is the demeaning practice of wage
          discrimination in our workplaces. Too many employers still undervalue --
          and underpay    work done by women.

                  Make no mistake: When a woman is denied equal pay, it doesn't just
          hurt her -- it hurts her family, and that hurts America.  Between 1995 and
          1996 alone, the number of families with two working parents increased by
          nearly two million. And in over ten million families, the mother is the
          only breadwinner.

                  Just think what a 25 percent wage gap means in real terms.  Over
          the course of a working year, it means hundreds, even thousands of bags of
          groceries ... visits to the doctor ... rent and mortgage payments. Over
          the course of a working life, it can mean hundreds of thousands of dollars
              smaller pensions ... and less to put aside for retirement.

                  To prepare our nation to meet the challenges of the 21st Century, we must
          do more to ensure equal pay, equal opportunity, and equal dignity for
          working women.

                  Today, I am pleased to announce a new $14 million Equal Pay
          Initiative, included in my balanced budget, to help the Department of
          Labor and the Equal Employment Opportunity commission expand opportunities
          in the workplace for women and end wage discrimination once and for all.
          with more resources to identify wage discrimination, to educate employers
          and workers about their rights and responsibilities, and to bring more
          women into better-paying jobs, we will be closer than ever to making equal
          pay a reality for every American.

                  In my State of the Union address, I called on Congress to ensure
          equal pay for equal work -- and it brought members of both parties to
          their feet in an unanimous show of support.   We know that equal pay is
          not a political issue -- it is a matter of principle, a question of what
          kind of country we want American to be today, and in the 21st Century,
          when our daughters grow up and enter the workplace.

                  There has been strong leadership on fair pay from members in both
          houses of Congress, including Senator Harkin and Representative Norton.
          Today, I calIon the Congress to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act, sponsored
          by Senator Daschle and Representative DeLauro -- legislation that
          strengthens enforcement of our equal pay laws, expands opportunity for
          women, and helps working families to thrive.  This should be .one of
          CongressD, first orders of business.

                  If we meet this challenge, if we value the contributions of all
          AmericaD,s workers, then we will be a more productive, prosperous and


     proud nation in the 21st century.

            Thanks for listening.
