Something to think about ...
How about letting Nicole Rabner in the First Lady's office take over women's
issues and relations with Betsy Myer's office? Nicole is good, knows the issues
and is looking for a larger role for herself. And, of course, the First Lady is
committed to women's issues.  It would probably also make Betsy Myers and the
women's groups happy to have more access to the First Lady's office.
We could then pick and choose whichever issues we'd like to get involved in.
I haven't talked to Nicole, but my guess is she'd like the proposal.
What do you think?
