                                          PRESIDENT CLINTON

                                  FIGHTING YOUTH TOBACCO USE



    Because President Clinton understands the danger of tobacco use to the health of our children, he
    has taken strong, bold action on this pressing public health concern.


    A REcORD OF ACHIEVEMENT


    First-Ever Plan to Protect Our Children from Tobacco. On August 10, 1995, President
    Clinton announced broad executive action to protect our nation's young people from the dangers
    of tobacco by sharply restricting the advertising, promotion, distribution, and marketing of
    cigarettes to teenagers. The President authorized the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to
    initiate a broad series of steps all designed to stop sales and marketing of cigarettes and
    smokeless tobacco to children. The President's comprehensive and coordinated plan is intended
    to reduce tobacco use by children and teenagers by 50% in seven years.

    Strong FDA Action. One year later, on August 23, 1996, the President's program was launched
    with the publication of the FDA final rule on tobacco and children. The rule required tobacco
    companies to educate children and teenagers about the dangers of cigarettes and smokeless
    tobacco through a national multi-media campaign.

    Cracking Down on Youth Access to Tobacco. On February 28, 1997, the FDA made 18 the
    minimum age to purchase tobacco products nationwide and required photo LD.s for anyone
    under the age of27.

    Courts Affirm the Clinton Administration's Efforts To Protect Our Children from
    Tobacco. On April 25, 1997, a Federal District Court in North Carolina affirmed the FDA's
    authority to regulate tobacco as a drug and restrict children's access to tobacco products.

    Protecting Federal Employees. On July 31, 1997, President Clinton announced an executive
    order to protect federal employees from environmental tobacco smoke. This executive order
    banned smoking in and around federal Executive Branch facilities.


           "Bill Clinton has shown more guts on this issue of tobacco, children and health
           than any president in the history of the country. "
                  --Joseph Califano, health secretary under President Carter and President of
                  the Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse, August 11, 1995
