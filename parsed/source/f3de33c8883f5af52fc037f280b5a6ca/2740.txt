TEXT:
OMB is trying to draft this letter to Shaw now, and Diana and I want to
give them language to start off in the right direction on those things we
are most involved in. AS YOU KNOW, THE MARKUP IS PROBABLY GOING TO BE
TOMORROW, SO WE'RE TRYING TO GET THE LETTER DRAFTED NOW. Diana is drafting
language on FLSA.  Below is possible language on other welfare issues.
Would you like to revise this before I send to OMB?


We are pleased the bipartisan balanced budget amendment includes the
President's $3 billion welfare to work proposal and that the Ways and
Means subcommittee has included in its mark a version that meets many of
the Administration's priorities:

It provides additional funds for jobs where theyD,re needed most: to help
long term recipients in high unemployment/high poverty areas;
It directs funds to cities and local governments with large numbers of
poor people;
It awards some funds on a competitive basis, assuring the best use for
scarce resources;
It provides communities with appropriate flexibility to use the funds to
create succesful job placement and creation programs.

We do, however, strongly oppose the Committee's decision not to add
stronger language to prevent worker displacement.   In addition, we
encourage the Committee to amend the proposal to provide additional
incentives for success through performance bonuses.   [IS THIS ENOUGH ON
WORKER DISPLACEMENT?]

The Administration is concerned that the Chairman's mark makes several
changes to the TANF program which are outside the scope of the budget
agreement, including changes to the TANF work rules, state penalties, and
fund transferability.
