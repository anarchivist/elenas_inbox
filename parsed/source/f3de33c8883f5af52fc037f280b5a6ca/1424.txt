TEXT:
I met with Eli Segal this morning. We talked about 1) the Internet
project, 2) the DLC conference, 3) his organization's rollout, and 4)
involving the faith community in his efforts with business. Here's what
he had to say.

--He loves the internet   idea.  I gave him a copy of the memo I drafted for
Cynthia and he is going   to try to drum up computer donations immediately.
He's been looking for a   way to involve the high tech industry and thinks
this could be it.  I'll   keep you posted.

--He'd love to be involved in a DLCjWhite House conference on best welfare
to work practices.    However, the National Alliance of Business and the NGA
are talking about holding similar conferences.    I think we should shoot to
bring Eli, the DLC, NGA and NAB together for one best practices
conference . . Further, Eli is still having trouble with Marriot. As a way
of smoothing Marriot over, we could headline Marriot's program. What do
you think?

-Eli says the April 7 date is too early for a rollout and he is also
hesitant about April 16. He feels a rollout on April 16 is pushing it.
He's also reconsidering Milwaukee as the rollout spot and thinks
Washington might be more appropriate fora national rollout followed by
regional events. What do you think?

-Finally, Eli had not thought about involving the Faith community in his
effort, but will give it some thought. We plan om talking again early
next week.
