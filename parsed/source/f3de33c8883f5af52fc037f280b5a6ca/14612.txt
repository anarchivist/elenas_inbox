I have received your letter of January 14, 1997, and as you
requested, accept your resignation as Under Secretary for Food,
Nutrition and Consumer Services at the Department of Agriculture,
effective February 14, 1997.

As you leave the Administration, I want to thank you for your
efforts to improve the quality of health and nutrition in our
nation. During your four-year tenure at the Department of
Agriculture, you have helped to revitalize the Department's
nutrition mission -- to reach millions of children and families.
Your work toward this important goal has ensured a healthier
future for all Americans. As Under Secretary, you have been an
important contributor to this Administration's finest
achievements in preserving and expanding nutrition programs such
as WIC and the School Lunch Program -- all of which are vital
investments in our nation's future.  Thanks again for your
service.

Best wishes for much continued happiness and success.
