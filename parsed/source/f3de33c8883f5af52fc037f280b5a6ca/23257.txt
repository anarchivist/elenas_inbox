                                BEFORE
            THE SUBCOMMITTEE ON WORKFORCE PROTECTIONS
         HOUSE COMMITTEE ON EDUCATION AND THE WORKFORCE

                                         March 23, 1999



     Mr. Chainnan, Members of the Subcommittee, I am pleased to come before you today to

discuss OSHA's efforts to protect workers while fonning partnerships with employees and

employers. When I appeared before the subcommittee last April I described how OSHA is

changing the way it does business. Today I shall discuss some highlights of the past twelve

months as well as my priorities for next year.

     OSHA's core mission is to provide a safe and healthy workplace for every working man and

woman in the Nation. We are encouraged by the latest occupational injury and illness statistics.

For the fifth consecutive year the rate of injuries and illness declined. In fact the rate for 1997

was the lowest since BLS began reporting this infonnation in the early 1970s. The improvement

is particularly impressive in a booming economy when many new and inexperienced workers

have entered the workforce. Historically, new employees have been more likely to get hurt on

the job than more experienced workers. Much of the credit for the improvement can be

attributed to millions of employers and employees working every day to eliminate on-the-job

hazards. I am proud that OSHA and its 25 State plan partners have been a catalyst for these

private sector efforts, using results-driven enforcement efforts, compliance assistance and

commonsense standards to bring about workplace improvements.
                                      Hex-Dump Conversion

     Many challenges remain. Even with the decline in rates there were more than 6 million

workplace injuries and illnesses in our Nation in 1997. Almost 3 million injuries or illnesses

required recuperation away from work or restricted duties on the job. More than 6,000 workers

died from on-the-job injuries in 1997 and many thousands more die each year as result of chronic

diseases related to occupational exposures to toxic substances.



                                      Priorities for FY 2000

      In order to accomplish the goals of OSHA's Strategic Plan I have established four priorities

for the agency for the next fiscal year. They are: (1) Creative partnership; (2) Strong

enforcement; (3) Improved rult:making; (4) Expanded education and outreach.          These

priorities arc" designed to enable OSHA to reach the primary FY 2002 goals of our Strategic Plan,

which are: (1) a 20 percent reduction in injuries and illnesses in 100,000 workplaces; (2) a 15

percent reduction in injuries and illnesses among five high-hazard industries; (3) a 15 percent

reduction in three specific injuries and illnesses--silicosis, amputations and lead poisoning.

    Creative Partnerships.      OSHA will continue to form partnerships with workers,

employers, insurance companies, safety and health professional groups, trade associations and

anyone else interested in improving workplace conditions. Partnerships may be local or

nationwide. I have directed each area office to make a special effort to develop a partnership,

and I will be asking for reports on their progress. I have also met with representatives of the

insurance industry and others to talk about forming nationwide partnerships.

     Earlier this month OSHA partnered with the Small Business Administration to hold a Small

Business Forum here in Washington. The forum showcased information and services available


                                                 2
                                          Hex-Dump Conversion

to help small businesses improve safety and health. OSHA plans to follow-up on this

conference by holding a series of similar conferences throughout the nation during National

Small Business Week in May.

      OSHA joined with industry last November to hold a partnership conference celebrating the

positive impact of strategic partnerships on employee protection and lower workers'

compensation costs for employers.      Secretary of Labor Herman summed up the spirit of the

conference when she said:

       We've spent 6 years changing the way we do business in the Labor Department--
       focusing on results, thinking outside the box, emphasizing cooperation. We've been
       telling you there's a different OSHA in town. This conference gives you a chance to
       observe first hand the new ways we've been working together to get results.

     In one success highlighted during the conference, OSHA worked with the Steel Erectors'

Safety Association of Colorado (SESAC) to enhance education and improve workplace safety.

As a consequence, SESAC members have seen positive results. Calcon Constructors, for

example, reduced its workers' compensation rate by almost two-thirds, saving sixty-three cents

on every dollar in workers' compensation costs as a result of its partnership with OSHA. In

addition, since the time Calcon initiated partnership efforts with OSHA in 1992, the company has

reduced its rate of injuries and illnesses by over eighty percent.

      Another successful partnership is happening in Port Arthur, Texas where the Huntsman

Petrochemical Aromatics and Olefins Plant is a member of OSHA's Voluntary Protection

Programs (VPP), our primary recognition program for employers. Workers at this site have

repeatedly credited VPP participation as one vital factor contributing to improved management

and employee relations. The plant's current three-year injury incidence rate is 74 percent below



                                                  3
                                          Hex-Dump Conversion

the industry average, and its lost workday rate is 99 percent below average.

           OSHA's partnership efforts under VPP continue to increase. We have added 92 sites to

the VPP since last year--an increase of22 percent--for a total of 507 Federal and State VPP sites.




     We also continue to work closely with our 23 State partners with OSHA-approved State

Plans. We have requested funds from the Congress to enable New Jersey to join in that

partnership by funding safety and health coverage for its public employees.

    In addition, we are establishing partnerships with other Federal agencies. Last July, OSHA

signed an agreement with the U.S. Department of Agriculture on grain dust hazards, and more

recently, we entered into an agreement with the National Park Service to provide assistance in

improving safety and health programs for employees at 10 park sites. These sites will then serve

as models for the entire park system.

     Strong enforcement. OSHA's credibility requires balance. Not only is partnership

important, but the agency must pursue employers who ignore the rules and endanger their

employees. While the Cooperative Compliance Program has been stayed pending review by a

federal appeals court, OSHA has implemented an interim plan, targeting the most dangerous

workplaces, which is proving very effective at identifying significant cases. The Interim

Targeting Program which OSHA instituted in April 1998 is identifying four times as many

significant cases--those in which proposed penalties are $100,000 or more--as our old inspection

targeting methods.     In the coming year we intend to bolster the agency's targeted enforcement

efforts.

       Improved ruIemaking is another priority. OSHA is working smarter in developing


                                                  4
                                            Hex-Dump Conversion

standards. I have designated a single leader to be in charge of all standards activity and we will

pilot test the use of teams for each project. Where appropriate, OSHA will use negotiated

rulemaking and will utilize national consensus and international standards to speed up our

rule-making process. Standards will emphasize outcomes and results rather than layers of

requirements.

     OSHA is continuing to eliminate outdated standards and re-write its rules into plain

language. Last April we proposed a revision of overly detailed standards covering dipping and

coating operations, which are designed to protect employees from fires and explosions. The

new Rule will be published shortly. The text has been made much shorter and duplicative

requirements have been eliminated. As of June 1998, the agency had eliminated over 1000

pages of outdated or redundant regulations, which will result in savings of almost $10 million

annually for employers. This year OSHA will continue to simplify regulations when we issue

the final revised rule on exit routes. We will also be doing "lookback" reviews of significant

standards to determine how effective they have been in saving lives and whether we should

consider changes and revisions ..

     In December, with broad support, OSHA issued a standard which requires training for more

than 1.5 million workers who operate powered industrial trucks. Evaluation of each operator's

performance is required as part of initial and refresher training. The rule is expected to prevent

11 deaths and almost 10,000 injuries each year and to save employers $118 million annually

from reductions in medical costs, workers compensation and lost output.

     This year OSHA plans to publish a proposed rule for safety and health programs and we will

 finalize a revision of the agency's recordkeeping regulations. These are what we call


                                                 5
                                      Hex-Dump Conversion

"building-block standards" because they are fundamental to workplace protection.

    Ergonomics is the most important standard we intend to propose this year. Work-related

musculoskeletal disorders account for 34% of all lost-workday injuries and illnesses. These

disorders cost employers $15- $20 billion in workers compensation costs each year, amounting to

$1 out of every $3 spent on workers' compensation. Yet this problem is preventable. The

National Academy of Sciences (NAS) has found compelling evidence that interventions can avert

disabling injuries. The Nation's leading professional society of occupational physicians, the

American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (ACOEM), has urged us to

move forward.   In a letter to OSHA of February 15 ACOEM stated that there is "an adequate

scientific foundation for OSHA to proceed with a Proposal and, therefore, no reason for OSHA

to delay .... " OSHA has spent the last several years talking to hundreds of business people who

have responded to problems by implementing successful ergonomic programs in their

workplaces. Clearly, as so many employers, workers, and scientists have already learned,

ergonomics programs work. The draft ergonomics proposal OSHA released last month for the

purposes of the SBREFA process incorporates the basic features of successful ergonomics

programs already used by many businesses to reduce their musculoskeletal injuries/illnesses.

Expanded education and outreach

  The largest single program increase in the budget which I requested last week is for

compliance assistance. OSHA plans to place a compliance assistance specialist in each Federal

area office, to provide advice and assistance to businesses, partiCUlarly small business employers.

This staff will be devoted exclusively to providing general advice on regulations and programs

in response to requests by employers, employees, and others in their community.      OSHA also


                                                6
                                           Hex-Dump Conversion

seeks increased funding for the Susan Harwood Training Grant program to address priority areas

in the Strategic Plan.

    OSHA's interactive software advisors continue to be extremely popular. The advisors,

which are available on OSHA's Web Page, offer instant assistance in complying with OSHA

standards. The latest additions are the Hazard Awareness Advisor, which is designed to help

employees and employers, especially small businesses, locate hazards in their workplace, and

Safety Pays, which shows employers the impact that occupational injuries and illness can have on

the company's bottom line.

     We also released three new, major publications last year, to help employers understand

OSHA's regulations. They include a guide to scaffold use in the construction industry; a guide

for small business employers to assess the need for use of personal protective equipment in their

workplaces; and a booklet on protection for healthcare workers who respond to emergencies

involving chemical, biological, or radioactive hazards.

     In another effort to expand our compliance assistance for employers OSHA issued a new

directive on the Hazard Communication Standard allowing employers to provide Material Safety

Data Sheets to their employees electronically so that they are aware of chemical hazards and

protective measures.

     Enhanced Whistleblower Protection. To ensure that Americas's workers can exercise

their rights under the OSH Act without fear of retaliation, I have recommended that the

Administration send to the Congress legislation that strengthens the OSH Act's whistleblower

protection. There is a good deal of evidence that many workers do not feel free to complain

about unsafe conditions and that some employers feel they can retaliate against whistleblowers


                                                7
                                           Hex-Dump Conversion
with impunity. Increasedwhistleblower protection is an important priority for OSHA.

                                              ***
     Mr. Chairman, I believe that the "New OSHA" has an impressive story to tell. Since the

agency was reinvented in 1995 we have seen injury/illness rates decline while OSHA has

achieved a careful balance between enforcement and cooperation. OSHA's programs are

combining tough enforcement, creative partnership and results-driven management.

appreciate the opportunity to testify today and to outline OSHA's success and its priorities for FY

2000.
