      i HAVE ATTACHED A MEMORANDUM THAT I SENT TO DIANA FORTUNA AT DPC LAST
      NIGHT WHO HAS BEEN CHAIRING THE INTERAGENCY WELFARE GROUP FOR YOUR
      INFORMATION.

      IT IS CLEAR THAT OUR INTERESTS ARE BEING LEFT BEHIND DESPITE OUR BEST
      EFFORTS TO PARTICIPATE AND HAVE AN IMPACT.  [THE HHS MTG WAS ATTENDED
BY
     JACK KRISTY, RANDY HANSEN, TED SKY, LYNETTE CHARBONNEAU AND MYSELF]
CLEARLY, WE NEED TO SHAKE SOME MORE TREES ON THIS IF WE WANT IMPACT.

      I AM ALSO ATTACHING SOME OF JACK KRISTY'S COMMENTS ON THE HHS
      GUIDANCE BELOW:

Two items in the January 31 HHS document are probably worth noting:

     (1) P.4, last paragraph above "Child Support." The second sentence
     indicates that HHS will seek a legislative change to clarify that the
     "calculation of whether a State has met the applicable participation
     rate shall take into account the State's success in placing
     participants in both TANF and MOE [i.e., non-federally funded
welfare]


     programs in work activities." This suggests that if Congress narrows
     the law on the 20% issue there will be collateral effects with
respect
     to welfare assistance provided by States with their own resources.
     Bad and double bad.

        (2)P.6, second paragraph ("Interim Penalty Policies"), second and
        third sentences. Note particularly: "States will not be subject to
        penalties under the new law so long as they implement programs which
        are related to the intent of the statute and operate within a
        reasonable interpretation of the statutory language." We should make
        sure that "our" interest groups are aware of this language as they
try
        to sell their recommendations to State welfare planners.

        Today, after much waiting, we met with hhs regarding joint issuance
of
        a guidance letter on the 20% voc ed issue and other items[a copy of
        which they have had for weeks].  We learned at that meeting that
        HHS/acf issued guidance on 1/31/97 regarding a number of issues and
        were told that this was likely to be the only guidance they were
going
        to issue.  Clearly, we would have liked to have been involved in what
        should have been included in that guidance memo and told them so at
        the meeting.

        We have briefed HHS on our issues several months ago [at several
        different meetings].  We also briefed the inter-agency work group and
        provided our issue papers to HHS and the work group very early on in
        the process. Olivia Golden and Livonia Limon met with the education
        groups on these issues at our invitation early in the process.

     Clearly, when this guidance went out, the Department of ED's
interests
     were not on anyone's radar screen or dismissed as not important
enough
     or too sensitive to be considered as part of this issuance. This
     guidance was not raised at one of our now bi-weekly meetings that Ted
     Sky, Jessica Levin or myself have attended in behalf of the
     department.

      We remain disappointed that we were not included in a process that
we,
      in good faith, made every attempt to be a part of. We are not sure
      what the best way is to participate in the future to represent the
      interest of the Department and the Education groups who have pushed
us
        for answers on these issues.

     We are concerned with the Administration's position on the technical
     amendments and· have particular interest in any attempt by the
Congress


     to narrow the interpretation of the 20%.
