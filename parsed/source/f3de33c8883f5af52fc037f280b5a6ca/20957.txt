  TEXT:
           Chris asked me to summarize my notes of our meeting this morning
  in orde.r to review the civil rights enforcement issues we identified as
  particularly significant. I list these below, as well as my recollection
  of the remainder of our discussion. Please let me know if you have
  corrections or additions.

          We identified the following "frontier" civil rights enforcement
  issues as significant enough to warrant review by the President:
          1) higher education admissions, including the use of standardized
  tests and the way we choose to articulate and support the Bakke decision;
          2)   high stakes testing in other settings, such as elementary and
  secondary schools;
          3) single sex schools;
          4) magnet and charter schools, including the appropriate use of
  race by these schools in creating a diverse student body and our
  enforcement strategy if schools exclude groups in violation of the civil
  rights laws;
          5) the importance of testers in civil rights enforcement, as used
  by the EEOC and other enforcement agencies;
          6) achieving diversity in employment and ownership in the
  broadcasting industry, including the status of the challenge to the FCC's
  employment rules and strategies to diversify ownership;
          7) our efforts to achieve "environmental justice," i.e.,
  challenging decisions of local government or other recipients of federal
  funds in land use planning decisions that have a discriminatory impact.

          In addition to these issues, we may, after further review, want to
  include language discrimination by employers and religious discrimination.
  Also, the question of reforms in the 8(a) program may warrant review, both
  as a legal matter based on our need to comply with Adarand and as a policy
  matter, based on the desire to make the program more effective.

             In regard to policy issues that Chuck and I contemplated including


  in a memo to the President, particularly pipeline strategies for higher
  education, there was a strong recommendation to include these as a part of
  the regular budget process. I will convey this recommendation to Chuck and
  discuss with Elena and Mike Cohen how that would be done. Finally, there
  was a consensus that we need some kind of regular White House review of
  civil rights enforcement policy and strategies. One possibility is a
  meeting every month (perhaps 6 weeks) involving DPC, Counsel's Office,
  other White House staff where appropriate, the heads of the enforcement
  agencies and some agency staff.
