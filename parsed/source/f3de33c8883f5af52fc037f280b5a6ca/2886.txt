TEXT:
Elena,
I need you to clear the following letter to Winston Bryant on Medicaid
Fraud.  Chris Jennings' office already approved it. Thanks. Sarah x65514

Dear Winston:
Thank you for your letter.  I appreciate knowing of your efforts to
stop Medicaid fraud in Arkansas.

While, I can't comment directly on your proposal, I will make sure
that the Justice Management Division at the Department of Justice will
give it every consideration.

As you know, I've made combating waste, fraud, and abuse in our
nation's health care system a top priority. My first budget in 1993
closed loopholes in Medicare and Medicaid that had allowed waste,
fraud, and abuse to occur.  Since 1993, the Department of Justice has
increased health care fraud investigations, criminal prosecutions,
convictions, and civil recoveries.  To build on these efforts, two
years ago my Administration launched Operation Restore Trust, a
comprehensive anti-fraud initiative in five key states.  Since then,
ORT has produced ten dollars in overpayments for everyone dollar
invested, and the Kennedy-Kassebaum bill I signed in 1996 expanded ORT
nationwide.

As we continue to work to fight waste, fraud, and abuse in our
nation's health care system, I hope you will remain actively involved.
Thanks for helping to improve our Medicaid system.
