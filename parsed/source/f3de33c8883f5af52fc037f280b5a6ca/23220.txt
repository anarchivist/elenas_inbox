Q:   What is your response to Representative Barr's NRA-supported legislation to block
     lawsuits that cities have filed against the gun manufacturers? Do you have a
     position on legislation proposed by Senator Boxer to give cities the right to sue gun
     manufacturers and distributors? And do you have a position on the bill introduced
     by Senator Schumer yesterday which would regulate the sale of guns on the
     Internet?

A:   The Barr legislation is an attempt by the gun lobby to avoid the very serious issues about
     gun trafficking and gun safety raised by the cities' lawsuits. We are watching these suits
     closely, and will do all we can to resist efforts that would prevent the cities from
     presenting their evidence. Similarly, we are supportive of efforts such as Senator
     Boxer's that specifically allow cities to put such evidence before the courts.

     While we are still reviewing Senator Schumer's legislation, my policy continues to be: no
     background check, no handgun. That is why some of my top firearms-related priorities
     for the year are to extend the Brady waiting period and to ensure background 'checks at
     gun shows. We will review the Schumer legislation with this position in mind.

     At the same time, of course, I will continue to press forward on our other efforts to stop
     gun trafficking, ban violent juveniles from buying guns, and promote gun safety. I will
     not -- and I hope individual states and cities will not -- back down to the gun lobby on
     these issues.

Q:     Recently, there have been a number of stories on police brutality and misconduct,
       and a lack of citizen trust in law enforcement. What do you propose to do about
       this?

A:    Last weekend, I devoted my weekly radio address to announce a number of steps I will
      take to help strengthen police integrity and to build greater trust between law enforcement
      and the communities they serve. The policies I announced will be part of my 21 st
      Century Policing Initiative contained in the crime bill which I will soon send to the
      Congress. They include:

       (1) $20 million increase for integrity and ethics training. My crime bill will provide
       an increase of $20 million so that all 30 of our Regional Community Policing Institutes
       will be able to provide police integrity and ethics training. Currently, only two of the
       centers specialize in this crucial training.

       (2) $20 million to promote the best educated police force possible. My crime bill will
       authorize a new $20 million scholarship program for current state and local police
       officers who are seeking to advance their education and skills. The crime bill also will
       extend the Police Corps program, which offers college scholarships in exchange for
       service in law enforcement.

       (3) $2 million for improved minority recruitment. As we work to better educate
       and train our police, we must also do more to make sure police departments reflect
       the communities they serve. My crime bill will provide a $1 million increase for
       targeted police recruitment and outreach efforts such as police magnet high schools
       for youth, and partnerships with local colleges.

       (4) $ 5 million to expand citizen police academies. My crime bill will also propose $5
       million to establish more citizen police academies, which help to instruct residents on
       important police procedures -- and also help to strengthen the bond between law
       enforcement officers and their communities.


Q:     The tragic shooting death of Amadou Diallo by members of the New York Police
       Department has focused the nation's attention on the problem of police brutality. Is the
       federal government investigating that matter?

A:     The FBI, the u.s. Attorney for the Southern District of New York and the Justice
       Department's Civil Rights Division have been working closely and actively with the
       Bronx District Attorney's Office on the investigation. Further questions about the
       federal government's role in these investigations should be directed to the Justice
Q:   What can the Justice Department do against individual police officers who engage
     in misconduct?

A:   The Justice Department has the authority under criminal law to prosecute law
     enforcement officers who engage in misconduct, including the use of excessive force. At
     any given time, the Justice Department investigates several hundred allegations of
     criminal police misconduct around the country. Since 1993, the Justice Department has
     criminally prosecuted more than 300 law enforcement officers who have engaged in
     police misconduct, resulting in over 200 convictions.
