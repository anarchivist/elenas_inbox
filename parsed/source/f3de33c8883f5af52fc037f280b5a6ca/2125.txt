 TEXT:
 NEC and OMB are about to release the attached description of the budget
 agreement. We have asked them to hold, because the section toward the end
 on welfare to work/TANF talks about a share. of the money going directly to
 cities -- don't you think we should drop the word "directly"?

 It also seems odd to make it sound like we have an agreement on how to
 treat legal immigrant new entrants when in fact we don't.  Ken was just
 advising us to tell governors and mayors that there is no agreement in
 this area yet.


 THE PRESIDENT FOUGHT TO BETTER PROTECT:

 CHILDREN
          Keeping the Guarantee of Medicaid.   Preserves the Federal guarantee of
 Medicaid coverage for the vulnerable populations who depend on it and
 contains additional investments to extend coverage to uninsured children.

 LEGAL IMMIGRANTS WITH DISABILITIES

          Current Recipients.  Restores both SSI and Medicaid benefits for
 immigrants now receiving assistance who became disabled, ensuring that
 they will not be turned out of their apartments or nursing homes or
 otherwise left to an uncertain fate.

  Current Resident Nonrecipients. Does not change the rules
 retroactively.  Immigrants who are already in the country, are not now
 receiving benefits and subsequently become disabled will also be fully
 eligible for SSI and Medicaid benefits.

  New Entrants.  Partially restores SSI and Medicaid benefits for future
 arrivals who become disabled after entry--sponsor deeming will be applied
 with respect to both programs.

  Children. Restores SSI (and Medicaid) benefits for disabled legal
 immigrant children who are now in the country.  For children who arrive in
 the future, sponsor deeming will be applied with respect .to both SSI and
 Medicaid eligibility.

  Refugees and Asylees.  Extends the SSI and Medicaid eligibility period
 for refugees and asylees from 5 years after entry (the limit in the
 welfare bill) to 7 years, in order to give these residents more time to


    naturalize.


     PEOPLE WHO WANT TO WORK BUT CANO,T FIND A JOB

             Childless adults.  Last yearO,s welfare reform bill harshly restricted
    food stamps for able-bodied childless adults to only 3 out of every 36
    months, unless they are working. This move ignored the fact that finding
    a job often takes time. The budget agreement adds $750 million to the
    Food Stamp program, and redirects existing program funds, to create
    190,000 new work slots for food stamp recipients subject to the 0&3 in 36"
    time limit.

     Allows States to exempt up to 15 percent of the food stamp recipients who
    would otherwise be denied benefits as a result of the 0&3 in 36" limit.

    These two provisions together will preserve food stamps for approximately
    half of the able-bodied adults who, even though they are willing to work,
    would otherwise be ineligible for benefits.

    FINISH THE JOB OF WELFARE REFORM

     Additional resources for areas of particular need. Adds $2.0 billion to
    the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant, to be
    targeted to high-poverty, high-unemployment areas. A share of the
    additional dollars will go directly to cities with large poverty
    populations.  These resources will give States and cities the help they
    need to place welfare recipients living in the most disadvantaged areas
    into lasting jobs.

    These funds could be used for wage subsidies to private employers,
    transportation and other post-employment supportive services essential for
    job retention, and other effective job creation and placement strategies.

     Extra incentive for employers. Most welfare recipients want to work.
    The agreement establishes an enhanced welfare-to-work tax credit, to
    provide private employers with an incentive to give recipients a chance.

    The welfare-to-work tax credit in the budget agreement would allow
    employers to claim a credit of up to 50 percent of the first $10,000 in
    wages paid during a year to a worker who had been on welfare for a
    prolonged period of time.  The credit is available for up to two years per
    worker, giving employers an incentive to not just hire, but make efforts
    to retain long-term welfare recipients.

    In addition, expands the existing work opportunity tax credit (WOTC) to
    include, as one of the eligible populations, individuals subject to the
    0&3 in 36" food stamp limit.
