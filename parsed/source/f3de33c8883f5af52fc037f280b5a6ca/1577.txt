                  Clinton Administration Urges FCC to Investigate
                         Hard Liquor Ads on TV and Radio
                                           April 1, 1997

                                   Questions and Answers



Q. What is today's announcement?

       Today, President Clinton is announcing that he is sending a letter to the Federal
Communications Commission (FCC) Chairman Reed Hundt to "take all appropriate action" to
explore what effects might ensue from the distilled liquor industry's decision to end their 50·year
voluntary ban on broadcast advertising. The letter also asks the FCC to explore possible actions
the agency could take in response to end of the ban on broadcast liquor advertising.


Q.     Why are you announcing this now?

A.     In February, Chairman Hundt again spoke out on the issue ofliquor advertising. The
President felt it was important to send a letter to the FCC to weigh in on this matter in view of
the Chairman's recent comments.

        In his radio address to the people last November, the President stated his firm opposition
to the American liquor industry decision to lift the voluntary ban on hard liquor advertising. At
that time, President Clinton commended the major broadcast networks' commitment to honor the
ban and keep liquor ads off the air.

        While all of the major networks have upheld their pledge to refrain from such
advertisements, in the last few months, hard liquor advertisements have appeared on broadcast
and cable television and radio stations.


Q.     Why does the letter only address distilled spirits -- what about beer and wine?

A.      The letter is in response to a particular action by the distilled liquor industry that the
President believes heads us in the wrong direction -- the collapse of the 50-year agreement that
kept these ads off the air.

        The President is asking the FCC to "explore what effects might ensue" from the collapse
of the agreement, which presumably will include the collection and analysis of data on the link
betwee~ liquor advertising and youth alcohol consumption. Especially given strong intuitive
reasons for believing that such a link exists, it is appropriate for the FCC to investigate this
matter further and examine their options to act in light of the information acquired.
                                                                                   Hex-DiJmp Conversion
Q.     What companies have already begun advertising on TV?

A.      Several distillers, including Seagram and Allied-Domecq, whose brands include Kahlua
and Hiram Walker products, have already hit the airwaves with commercials airing after 10 pm
in selected markets.


Q.     How many stations have started to run these advertisements?

A.      A liquor industry source estimated that 50 cable and independent stations have agreed to
air liquor advertisements. None of the major broadcast networks have yet agreed to air these
commercials since the liquor industry announcement last November.


Q.     What can the FCC do about the liquor industry'S decision to advertise on radio and
TV?

A.      The letter the President is sending today asks the FCC Chairman to look into what actions
the FCC is able to take in view of the liquor industry decision. The introduction of hard liquor
advertisements to television and radio requires careful study. At a minimum, the FCC must
determine what options are available to them in addressing this issue.


Q.     How big of a problem is alcohol use by young people?

A.      Alcohol is the drug most often used by young people. Approximately one in four 10th
grade students and one-third of 12th graders report having had five or more drinks on at least one
occasion in the last two weeks.

        The average age of having a first drink has declined to 15.9 years-old, down from the
average in 1987 of 17.4 years-old. According to the results of a 1994 national household survey,
2 million youth rate themselves as "heavy" alcohol drinkers. It is further estimated that one-half
of America's 2 million junior and senior high school students drink monthly.

        Moreover, alcohol is a "gateway" drug-- young people who are heavy drinkers are
significantly more likely to become multiple drug users later in life than their non-drinking
counterparts.

Q.     How is this announcement similar to President Clinton's actions on tobacco
advertising targeted at youth?

A.      President Clinton firmly believes that we have a national obligation to act strongly to
protect our children from threats to their health and safety. To this end, the President is
sending a letter to ask the FCC to explore its options in addressing the issue of hard liquor
                                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion
advertising on television and its effects on underage drinking.

        The President fought to impose appropriate regulations on tobacco advertising that
appeals to adolescents. Both actions highlight the President's commitment to help parents who
are struggling to raise healthy and drug-free children.
