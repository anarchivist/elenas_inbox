 TEXT:
 As the attached indicates, there is some question as to whether POTUS'
 reference in his ONC remarks on Saturday to "intellectual purgatory"
 refers to bilingual education or to Unz if it passes.  As I read the
 transcript, I think he means bilingual education--though I'm not sure its
 a good idea to offer that clarification.

 Any thoughts?

 He came up with intellectual purgatory all by himself.

 But for the record [consulting the record], I think he was talking about
 children.

  "I hope that all of you in California, particularly
here, will debate this, because we need to do right by these
kids. And doing right means giving them what they need, but not
keeping them trapped in some sort of intellectual purgatory where
they'll get bored and drop out of school and won't go forward.
So I'm very sympathetic with the impulse that put this initiative
on the ballot, but I think it's the wrong answer.

Do you know who drafted remarks for POTUS for Saturday's DNC event?

POTUS uttered words "intellectual prugatory" but there is a question as to
what he is referring to.  Kids in bilingual education or the Unz
initiative?
