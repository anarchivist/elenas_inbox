          MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

          FROM:         Bruce Reed
                        Elena Kagan

          RE:           DPC Weekly Report



                 1. WELFARE -- Welfare Provisions of the Budget: The bill reported by the Senate
          Finance Committee this week varies from the House versions regarding benefits for legal
          immigrants, welfare to work, and privatization of welfare operations.

                  2. WELFARE -- Comparison of Legal Immigrant Benefit Restoration Proposals:
          The Senate Finance Committee this week passed legal immigrant legis1ation that is better than
          the House Ways and Means proposal, but still does not comport with the budget agreement.
          House Ways and Means restores SSI and Medicaid benefits only to immigrants (both the
          disabled and non-disabled elderly) already receiving benefits prior to August 23, 1996, when the
          welfare law was signed -- essentially grandfathering those already on the rolls. The budget
          agreement restores SSI and Medicaid benefits to any immigrant in the country as of that date who
          is or becomes disabled. The Senate Finance Committee proposal actually costs more than the
          budget agreement over the budget window. Like the House proposal, the Senate would
          grandfather all those on the rolls when the welfare law was signed, and it would also allow
          disabled legal immigrants in the country when the law was signed to apply for SSI until
          September of this year.

                  The Senate Finance policy would cost $10.4 billion, as compared to the $9.7 billion price
          tag of the budget agreement and the $9.0 billion cost of the House proposal. Covering both
          groups would cost $11.4 billion.

                 In 2002, the budget agreement preserves SSI coverage for 75,000 more people than the
          House proposal. However, the House proposal protects 50,000 more people initially because it
          grandfathers everyone on the rolls, including the non-disabled elderly, who are not protected by
          the budget agreement. In spite of this apparent "elderly vs. disabled" split, aging groups have
          joined with disability groups in forcefully endorsing our approach over the House's.



                                                                    Automated Records Management System
                                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion
non-disabled on the rolls who are not covered under the budget agreement, and legal immigrants
in the country when the law was signed who become disabled in the future. In a letter on the
Senate Finance proposal this week, we signaled our willingness to cover the non-disabled elderly
under the right circumstances by stating, "The Administration is sympathetic to the goal of
covering the elderly non-disabled, and will work with you to address this issue. However, as is
the case with all of the provisions in the agreement, any new policies that require additional
resources must be mutually agreeable."

        The Senate's version of the $3 billion welfare to work program adapts the basic House
Ways and Means model to the Committee's more rural membership. In the Senate, less of the
$3 billion is awarded on a competitive basis (25% vs. 50%) and none of these competitive funds
are set-aside for the 100 cities with the most poor people (House Ways and Means set aside 65%
of the competitive funds for this purpose), although the Senate not surprisingly retained a rural
set-aside similar to the House's. In the Senate, nearly all of the 75% of funds distributed based
on formula flow to local jurisdictions, like in the House, but the Senate sends the funds to local
welfare office controlled by the governors instead of private industry councils controlled by the
mayors. During mark-up, the Senate added language to strengthen the anti-displacement
provisions of the program.

         There was a major battle in the Finance Committee regarding the chairman's provision to
deem the Texas privatization proposal approved and allow up to ten states to privatize Medicaid,
Food Stamps, and other program operations. Senator Conrad offered a motion, opposed by Phil
Gramm, to strike the provisions. Conrad's motion won, with votes from all Democrats and
Senators D'Amato and Jeffords. Then, after some back-room wrangling, the chairman's
proposal was limited only to Texas and D'Amato and Jeffords changed their votes. Thus, the
Senate bill allows complete privatization of all health and human services programs in Texas.
In the House, the bills reported out by the Agriculture and Commerce committees allow all 50
states to privatize food stamp and Medicaid operations.

        3. WELFARE -- Employment Prospects of Welfare Recipients: Many economists
are now turning their attention to the question of whether there will be enough jobs for welfare
recipients who need to go to work. The latest is a draft, not-for-quotation study by former OMB
Program Associate Director Isabelle Sawhill and co-author Daniel McMurrer. They conclude
that if the economy continues· to grow, it should produce a sufficient number of jobs to
accommodate welfare recipients entering the labor force. This conclusion is based, however, on
their estimate that only about 150,000 additional welfare recipients will need to go to work each
year under the new law. Sawhill and McMurrer conclude that this year's 25% work participation
requirement will be met by those already working and the credit states will get for caseload
reductions from the past several years. Thus, they base the additional number required to work
on the law's 5% per year increase in the participation rate from now until the year 2002. The
authors note that even with continued job growth, some welfare recipients may be unable to find
jobs because of their low skills and that states may need to retain some individuals on the rolls


                                                2
find full-time employment should stay above the poverty line with the help of the EITC, the
higher minimum wage, and subsidized child care. A mother with two children
who eamed $10,000 a year in 1996 (slightly less that what a full-time year-round worker would
make at $5.15 an hour) would also qualify for $3,556 from the EITC, and about $2,400 in Food
Stamps. After paying $765 in payroll taxes, the family would have a disposable income just
over $15,000. With child care subsidies, this family's disposable income would stay above the
poverty line, but paying as much a $3,000 a year per child in out-of-pocket child care expenses
would push them back below poverty.

[Note to BrucelElena: Wall Street Journal reporter Michael Frisby's description slightly
misconstrues Sawhill's findings (he spoke to her, never saw the study). He says "Her nearly
completed analysis estimates that only 140,000 welfare recipients a year may be cut from the
caseloads, far fewer than some have thought." Her study looks at those who leave welfare for
work, but Frisby's use of the word "cut" makes it appear she's talking about those who reach the
time limits. Frisby took 146,000 in 1998 and made it 140,000; I used 150,000 because the
number rises, starting at 146,000 in 1998 and rising to 153,000 by 2002.]

       4. Housing-- State of the Cities Report: On Monday, June 23, you will announce the
issuance of HUD's report, "The State of American Cities." The report, in three sections,
describes:

       1. The "decades of decline" leading up to the early 1990's.

       2A. The significant improvements made by cities since 1993 as a result of the strong
       economy and this Administrations's urban policies (including Empowerment Zones,
       CDFI, home ownership strategies, and) along with

       2B. The real challenges that remain, specifically: job growth disparity between cities
       and suburbs, increased poverty concentration in central cities, and continued middle-class
       migration from central cities to the suburbs.

       3. The Administration's "Urban Agenda for the Future," a comprehensive plan based on
       the same empowerment principles (local control, flexibility) that undergird everything we
       have done so fat.

Building on the report, you will announce three new policies to help America's cities:

       1. The Officer Next Door program makes government owned homes available for sale at
       a fifty percent discount to police officers who agree to live in the communities they
       police.




                                                3




           2. You will announce an additional 25 basis points reduction in mortgage insurance
           premiums for first time buyers who purchase homes in central cities.

           3. You will call for legislation transforming Section 8 certificates and vouchers into
           potential home ownership vouchers, enabling low-income families to use their Section 8
           subsidies to support debt service on a mortgage.
           You will also reiterate your call for a new round of Empowerment Zones and brownfields
    cleanup incentives, contrasting the inclusion of Empowerment Zones and brownfields funding in
    the budget deal, with the lack of such funding in Republican tax proposals.

            Finally, you will announce HUD's top-to-bottom management reform plan, developed at
    your direction to incoming-Secretary Cuomo in January.

            5. AIDS -- Upcoming Action on Needle Exchange: Current law requires that the
    Administration not authorize the use of Federal funds for needle exchange programs unless there
    is conclusive evidence that they do not encourage drug use. Although there is strong evidence
    that indicates that needle exchange programs help reduce the spread of AIDS, HHS is currently
    concluding its review on whether these programs increase the use of drugs. Local communities
    remain free to use non-Federal funds to support such programs.

            We are facing increasing pressure from the AIDS community and from the Mayors'
    Conference in San Francisco for the Administration to conclude that there is no problem with
    increased drug use and therefore authorize cities to access the CDC-allocated prevention block
    grant for needle exchange programs. Because conservative Republicans are fearful that the
    Administration may move in this direction, they are planning to take away the Secretary's
    authority to grant local communities access to these dollars. Weare pursuing legislative options
    through the appropriations process to assure that the Secretary's discretion is retained. We will
    be forwarding a memo to you in short order to review ways in which we might proceed. It will
    include not only options to retain the current Secretaries discretion but also suggestions for how
    to implement any decision that authorizes Federal dollars in this area.


            6. AIDS -- Release of HHS Guidelines on HIV Treatment: Thursday, NIH released
    HHS guidelines on HIV treatment procedures. This announcement was well received by the
    medical community and the AIDS community as an important contribution which will help
    doctors provide appropriate treatment. We encouraged HHS to do.wnplay this announcement
    since we were concerned that it would only provide AIDS activists with new reason to call for
    additional federal funding to cover the recommended treatment. Not surprisingly, the AIDS
    activists succeeded in turning this positive story into a rationale for why the Congress and the
    Administration should appropriate more dollars for coverage of protease inhibitors. We can
    expect the drumbeat in this area only to increase in the upcoming months, and we will have to
    determine whether it is appropriate to propose additional funding in this area and if so decide
    what the best legislative vehicle would be.


                                                    4




            7. HEALTH CARE -- Congressional Action on Health Care: The Senate Finance
    Committee reported out its health care provisions on Medicare, Medicaid and children's
    coverage expansions this week.           The Medicare provisions preserved many of the
    Administration's priorities including: new plan options, such as preferred provider organizations,
    provider sponsored organizations; preventive benefits (most of your mammography expansions
    excluding co-payments, colorectal screening, etc.) and traditional provider and beneficiary
    savings, which combined with your home health care reallocation, will extend the life of the
    Medicare trust fund for at least a decade. It also reduced the size of the MSA demonstration to
    100,000. The committee did include a number of reforms that exposed beneficiaries to
    additional costs, including a new income-related deductible, $5 per visit home care co-payment,
    and a proposal to phase in the Medicare retirement from age 65 to 67. We anticipate that all
    three of these provisions will be dropped either on the Senate floor next week or in the joint
    House/Senate conference.

            The Medicaid provisions included a Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) proposal that
    cuts payments to high DSH states much more significantly than either your original budget
    proposal or the House Commerce Committee. It also did not include a number of the
    low-income Medicare beneficiary investments, and it did not provide for the entire allocation of
    savings for the DC and Puerto Rico Medicaid provisions. The Administration will insist that
    those investments are fulfilled, consistent with the Budget Agreement. The initial indication
    from the Republican leadership is that they will try to helpful in this regard. Regarding the DSH
    cuts, we are attempting to find ways to moderate the impact on these states, but to date are having
    difficulty attracting much Congressional support.

             8.. CRIME -- Juvenile Crime Update: Last week, the Senate Judiciary Committee
    released a new Chairman's mark of its juvenile crime legislation. This version contains
    improvements over the bill as introduced and is substantially better than the House-passed bill.
    The new Chairman's mark removed provisions that we considered objectionable (e.g., death
    penalty for minors, mandatory 6-level sentence enhancement for gang activity). However, it still
    falls short of our Anti-Gang and Youth Violence Act: no major gun provisions such as child
    safety locks, or Brady for violent juveniles; no dedicated prevention funding; insufficient funds
    for prosecutors and courts; and inadequate protections for juveniles incarcerated in state
    facilities. The Senate was originally scheduled to mark up the legislation last week; however,
    the process has been stalled does yet not have a new markup date.

            9. CIVIL RIGHTS -- Minority Enrollment: You asked why the Department of
    Education has taken 1 Y, years (after Hopwood) to investigate minority emollment disparities.
    Do Ed reports that it notified Governor Bush that it was reopening its Title VI case in February
    and its investigators will interview students and school officials over the summer. DoEd
    stresses that it has not been inactive: Prior to investigating Texas, DoEd initiated investigations
    in Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania. They indicate that the Administration inherited a backlog of
    eight states to investigate and enforcement resources are a factor in these costly and lengthy


                                                    5
California investigation covers approximately 140.) DoEd Civil Rights said that they are
moving as quickly as possible with their investigations, but they do not want to comment on the
time frame of open investigations.

       You also inquired about the Administration's enforcement of the other civil rights laws.
The Administration has made progress in such areas as reducing the EEOC backlog and filing
record numbers of criminal prosecutions of the civil rights laws. At the same time, the full
range of civil rights law, including Title VI and the burgeoning American with Disabilities Act
caseload, pose significant enforcement challenges. The DPC is reviewing these issues with the
relevant agencies to provide you with additional specifics.

(Note: Sylvia asked Jose to include this section in the weekly.)

        10. IMMIGRATION -- Smuggling: The Administration has initiated Operation Reach
to strengthen international smuggling enforcement. Global Reach includes opening 13 new
offices in Europe, Asia, Africa and Latin America with 45 officers dedicated to criminal
smuggling investigations. It will also train foreign law enforcement and airline officials in
identifying fraudulent documents and facilitating cooperative enforcement efforts.
