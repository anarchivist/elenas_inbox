Though the President didn't get a chance to mention IDAs in the speech
yesterday, we now have a chance to get on record with support in the SAP.
Apparently HHS has not raised concerns with proposed language below.

DRAFT - NOT FOR RELEASE

1998



H.R. 4271 - The Community Services Reauthorization Act of 1998
Rep. Riggs (R) CA and 4 co-sponsors


The Administration supports H.R. 4271, which would reauthorize
appropriations for the Community Services Block Grant (CSBG) Program and
Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP). The Administration is
pleased that the bill includes a pilot project for Individual Development
Accounts (IDAs) to encourage low-income Americans to set money aside in
special savings accounts for post-secondary education or to purchase a
first home or start a new business. The President has long supported IDAs
as a means to helping low-income Americans save for their futures.

The Administration, however, is concerned that the bill includes only a
two-year reauthorization of LIHEAP and urges the Congress to enact a
four-year reauthorization of this important program.  In addition, the
Administration is concerned that the provision to allow States to use CSBG
funds for State tax credits may divert funds from the primary purposes of
the CSBG program and prove extremely difficult to monitor and evaluate.
The Administration will work to amend the bill as it continues through the
legislative process.
