                                  Welfare Reform Announcements



    1.    Welfare refonn bonuses to promote work and reduce illegitimacy: We are now nearly
          ready to announce two new nationwide competitions to promote work and personal
          responsibility. The first competition will award $1 billion in bonuses to states that do the
          best job of placing people into jobs and helping them succeed in the work place. The
          second will distribute $100 million a year to states that reduce their "illegitimacy ratio"
          i.e., the percentage of children born out of wedlock.

    2.    FICA tax and workfare: Announce before or at the meeting with the National Governors
          Association a new Treasury ruling that exempts workfare positions from payroll taxes,
          while maintaining worker protections. States have long sought this ruling to reduce the
          cost of requiring workfare, and doing so should undennine Republican attempts to
          eliminate worker protections for these positions.

    3.    Child support enforcement: Revoke all federal licenses (i.e., pilots, maritime, other) to
          parents who owe child support and call upon the House to enact the Deadbeat Parents
          Punishment Act, proposed by the President and passed by the Senate in November, to
          make it a felony offense to cross states lines to willfully avoid paying child support.

    4.    New welfare to work grants: Throughout the spring, welfare to work grants -- from the
          Balanced Budget Act's $3 billion welfare to work fund -- will be available to announce.

    5.    Earned income tax credit: Announce a new 1-800 number for employers to get help with
          the Earned Income Tax Credit, so to help companies retain employees and give them a
          raise in every pay check.

    6.    Federal welfare hiring: Announce in April -- one year after the initiative was launched --
          new numbers showing that the federal government is on track to hiring 10,000 welfare
          recipients by the year 2000.

    7.    Disability executive order: Sign executive order on increasing employment of people with
          disabilities.

    8.    Service: Have an event to highlight the expansion of high school service scholars
          program from 1,700 to 10,000 high schools.

    9.    Service: Have a bipartisan event to transmit the AmeriCorps reauthorization language.

    10.   Food Stamps for legal immigrants: Event to promote budget proposal.



                                                                  Automated Rerords Management System
                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion




                                        Ideas Under Development


     11.   Policies to promote fatherhood: Propose, or endorse a possible House proposal, for a
           block grant to states to encourage fathers to become more actively involved in their
           children's lives.

     12.   Policies to assist grandparents: Develop ideas of how to support and assist grandparents
           who are their grandchildren's primary caregiver.

     13.   College attendance: Ensure that welfare recipients can attend college while still fulfilling
           their work requirements.

     14.   Assets/Savings:Work with agencies to develop proposals to promote savings and IDAs
           among former welfare recipients.

     15.   Teen Pregnancy Prevention: Announcements for May.

                                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion
