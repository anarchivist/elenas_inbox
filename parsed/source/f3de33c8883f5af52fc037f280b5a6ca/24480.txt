TEXT:
When last we talked with Chris Schroeder (sp?) in your office, we agreed
to get back together with Ken Apfel to explore policy options and further
steps on this question.  Debbie Kramer has been trying to set up
something, but is not getting a response.    Could you help facilitate Ken
and Chris getting together? Thanks.
