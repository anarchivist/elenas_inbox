TEXT:
I have some new information on Equal Pay:
        1. Time Magazine and LATimes are doing articles on Equal Pay and
seem to be asking Susan Bianchi and others, "How do you feel about equal
pay vs. sexual harassment????"   "Where does this fit on your agenda?"

So, ........... .

Also, June 10th is the 35th anniversary of signing the Equal pay Act even
though it did not take effect for 1 year.   This was 'pre' civil rights
biil.

Other interesting dates include: ( around) May 8th is the day africian
american women finally earn the same as men in 97'; and sometime in mid
July is the same date for hispanic women.

May 1 is "worthy wage day" and I've heard the AFL is working on a combined
child care/equal pay event.  I'll try to confirm this today.
