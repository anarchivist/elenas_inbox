TEXT:
On July 1, Durbin, along with Voinovich, will hold a hearing and release a
GAO report, criticizing the Administration's policies on egg safety.   The
title of the GAO report is tentatively "Nation Lacks a Consistent,
Farm-to-Table Approach to Egg Safety," and the hearing's title is "Are
There Cracks in the Federal Food Safety System?"   Both FDA and USDA will
be asked to testify.  We will work to make sure we have a consistent
message, and prepare some Q&A on the report.  While the hearing will focus
on eggs, Durbin's staff has told us that they are going to use eggs as an
example to push for their single food safety agency legislation, which
they will introduce sometime before the hearing.

Durbin's staff is willing to work with us on a possible egg announcement
for the July 3 radio address.  I'm still waiting to hear from OMB on
whether it will be ready.   You all might want to make a call to make sure
it is ready       I have emphasized to them that we really want to do it:
