Thanks for sending down the Proposition 211 draft.  Just before I got your
letter incorporating Bruce Lindsey's comments, I received some suggestions
from Jennifer O'Connor on the language. Her comments are represented in
red, within and following the text below.  Should we amend the letter or
can we leave it the way it is?
************************************************************************************
Thank you very much for writing to me about Proposition 211, the
California ballot initiative regarding securities lawsuits.

I opposed this Proposition because I felt it would undermine the balance
between the federal and the state governments with respect to the
regulation of widely traded securities. As my veto of last year's
Securities Reform Act attests, I believe strongly in the need to protect
the rights of defrauded investors.  But after careful consideration, I
determined that Proposition 211's creation of a novel cause of action,
broader than any now recognized, would have gone too far in the other
direction, deterring companies from providing useful information and
thereby harming American investors.

Thank you again for giving me your views.
Needs something addressing preemption. ( I believe we didn't ever do
anything and we should say so.)
