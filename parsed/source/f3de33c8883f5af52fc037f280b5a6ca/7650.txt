Elena,
As you know, the House Judiciary Committee mark-up is now scheduled for
next week (Tues'. or Wed.). ,Peter now recommends that the letter to
Chariman Hyde include a veto threat.   The attached revised version of the
letter contains a veto threat and a statement of Administration support
for legal immigration (consistent with a request by the AG).   I have
bolded these two portions of the letter for your review.   Thanks.

The Honorable Henry J. Hyde                             Hex-Dump Conversion        .
Chairman
Committee on the Judiciary
U.S. House of Representatives
Washington, D.C. 20515


Dear Chairman Hyde:

        Today, your Committee will mark-up H.R. 3736, the "Workforce Improvement and
Protection Act of 1998" which is intended to address the growing demand for skilled workers in
the information technology (IT) industry. H.R. 3736 enacts a temporary increase in the annual
cap on the number of visas for temporary foreign "specialty" workers under the H-lB program,
while also effecting reforms to the H-IB program that would help target usage ofH-IB visas to
industries and employers that are actually experiencing skill shortages.

         The Administration believes that the first response for increasing the availability of
skilled workers for industry must be increasing the skills of U.S. workers and helping the labor
market work better to match employers with U.S. workers. ' Therefore, additional efforts to
increase the skill level of U.S. workers and needed improvements to the H-IB program are
necessary prerequisites for the Administration to support any short-term increase in the number
of H -1 B visas available for temporary foreign workers. Modifications to the H-IB program
that appropriately protect U.S. workers are fully consistent with the Administration's
longstanding support for legal immigration. (the AG requested this language to combat the
view that our restriction on use o/the H-IB program was an anti-immigrant signal)

        We are pleased that H.R. 3736 as reported from the Immigration and Claims
Subcommittee is consistent with one of our primary objectives, insofar as it links a temporary
increase in the H-IB cap to the enactment ofmeailingful reforms to the H-IB visa program. H.R.
3736 would help ensure that U.S. workers do not lose their jobs to temporary foreign workers
and that employers have made serious efforts to recruit U.S. workers for open positions so that
qualified U.S. workers have the opportunity to fill a job before a temporary foreign worker is
hired. Moreover, H.R. 3736 expands enforcement authority to help prevent employer abuses of
the H-IB program. These reforms will effectively target H-IB visas to industries experiencing
skill shortages.

        Unfortunately, H.R. 3736 does not contain any provision to encourage additional training
ofD.S. workers. Training is a vital component of our strategy to address the long-term demand
for highly skilled U.S. workers and to enhance the international competitiveness of important
U.S. industries. An effective training strategy would also work to reduce the demand for H-IB
visas. The Administration strongly supports amending H.R. 3736 to provide for additional
training opportunities for U.S. workers and believes that this training should be funded, in part,
through a modest H -1 B application fee paid by employers.

       The Administration is also concerned that the increase in the annual number of H-l B
                                                     .      Hex-Dump Conversion
visas reflected in this bill is too large, although we agree that the increase should last for only
three years. In addition, the Administration does not support provisions in the bill that would
impose occupation-based restrictions on the first 65,000 H-IB visas.

         The Administration believes that the reforms included in H.R. 3736 would substantially
improve the current H-l B program .. With the addition of a meaningful training provision, a
modest reduction in the level of increase in the annual H-IB visa cap, and modifications to make
the bill consistent with U.S. international trade obligations, H.R. 3736 would gamer the
Administration's strong support. However, if amendments are adopted that substantially
weaken the reform or enforcement provisions of H_R. 3736 or if meaningful provisions for
increasing the skill levels of U.S. workers are not adopted, the Secretary of Labor and the
Attorney General would recommend that the President veto this legislation.

      The Office of Management and Budget advises that there is no objection to the
submission of this report from the standpoint of the Administration's program.



Sincerely,




JANET RENO                             ALEXIS HERMAN
Attorney General                       Secretary of Labor
