TEXT:
He had read our SAP language as a more positive statement about his
amendment, and was disappointed to say the least about our "do not oppose"
stance. He will continue to urge us to weigh in in conference.    He asked
if we would consider supporting as a compromise a provision which allows
12 months of postsecondary education or vocational education (without
making both 24 months and without taking the teens out of the 30 percent
cap) .  We have in essence in the TANF reg allowed this, since states
define "vocatioal education" but more states would realize they had the
option if it were in the statute.  Thoughts, comments?
