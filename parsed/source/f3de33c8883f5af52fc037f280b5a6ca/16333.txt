          EDITORIAL NOTEBOOK / By BRENT STAPLES

          Forty Acres and a Mule

            Bill Clinton has earned a boat-load of scorn since suggesting
that he might apologize for slavery, as some in Congress have
          suggested. Critics from both left and right argue that such an
apology would be trivializing, empty, arrogant and racially divisive. The
          dominant view, typified by the columnist Charles Krauthammer, is
that there is essentially nothing to discuss, since the civil War closed
          the issue and the slavers and the enslaved are long since dead.
But all the noise suggests the issue is very much alive. The terms of
          Emancipation are nearly as explosive today as during the 1860's,
when they dominated public consciousness and nearly tore the
          Government apart.

          The facts of the period have been papered over in myth. These
days, every school child thinks that Abraham Lincoln freed the slaves at
          one fell swoop -- and for moral reasons. In fact, the
Emancipation Proclamation freed only the slaves in rebellious states.
Lincoln himself
          called it a military tactic, acknowledging that moral issues
were in no way involved.

          The slavers and the enslaved are certainly gone from the scene.
But African-American families that have shown even a casual interest in
          history can give chapter and verse on relatives who were born in
slavery or just afterward and the costs they paid. In the Staples family,
          for example, mine is the first generation to come of age without
a flesh and blood former slave somewhere at the extended family table.
          That people in their 40's have this experience makes the issue a
current one indeed.

          My maternal great-grandmother, Luella Holmes Patterson, was born
of a former slave and her master -- and shipped off the plantation
          when the wife got wind of her. As a grade schooler, I visited
Luella often in Hollins, Va. A few towns away lay the farm of my paternal
          great-grandfather, John Wesley Staples, who was conceived in
slavery as well and born July 4, 1865, at the dawn of Emancipation. He
          died 10 years before my birth but was remembered to me in
stories and pictures. As recently as 10 years ago, he and his wife, Eliza,
were
          the subject of a pamphlet, written for a family reunion.

          John Wesley met Emancipation with his whole life still in front
of him. But among his neighbors and in-laws were ex-slaves who came to
          freedom landless and old or simply broken by the experience. My
uncle Mack, who will be 80 in December, remembers them well.
          When I asked him about the apology brewing in Congress, Uncle
Mack could barely contain himself: "They can keep the apology. What
          good is it? They promised us 40 acres and the mule. None of our
people ever got that."

          "Forty acres and a mule," of course, is a rallying cry from
1865. It originated during Sherman's March to the Sea. Overwhelmed by black
          families that abandoned the plantations to follow him, Sherman
issued Special Field Order 15, declaring the Georgia Sea Islands and a


          strip of South Carolina rice country as black settlements. Each
family was to get 40 acres and the loan of an Army mule to work it. Other
          generals and Federal officials followed Sherman's lead, realizin
g that land was the only hedge against starvation and renewed bondage.

          The confiscations were in accordance with Federal law. If
sustained and accelerated, the land grants would have created black capital
          and independence almost immediately and precluded much of the
corrosive poverty that still grips the black South. President Andrew
          Johnson was nearly impeached, in part for obstructing Congress
on Reconstruction. Meanwhile, he canceled Special Field Order 15,
          returning land to white owners and condemning blacks to de facto
slavery.

          In many places, the eviction process was long and bloody. As the
ex-slave Sarah Debro said of the period: "Slavery was a bad thing, and
          freedom, of the kind we got with nothing to live on, was bad.
Two snakes full of poison. One lying with his head pointing north, the
other
          with his head pointing south.       Both bit the nigger and they
was both bad." My father and uncles grew up steeped in accountings like
          this one.

          For 250 years African-Americans were deprived of freedom, basic
education and the right to accumulate wealth, which they could have
          passed on to their descendants.

          This history would have left a wound in any case. But the wound
is open and running because the country refused to atone materially
          when it had the chance. In that sense, at least, my Uncle Mack
is right about the apology.

         No amount of talk can alter the past.
