TEXT:
I used our farmer budget OMB paragraph but changed it: 1.  to say we
"strongly support" the current negotiations for farmer money instead of we
are "monitoring" it and 2. said we looked forward to working with
everyone, including Members of Congress, as this process continues.

Q.   What steps is the Administration considering to protect farmers from
the negative impact of an increase in tobacco taxes?

A.   The Administration remains committed to protecting tobacco farmers
and their communities, and strongly supports on-going efforts by state,
farmer, and industry representatives to provide resources and purchase
commitments to tobacco farmers.  Farmers who never marketed cigarettes to
children and worked hard to sell a legal crop should be protected. The
Administration looks forward to working with all parties as this process
continues, including Members of Congress, to ensure the financial
well-being of tobacco farmers, their families, and their communities.
