    Elena,

        Remember I drafted that memo from Bruce to Frank Raines, and you
edited it. Then, in early August, Tom and I met with you and Bruce in
one of our issues meetings. We asked about Bruce signing the memo for the
executive order and sending it to Frank. Bruce indicated that the memo
would be better off coming from Maria.

        In any event, the executive order is drafted, and Justice has
already preliminarily signed off on it.   Let's talk further about this
when you come back from vacation. By the way, hope you have (or had) a
fabulous time!

                                               Mary
