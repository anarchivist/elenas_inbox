Jeff:
At today's VP message planning meeting we concluded that the budget issues
that surround the Civil Aviation Safety POD cannot be worked out in time
for a Dec. 18 or Dec. 19 POTUS event/radio address. As you indicate in
the attached, we still would like to get that done by Feb. I am not sure
what kind of a radio address we would have without that, but we (you)
should talk to Tom Freedman and team about your idea to see if they think
it would work for POTUS.
Alternatively, we would like to propose for the radio address the issue
Mary has been working on: "sharing the data in the' black box" proposed
safety rule. Since this idea contains REGO partnerships, a way for the
President to challenge other airlines to get on board, etc. we think it
has possibilities for the President's address.  Can you and Tom and Mary
and Jean talk about this and determine what recommendation we want to make
to DPC so they can take the issue through the President's decision making
process?

subject:         Aviation PDD--follow up

Morley -- I spoke with Jim Kohlenberger in Davide Beier's office this
morning on aviation PDD and the possible dilemma with proposed cut in
NASA's aero budget.  I think they are sympathetic to doing the PDD but may
see more value in rolling it out with the budget in February. Jim told me
that he was going to have David call you to discuss.  I think we can still
construct an aviation message for the POTUS on 12/18 that makes sense and,
in a way, tees up the PDD for a rollout in February.
