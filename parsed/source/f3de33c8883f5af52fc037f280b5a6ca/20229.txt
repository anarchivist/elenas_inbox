         Subject:         Gramm Language -- Slight Revision

         Here is a slight revision on the Gramm language to make it clearer that
         the two offsets are reductions from the gross amounts.




         Amendment to S. 1415 to Reduce Net Revenues for
         Marriage Penalty Tax Expenditure

         Amend Sec. 401 (c )   (2) defining net revenues in the Tobacco Trust Fund as
         follows:

           (c)  Net Revenues.   For purposes of subsection (b), the term "net
         revenues"  means the amount estimated by the Secretary of the Treasury
         based on the excess of

          (1) the amounts received in the Treasury under subsection (b), over

          (2) amounts reflecting

         (i) the decrease in the taxes imposed by chapter 1 and chapter 52 of the
         Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and other offsets, resulting from the
         amounts received under subsection (b). and


         (ii) the decrease in the taxes imposed by chapter 1 of the
 Internal Revenue Code of 1986 resulting from the provisions of Title [XX]
