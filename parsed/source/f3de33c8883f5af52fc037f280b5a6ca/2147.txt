FROM:      OMB LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS

DATE:      MAY 7, 1997

SUBJECT:           LEGISLATIVE REPORT


Administrator Sally Katzen will testify tomorrow before the Senate
Committee on Rules and Administration, in support of Government Printing
Office Reform.

CONGRESS TODAY (5/7):

SENATE


The Senate continued consideration of S. 672, the Bosnia/Disaster
Assistance Supplemental.
        [SAP sent, 5/7: O&Based on the Senate Committee bill, which included
        the automatic    continuing resolution, the President had
indicated       that he would veto it because it         includes
strongly objectionable           extraneous provisions.OS]

Late Wednesday evening, Senator Byrd offered an amendment to strike the
McCain-Hutchison automatic continuing resolution provision from the bill.
The Senate did not vote on the amendment. Senator McCain then amended his
provision, by unanimous consent, to increase the FY1998 funding level to
100% of the FY 1997 enacted level (up from 98%). Senator Byrd did not
object to McCainO,s motion, and, in exchange, Senator McCain did not move
table the Byrd amendment.  Thus, debate on ByrdO,s amendment to strike the
now 100% automatic continuing resolution provision from the bill will
continue on Thursday.

Also today, the Senate also took the following action
o       Invoked cloture on the bill by a vote of 100 to   o.
o       Adopted (89-11) DO,Amato (R-NY) amendment to remove Social
Service Block Grant     funds from the bill, intended to assist legal
immigrants when certain benefits expire in      August and to insert an
extension of the SSI benefits through September 30, 1997. As
        expected, the JOBS rescission offsets the cost.

o       Tabled (51-29) Bumpers (D-AR) amendment to remove a provision
that would prohibit     Interior from implementing policy guidelines
on RS 2477 related to rights-of-way for         States building highways
on public land.

o       Adopted (UC) Hollings amendment to prohibit the use of any funds
made available in any   Appropriations Act for FY97 made available
by the Commerce Dept to make irreversible       plans for the use of
sampling in taking the 2000 decenial census.

o       Adopted (UC) Byrd amendment, offered by Stevens, to expand
eligibility for rail freight    assistance not only to the Northern
Plain States, but to any state affected by flooding.

o       Adopted (UC) Feingold/Hutchison, which prohibited use of funds in
the Act for supporting troops in Bosnia after June 30, 1998.  It should be
noted, however,         that there      are no funds in the Act that
were intended to be used after June     30, 1998.

HOUSE
Suspended the Rules and passed (399-16) H.Res. 93 - Regarding the BLS and
adjustments to the CPl. The House considered the bill in TuesdayO,s
session under suspension of the rule, and ordered but postponed the vote.
