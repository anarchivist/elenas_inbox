TEXT:
Michael Deich suggests a $60 million maximum package.
 'That buys a good EEOC package of:
" New performance goal (cases averaging 6 months, requires 114 new FTE's);
  "The $10 million new technology piece;
" A commitment to doing 10% of all cases by ADR.

 It gets a good fair housing package from HUD ($10 million new targeted,
audit based enforcement) .

 There is no recommendation for the Department of Education in the package
as OMB wants to wait and review it in context with the rest of education.
ED OCR has requested increased resources including more staff and a more
collaborative approach with schools that will rely on improved technical
assistance.

For DOL the package includes a 10% increase in the number of compliance
reviews conducted (OFCCP started a tiered compliance review system in FY
1998 by which they target serious cases).

HHS OCR is basically maintained, sparing it from the average 4% reduction
in other HHS discretionary activities. The funding includes a triaging
front-loaded program to focus more resources on outreach and technical
assitance

Michael says it leaves another up to $10 million of new money to play
with. Among the options: a beefed up emphasis on compliance and mediation
by education and hhs.  Some money to improve DOJ's role as coordinator
which many groups mentioned to us.
