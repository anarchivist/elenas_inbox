                                           May 10,1999

The Honorable C.W. Bill Young
Chairman
Committee on Appropriations
U.S. House of Representatives
Washington, D.C. 20515

Dear Mr. Chairman:

         As you prepare for conference, the purpose of this letter is to provide the
Administration's views on H.R. 1141, the FY 1999 Emergency Supplemental Appropriations
Act, as passed by the House and by the Senate and on H.R. 1664, the FY 1999 Kosovo and
Southwest Asia Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act, as passed by the House. This
letter supplements the views provided in the Administration's letter to the conferees of April
26 th regarding H.R. 1141 and our May 6th Statement of Administration Policy on H.R. 1664.

        As indicated in these earlier letters, there are a number of very troubling issues in this
conference and the President's Senior Advisors would continue to recommend that he veto this
legislation unless the objectionable provisions are resolved in a satisfactory manner. As the
conferees develop a final version of this important legislation, your consideration of the
Administration's views would be appreciated.

        During February, the President submitted several requests to Congress for emergency
assistance and other critical programs. The Central American emergency relief package remains
urgent and should be approved without offsets. Every day we delay means another day the
people of Central America lose hope in their ability to rebuild their homes, earn their livelihood,
and achieve a prosperous future in their homeland. Also of critical importance is our request
for emergency agJ;icultural relief to our farmers, which also should be approved without offsets.
In addition, the FY 1999 supplemental request for $100 million in assistance for Jordan is critical
to stabilizing the Jordanian economy, ensuring a smooth transition ofleadership and promoting
the goal of peace in the Middle East that we all share. The Administration has consistently
urged the Congress to avoid confrontation by acting quickly to enact these requests without
extraneous riders and spending.
                                                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion

        On April 19th , the President requested $6.05 billion for the Department of Defense, the
Department of State, and other international programs to provide the funds necessary to cover the
costs of the military and humanitarian operations related to the crisis in Kosovo. Also included
were funding requests to cover costs associated with ongoing, enhanced operations in Southwest
Asia. The Administration's package: protects the military readiness of those forces in the
Balkan theater and all other U.S. forces; ensures that our military has the full measure of
resources necessary to carry out the Kosovo air campaign; and, funds the U.S. commitment to
provide humanitarian relief now and respond to potential future refugee assistance needs.

        While the House Republican leadership chose to fund the Kosovo supplemental bill as an
emergency, regrettably, the House-passed bill, which totals over $13 billion, goes well beyond
the funding requirements of the mission in Kosoyo and the need to maintain current readiness.
It includes funding of over $1 billion for military construction projects, most of which may not
begin construction for several years and many of which are not even included in the
Department's long-range plan. The bill includes significant increases for operation and
maintenance programs that have been budgeted for in the FY 2000 Budget and that should be
considered during the FY 2000 appropriations process, not in an emergency supplemental bill.
With regard to Kosovo funding, we continue to believe that the Administration's request is the
appropriate level of funding, and we continue to urge the conferees to reduce the level contained
in the House-passed bill.

         With regard to H.R. 1141, regrettably, the House and Senate Republican leadership chose
to insist on offsets for the humanitarian relief for the victims of Hurricane Mitch in Central
America and for the agricultural relief for America's farmers. On what basis this decision was
made is not clear. The emergency requests made by the President were based on the same
authority used by President Bush for Desert Shield/Storm and for the victims of Hurricane
Andrew and by President Clinton for the victims of the Northridge Earthquake, the Midwest
Floods and agricultural relief provided to our farmers.

        In addition, the Senate chose to include a number of strongly objectionable and
extraneous riders related to the environment, tobacco and the rights of Native America Indians.
An emergency spending bill should not be used to enact objectionable environmental riders such
as the provisions contained in this bill that reopen a balanced agreement on protecting the natural
resources and wilderness values for the Glacier Bay National Park, a provision delaying the oil
valuation rule and a provision delaying hard rock mining regulations. Nor should such a bill be
used to enact a provision that would allow States to keep $246 billion in tobacco settlement
funds without any commitment to use these funds to stop youth smoking or for other public
health initiatives. Similarly, this bill should not be used to direct the Department of Interior not
to approve any new, non-State, approved Indian gaming compacts or to overturn the
Department's plan for reorganizing the Office of Special Trustee for American Indians. The
attached position statements detail these concerns.

                                                                              Hex-Oump Conversion
        Despite months of allied diplomatic efforts to achieve a balanced peace plan in the
Balkans, the government ofSlobodan Milosevic defied the international community and pursued
a course of repression and terror against the people ofKosovo. We determined that we could
not allow these actions to go unchallenged. Now, we have a responsibility to our country and to
the men and women serving our country in the Balkans and to address the humanitarian crisis
provoked by the Milosevic government. Now is not the time to slow progress on our emergency
supplemental request by adding funding unrelated to the mission or to maintaining current
readiness or by adding extraneous provisions. We strongly support efforts to reduce the amount
of unrequested, non-emergency defense funding and the elimination of objectionable offsets and
riders.

       We ask the Congress to act quickly upon these requests and send a clear message to
Milosevic - his actions will not be tolerated and we are prepared to back our words with action.
We must also move forward now to provide agricultural assistance to our farmers and to reach
out with a helping hand to the victims of Hurricane Mitch.

       Let us work together.



                                             Sincerely,
