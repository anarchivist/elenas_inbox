DRAFT STATEMENT ON THE NINTH CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS DECISION TO
FORCE ADDITIONAL SALES OF OLD GROWTH TIMBER
        I am deeply disappointed in the court's decision to force us
to release these sales of healthy ancient timber.
        I strongly believe that this expansion of ancient timber
sales was not authorized by the rescission legislation. Our
understanding of the amount of volume to be released was
significantly different from the interpretation upheld this week


by the courts.
        I will pursue a legislative remedy to overturn this
decision.
        At this time, we have no choice but to comply with the
court's decision.  The court's decision forces us to release
timber that may lead to grave environmental injury to chinook
salmon and other wildlife, and damage our rivers and streams.
This could jeopardize the livelihoods of tens of thousands of
people who depend on the Pacific Northwest's vibrant commercial
and sport fisheries.
        I will ask each national forest supervisor to meet with the
companies awarded contracts to seek mutually agreeable changes to
mitigate any harm to salmon and other species and water quality.
        I have begun a consultation with the Secretaries of the
Interior and Agriculture as well as the professionals in the
Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management, the Governors
of the affected states, and local elected representatives to see
what options we may have to preserve forest and fishing jobs in
the Pacific Northwest while also protecting the environment.
        In signing the 1995 Rescission Act and in subsequent
directives to my cabinet, I pledged to uphold existing
environmental laws and standards except when forced to do
otherwise. We will continue to do that and challenge those who
interpret differently the language in that law.
