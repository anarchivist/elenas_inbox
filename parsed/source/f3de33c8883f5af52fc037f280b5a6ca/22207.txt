TEXT:
 He still wants to remove "remains committed to protecting tobacco farmers
and their communities" and to keep in "to fulfill national commitments" in
the Medicaid chapter. he feels strongest about the second, says he worked
the language out with Jack but is willing to consider alternative
suggestions.  I told him no way, we want our edits.  He is going to call
me again when he returns to the building (he was calling from a loud
restaurant which made conversation difficult) .

On farmers, he thinks we're making a mistake giving people a sound bite
that they quote and follow by saying we did nothing in the budget for them.

On Medicaid recoupment, I think he's totally wrong, but what about
proposing back
"work with the states and the Congress to enact tobacco legislation that,
among other things, resolves these federal claims in exchange for a
commitment by the states to use tobacco money to fulfill national
commitments to support national and state priorities including for efforts
to reduce youth smoking, public health and childrenD,s programs, and
affected rural communies"




Protect farmers and farming communities. The Administration remains
committed to protecting tobacco farmers and their communities, and is
monitoring closely on-going efforts by state, farmer, and industry
representatives to provide funding and purchase commitments to tobacco
farmers.  The Administration will looks forward to working with all parties
, as needed, to ensure the financial well-being of tobacco farmers, their
families, and their communities. Farmers never marketed cigarettes to
children; they should be protected.


Since US taxpayers paid a substantial portion of the Medicaid costs that
were the basis for much of the state settlement with the tobacco


companies, Federal law requires that the Federal government recoup its
share.  However, the Administration will again support legislation to
waive direct Federal recoupment, if states agree to use a portion of funds
from the settlement for programs currently financed by Federal taxpayers.
is open to will working with the states and the Congress to enact tobacco
legislation that, among other things, resolves these federal claims in
exchange for a commitment by the states to use tobacco money to fulfill
national commitments for efforts to reduce youth smoking, public health
and childrenO,s programs, and affected rural communities.
