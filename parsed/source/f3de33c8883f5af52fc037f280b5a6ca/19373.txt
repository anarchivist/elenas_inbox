TEXT:
Education and PIR will have senior officals speaking at university
campuses this week (Riley/Reno speaking on Wed) as part of PIR's weeklong
dialog on race.

Both ED and PIR provided factual input in putting this q&a together and
have asked whether we have a final copy that they can use for senior staff
that get asked about this issue.  This q&a (attached) was never finalized
(eclipsed by other news of the day) -- do you want to review it?

                    DECLINING MINORITY ADMISSIONS IN CALIFORNIA           'P Conversion y, em

                                              April 6, 1998

Background: According to figures released by the University of California, minority admissions to most
            University of California institutions have dropped dramatically this year absent affIrmative
            action. For example, at the Berkeley campus, minority admissions have decreased 57% for
            black students, 40% for Hispanic students, and 39% for American Indian students from last
            year's rates. At UCLA, minority admissions have decreased 43% for black students, 33%
            for Hispanic students, and 43% for American Indian students.

Question:      How do you respond to reports that minority admissions to California's universities have
               dropped dramatically?

Answer:       The Administration is extremely concerned about the decline in the numbers of
              African-American, Hispanic, and Native American students admitted to universities in
              California as a result of Proposition 209 and the University of California Board of Regents'
              decision to prohibit the use of properly constructed affIrmative action in admissions.
              Educational opportunity is the touchstone of the American dream and the key to America's
              continued strength in the 21st century. At a time when our nation is becoming more and
              more diverse, we must not close the doors of educational opportunity to our students of
              color. Furthermore, because students learn from each other as well as from their
              professors, diversity on campus is a vital educational resource that strengthens the
              educational experience for all our students. For these reasons, every American should be
              concerned about the developments in California.

Question:      How do you respond to those who say that the drops in minority admissions only indicate
               the extent to which race was being used to admit underqualified minority students?

Answer:       I strongly disagree with that analysis. On April I, the Washington Post reported that the
              University of California at Berkeley had to reject more than 800 minority applicants who
              had 4.0 high school grade point averages and SAT scores of 1200 or higher. These
              minority students are exceptionally qualified for any college or university in the country.
              Furthermore, we as a nation must realize that diversity and excellence go hand in hand; they
              are fully compatible and indeed complementary goals. Any educator will tell you that
              students learn from each other as well in their classes and from their professors-- that's why
              diversity is important.

Question:     What is the administration doing to address this problem?

Answer:       We are working on several fronts to address this issue:

       ·      We will continue to strongly support properly constructed affIrmative action programs in
              higher education. For example, we will continue to intervene in litigation in support of
              appropriate affIrmative action programs and to challenge the Hopwood decision.

       ·      We will continue to press higher education offIcials to maintain and expand diversity, and
              we will offer assistance to them to do so. For example, we have called on colleges and
              universities burdened by new legal restrictions to develop new and creative approaches to


                                                    1
                                                          Hex-Dump Conversion
            achieving diversity, such as aggressively recruiting in secondary schools with high
            percentages of minority students and forming educational partnerships with such schools.

       ·    Finally, the President has recently announced a dramatic array of education policy actions
            that will improve educational opportunity and outcomes for all Americans and thereby
            strengthen the pipeline of students progressing from K-12 education to college. These
            initiatives include:

                   High Hopes --a $140 million investment in the FY 1999 budget -- that promotes
                   partnerships between colleges and middle/junior high schools in low-income
                   communities. These partnerships will provide students with vital support services
                   -- including tutoring, counseling, and mentoring and with information on college
                   options, academic requirements, costs, and financial aid to help students stay on
                   track through high school graduation and college.

                   Education Opportunity Zones -- This proposal will devote $1.5 billion over 5
                   years to help high poverty urban and rural school districts help their students reach
                   high standards, by proving resources to strengthen accountability, better train
                   teachers and principals, and provide students who need it with extra help through
                   after school and summer school programs.

                   Small Class with Qualified Teachers -- In order to provide all students with a solid
                   foundation and improve reading in grades 1-3, the Administration is proposing a
                   $12.4 billion initiative over 7 years to help local schools hire 100,000 teachers to
                   provide students with small classes and well-prepared teachers.

                   Teacher Preparation and Recruitment -- President Clinton has proposed a $350
                   million initiative to attract nearly 35,000 outstanding new teachers into high-poverty
                   schools in urban and rural areas over the next five years. In addition, it will
                   upgrade the quality of teacher preparation at institutions of higher education that
                   work in partnership with local schools in inner city and poor rural areas.

                   Hispanic Education Action Plan -- The Administration's FY99 budget provides
                   substantial education investments in programs that are targeted to the needs of
                   Hispanic students, including increases in Bilingual Education, funding for Hispanic
                   Serving Institutions, TRIO college preparation programs and migrant education
                   programs.

Question:          Is the Office for Civil Rights at the Department of Education investigating
                   admissions policies at higher education institutions?

Answer:            The Office for Civil Rights at the Department of Education has received complaints
                   regarding university admissions policies. They will continue to investigate
                   complaints concerning current admissions policies at institutions of higher education
                   to determine if they violate federal civil rights laws by discriminating against
                   minority students. The existence of an investigation does not necessarily indicate
                   that a violation has occurred.
