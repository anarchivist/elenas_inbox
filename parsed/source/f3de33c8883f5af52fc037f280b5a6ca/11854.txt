                   President Clinton: Deterring and Reducing Gun Crime
                                      March 20, 1999

In his weekly radio address, President Clinton will direct the Secretary of the Treasury and
Attorney General to develop a national strategy to increase gun prosecutions and further reduce
gun violence. The strategy will also call for: expanded efforts to identify illegal gun markets and
gun "hot spots"; improved coordination with state and local law enforcement; closer supervision
of gun criminals on parole or probation; and innovative, community-based efforts. The
President will also release a new Justice Department report highlighting 60 promising strategies
that have helped reduce gun violence throughout the country.

Prosecuting More Gun Criminals

To continue to reduce gun crime and violence, President Clinton will direct the Secretary ofthe
Treasury and Attorney General -- working with U.S. Attorneys, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms (ATF), and all of state and local law enforcement -- to develop a comprehensive
national strategy to investigate and prosecute more gun criminals.

       Project Exile. The President will call for the expansion of programs like Project
       Exile in Richmond, VA. Under Project Exile, the Richmond U.S. Attorney --
       working closely with other state, local and federal law enforcement authorities --
       targeted gun-carrying felons and other armed criminals for immediate federal
       prosecution and stiff mandatory sentences in federal prison. As of last November, Project
       Exile had achieved the following results: 372 persons were indicted for federal gun
       violations; 440 guns were seized; 300 persons were arrested or held in state custody; 222
       arrestees (or about 75 percent) were held without bond; 247 persons were convicted; and
       196 persons were sentenced to an average of 55 months imprisonment And gun-related
       homicides have dropped by more than 40 percent last year.

       ''An illegaJ gun will get you 5 years in federal prison. » As part of Project Exile, law
       enforcement authorities also reached out to the community and launched an extensive
       media campaign to get a simple message across to Richmond's gun criminals: "An illegal
       gun will get you 5 years in federal prison." This message was advertised on 15
       billboards throughout the city, a fully painted city bus (that changes routes daily and
       covers the entire city each week), and a series of radio and television promotional spots.
       Criminals in Richmond routinely testify that they did not carry a firearm because of their
       knowledge of the stiff federal penalties.

       Boston Gun Project. The Boston Gun Project, is another example of enhance firearms
       prosecutions. After tracing all guns recovered at crime scenes to their source, the Boston
       Police Department and ATF work together to disrupt illegal gun markets by investigating
       illegal gun trafficking and referring cases for swift prosecution by both federal and state
       prosecutors. As a result ofthese and other youth violence prevention efforts, youth
       homicides in Boston have dropped 75 percent since 1995.

Building on the Success of Local Strategies

Although crimes committed with fireanns are down by 27 percent nationally, gun-related crime
and violence remain serious problems. To help all communities benefit from the many
successful strategies already in place throughout the country, the President's directive also calls
for the Treasury and Justice Departments -- in developing their national strategy -- to specifically
consider the follow elements:

       -- comprehensive crime gun tracing, analysis and mapping; increased us of ballistics
       identification technology; and coordinated use of crime gun information to identify illegal
       gun markets, gun "hot spots" and illegal gun traffickers;

       -- coordinated law enforcement and regulatory enforcement efforts to ensure compliance
       with all applicable laws by federally-licensed dealers and prospective gun sellers and
       purchasers;

       -- targeted deterrence of violent offenders through improved coordination of with
       probation and parole officials supervising such offenders and swift and certain
       punishment of for those found to have violated the conditions of their parole or probation;
       and

       -- problem-solving analysis and innovative strategies to work closely with the community
       members to identify gun criminals, remove weapons in the hands of juveniles, search for
       and seize crime guns, and increase the public's knowledge of their community's
       gun-related crime and violence problem.

The President will release a new Justice Department report -- Promising Strategies to Reduce
Gun Violence. Designed as a "toolbox" for communities, the report details 60 successful
strategies to reduce gun violence that were reviewed and recommended by more than 40
national experts. The report will be distributed to communities throughout the country next
week.

New Resources for Firearms Enforcement

The President's FY 2000 budget includes new resources to help implement the national strategy
called for today. In particular, his budget includes:

       $5 million for more than 40 additional federal prosecutors to conduct intensive fireanns
       prosecution projects targeting violent felons who possess guns, anned drug traffickers,
       and illegal gun markets;

       $23.8 million for more than 120 new ATF agents to support fireanns investigations,
       arrest violent criminals and gun traffickers, and crack down on illegal gun sales; and
                    Hex-Dump Conversion

$1.3 billion for a 21 st Century Policing Initiative to help communities hire more police
and prosecutors, and to allow them to target gun crime and other public safety priorities.
