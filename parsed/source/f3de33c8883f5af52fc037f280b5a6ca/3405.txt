TEXT:
The President's FY 1998 Budget presumed the $3 billion program would be
administered by DOL, and included as "proposed for later transmittal" a
DOL Salaries and Expenses discretionary appropriation of $6.2 million, for
75 FTE and related expenses.

"Later transmittal" proposals go up to Congress as budget amendments when
the substantive program (in this case welfare to work) is enacted, or
about to be, and are usually timed so as to be on the record when the
appropriations subcommittees mark up their bills for the year, lest they
not be considered due to lack of timely transmittal.

The LjHHSjED appropriations subcommittee markups are both next week.  The
$6.2 million for DOL is going up today or in the next day or so, as part
of a larger package of budget amendments.  It is being treated as a
routine transmittal, no fanfare.

I wouldn't raise it in any of the Hill meetings we are having with
authorizers, it could be distracting, but I wanted to be sure you folk all
were aware of it.
