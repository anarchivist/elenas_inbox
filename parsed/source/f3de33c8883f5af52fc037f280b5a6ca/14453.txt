TEXT:
Martha Foley asked me to put together a message meeting to discuss
releasing the
President's report on international family planning. The meeting is
scheduled
for Thursday, Jan. 16 from 2:30-3:30 in room 211 OEOB.


The President is due to submit his report to Congress no later than Feb. 1
and a
vote on the report is likely to occur shortly thereafter. The report and
the
vote are expected to be controversial. In addition, the VP is scheduled
to
speak to NARAL on Jan. 22 (the Roe v. Wade and Mexico City policy
anniversary)
and he will likely have to field questions about the report and the
upcoming
vote, so we need to be clear on message as soon as possible.

We need to discuss the following questions:

1)      Actual report release date (we have discussed Jan. 30)
2)      Message
3)      Release strategy (remarks, press release or what?)

A draft of the report will be distributed to you this evening.

State and USAID are making final edits to the report and are clearing it
through
Secretary designate Albright and others. The final report will be
available
Tuesday, Jan. 21.
