TEXT:
I caught up with Ed Lorenzen/Stenholm on a number of issues today.

He says the Ways and Means mark WILL include Texas language, a generic
blanket statement like "notwithstanding any other provision of law, states
may contract out eligibility systems ... "

I guess we'll see when we get the Ways and Means language tomorrow.
