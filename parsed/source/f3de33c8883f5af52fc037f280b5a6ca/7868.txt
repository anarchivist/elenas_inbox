DRAFT MEMORANDUM FOR EOP PRINCIPAL'S MEETING

FROM:          EOP Policy Working Group on Poverty Measurement

SUBJECT:       Advice to the Bureau of the Census

                                        BACKGROUND

In 1992, the Bureau of the Census commissioned the National Research Council of the National
Academy of Sciences (NAS) to establish a panel of experts to recommend improvements in the
measurement of poverty. The final NAS report was issued in 1995. Census has announced that
IT IS planning to release a report in late 1998 or early 1999 providing alternative poverty
measures, based on the NAS recommendations. Nearthe end of 1997 the Department of
Commerce approached OMB and indicated its willingness to receive any advice that OMB or
other WH policy offices might have regarding policy-related issues that the Bureau of the Census
will face in determining which alternative poverty measures to present. As a result of that
request, an EOP Policy Working Group on Poverty Measurement (composed ofCEA, DPC,
NEC, and OMB) was established to review key policy-related questions. The Deputy Assistant
Secretary for Human Services Policy in HHS also attended these meetings because of her
expertise on programs. This memorandum presents a set of options discussed by that group on
topics where the NAS poverty measurement recommendations have major policy ramifications.
(Note that a broader interagency Technical Working Group on Poverty Measurement is also
meeting to consult with Census on statistical issues relating to alternative poverty measures.) It
is important to note that we are merely being asked to give advice to the Bureau of the Census;
what they actually publish is their decision.

The official measure of poverty has remained virtually unchanged for 35 years, despite
substantial changes in family behavior and government policy. For instance, the NAS panel
identified several weaknesses in the current poverty measure:

·      The current poverty measure takes no account of changes in government policy, such as
       changes in tax laws (i.e., the expansion of the EITC) or changes in in-kind benefits (i.e.,
       Food Stamps).

·      The current measure does not distinguish between the needs of working and non-working
       families. In particular, it does not reflect the cost of child care and other work expenses
       for working low-income families.

                                                       Preliminary Draft -- CLOSE HOLD. page 2


·      The current measure takes no account of medical care costs which vary substantially
       across families.

Note that the discussion to date only concerns the alternative measures that Census will publish.
The Statistical Policy Office in OIRA officially issues the regulation that determines what the
"official" poverty measurement methodology will be, while the Office of the ASPE in HHS
officially determines the "guidelines", which are a simplified form of poverty thresholds used by
some programs in the determination of eligibility. The last item for discussion is the process to
explore the possibility of adopting an improved alternative poverty definition as the new
"official" definition and utilizing it in program eligibility decisions. Attachment 1 (from HHS)
provides a brief review of how program eligibility is (or isn't) tied to poverty line measurement.

The Current Poverty Measure

The methodology by which current poverty thresholds are determined was developed in the early
1960s by Mollie Orshansky, a staff economist at the Social Security Administration. She
developed a set of poverty thresholds that vary with the number of adults, the number of children,
and the age of the family head. These thresholds represent the cost of a minimum diet
multiplied by 3 to allow for non-food expenditures. The multiplier of3 was chosen because the
average family in 1955 spent one-third of its after-tax income on food. Since the late 1960s, the
thresholds have simply been updated annually to adjust for price inflation.

The NAS Recommendations

In order to understand the NAS panel's recommended revisions, one must understand the basics
of determining poverty. A family is considered poor when their resources fall below a
predetermined poverty line or threshold. Therefore, one must develop a methodology for
estimating family resources and for defining the threshold resource level below which a family is
considered poor.

1.     Defining J;amily Resources

For purposes of the current poverty calculation, the definition of family resources is cash income.
 The NAS recommendations would estimate family resources as:

Family resources              Cash income + Near-money in-kind benefits - Taxes - Child care
                              costs - Work expenses - Child support payments - Out of pocket
                              medical care expenditures (including health insurance premiums)

The rationale for subtracting taxes, work and medical expenses from family resources is that
these expenditures are typically not discretionary and reduce the income available to a family for
economic survival.
                                        Hex-Dump Conversion
                                                       Preliminary Draft -- CLOSE HOLD. Page 3

There is near consensus among researchers that adjusting for near-money in-kind benefits
(primarily food stamps and housing subsidies) and taxes would be an improvement in how
poverty is measured. There is slightly less agreement on whether child care costs, work
expenses, and child support payments should also be deducted because an unknown proportion
of these expenses are likely discretionary. (The NAS proposes to cap the amount of child care
and work expenses that can be subtracted to deal with this problem.) As discussed below, the
adjustment for out-of-pocket medical care expenditures is more controversial.

2.     Defining a Poverty Threshold

A threshold must be determined against which to compare a family's resources. The NAS panel
 recommends basing the threshold on a fraction of expenditures on necessities (food, shelter, and
clothing) plus a little more. Specifically, the NAS panel recommends selecting the 30th to 35th
percentile in the distribution of annual expenditures on food; shelter, and clothing among
families offour (two adults and two children), and then multiplying this expenditure level by
between 1.15 and 1.25. Thresholds for other family sizes and types would be determined by an
equivalency scale calculation.

The NAS recommends adjusting these thresholds to take into account geographic variation in
cost ofliving, based on differences in housing costs by region and by city-size. It recommends
adjusting them over time by recalculating them from expenditure data on an annual basis.


                                OPTIONS FOR DISCUSSION

L Recommendations regarding which alternatives the Bureau of the Census should adopt
to determine the level of the poverty threshold.

The NAS panel acknowledges that the actual level at which the poverty threshold is set (and
hence the final poverty rate) is inherently arbitrary and cannot be determined on the basis of
purely statistical judgements. There are two primary options:

A. The NAS alternative. As described above, the NAS panel recommends establishing a
threshold based on the 30th-35th percentile in the distribution of annual expenditures for a family
of four, with a small multiplier to account for additional small personal expenditures. As
shown in Tables 1 and 2, column 3, this would raise the 1996 poverty rate from 13.7% to 18%,
and increase poverty among all subgroups.

B. Benchmarking. The NAS also provides poverty estimates that benchmark the alternative
poverty rate to equal the old poverty rate in a given year. The Census has done a number of such
benchmarked calculations for 1996, as shown in Tables I and 2, column 2. (The report issued
early next year would benchmark to 1997.) Benchmarking would assure that the aggregate
poverty rate is identical for the official and the alternative measure in the benchmark year. But
                                       Hex-Dump Conversion

                                                       Preliminary Draft -- CLOSE HOLD. Page 4

the distribution of poverty among subgroups within each measure would differ (see Table 2).
Similarly, both historical and future trends would differ. For instance, the alternative measure is
identical in 1996 but higher in 1991. (The faster fall is largely due to the decline in the EITC.)

Pros of using the NAS measure:
·      Incorporates the recommendations of the NAS panel, based on their judgement from the
       best available evidence.

·      Maintains threshold levels that are quite similar to the current thresholds (although they
       have a very different interpretation.)

Cons of using the NAS Measure:
·     Results in a substantially higher poverty rate (although the trends over time are similar.)

·      Changes the relative poverty share of different groups.

Pros of Benchmarking:
·      May provide an easier transition to the new methodology because there will not be a
       change in the overall level of poverty.

·      Focuses the arguments on the relative distribution of who is poor rather than how many
       people are poor. Proposed changes in the relative well-being of different groups may be
       more defensible than proposed changes in the levels of poverty.

Cons of Benchmarking:
·     Violates the NAS recommendation that the threshold should be based on the 30th-35th
      percentile in the expenditure distribution. In order to benchmark, the threshold falls to
      (about) the 25th percentile of expenditures on food, shelter, and clothing.


2. Recommendations regarding updating the thresholds over time

Currently the poverty threshold is updated annually using the CPI. This, however, does not
allow for adjustments that reflect changes in underlying consumption patterns that might affect
the revised thresholds. For instance, food prices have decreased relative to other goods over
time, while housing prices have increased. There are two options:

(A) Recalculate the thresholds annually as a share of consumption on food, shelter, and clothing.
(This is recommended by the NAS panel.)

(B) Update the thresholds on a year-to-year basis using a price index (preferably one based only
on food, shelter and clothing). Implement a regular process (every 5-10 years) of reviewing the
poverty measure and recalculating the thresholds.

                                                      Preliminary Draft -- CLOSE HOLD. Page 5

NOTE: The deputies recommend Option (8).

Pros of Re-calculating the Thresholds:
·      Regular recalculation will allow the poverty thresholds to more accurately reflect changes
       in consumption patterns and standards ofliving.

·      Without an expectation that the thresholds will be re-calculated regularly, it may be hard
       to update them at all.

Pros of Updating Using the CPJ:
·      Using the NAS methodology, the poverty thresholds are somewhat relative (i.e., they are
       affected by changes in the distribution of household expenditures.) As a result, they are
       a moving target and do not provide an absolute standard of need. A CPI adjustment
       would make it easier to compare poverty from year to year against a constant standard.
·      Because consumption patterns and standards of living change slowly, it may be better to
       take them into account periodically rather than annually.

·      If updated with a CPI for necessities only (food, clothing, and shelter), this may capture
       most of the relevant changes and will make it easier in the short-run to understand the
       updating procedure.

·      The data may not be good enough for an annual re-calculation of the thresholds.


3. Recommendation as to whether thresholds should be adjusted for geographic variation.

The NAS panel recommended adjusting the poverty thresholds for cost-of-living differences
across regions and by city size. Census proposes to make such adjustments based on housing
cost differences (which have much greater regional/city size variation than food or clothing.)

NOTE: The Deputies recommend against geographic price adjustments.

Pros ofAdjusting for Geographic Variation in Cost ofLiving:
·      Most statisticians and economists agree that such adjustments should be made if data are
       available.

Cons ofAdjusting for Geographic Variation in Cost ofLiving:
·     There is no one "right" way to make such adjustments and legislators could try to
      intervene on exactly how the "correct" regional price adjustments are done.

·      The data available to make such adjustments are limited and may not be entirely reliable.

·      Implementing such an adjustment in the poverty line threshold could lead to pressure to
                                         Hex-Dump Conversion

                                                      Preliminary Draft -- CLOSE HOLD. Page 6

       provide regional cost adjustments in a wide vanety of other government programs, from
       Social Security benefits to tax payments.


 4. Recommendation regarding how to account for medical care expenditures.

Since the mid-1970s, analysts have been concerned that the official poverty rate overstates the
extent of poverty among beneficiaries of Medicare, Medicaid, and private health insurance. At
the same time, the official poverty rate may understate the extent of poverty among populations
with large medical expenditures. Most analysts agree that, in principle, medical care "needs"
should be incorporated into the calculations of the threshold and family resources (i.e., families
with higher medical needs should have higher thresholds; those with more generous medical
benefits should have higher income; and those who must spend more to achieve "good health"
should have those expenses subtracted from their resources). However we cannot observe a
family'S medical need. In addition, it is not clear that one can simply impute the cash value of
insurance benefits and add this to income. The "extra" benefits received from insurance to cover
expensive medical services do not provide income that can be used for any other purpose.

To understand the difficulties, consider including medical benefits into the income calculations.
Adding medical benefits to income, without also adjusting the poverty threshold, has the perverse
effect of making sicker individuals appear better off. Other proposals to adjust the poverty
threshold (without also adjusting income), run into similar problems.

In the end, the NAS panel recommended subtracting all medical out-of-pocket (MOOP)
expenses (including health insurance premiums) from income, without trying to value health
insurance as a part of income or medicaJ need as a part of the thresholds. Hence, family
resources are measured net ofMOOP. Those individuals with good insurance will have few
out- of-pocket expenses; those without insurance who face health problems will have lower
measured incomes as they pay more for medical care. (The NAS panel also recommends a
"medical care risk" index be developed, separate from an index of economic need, to measure
how well an individual is protected against medical problems.)

This adjustment accounts for the larger poverty rates using the NAS methodology. For example,
in 1996 the poverty rate was 13.7% using the current methodology; it would have been 18%
using the NAS methodology, but only 13.2% using the NAS methodology minus the medical
expenses adjustment. This adjustment has its largest impact on poverty rates for the elderly and
would have the effect of substantially narrowing the poverty gap between children and the
elderly. This adjustment is one of the most controversial of the NAS recommendations.

There is general agreement that ignoring medical care and medical expenses entirely is not a
good idea, particularly given the rapid increase in medical costs in the past 30 years and the
extent of uninsurance among the low-income population. Ignoring this issue -- particularly
given this Administration's concern with it -- is not a credible option. There are two other
                                      Hex-Dump Conversion

                                                     Preliminary Draft -- CLOSE HOLD. Page 7

alternatives
(A) Follow the NAS recommendations and subtract MOOP from family resources. This makes
families without health insurance who face medical expenses less well-off than other families.
(Note, there is still an open discussion as to whether MOOP should be subtracted from family
resources or added to the thresholds. Either way, it will make little difference in aggregate.
This is clearly a technical decision best left to the Census.)

(8) Try to impute the value of health insurance to income, so those with insurance have higher
resources. Health insurance should then also be imputed into the thresholds.

NOTE: The Deputies recommend option A

Pros ofAdjusting for MOOP:
·      While not perfect, under the NAS recommended adjustment families with higher medical
       expenditures will be "poorer." The NAS recommended adjustment would also be
       sensitive to changes in health care financing that would increase disposable income and
       thereby reduce poverty.

·      If we do not adjust for medical care (in some way) now, it may be much harder to do so in
       a few years when we will have better data (because the change will be so dramatic it will
       be viewed as another big methodology change).

Cons ofAdjustingfor MOOP:
·     The data that are currently available are out-of-date, (but we should have updated
      information available in a more timely fashion within another year.)

·      The NAS recommended approach relies on the controversial assumption that all medical
       care expenditures are nondiscretionary. (This concern could be mitigated to some extent
       by imposing a cap on the amount of medical expenses.)

Pros ofImputing the Value ofHealth Insurance into Resources and Thresholds:
·      Provides a more complete accounting of all medical resources available to a family.

Cons ofImputing the Value of Health Insurance into Resources and Thresholds:
·     There is no accepted "correct" way to do this. The data here are probably more
      unreliable than the data needed to impute the value ofMOOP to families.

·      Many analysts agree with the NAS panel that the value of health insurance is quite
       different than (say) the value offood stamps, which are far more fungible. Mixing in
       health insurance coverage with economic need causes serious interpretational and
       conceptual problems to a measure of economic need.

·      To date, Census has been following the NAS recommendations. Ifwe asked them to
                                         Hex-Dump Conversion

                                                     Preliminary Draft -- CLOSE HOLD. Page 8

       switch to this approach, it might require substantial additional work and seriously delay
       their report.


5. Recommendations regarding which alternatives Census should publish and/or how
they should be presented.

The current plan is to publish a small number (maybe 3) alternatives. For instance, the Census
could publish a 1997-benchmarked poverty rate and a NAS-alternative poverty rate, providing
two alternatives. Or it could publish a 1997-benchmarked poverty rate including all of the NAS
recommendations, and then publish the same thing without MOOP, or without geographical price
variation. (There will be extensive appendices in this report that will report a wide variety of
different poverty calculations, to demonstrate the statistical properties of the poverty
measurement recommended by NAS.)

·      Will it be confusing to publish multiple (even a small number) of alternatives, as opposed
       to only one alternative? How will this affect how the report is received? How should
       these be presented?

·      What problems will it create to have multiple alternatives if at some future point we
       want to redefine the official poverty rate to one of these improved alternative measures?


6. Process from here

Among the options to be considered as we move forward from here:

·      Hold a joint DPC-NEC Principal's meeting to brief the broad group of interagency
       principals about this process and it's potential implications.

·      An interagency working group should start discussing the implications of alternative
       poverty measures on program eligibility.

·      Is there some preparation we should be sure happens on the Hill or among advocacy
       groups to prepare people for the upcoming poverty report?

  Use of the Federal Poverty Guidelines in Determining Program Eligibility and Benefits

The Federal poverty guidelines are a simplified version of the official poverty line thresholds
which are used for program purposes. They are issued by HHS annually, and are based on the
previous year's thresholds.

As Gordon Fisher, the analyst at HHS who oversees the production of the guidelines, notes in a
recent paper:

       A number of people believe that the poverty guidelines affect many big entitlement
       programs. That belief is an exaggeration of the actual situation. Most of the Federal
       programs using the guidelines are medium-sized or small, with only a few big programs.
       Moreover, most...are discretionary programs ... Only a few programs using the guidelines
       are mandatory: Medicaid, the Food Stamp Program, and child nutrition programs (mainly
       the National School Lunch Program.)l

As Fisher notes, spending under discretionary programs, which are appropriated each year, would
not be affected by any change in the guidelines, even if that change affected eligibility for the
program. If eligibility for these programs expands, the appropriated funds are able to serve a
smaller proportion of the eligible population, but total spending does not change. (Most of these
programs already serve only a small fraction of those estimated to be eligible.) Only the three
big mandatory programs Fisher mentions above would have spending changes associated with a
change in the guidelines.

Even within these three programs, the impact of changes in the poverty guidelines is less than
might be expected. In Medicaid, for example, most recipients qualify for coverage because of
their participation in other means-tested programs such as T ANF and SSI--programs that do not
use the poverty line in their eligibility criteria. The major group whose coverage does depend on
the guidelines is children in families below 133% of the poverty line who are not current or
recent T ANF recipients. In all, people whose eligibility for Medicaid is somehow related to the
poverty line are estimated to account for about 20 percent of Medicaid recipients. Since most
are in families with incomes well below the specified level, only a small fraction would actually
be affected by a poverty line change.

Impacts in the Food Stamp Program and the National School Lunch Program would probably be
even smaller. The poverty guidelines are used in the Food Stamp Program to set gross income
eligibility--only families with gross incomes below 130% of the poverty line are eligible for food

stamps. Actual food stamp benefits are calculated based on net income, however--income after
deductions for work expenses and other items. Net income is compared to a specific benefit
allotment, determined nationally for each family size, and that benefit is reduced by 30 cents for
every dollar of net income the family receives. In practice, the benefit allotment would reach
zero for almost all families long before an income of 130 percent of poverty was reached. Thus,
the gross income eligibility cut-offfor food stamps is more theoretical than real--families at or
near 130% of the poverty line will almost always be eligible only for zero benefits.

The National School Lunch Program has two cut-offs related to the poverty guidelines: Families
with incomes below 130% of poverty are eligible for free lunches, and those below 185% are
eligible for reduced-price lunches. Unlike the Food Stamp and Medicaid Programs, however,
the school lunch program does not collect and verify detailed information on recipients' family
incomes. Instead, families are asked at the beginning of each school year (or when their child
enters a new school) to fill out a form certifying that their incomes are below the specified level.
Because this process is relatively informal, it seems unlikely that small changes in the level of the
income cut-off would have big impacts on the number of children applying for and receiving free
and reduced-price school lunches. In any case, total spending on the school lunch program--a
significant proportion of which is not means-tested--is much smaller than spending on Medicaid
and food stamps. In 1996 Federal spending on the school lunch program was $5.4 billion,
compared to $25.4 billion for food stamps and almost $92 billion for the Federal share of
Medicaid.
