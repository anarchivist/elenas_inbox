Elena, welcome back. This is probably one of 8,000 e-mails that you have to
read. When you have a moment, could you and I please talk about some issues
that Walter Dellinger has highlighted and suggested we think about in the event
that there is another possible shutdown in December? I understand that this is
more or less in your bailiwick (is this right?) and can fill you in on what's on
Walter's mind. Many thanks.   KW
