     One America Conversation with Commission on White House Fellowships. On
     January 21, Sylvia Mathews and I led a One America Conversation with your
     Commission on White House Fellowships. The group consisted of present and former
     White House Fellows. During the discussion, two potential promising practices were
     identified. The participants pledged to continue the dialogue on race in their
     communities.

ADVISORY BOARD ACTIVITIES

     Northern California Advisory Board Meeting. We will be visiting the San
     Francisco/Oakland/San Jose metropolitan area on February 10- 11. We plan to visit
     promising practices sites in the area and hold a community forum in San Jose. The
     Advisory Board meeting will occur on the second day in San Jose focusing on the topic of
     race and poverty. We have invited William Julius Wilson from Harvard University,
     Douglas Massey from the University of Pennsylvania and others to participate in a panel
     discussion on the relationship between racial segregation, poverty and the persistent lack
     of opportunities for those who live in poor, concentrated neighborhoods.

     Advisory Board Members Activities for Martin Luther King, Jr. Day. Chairman
     Dr. John Hope Franklin and I joined the Vice President in Atlanta for the King Center
     Program. The program was very well received. Linda Chavez-Thompson visited the

     Cook gave the keynote address at a multi-racial, multi-ethnic silent prayer march on
     Sunday, January 18th at the New York Metropolitan Martin Luther King Center for

program in South Central, Los Angeles. The dialogue on race occurred with about 35
youths ranging in age from 15 to 25.

OFFICE OF THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR

    OUTREACH

    Corporate Leaders. The next Corporate Forum will be on Friday, January 30, at the
    Biltmore Hotel in Los Angeles. Secretary of Commerce William Daley will host the
    discussion and Advisory Board members Angela Oh and Robert Thomas will attend.
    This is the third in a series of meetings with corporate leaders.

    Campus/Community Week of Dialogue. The Campus/Community Week of Dialogue,
    in which we are partnering with the Association of American Colleges & Universities and
    the National Urban League, is scheduled for the week of April 6. The week will both
    involve thousands of students and others in dialogue about racial issues and recruit higher
    education and community leaders to promote study and dialogue on racial issues in the
    longer term. Minority-serving institutions and community colleges will be asked to be
    involved, as well. We met with dozens of higher education leaders at the Association of
    American Colleges & Universities' annual conference to discuss the National Week of
    Campus/Community Dialogue.

    RESEARCH AND POLICY PLANNING

    Promising Practices. We have now posted a total of 50 examples of promising
    practices on the Website. These examples represent many sectors (business, education,
    media, and others) in various communities around the country. We expect to highlight
    an additional 30 practices by the end of this month.

    Essays. We are working with the Domestic Policy Council and the Department of
    Education to produce at least two papers regarding the value of diversity in higher
    education.

    K-12 School Case Studies. In November, the Advisory Board highlighted a case study
    of a Fairfax, Virginia elementary school's race-related programs and activities. We are
    working with the Department of Education to develop plans for additional case studies
    (i.e., more in-depth summaries of promising practices) of programs that are bridging
    racial disparities in education. This project was announced by Secretary Riley during the
    December Advisory Board meeting.

    COMMUNICATIONS

    Public Service Announcement (PSA). The Initiative is working with the Leadership
    Conference Education Fund, the Ad Council and an advertising agency to finalize a


                                             3
    radio campaign. The advertising agency has submitted ideas for print ads of the PSA
    that would appear in newspapers around the country, particularly focusing on college and
    university press. In addition, scripts for the radio campaign have been submitted.
    Distribution of the PSA should occur in early February to public service directors at
    television and radio stations.

    C-SP AN's" Alexis de Tocqueville" series. The series producer has expressed interest
    in producing a special program on the work of the Advisory Board to appear in March or
    April. We are currently reviewing the schedules of some of the Advisory Board
    members for the months of February and March, for inclusion in this special. (The
    Program is a nine-month series that C-SPAN started in May 1997 to retrace the
    steps of de Tocqueville's trip to America and to explore what it means to be an
    American.)

    Article for the League of Women Voters. An article focused on the goals of the
    Initiative will appear in the March/April edition of The National Voter, the magazine
    produced by the League of Women Voters. That issue will focus specifically on
    diversity and will feature several prominent writers.

FEDERAL AGENCY ACTIVITIES

    One America Conversations. More than 117 One America Conversations have
    occurred. The reports we have received to date on these Conversations show that we
    have reached over 800 people in more than 34 cities around the country. We estimate
    that we have reached close to 2,500 individuals.

    Department of Treasury

    HBCV Funding. Since 1996, Treasury has worked with the Department of Education
    on a construction financing program for HBCUs. During the week of January 12, the
    Federal Financing Bank disbursed $99,000 to West Virginia State College to pay for
    dorm construction and renovation as part of the HBCU program. The Designated
    Bonding Authority (a private entity that works with the Department of Education to
    promote the program) will be sending solicitations to all eligible institutions describing
    the availability of the capital financing and the current low interest rates.
