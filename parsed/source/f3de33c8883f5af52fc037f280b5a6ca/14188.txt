TEXT:
Attached is a relatively short letter that could be signed by
Bruce and Carol Monday to the NGA, NCSL, and APWA answering the
three major questions laid on the table at our previous meeting
with them.
As you know, HHS did not agree to modify the plan guidance to
incorporate these issues for distribution on Monday. They had
mentioned that Shalala might call Panetta, but she has not yet.
This letter will allow us to have our policy in writing so there
is no confusion either within the administration or in the
translation by the groups to the states who need the information.
Please send me your comments on the letter as soon as possible.
Thanks.
