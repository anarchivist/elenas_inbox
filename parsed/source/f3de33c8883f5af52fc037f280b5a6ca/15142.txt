TEXT:
I got a call from Shay Bilchik saying DOJ has come up with $700,000 in
current DOJ funds to expand their training for community police officers
in child develpment to more sites and expand the training to others such
as teachers.  This will bring total funding to $1 million. They expect to
send paper over tomorrow on it.

So HHS Secretary Reno seems to be coming through.
