TEXT:
Elena,

By "testing" I did mean the practice of sending in paired testers (each of
a different racial or ethnic background, but matched as to other qualities
and qualifications) to determine whether they receive equivalent treatment
from the prospective employer. The hearing tomorrow is being held by the
Employer-Employee relations subcommittee of the House Committee on
Economic and Educational Opportunities. The chair of this subcommittee is
Harris Fawell (R-Illinois). According to Ellen, Gingrich is to testify
first, and then Igasaki (Acting EEOC Chair) and others will sit as a group
and make opening statements and respond to questions.  The others on the
Igasaki panel will include two former EEOC Chairs (both Republicans) and
someone who the Acting Chair knows from Chicago (Ellen was unsure who this
was) .

Julie
