I think that's a great idea. Maybe they could work it out with Eli's
group.

Subject:         DLC Welfare Conference

I just spoke with Margie Waller (my newly hired replacement at PPI) and
she asked whether we are still interested in holding a joint welfare to
work conference with the DLC. According to her, Al is still very keen on
the idea.  I think it would be a great opportunity to highlight best
practices, especially the use of intermediaries. What do you think? Have
you and Al talked about this recently?
