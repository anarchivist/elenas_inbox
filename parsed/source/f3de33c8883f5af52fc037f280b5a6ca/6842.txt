                                             March 27, 1998
                                                                        Automated Records Management System

    Hon. Nita Lowey
    United States House of Representatives
    Washington, DC

    Dear Nita:

           Although my trip to Africa precludes me from joining you, I want to state once more
    my strong support for the historic journey you are on: a journey to make our streets safe,
    our drivers sober, and our laws more sensible.

            Your proposal to establish a nationwide crackdown on drunk driving by setting a
    uniform limit for impaired driving at .08 blood alcohol content (BAC) truly is an idea
    whose time has come. At a time when crime all across America is going down, we still lose
    an American to drunk driving every 30 minutes -- every half hour a family is shattered, a
    child, a parent, a neighbor, is lost forever.

           By setting a strong but sensible limit on blood alcohol content, we could save as
    many as 600 lives a year. And a uniform drunk driving standard will still allow adults to
    drink responsibly and moderately -- since your .08 BAC standard is not reached until a
    170-pound man has had more than four drinks in an hour, and three for a typical woman.

            This should by no means be a partisan issue. Indeed, your bipartisan work with
    Benjamin Gillman, as well as the partnership between Frank Lautenberg and Mike Dewine
    in the Senate, proves that when leaders from both parties come together, we can set aside
    political differences to save lives and serve America. It is my fervent hope that the
    majority of your colleagues in the House will join the large bipartisan majority in the
    Senate, and send me legislation to put the brakes on drunk driving. .

                                             Sincerely,
 ,                                                                        Page 1 of 11
