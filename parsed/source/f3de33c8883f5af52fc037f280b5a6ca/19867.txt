TEXT:
Rahm/Bruce/Elena/Cynthia:

We can pull a group of open/supportive law enforcement groups, mostly
management types, on Monday afternoon. However, we'11 need to nail down a
few things as soon as we can tomorrow. These include:

1. Availability of Senior Administration Officials. Most importantly, we
need to be able to get the right Administration officials in the room to
talk to law enforcement.  I understand this should include -- Kelly and/or
McGaw, Bruce, Elena and/or Rahm, and maybe someone from McCain's office.
I can work w/Beth Weaver of Treasury to get their participation, but I'll
need the tobacco wing of DPC to secure the right mix of WH folks and/or
McCain's staff.

2.  Briefing materials. We need a page or two of bullets that address the
major arguments raised by some of the law enforcement folks.  Also, do we
have any smuggling/enforcement "fixes" that we're considering and want to
float.

3.  Desired outcome. While I've sold the meeting as purely informational
and "starting a dialogue w/law enforcement," a couple of the groups have
indicated that -- providing theY're satisfied with our position on
enforcement issues -- they're willing to publicly support tobacco passage
as something that is good for law enforcement on balance. Do we want to
push for supportive statements or simply stop these groups from joining
the others?


The groups that I have spoken with, and which are generally supportive,
include:  National Sheriffs Association, International Association of
Chiefs of Police, Major Cities Chiefs, and Police Executive Research
Forum. We could also invite the remaining currently non-aligned groups:
International Brotherhood of Police Officers, National Troopers Coalition,
Black Law Enforcement Executives, and Police Foundation.

Of course this doesn't obviate the need to meet the withe four groups that
wrote the bad letters that are out there -- National Association of Police
Organizations, Fraternal Order of Police, Federal Law Enforcement Officers
Association and International Union of Police Associations -- but we can
do these later in the week. NAPO's head will be out of town until
Wednesday, Christa says the FOP refuses to meet with us ... period.

Let's talk about at tomorrow's meeting.

Jose'
