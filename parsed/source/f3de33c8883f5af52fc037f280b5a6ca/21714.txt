TEXT:
We realized that we don't have a comprehensive list of all federal
programs for which Tribes are eligible to receive funds.  As the result of
a meeting that Maria and Lynn held, we thought we should ask all the
agencies to list their funding programs and indicate whether tribes are
eligible.  I thought I would send out the request to all the agencies.
Let me know if you have any problems with this.  Otherwise I plan on
having Cabinet Affairs send out the request in their call tomorrow
morning.  Thanks, Mary
