TEXT:
Ken shared with me your draft language on the HHS waiver issue.  I
wouldn't fomulate it quite that way, I'd suggest something along the
following lines:

The Administration believes that waivers should not exempt people from
work requirements and time limits.  We hope that States (and the
Congress?) will share this view, but if it becomes apparent that is not
the case, the Administration will seek legislation to clarify the issue.
