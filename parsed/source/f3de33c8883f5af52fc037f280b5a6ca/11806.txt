TEXT:
As I indicated on my message schedule update email yesterday, there was
interest in doing something with the Nursing Home bill.    I wanted to
make you aware of the current situation with the bill.

Originally people talked about maybe using this for next week's radio
address.   However there are many complications with this. Next week's
radio address will be taped on the road in Las Vegas, and Leg. Affairs is
looking to do something here with Members and press. Also, we have now
received the bill, and deadline for signing is next Monday (March 29) .
The only days POTUS is here before then are next Tuesday, Wednesday, and
the morning of Thursday, all of which currently have message events
scheduled.   If we want to do something with this bill, I think our only
options are to try to push for a secondary event on Tuesday or Wednesday
(which may be difficult considering the number of other secondary events
already scheduled on those days), or push for this being the message event
on Thursday morning (which would bump Consumer Financial Right to Know
again) .

I generally wanted to just give you an update on this, but let me know if
there's something more you would like me to find out/explore.  Thanks.
