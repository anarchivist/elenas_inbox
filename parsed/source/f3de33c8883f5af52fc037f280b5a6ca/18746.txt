MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:          GENE SPERLING, BRUCE REED

RE:           ADMINISTRATION POLICY ON SKILLED TEMPORARY FOREIGN
              WORKERS

We are providing you with this infonnational memo on the "HI-B visa" issue because the New
York Times recently ran a story on the basis of a leaked internal Administration options memo,
and because this is an important topic to Silicon Valley companies. During your trip to
California later this week, you will be interacting with high-tech CEOs and may get asked about
this. A suggested Q&A is attached.

Current U.S. law pennits 65,000 HI-B visas each year for skilled (BA or equivalent) temporary
foreign workers. The computer and health care industries are the primary users of the H 1-B
program. The annual 65,000 visa cap was met for the first time in FY 1997. This year, we
expect to reach the limit in Mayor June -- several months before the end of the current fiscal
year. Accordingly, the cap is likely to become a legislative issue in this session of Congress.

The infonnation technology (IT) industry, along with Senator Abraham, Representative Zoe
Lofgren, and other members of Congress, support either the removal of or a significant increase
in the HI-B cap. Unions, other worker organizations, Senator Kennedy, Congressman Dingell,
and other members of Congress are likely to oppose any increase.

A DPCINEC working group with representatives from Labor, Commerce, State, and INS has
started to meet to develop Administration policy on:

1.     Steps we can take to work with industry and institutions of higher education to address
       the shortage of workers with IT skills;

2.     Refonns of the Hl~B program (e.g., a prohibition against laying off U.S. workers to
       replace them with foreign workers); and

3.     Whether or not to increase the HI-B cap from its current level of65,000.
                                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion

We have tentatively decided that in addressing shortages of workers within the IT industry, we
should focus on increased training, education and recruitment of American workers -- not on an
increase in the cap for temporary foreign workers_ We intend to initiate a partnership with the
IT industry to make this happen. We have, in at least one similar context, used such a
partnership to effectively address perceived labor shortages. We successfully addressed
concerns about the shortage of shipbuilder workers in Louisiana by bringing together industry,
labor, and state and local elected officials. Through this partnership, it was ultimately
determined that the temporary shortage that existed within this industry was 1,000 workers,
rather than the 10,000 originally claimed.

The interagency group is willing to consider, if necessary, an increase in the HI-B cap as part of
an overall package that includes industry commitments to training, education and recruitment and
reform of the HI-B visa program. However, we do not recommend starting our discussion with
the cap increase on the table. Moreover, any increase in the H I-B cap (even a 20,000 to 35,000
increase) is not likely to address either the short or long term problem of IT worker shortages,
given the projected growth in demand for workers with IT skills.

Our next step is to meet with high-tech industry executives to develop an "action plan" that
builds on a series of announcements that the Departments of Commerce, Education and Labor
made at a January 1998 conference in Berkeley, California.

Q. Mr. President, will your Administration grant more visas to high-skilled foreign
workers who are in demand by high-tech industries?

We have made no decision on this issue. In reviewing our options, my Administration's first
priority will be to ensure that American workers have the skills they need to fill these jobs, and
that they have priority over any foreign workers with similar training. The growing demand for
workers with high-tech skills shows how critical my agenda for life-long learning is -- HOPE
scholarships to open the doors of college, tax credits for employer investment in life-long
learning, and making sure that all of our children are technologically literate.
