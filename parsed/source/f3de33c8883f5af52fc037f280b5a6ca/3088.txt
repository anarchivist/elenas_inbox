TEXT:
A few things that might be useful for your morning meeting:


1) Child Support Enforcement.   We are nearly prepared to release child
support data Tuesday if it fits with the communication strategy (Ann Lewis
said they'd discuss it at the morning meeting).   Attached is a draft
letter from the President to Congress which we could release.   There's an
HHS-DOJ-Treasury joint press release being finalized.   Because the
juvenile justice markup isn't until Thursday at the earliest and may be
post-poned until after the recess, we don't have to do this today.

2) Update on welfare to work.  Ron Haskins called to give me and Bruce a
secret update on his negotiations with GOP House Ed and Workforce
committee on welfare to work.  Bruce said he'd started to tell you about
this, but was interrupted, so I should bring you up to speed.

        The worst thing, which we squaked about, would be to distribute
90% of funds by formula, which gives less to large cities (Ways and Means
was 50 competitive/50 formula).

        FLSA was similar to earlier reports: States could count only cash
and food stamps for wages (not Medicaid, housing, or child care);  if cash
and food stamps isn't enough, can count job search and education as "work"
to make up the difference; as in the 1988 Family Support Act, welfare
recipients, the FLSA doesn't apply, but some specific protections do.  The
update Bruce got tonight is that House Democrats are still fighting to
keep the "prevailing wage" language and to prevent the exemptions from
applying to nonprofits as well as public sector jobs.

        Other issues: Lower MOE (from 80% to 75% to qualify for new
welfare to work money); additional power for governors who determine the
PIC is not cooperating with the TANF agency (can redistribute funds from
that PIC); only 70% of funds would have to be spent on long-termers,
instead of 90%.

3) FYI: Here are copies of the final Senate letter and the proposed House
Rules letter.

The Honorable Gerald R. Solomon
Chairman
Committee on Rules
US House of Representatives
Washington, D.C. 20515

Dear Mr. Chairman:

        As you consider this year's budget reconciliation bill, I am writing to transmit the views
of the Administration on the Budget Committee reported legislation on the spending provisions.
The Administration's views on the tax provisions of the legislation will be transmitted separately.

        Many provisions of the reported bill are consistent with the Bipartisan Budget
Agreement. In particular we are pleased that the House has continued in the intent of the
Bipartisan Agreement to consider two separate reconciliation bills, the first for spending and the
second for taxes. However, there are certain key areas where the legislation is not consistent
with the Agreement. We understand there are ongoing efforts -- in accordance with the Budget
Agreement -- to resolve a number of issues through an amendment at the Rules Committee. The
Administration intends to continue working closely with the Leadership on remedial
amendments.

        Key areas where the bill is inconsistent with the Budget Agreement include: failure to
fully restore Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and Medicaid benefits for legal immigrants;
assisting low-income Medicare beneficiaries in paying premiums; providing Medicaid benefits
for disabled children; implementing important Medicaid investments; properly implementing the
home health reallocation; creating additional work slots for individuals subject to the Food
Stamp time limits; fully providing for savings from spectrum auctions; and ensuring that a
substantial share of Welfare-to-Work funds go to cities/counties with large poverty populations.

        The Bipartisan Budget Agreement is good for America, its people, and its future, and we
are fully committed to working with Congress to see all of its provisions enacted into law by the
August recess.

Items Contrary to the Bipartisan Budget Agreement

        Assistance tor Low-Income Medicare Beneficiaries --[This may he dropped if it is
"fIXed"} Recognizing that premiums represent a significant burden on low-income
beneficiaries, the Budget Agreement allocated $1.5 billion to ease the premium impact of the
home health reallocation on this population. The reported bill falls short of this, including only
$.5 billion for this purpose. .Given that the Ways and Means Committee spent $800 million to
forgive the Part A enrollment penalty for certain state and local workers who would not
otherwise qualify for Medicare, it is not a questions of adequate resources. Additionally the
approach in the bill is too administratively complex for the value of the benefit provided.

                                                              Automated Records Management System
                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion
his June 20 letter to Budget Committee Chairman Kasich and Ranking Member Spratt that he
will be unable to sign legislation that does not include the agreement's policy protecting disabled
immigrant. The Budget Agreement explicitly states: "Restore SSI and Medicaid eligibility for
all disabled legal immigrants who are or become disabled and who enter the U.S. prior to August
23,1996." The reported bill fails to reflect the Agreement. As a result, in 2002 it would
protect 75,000 fewer immigrants than called for in the Budget Agreement.

        Medicaid Benefits fOr Disabled Children -- [This too may be addressed at the Rules
Committee] The Budget Agreement clearly includes the proposal to restore Medicaid for current
disabled children losing SSI ·because of the new, more strict definition of childhood eligibility.
The reported bill failed to include this proposal. We strongly urge the House to include this
provision and retain Medicaid benefits for approximately 30,000 children who could lose their
health care coverage in FY 1998.

        Medicaid Investments -- After extended negotiations that preceded the Bipartisan Budget
agreement, the Administration and the Congressional leadership agreed to specified savings and
investments in the Medicaid program over 5 years. Specifically, the Agreement calls for a
higher Federal matching payment for the Medicaid program in the District of Columbia and
adjustments for the Medicaid programs in Puerto Rico and the territories. The reported bill fails
to include these provisions.

        Home Health Reallocation -- The home health reallocation in the Budget Agreement is
not properly reflected in the reported bill. During the negotiations, we discussed at great length
the shift of home health expenditures to Part B, and it was always understood to be immediate.
The Ways and Means Committee's phase-in of the shift means a loss oftwo years of solvency on
the Part A trust fund, two years which we can ill afford to lose. We urge the House to
incorporate the provision included in the Commerce Committee reported title.

        Create Additional Work Slots for individuals subject to the Food Stamp time limits -- The
Bipartisan Budget Agreement includes $1.5 billion in additional funding for the Food Stamp
Program to increase support for work and provide States with flexibility to exempt individuals
from the Food Stamp time limits due to hardship. While we appreciate that the reported bill
implements the 15 percent hardship exemption consistent with the Agreement, the bill's
approach for employment and training (E&T) funds for able-bodied childless adults aged 18-50
falls short of creating the maximum level of work slots. The Agreement specifically states that
existing Food Stamp E&T funds will be redirected and new capped mandatory funding added "to
create additional work slots for individuals subject to the time limits." The Agreement provides
$1 billion for this purpose. The approach in the bill would create more than 100,000 less work
slots than the Administration's legislative proposal and approximately 60,000 less than the
approach taken by the Senate bill. Specifically, the bill lacks performance standards and
accountability to ensure that the new Federal funding creates additional work slots that do not
meet the welfare reform statute's tough work requirements for Food Stamp recipients,
particularly by allowing 100 percent of the money to be spent on job search activities.
policies described in the Balanced Budget Agreement. It is our understanding that current
attempts to redraft the bill still fall over $8 billion short of target levels. The reported bill does
not include two of the proposals included in the Budget Agreement, the auction of "vanity" toll
free telephone numbers and the spectrum penalty fee. The bill does not include reimbursement
authority for Federal users that are required to relocate to new spectrum bands. Reimbursement
of Federal agencies, such as the Department of Defense, is critical in order to avoid demands for
increased discretionary spending (which could total several billion dollars) under the agreed upon
discretionary spending caps. Additionally, the bill does not provide a firm date for the
termination of analog broadcasting, thus causing significant savings reductions.

        Additional concerns include the lack of authority for the FCC: to retain a portion of
auction receipts to cover the expense of administering auctions which would require additional
discretionary appropriations to cover these costs; to use economic mechanisms other than
auctions where appropriate, ( i.e., user fees to create incentives for efficient spectrum
management) and to revoke and reauction licenses when an entity declares bankruptcy, which is
essential to preserving licenses awarded in previous auctions. The reported bill also includes an
expansive definition of public safety that would create loopholes permitting far too many entities
to be exempted from auctions and language that would protect spectrum for use by specific
Federal users, which is contrary to the Administration's policy to manage spectrum across the
Federal government through a process managed by the National Telecommunications and
Information Administration. The Administration also has concerns with the non-germane
language that eliminates the Duopoly and Newspaper Broadcast Cross-Ownership Rules. The
reported bill language could short-change our Nation's long-standing commitment to fostering a
diverse marketplace of ideas and ignores potential telecommunications policy and revenue gains
that may be achieved if the FCC were to repack this spectrum for alternative uses.

        Targeting Weltare to Work funding to citieslcounties with large poverty populations --
The Administration strongly believes that a substantial amount of all Welfare-to-Work funds
should be managed by cities and other local areas. The welfare-to-work structure crafted by the
Ways and Means Committee accomplishes this goal through its division of funds between
formula (50 percent) and competitive (50 percent) grants; its formula grant sub-States allocation
factors and method of administration; and its reservation of 65% of competitive grants for cities.
The Education and Workforce Committee would reduce the competitive funding share from 50
percent to 5 percent, thus severely restricting the amount for which cities can apply directly.
The Ways and Means accurately reflects the Agreement.


Additional Concerns

       Although the Budget Agreement did not specifically address the following items, the
Administration has significant concerns about them. The Administration urges the House to
address these concerns at the Rules Committee.
        Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs) -- While we have agreed to work with you to develop
a demonstration of this concept for the Medicare population, we have concerns about the size and
scale of the demonstration in the reported bill. The reported bill provides for a demonstration
with 500,000 participants, costing $2 billion, which is many times larger than any other Medicare
demonstration. Moreover, the demonstration exposes beneficiaries to any additional charges
providers choose to levy without limitation. We strongly believe that the current law limits on
balance billing should be applied to this demonstration. We commend the Senate Finance
Committee for limiting this demonstration to 100,000 participants, but still prefer a
demonstration limited geographically for a trial period.

        Medical Malpractice -- We believe that the malpractice provisions in the reported bill are
extraneous to the Bipartisan Budget Agreement. As you know, the Administration opposed the
malpractice provisions in the vetoed Balanced Budget bill, as well as those adopted in the House
version of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPM). We find these
provisions highly objectionable, and we oppose them.

        Preventive Benefits -- While the preventive benefits in the reported bill are largely the
same as those advanced in the President's Budget, we bring to your attention the failure to waive
coinsurance for mammograms. As you know, mammography saves lives, yet many Medicare
beneficiaries fail to use this benefit. Research has found that copayments hinder women from
fully taking advantage of this benefit. Thus, we continue to support waiving copayments for
mammograms.

        Medical Education/Disproportionate Share (DSH) Carve-out -- The Administration's
budget would move the medical education (indirect and direct) and DSH adjustments out of
managed care payment rates and redirect these funds to eligible hospitals that provide services to
Medicare managed care enrollees. This is an important proposal designed to ensure that the
nation's teaching hospitals and those that serve low-income populations receive the Medicare
payments to which they are entitled. We urge the House to include the Ways and Means
proposal.

        MedicarePlus -- The bill permits beneficiaries to be locked into a MedicarePlus plan for
as long as 9 months, after a lengthy transition period. We continue to support the monthly
disenrollment option as an important safety valve for managed care enrollees who are dissatisfied
with their managed care plan. Moreover, we would support the ability of these enrollees to opt
to purchase any Medigap plan of their choice upon disenrollment.

       We have expressed concerns to the Subcommittee about balance billing limits in
MedicarePlus plans and anticipate a resolution of this issue such that MedicarePlus beneficiaries
maintain their current law managed care protections against excessive cost-sharing (including
those prohibiting balance billing).

       Prudent Purchasing -- We are pleased that the House included our proposal to expand the
"Centers of Excellence" program and a limited demonstration of a durable medical equipment
the prudent purchasing proposals. The Medicare program is governed by a strict set of provider
payment rules that have the effect of limiting the ability of the Federal government to secure the
most competitive terms available to other payers in the marketplace. We have advanced a set of
proposals to allow Medicare, the nation's largest health insurer, to also take advantage oflower
rates providers offer to other payers.

        Medicare Commission -- The reported bill would establish a Medicare commission.
Establishing a bipartisan process that is mutually agreeable is essential to successfully address
the challenges facing Medicare. We look forward to working with you on the development of
the best possible bipartisan process to address the long-term financing challenges facing
Medicare while simultaneously ensuring the sound restructuring of the program to provide
high-quality care for our nation's senior citizens.

        Hospital Outpatient Department COPD) Coinsurance Waiver -- While we support the
policy in the reported bill that allows hospitals to reduce coinsurance for beneficiaries without
being charged with a kickback violation, we would urge the House to include language barring
such hospitals from charging the Medicare program for bad debt for such waived coinsurance.
We suggest that hospitals make an election with the Secretary where they choose on an
across-the-broad basis for all beneficiaries to waive coinsurance and consequently do not bill
Medicare for the waived coinsurance. Such a policy will permit proper monitoring on bad debt.


Medicaid

        Disproportionate Share Hospitals -- We have concerns about the allocation ofthe
disproportionate share hospital (DSH) payment reductions among States included in the reported
bill. Although we agree that there have been abuses of this program in the past, taking such
large reductions in certain states whose Medicaid programs are particularly dependent on DSH
spending will likely affect their ability to cover services. We urge the House to revisit the FY
1998 President's Budget proposal, which ensures that the States with the highest DSH spending
are not bearing most of the impact ~fthe savings policy.

        We are very concerned that the reported bill does not include any retargeting ofDSH
funds. As the Administration has stated previously, we believe that significant savings from
DSH payments should be linked to an appropriate targeting mechanism. It is for this reason that
we support proposals that assure the targeting of some DSH funds to hospitals that serve a high
proportion of low-income and uninsured patients.


Children's Health

       We believe that the $16 billion Children's Health investment should be used for health
insurance coverage. The Administration does not support the direct services option in the
reported bill. We are concerned that a State could spend all of its money on one benefit or to
meaningful coverage.

        We are also concerned that the reported bill may not be the most cost-effective manner
possible to expand coverage to children, as required by the Agreement. The reported bill
includes both a Medicaid and a grant option; however, the incentives in the reported bill could
discourage States from choosing the Medicaid option. We believe that Medicaid is a
cost-effective approach to covering low-income children, and would like to work with you on
strengthening this option. We also believe that the grant program should be designed to be as
efficient as possible. The provision that allows States to use funds for "other methods specified
under the plan" with no details on what this means implies that States may use funds for
purposes other than the intent of the Agreement (e.g., to offset States' share of Medicaid). We
oppose this. We are encouraged that the Senate reported bill includes notable improvements.
Specifically, we commend the decision not to allow use of the $16 billion investment in areas
other than insurance coverage and the improved definition of benefits relative to the House
Commerce Committee provisions.

       As the Administration has stated many times, we do not support limiting access to
medically necessary benefits, including abortion services. We would like to work with the
Congress to resolve this issue.

Minimum Wage and Workfare

        [Reportedly this has been dropped} The Administration strongly opposes the reported
bills' proposal on the minimum wage and welfare work requirements. The proposal is not part
of the Budget Agreement and, had it been raised during negotiations, we would have strongly
opposed it. Second, the proposal would undermine the fundamental goals of welfare reform.
The Administration believes strongly that everyone who can work must work, and those who
work should earn the minimum wage --whether they are coming off welfare or not .. The
proposal does not meet this test. .[Negotiations continue on the FLSA protections} In addition,
under this proposal, working welfare recipients will be deprived of the protection of laws
addressing employment discrimination, unsafe workplaces, child labor, overtime, and family and
medical leave.


Welfare-to- Work

        We are pleased that the reported bill includes provisions that would address priorities,
including: the provision offormula grant funds to States based on poverty, unemployment, and
adult welfare recipients; a sub-state allocation of the formula grant to ensure targeting on areas
of greatest need; appropriate flexibility for grantees to use the funds for a broad array of activities
that offer promise of resulting in permanent placement in unsubsidized jobs; funds awarded on a
competitive basis; and a substantial set-aside for evaluation. We look forward to working with
the Congress to refine these provisions.
-- The Administration strongly opposes the repeal of the maintenance-of-effort requirement
because it would let States significantly cut, or even eliminate, benefits to nearly 2.8 million poor
elderly, disabled, and blind persons. Congress instituted the maintenance-of-effort requirement
in the early 1970s to prevent States from effectively transferring Federal benefit increases from
SSI recipients to State treasuries. The proposal also could put at risk low-income elderly and
disabled individuals who could lose SSI entirely and thereby lose Medicaid coverage as well.
The Administration opposed this proposal during last year's welfare reform debate.

        Welfare-to-Work Performance Fund -- The reported bills do not include a performance
fund. It is essential that welfare to work funds generate greater levels of placement in
unsubsidized jobs than States will achieve with TANF and other funds. We hope the House will
be willing to consider a mechanism to provide needed incentives and rewards for placing more of
the hardest-to-serve in lasting, unsubsidized jobs that promote self-sufficiency. We look
forward to working with the Congress during conference to refine these provisions.

        Worker Displacement -- We strongly urge the House to adopt, at a minimum, the
provisions included in H.R. 1385, the House-passed job training reform bill which were included
in the Education and Workforce reported bill, but not in the version reported by the Ways and
Means Committee.

        Distribution of Funds by Year. -- It does not appear that the bill's allocation of $3
billion in budget authority over fiscal years 1998-2000 would, when combined with the
program structure, result in an outlay pattern consistent with an estimate of zero outlays in
FY 2002, as provided in the budget agreement. The Department of Labor is available to
work with staff to craft provisions that satisfy this agreement.

Student Loans

        The Administration opposes the provision regarding administrative cost allowances
(ACAs) to guaranty agencies in the Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP). The
provision would mandate ACAs to be paid at a rate of 0.85% of new loan volume from
mandatory funding authorized under Section 458 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA), up
to a cap of $170 million in FY 1998 and 1999 and $150 million in FY 2000-2002. It would
represent a new entitlement to these agencies not included in the budget agreement. Moreover,
any allowance to these agencies should bear some relationship to the costs these agencies incur
and not be based on an arbitrary formula. This is an issue for the upcoming HEA reauthorization.

MEWAs

         The reported bill includes language from HR 1515 the Expansion of Portability and
Health Insurance Coverage Act of 1997, in the budget reconciliation legislation. We believe
that the bill as currently drafted has inadequate consumer protections and has the potential to
result in premium increases for small businesses and employees who may bear the burden of
adverse selection. H.R. 1515 would transfer the regulation of a large health insurance market
Income Security Act ("ERISA"). Although there currently is strong bipartisan interest in
strengthening consumer protections in health plans governed solely by ERISA, they still are
weak. Any legislation like the current bill that expands ERISA's scope must be accompanied by
an expansion of consumer protections. The Administration opposed these provisions when they
were considered last year, and we believe it would be unfortunate and unwise to introduce this
level of controversy into the budget reconciliation process.

Privatization

        The reported bill would allow the eligibility and enrollment determination functions of
Federal and State health and human services benefits programs, including Me.dicaid and Food
Stamps to be privatized. While certain program functions, such as computer systems, can
currently be contracted out to private entities, the certification of eligibility for benefits and
related operations (such as obtaining and verifying information about income and other eligibility
factors) should remain public functions. The Administration believes that changes to current
law would not be in the best interest of program beneficiaries and strongly opposes this
provision.

Debt Limit Extension

       {Is thisftxed?JThe Administration strongly urges the House to include the debt limit
extension contained in the Bipartisan Budget Agreement in the first reconciliation bill, the
spending bill.

Other provisions that may he added at the Rules Committee

        We understand that an amendment may be brought to the Rules Committee that would
put automatic cap on year by year spending beneath the level of annual revenues in order to put
additional resources into the Social Security Trust Fund, provide for increased spending for
transportation, and to pay for additional unspecified tax cuts. We have a number of concerns
with this approach; projections of future growth are highly uncertain; there is no mechanism for
protection in case of a recession which could make a weak economy even weaker; under the
proposal it is possible that -- outside the budget process -- a one-year surplus could finance a
permanent tax cut which would increase the debt in the long run; and finally, allowing the
highway trust fund to spend outside the budget violates the principals of a unified budget, gives it
status over other important priorities, and complicates calculations of exactly what the budgetary
surplus would be as called for in the proposal. This amendment was never discussed in the
context of developing the Bipartisan Budget Agreement and would disrupt the carefully balanced
compromises contained in the Agreement. The Administration opposes it.

        We are also concerned by reports that the Rules Committee may consider provisions
which add further restrictions to immigrants access to public benefits. Many of the potential
provisions were considered during last year's immigration reform debate and were removed from
the final legislation after negotiations between Congress and the Administration because they
provisions, which would introduce known controversies into the budget reconciliation process.

       The Bipartisan Budget Agreement reflects compromise on many important and
controversial issues, and challenges the leaders on both sides of the aisle to achieve consensus
under difficult circumstances. It is critical that we do so on a bipartisan basis.

       I look forward to working with you to implement this historic agreement.

                                              Sincerely,




                                             Franklin D. Raines

 Identical letter sent to the Honorable Joseph Moakley, The Honorable John R. Kasich, The
                                    Honorable John Spratt

[Could we move voc ed to additional concerns and drop this section?)

Vocational Education in TANF and Transfers to Title XX

        The Administration is concerned with several provisions included in the Reported bill
that were not in the Bipartisan Budget Agreement. For example, the agreement did not address
making changes in the T ANF work requirements regarding vocational education and educational
services for teen parents. The Administration opposes the Title XX provision allowing States to
divert TANF funds away from Welfare-to-Work efforts to other social service activities.

State SSI Administrative Fees

       The Administration is pleased that the Ways and Means Subcommittee approved a
provision, consistent with the Budget Agreement to increase the administrative fees that the
Federal Government charges States for administrating their State supplemental SSI
payments and to make the increase available, subject to appropriations, for Social Security
Administration (SSA) administrative expenses.

Refugee and Asylee Eligibility

        The Agreement would extend the exemption period from five to seven years for refugees,
asylees, and those who are not deported because they would likely face persecution back home.
The Administration supports the reported language, which implements this policy and also
extends the exemption to Cuban, Haitian, and certain Amerasian entrants.

Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)

        The reported bill includes three proposals made by the Treasury Department to improve
EITC compliance. The reported bill would deny EITC for ten years for those who fraudulently
claim the EITC; toughen recertification requirements for those denied the EITC as a result of
deficiency procedures; and impose due diligence requirements for paid preparers. Treasury has
proposed additional legislative compliance measures that we hope the Congress will consider
during conference.

The Honorable Frank Lautenberg
Ranking Minority Member,
Committee on the Budget
United States Senate
Washington, DC 20510

Dear Senator Lautenberg:

       As the Senate begins consideration ofS. 947, the spending-related portion of this year's
budget reconciliation legislation, I am writing to transmit the Administration's views. We will
transmit separately the Administration's views on the tax reconciliation bill.

        While many provisions of the bill are consistent with the Bipartisan Budget Agreement,
in some key areas others are not. We understand there are ongoing efforts to resolve as many
issues as possible through a bipartisan Leadership amendment. Such an amendment would
advance the bipartisan process which began last month with the Budget Agreement. The
Administration intends to continue working closely with the Leadership on remedial
amendments.

         Key areas where the bill is inconsistent with the Budget Agreement include the failure to:
"restore SSI [Supplemental Security Income] and Medicaid eligibility for all disabled legal
immigrants who are or become disabled and who entered the U.S. prior to August 23, 1996";
assist low-income Medicare beneficiaries in paying premiums; provide Medicaid benefits for
certain disabled children and the full 70 percent Federal match for Medicaid in the District of
Columbia; properly implement the Medicare home health reallocation; provide for State SSI
administrative fees; and achieve the agreed-upon levels of savings from spectrum auctions and
related provisions.

         In addition, we have significant concerns about a number of issues which the Budget
Agreement did not specifically address: the lack of quality standards and protections against
balance billing in private fee-for-service plans in Medicare Choice and in Medical Savings
Accounts (MSAs); the added burden of new copayments for certain Medicare Part B and
Medicaid beneficiaries; the higher eligibility age for Medicare recipients and the income-relating
of the Medicare deductible; the failure to include all of the Administration's prudent purchasing
reforms; the lack of a Federal Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) targeting standard; the
failure to put the proper parties in charge of administering the welfare-to-work program; the
proposal to privatize eligibility determinations in Texas; and the lack of adequate
maintenance-of-effort requirements for Food Stamps.

        The Bipartisan Budget Agreement is good for America, its people, and its future, and we
are fully committed to working with Congress to see all of its provisions enacted into law by the
August recess.

        Continued SSI and Medicaid Benefits for Legal Immigrants -- While the Senate reported
provision giving benefits to new applicants for a limited time is preferable to the House
provision, it fails to provide sufficient assistance for the most vulnerable individuals. The
Budget Agreement explicitly states: "Restore SSI and Medicaid eligibility for all disabled legal
immigrants who are or become disabled and who enter the U.S. prior to August 23, 1996."
As the President stated in a June 20, 1997 letter, he views this issue as of paramount importance.
As the letter states: "To achieve our common goal of a signable bill that balances the budget, it is
essential that the legislation that is presented to me include these provisions. I will be unable to
sign legislation that does not." The reported bill fails to reflect the Agreement. As a result, in
2002 it would protect an estimated 55,000 fewer immigrants than the Budget Agreement calls
for.
        In addition, the President's strong preference is to cover both elderly and disabled
immigrants. We will work with you to identify the necessary resources to do so.

        Assistance for Low-Income Medicare Beneficiaries -- Recognizing that premiums
represent a significant burden on low-income beneficiaries, the Budget Agreement allocated
$l.5 billion to ease the impact on this population of increasing Medicare premiums related to the
home health reallocation. The reported bill does not include this provision.

       Medicaid Benefits for Certain Disabled Children -- The Budget Agreement clearly
includes the proposal to restore Medicaid for current disabled children losing SSI because of the
new, more strict definition of childhood eligibility. The reported bill failed to include this
proposal. We strongly urge the Senate to include this provision and retain Medicaid benefits for
about 30,000 children who could lose their health care coverage in FY 1998.

        DC Medicaid - We are pleased that the reported bill includes a higher matching payment
for the Medicaid program in the District of Columbia, but we are concerned that the increase is
not sufficient. The matching rate proposed in the reported bill sunsets at the end ofFY 2000 and
is 10 percentage points lower than the matching rate of70 percent in the FY 1998 President's
budget. A 60 percent matching rate would still leave the District paying more to the Medicaid
program than any other local government.

        Home Health Reallocation -- The home health reallocation in the Budget Agreement is
not properly reflected in the reported bill. During the negotiations, we discussed at great length
the shift of home health expenditures to Part B, and all sides clearly understood that it would be
immediate. The Committee's phase-in would cost two years of solvency on the Part A trust
fund -- two years that we can ill afford to lose. We urge the Senate to incorporate the same
provision included in the House Commerce Committee reported title.




                                                 2
Budget Agreement which calls for increasing the administrative fees that the Federal
Government charges States for administering their supplemental SSI payments -- the proceeds of
which would be available, subject to appropriations, for Social Security Administration (SSA)
administrative expenses.

       Spectrum - While the Senate reported provisions are a substantial improvement over
counterpart House legislation, we continue to have serious concerns. The reported language
would not achieve the full $26.3 billion in savings and policies described in the Budget
Agreement. In addition, the bill does not include two of the proposals included in the Budget'
Agreement -- auction of "vanity" toll free telephone numbers and the spectrum penalty fee.
Additionally, the bill does not provide a firm date for terminating analog broadcasting, thus
causing significant savings reductions.

         We also have the following additional concerns with the reported spectrum language: the
lack of authority for the federal Communications Commission (fCC) to use economic
mechanisms, other than auctions, where appropriate (i.e., user fees to create incentives for
efficient spectrum management); a very expansive definition of public safety that would create
loopholes permitting too many entities to be exempted from auctions; language that would
protect spectrum for use by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which is contrary to the Administration's policy on
managing spectrum across the government through a process managed by the National
Telecommunications and Infonnation Administration; and the lack of authority for the fCC to
revoke and reauction licenses when an entity declares bankruptcy, which is essential to preserving
licenses awarded in previous auctions.


Additional Concerns

       Although the Budget Agreement did not specifically address the following items, the
Administration has significant concerns about them. The Administration urges the Senate to
address these concerns during Floor action.

Medicare

        Private Fee for Service in Medicare Choice. While the Administration supports the
introduction of new plan options for Medicare beneficiaries, we believe that any new options
must be accompanied by appropriate beneficiary protections. We believe that inclusion of
private fee-for-service plans in Medicare Choice without balance billing or quality assurance
protections is bad policy. Beneficiaries should not be exposed to billing in excess of current law
protections. Also, we are concerned that this option will attract primarily healthy and wealthy
beneficiaries and leave sicker and poorer beneficiaries in the more expensive, traditional
Medicare program.


                                                3
limited in order to minimize potential damage and costs to the Medicare program. We
commend the Finance Committee for limiting the demonstration to 100,000 participants, but still
believe that a geographically limited demonstration would be much preferable. We are also
pleased that the cost-sharing and deductibles for MSAs that have been reported are similar to the
provisions that were enacted under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
(HIPAA).
We also strongly believe that the current law limits on balance billing should be applied to this
demonstration to protect beneficiaries from being subjected to any additional charges providers
choose to assess. We believe this demonstration should be limited geographically for a trial
period which would enable us to design the demonstration to answer key policy questions.

       Home Health Copayments. We note that the bill would impose a Part B home health
copayment of $5 per visit, capped at an amount equal to the annual hospital deductible.
Medicare beneficiaries who use home health services tend to be in poorer health than other
Medicare beneficiaries. Two-thirds are women, and one-third live alone. Forty-three percent
have incomes under $10,000 per year. We are concerned that a copayment could limit
beneficiary access to the benefit. Imposing a home health copay is not necessary to balance the
budget, and any further consideration of this policy should be part of a bipartisan process to
address the long-term financing challenges facing Medicare.

        Medicare Eligibility Age. Raising the eligibility age for Medicare is not necessary to
balance the budget, and any further consideration of this policy should be part of a bipartisan
process to address the long-term financing challenges facing Medicare. Moreover, this proposal
does not contain provisions to address the fact that early retirees between the ages of 65-67 may
not be able to obtain affordable insurance in the private market.

        Prudent Purchasing. We applaud the bill's inclusion of our inherent reasonableness and
competitive bidding proposals. However, we urge the Senate to take advantage of all the
prudent purchasing proposals. The Medicare program is governed by a strict set of provider
payment rules that have the effect of limiting the ability of the Federal government to secure the
most competitive terms available to other payers in the marketplace. We have advanced a set of
proposals to allow Medicare, the nation's largest health insurer, to also take advantage oflower
rates providers offer to other payers.

        Income-related Deductible. The reported bill includes a proposal to income-relate the
Medicare Part B deductible. While the Administration is not opposed to income relating
Medicare in principle, we have a number of concerns about this proposal. First, as the
President mentioned yesterday, we believe this provision is outside the confines of the
underlying budget agreement. Second, we are concerned that the proposal has design
flaws. It would be extremely difficult to administer. Moreover, it may not achieve its
intended purpose of reducing unnecessary utilization of services because the vast majority
of beneficiaries have supplemental "Medigap" policies that pay for Part B deductible costs.
  While we do have serious concerns about this proposal, we remain interested in discussing
it, or proposals like it, in the broader context of reforms to address the long-term financing

                                                4




                                            5
Establishing a bipartisan process that is mutually agreeable is essential to successfully address
the challenges facing Medicare. We look forward to working with you on the development of
the best possible bipartisan process to address the long-term financing challenges facing
Medicare while simultaneously ensuring the sound restructuring. of the program to provide
high-quality care for our nation's senior citizens.

       Medicare Choice Payments. We would prefer to limit the growth in Medicare Choice
payments to Fee-for-Service Medicare, rather than having two separate growth targets. To do
so may lead to an erosion of the value of the Medicare choice benefit package and expose
beneficiaries to increased premiums.


Medicaid

         Disproportionate Share Hospital Savings. We have concerns about the details of the
allocation of the disproportionate share hospital (DSH) payment reductions among States. The
bill may have unintended distributional effects among States. We recommend that the Congress
revisit the FY 1998 President's budget proposal, which achieves savings by taking an equal
percentage reduction off of states' total DSH spending, up to an "upper limit."    Although the
reported bill includes a provision to require States to develop DSH targeting plans, we are
concerned that the bill does not include a federal DSH targeting standard. Without federal
standards, providers with high-volume Medicaid and low-income utilization may not be
sufficiently protected from reductions in the DSH program.

        Medicaid Cost Sharing. The bill would allow States to require limited cost sharing for
optional benefits. We are concerned that this proposal may compromise beneficiary access to
quality care. Low-income Medicaid beneficiaries may forgo needed services if they cannot
afford the copayments. We urge the Senate to revisit the FY 1998 President's budget proposal,
which would allow nominal copayments only for HMO enrollees. This proposal would grant
States some flexibility and would allow HMOs to treat Medicaid enrollees in a manner similar to
non-Medicaid enrollees, without compromising access to care.

        Criminal Penalties for Asset Divestiture. The reported bill would amend Section 217 of
the HIP AA of 1996 to provide sanctions against those who assist people in disposing of assets in
order to qualify for Medicaid. We would prefer to repeal Section 217 because we believe that
the Medicaid laws in effect before the enactment of the Health Insurance and Portability and
Accountability Act are sufficient to protect the Medicaid program against inappropriate asset
divestiture.

        Return to Work. We are pleased that the reported bill includes a provision allowing
States to permit workers with disabilities to buy into Medicaid. We recommend the President's
Budget proposal which would not limit eligibility for this program to people whose earnings are
below 250 percent of poverty. We believe that this limit in the reported bill would not allow
States sufficient flexibility to remove disincentives to work for people with disabilities.


                                                6
bill includes adjustments for the Medicaid programs in Puerto Rico and the territories, but we
would prefer the language included in the FY 1998 President's Budget.

Children's Health

        We are encouraged that the Senate reported bill includes notable improvements over the
provisions reported by the House Commerce Committee. Specifically, we commend the
decision not to allow use of the $16 billion investment in areas other than insurance coverage.
In addition, we are pleased to note the improved definition of benefits relative to the House
Commerce Committee provisions.

        While the Senate-reported bill represents a positive step forward, we are particularly
concerned about the benefits definition and the lack of low income protections. It is our hope
that the intent of this legislation was to ensure that children receive a benefit package that is at
least commensurate with the standard Blue Cross/Blue Shield FEHBP benefit. However, the
actual statutory language is much more limiting and would permit much less significant
coverage. In addition, while the HHS Secretary would have discretion to define whether or not
the benefit package meets the statutory requirement, she would not have the ability to ensure that
low income children do not have to shoulder unrealistically high cost sharing that could lead to
reduced access to needed health care. We also want to ensure that this investment is properly
targeted to cover children who do not currently have health insurance. Finally, as the
Administration has stated many times, we do not support limiting access to medically necessary
benefits, including abortion services. We look forward to working with the Congress to resolve
these important issues.


Welfare to Work

        Local Program Administration -- The challenge of welfare reform -- moving welfare
recipients into permanent, unsubsidized employment -- will be greatest in our Nation's large
urban centers, especially those with the highest number of adults in poverty.     Mayors and other
local elected officials, working with private industry councils, have been entrusted by Congress
with the responsibility for administration of other Federal job training funds. The
Administration strongly believes that a substantial amount of all Welfare to Work funds should
be managed by these entities, which have the experience to address most effectively the
challenge of moving long-term welfare recipients into lasting unsubsidized employment that
reduces or eliminates dependency.

         The committee reported bill, however, would provide for local administration of formula
grant funds only through the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) agency. The
bill's competitive grant structure would not ensure that an appropriate portion of funds outside
rural areas will be administered by cities with high concentrations of adults in poverty. The
Administration is concerned that the reported bill provides that the competitive grant portion
would be only 25 percent of the total funds available, still further limiting resources for cities


                                                 7
House Ways & Means Committee which would increase the share of competitively awarded
funds to 50 percent and set aside a substantial portion of these funds for cities with the highest
poverty populations.

        Performance Bonus. The Administration is pleased that the Finance Committee
included a performance bonus concept. We are concerned, however, that the performance
fund simply augments the existing T ANF performance fund without establishing any new
expectations on grantees for additional performance using these welfare-to-work funds, or
rewards for placing the hardest-to-serve in lasting, unsubsidized jobs that promote
self-sufficiency. In addition, the Administration agrees with the House that the way to
administer welfare-to-work grant funds so as to have the greatest likelihood of success is
through the Department of Labor, the mayors, and the private industry council system.

        Federal Administering Agency. The reported bill would place the program under the
authority of the Secretary of Health and Human Services. While consistency with Federal
TANF strategies is essential, Welfare to Work program activities should be closely aligned with
the workforce development system overseen by the Secretary of Labor. The Administration
therefore believes that the Secretary of Labor should administer this program in consultation with
the Secretaries ofHHS and HUD (as in the House bill).

       Non-displacement. We understand the Senate adopted non-displacement provisions
during committee action. However, we strongly urge the Senate to adopt, at a minimum, the
provisions included in the House Education and the Workforce Committee-reported bill, which
apply both to activities under the new Welfare-to-Work grants and TANF.

        Distribution of Funds by Year. It does not appear that the bill's allocation of $3 billion
in budget authority over fiscal years 1998-2000 would, when combined with the program
structure, result in an outlay pattern consistent with an estimate of zero outlays in FY 2002, as
provided in the budget agreement. The Department of Labor is available to work with staff to
craft provisions that satisfy this agreement.

        We are pleased that the reported bili includes provisions that would address priorities,
including: the provision of formula grant funds to States based on poverty, unemployment, and
adult welfare recipients; a sub-state allocation of the formula grant to ensure targeting on areas
of greatest need; appropriate flexibility for grantees to use the funds for a broad array of activities
that offer promise of resulting in permanent placement in unsubsidized jobs; funds awarded on a
competitive basis; a substantial set-aside for evaluation; and a performance fund to reward States
that are successful in placing long-term welfare recipients. We look forward to working with
the Congress during conference to refine these provisions.




                                                  8

        The reported bill appropriately refrains from modifying current law with respect to the
application of the minimum wage and other worker protections for working welfare recipients
under TANF. The Administration believes strongly that everyone who can work must work, and
everyone who works should earn at least the minimum wage and receive the protections of
existing employment laws -- whether or not they are coming off welfare.

Privatization of Health and Welfare Programs

        The reported bill would allow the eligibility and enrollment determination functions of
Federal and State health and human services benefits programs in the State of Texas --
including Medicaid, WIC, and Food Stamps -- to be privatized. The Administration believes
that changes to current law would not be in the best interest of program beneficiaries and strongly
opposes this provision. While certain program functions, such as computer systems, can currently
be contracted out to private entities, the certification of eligibility for benefits and related
operations (such as obtaining and verifying information about income and other eligibility
factors) should remain public functions.

Food Stamps

        While we support much of the Committee's approach to implementing the
Agreement we are concerned that the proposal would create an estimated 100,000 fewer
work opportunities over five years than proposed by the Administration's bill, which
includes a specific target of 70,000 new slots each year. We are pleased that the Senate
adopted a performance-based structure to reward States that provide employment and
training (E&T) opportunities for individuals facing the 3-month food stamp time limit.
This is highly preferable to the less accountable provisions in the House bill. The
Senate's proposal should also be strengthened by conditioning receipt of the new 100
percent Federal E&T funds provided in the agreement upon a State maintaining 100
percent of their 1996 E&T spending. CBO estimates that the Senate's proposed 75
percent maintenance-of-effort requirement would result in States decreasing their E&T
spending by $89 million over 5 years. We urge the Senate to adopt provisions similar to
the House maintenance-of-effort provisions.

Student Loans

       We are pleased that the reported bill includes $1.763 billion in outlay savings,
including $1 billion in Federal reserves recalled from guaranty agencies, $160 million from
eliminating a fee paid to instituti.ons in the Direct Loan program, and $603 million in
reduced Federal student loan administrative costs. All these savings are being achieved
without increasing costs or reducing benefits to students and their families.

      However, the Administration opposes a new provision, unrelated to the Budget
Agreement, requiring administrative cost allowances (ACAs) to guaranty agencies in the


                                                9
be paid from mandatory funding authorized under Section 458 of the Higher Education
Act of 1965 (HEA) in FY 1998-2002. This provision would represent a new federal
entitlement. It would also limit inappropriately the funds available to the Secretary to
manage the FFEL Program effectively. Any allowance to these agencies should bear some
relationship to the costs these agencies incur and not be based on an arbitrary formula.
This is an issue for the upcoming HEA Reauthorization.


        The Bipartisan Budget Agreement reflects compromise on many important and
controversial issues, and challenges the leaders on both sides of the aisle to achieve consensus
under difficult circumstances. It is critical that we do so on a bipartisan basis.

       I look forward to working with you to implement this historic agreement.

                                                   10

 Housing

        We are concerned that the bill's provisions regarding FHA multifamily housing
restructuring would not transform this housing in the most effective and efficient fashion.
By ruling out the possibility of providing portable tenant-based assistance, the bill would
limit the ability of tenants to seek out the best available housing and prevent projects from
developing a more diverse mix of income levels. By establishing a preference for
delegating restructuring tasks to housing finance agencies, the bill places an unnecessary
constraint on HUD's ability to design the most effective partnerships. Finally, by failing to
address tax issues explicitly, the bill does not resolve impediments that could discourage
owners from participating in a restructuring process.

        The administration is also concerned about Section 2203 of the Senate reconciliation bill
which repeals federal preferences for the Section 8 tenant-based and project-based programs.
The Administration has supported these repeals only if they are combined with income targeting
that would replace the federal preferences. That targeting would ensure:
1) that the tenant-based program continues to serve predominantly extremely low income families
with incomes below 30 percent of the area median income and 2) that all developments in the
project-based program are accessible to a reasonable number of extremely low income families.

Unemployment Insurance Integrity

       The reported bill fails to support the provision of the Budget Agreement that achieves
$763 million in mandatory savings over five years through an increase in discretionary spending
for Unemployment Insurance program integrity activities of $89 million in 1998 and $467
million over five years. We urge the Senate to include in the bill provisions to authorize and
guarantee the discretionary activities and the resulting savings. The Admininstration separately
transmitted draft legislative language on June 6th to implement this provision of the Budget
Agreement.

Vocational Education and TANF

       The Administration is concerned with the reported bill's provision on vocational
education in T ANF. The agreement did not address making changes in the T ANF work
requirements regarding vocational education and educational services for teen parents.

Smith-Hughes

        The reported bill does not include a provision that would repeal the Smith-Hughes Act of
1917, although the bill finds the agreed-upon $29 million savings from other sources. In light of
the $1.2 billion annual appropriations under the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied
Technology Education Act, there is no justification for mandatory spending of $7 million per

                                               11
House Education and Workforce Committee reported title, which is consistent with the Budget
Agreement.

Refugee and Asylee Eligibility

        The Agreement would extend the exemption period from five to seven years for refugees,
asylees, and those who are not deported because they would likely face persecution back home.
The Administration supports the reported language, which implements this policy and also
extends the exemption to Cuban and Haitian entrants.

Otherlmmigrant Provisions

      .We urge the adoption of a provision that would provide the same exemption period
for Amerasian immigrants as provided to refugees. Amerasian immigrants share many of
the problems and barriers confronted by refugees and have the same level of need as
refugees. The Administration is pleased that the Committee bill exempts permanent
resident aliens who are members of an Indian tribe from SSI program restrictions. We
urge the Senate to extend this exemption to include the five year ban on eligibility for those
who enter the country after August 22, 1996. Neither of these provisions will change the
spending estimates associated with the Committee bill.

DRAFT LETTER ON CHILD SUPPORT ENFORCEMENT




       There is no job as important -- or as difficult -- as being a parent. Most parents eagerly

embrace the responsibility of raising and supporting their children. Others, unfortunately, do

not. Because every parent must take responsibility for the children they bring into this world,

I've made child support enforcement a top priority for my Administration. Today, I am pleased

to announce that new data from the Department of Health and Human Services and the

Department of the Treasury show we're making tremendous progress. I am also pleased to

endorse a bipartisan effort in the Congress to enact tough new legislation proposed by the

Attorney General to punish parents who wilfully neglect to pay child support.



       The Department of Health and Human Services' 20th Annual Report to Congress on

Child Support Enforcement shows thafthe federal/state child support enforcement program has

made record increases in child support collections, paternity establishments, and families

receiving child support collections. In addition, preliminary data for fiscal year 1996 provides

even more evidence that our crackdown on child support enforcement is working. Overall, from

1992 to 1996, child support collections have increased by fifty percent, from $8 billion to a

record $12 billion; paternities established have nearly doubled, increasing from 516,000 to nearly

one million; and the number of child support cases with collections rose by almost fifty percent.

executive order I issued last September 28th will help to collect even most child support. Under

the executive order, the Secretary of the Treasury in consultation with HHS has developed

procedures to collect past-due child support through administrative offset of federal payments

such as employee salaries, retirement benefits, and vendor payments. There's no reason why

parents who owe child support should collect federal funds. Currently, eight states and the

District of Columbia are participating in the program and over 725,000 parents have been

notified that their federal payments could be seized to satisfY delinquent child support debts. All

50 states are scheduled to participate in the program by the end of 1997. When the program is

fully implemented, annual collections could reach $200 million, which will be in addition to the

$1 billion the Treasury Department collected last year by offsetting tax refunds.



        While I am proud of these accomplishments, we must still do more to punish parents who

take egregious actions to avoid paying child support. Last July, I directed the Attorney General

to draft legislation to amend the Child Support Recovery Actto establish a felony offense for a

person who wilfully fails to pay child support for a child in another state. That proposal, which

was first submitted to Congress in September 1996, has been strengthened. The legislation

would make it a felony offense to 1) travel in interstate or foreign commerce with the intent to

evade a support obligation that is greater than $5,000 or has remained unpaid for longer than one

year;

2) willfully fail to pay a support obligation regarding a child residing in another state if the

obligation has remained unpaid for two years or is greater than $10,000. I am pleased that the


    Attorney General is working on a bipartisan basis with Senators Kohl andDewine to enact our

    tougher proposal into law.

           Last year, I signed into law a welfare bill containing the toughest child support

    enforcement provisions in history. Now we must work to implement these new rules and

    toughen them when necessary so that all parents pay the child support they owe. I look forward

    to continuing to work with the Congress on a bipartisan basis on these important matters.
