         As the President has said, the welfare reform bill he signed
into law yesterday offers a historic opportunity to end welfare
as we know it and replace it with a system that offers hope,
demands responsibility, and rewards work.
         However, as the President has also said, the welfare reform
bill contains provisions that cause unfair and unwarranted harm
to many families.   That is especially true of legal immigrants,
who have followed the rules, worked, paid taxes, in many cases
served in the military, and who have suffered a calamity that has
forced them to seek assistance. And, of course, it is true of
their children, who also will suffer the same consequences as
their parents.
         The President has vowed to repair (?) those provisions of
the bill.   In the meantime,m however, he is determined to ensure
that those provisions are implemented carefully, and that no
individuals not actually covered by those provisions are
improperly denied the benefits they and their children need.
         For that reason, the President has today issued two
directives to ensure that legal immigrants and their children who
remain eligible for benefits under the new law do not have those
benefits cut off mistakenly.
         The first measure directs the Secretary of Agriculture to
ensure that States have the maximum time allowed under the law to
make sure that legal immigrants who remain eligible for Food
Stamp benefits continue to receive them.   The Secretary is to
grant a waiver allowing any state, subject to certain legal
restrictions, to extend the certification periods for eligibility
for food stamps that apply to legal immigrants receiving
assistance. The extension will give States time to develop the
procedures needed to make accurate determinations of the many
facts -- such as immigration classification, veteran status, or
work history (other??) -- that the new law makes relevant to
eligibility. In this way, the directive will decrease inaccurate
or inequitable decisions to cut off Food Stamp benefits.
        Under the terms of the new law, benefits to legal immigrants
and their children are cut off only at the time of
recertification of their eligibility for Food Stamps. When a
State extends the certification period, it will, in effect, push


back the date on which a legal immigrant will be deprived of food
stamp benefits.
        This will allow those who have applied for citizenship or
who believe they may be exempt from the cutoff contained in the
law to continue to receive food stamps while the Immigration and

Naturalization Service (INS) or the Department of Agriculture
reviews their «applications??).

         The waiver, however, has specific time limits. Under
current law, the Secretary may not allow states to extend
certification periods beyond one year for most aliens or two
years for certain elderly or disabled aliens. For states that
already use that maximum certification period, the waiver will
not have an impact.   For those that have shorter periods, however
 (How can we find out how many, which ones, etc.????), the waiver
will permit extensions to a full year or 24 months. The
Department, however, may not allow states to extend any
recertification beyond August 22, 1997.
         The second measure directs the Attorney General, the
Secretary of Health and Human Services, and other agency heads to
make continued efforts to reduce bureaucratic delays in the
citizenship process for legal (??) immigrants applying to become
citizens. The INS already has made great progress in this area,
devoting more resources to processing naturalization applications
and reducing long waiting lists. This directive instructs the
Attorney General to continue to increase staff used to review
citizenship applications and to develop other effective means,
including joint efforts with community groups, of assisting
applicants for citizenship.
         In addition, the directive instructs the heads of all
relevant agencies to develop public/private partnerships devoted
to providing English
o                     .
-language training to applicants for
citizenship; make outreach efforts to those wishing to become
citizens; and provide special assistance to refugees and those
seeking asylum.
        Also today, the Attorney General, under authority granted by
the welfare reform law, will issue a memorandum containing a
provisional list of services which may not be denied to legal
 (??) immigrants. These services are determined to be "necessary
for the protection of life and safety." The Attorney General
will issue a permanent list at a later date. Additional
information is available at the Justice Department.
