TEXT:
We've reviewed both Olivia and Howard's testimony for House W&M Human
Resources Subcommittee tomorrow.  Olivia is giving a good overview of TANF
implementation:
how it's going out in the states (quite positive, basically similar to
Shalala memo and speech to AEI),
what HHS is doing and new federal role (regs, guidance, research,
partnerships with other federal agencies, accountability,   TA),
focus in coming months (working with states, communities and employers on
job retention and success; working with states to make investments,
develop knowledge, and provide supports for all families to
succeed--including hardest to serve; completing transformation of welfare
agencies to job centers, with appropriate linkages and community-based
approaches; data collection and accountability; improving understanding of
effects on children and families to continually improv~.programs and make
necessary adjustments) .
We've provided some comments to strengthen connections to our initiatives
such as housing vouchers and Access to Jobs, and to make sure testimony is
responsive to Shaw's concerns about HPB addressing all goals of TANF
without specifically mentioning family formation and stability.

Howard is talking about research and evaluation--what we've learned, what
we can expect to learn.   We've provided a few comments to minimize chance
that statements about what we know and don't know will get taken out of
context in a negative way
