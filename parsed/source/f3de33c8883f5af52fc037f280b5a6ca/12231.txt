TEXT:
As there is no time on the President's schedule next week (National Organ
and Tissue Donation Awareness Week) to participate in an organ donation
event, Chris and I talked about offering this up to a surrogate.  We are
currently exploring whether the First Lady or the Vice Presidnet have
interest in doing this event.  Please let me know if you do not want us to
offer this up to surrogates.

thanks!
