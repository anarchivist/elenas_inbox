TEXT:
FYI, there is a front-page L.A.  Times piece today by Jon Peterson on one
of the welfare-to-work hires in the EOP.  Claire Shipman is going to be
doing a piece on her as well (with Newsday and Knight-Ridder possibly to
follow).  Unfortuantely, we have only one of the six workers available to
us, for a variety of reasons, but she's great.
