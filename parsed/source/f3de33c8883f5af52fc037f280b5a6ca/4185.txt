TEXT:
Elena: welcome back from vacation.   I know you must have a million and
one things to do.  I'll just joined the President's Initiative on Race
last week as the Deputy for Policy Planning and Research.   I left you a
phone message last week to see if we can have an intro. meeting to discuss
how the PIR staff can and will participate in some of DPC's planning
activities in this next year.  From Michele Cavataio, I understand that
you have on-going issues meetings with participants of the federal
departments and agencies and that we'll be invited to participate.
Anyways, I would like to further discuss with you the nature and degree of
our continued participation in these meetings.  Please let me know when
you might have ~ome time to sit down for a short conversation.   I am in
the process of assembling a staff right now who will in the future take on
specific issue areas and support the work that DPC is already
undertaking. My number is 5-1045 if you want to call me. Thanks!!
