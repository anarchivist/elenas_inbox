Mary Jolly called and left a voicemail message on the company's answering
machine over the weekend.  She said she used to work with you on some
Senate
Committees and wants to talk to you before you have the Summit on School
Violence next week.  Tony asked me to forward the message on to you.

Have a nice day.

Karen
