TEXT:
I talked to Judy Appplebaum who said the provision looked acceptable and
that I could "leave town with my conscience clear that the comprmise was
acceptable." She recommended taking out the 100 employee floor, that
wasn't in the original bullet points that Treasury and Commerce agreed to
anyway, I think we should. Mary will double check with a couple of other
folks and then I think it is ready to pass on to Daschle.

The other consideration is that the Senate is out of session past our
event, so while we should push hard to get agreement to specific
lanaguage, Daschle won't be able to formally drop the bill ·until after the
event. Thus, while the President will be endorsing a bill and a data
collection provision in general, we could always tweak the specific
language afterwords.
