     Q&A for Presidential Initiative to Ensure the Safety of Imported Fruits and Vegetables
                                         October 2, 1997


Q:    What is the President proposing?

A:    The President is proposing two legislative and two executive actions that will further
      ensure the safety of fresh fruits and vegetables especially those imported into the U.S.
      First, the legislation will authorize the FDA to halt imports of fruits, vegetables, or other
      food from any foreign country ~hose food safety systems and standards are not on par
      with those of the U.S. Second, the President will also provide the necessary funds in his
      FY99 budget to enable FDA to expand dramatically its international inspection force so
      that it can make good use of this new authority.

      Third, the President has asked the Secretaries of Health and Human Services and
      Agriculture to take additional steps to improve the safety of both imported and domestic
      fruits and vegetables. Specifically, he has asked the Secretaries to issue within one year
      guidance on good agricultural practices and good manufacturing practices for fruits and
      vegetables. By providing the first-ever specific safety standards for fruits and
      vegetables, the guidance will improve the agricultural and manufacturing practices of all
      those, foreign and domestic, seeking to sell produce in the U.S. market.

      Finally, the President has also asked the two Secretaries for a plan on how to improve the
      use of existing and projected resources to monitor agricultural and manufacturing
      practices abroad, assist foreign countries to improve those practices, and prevent the
      importation of unsafe produce, including by detecting unsafe food at the dock or border.
      The plan is due in 90 days.

      These efforts all build on the Clinton Administration's long-term commitment to
      strengthening our food safety system. With the help of the Vice-President's National
      Performance Review, we have fundamentally improved the way we ensure the safety of
      meat, poultry, and seafood. We have also put in place important new protections against
      the risks of pesticides in our food, especially for our children. And we are hopeful
      Congress will provide the $43 million the President requested in his FY98 budget to
      improve food safety.


Q:    Why is he proposing these actions?

A:    There have been enormous changes in the produce department of the grocery store.
      Thirty years ago, most produce sections only had around a dozen items year round and
      that would increase to as many as 50 in the summer. Today, no matter where you live in
      the United States, the chances are there are 400 or more items in the produce section and
      they are there all year round. Ten years ago, Guatemala first began planting raspberries
      vines in their fields, today Guat~alan raspberries account for about 30 percent of the
     raspberries sold in U.S. stores.
                                                                   Hex-Dwnp Conversion
     We have changed as well. Americans are eating more fresh fruits and vegetables than
     ever before, and our nation's health experts tell us we will live longer, better quality lives
     as a result. Our environment is also changing. We are finding "new" exotic bugs such
     as cyclospora and E. Coli 0157 :H7 on our food that once were not there.

     When you add up all these changes, and ask the question: is raw produce more risky to
     eat, the experts have told us they don't think so. The increase in the amount of produce
     and the types of produce we consume is far greater than the illnesses that may have
     resulted. But the experts have also made suggestions on ways to further improve the
     safety of raw produce, and the steps we are announcing today follow their advice.


Q:   Why has the Administration waited until now to take these steps?

A:   We are taking these steps now because they are the natural next steps in the President's
     long-term efforts to ensure the safety of the nation's food supply.

     One of the first challenges we faced after taking office in 1993 was an outbreak of E. coli
     in hamburger in the northwest. We recommended replacing our old system of
     responding to problems only after they occur with a new system to prevent problems
     before they occur. That system, which we are putting in place for meat, poultry, and
     seafood is greatly increasing our ability to make sure food is safe.

     In January, we announced several additional steps to improve the safety of our food. The
     President asked Congress to add $43 million to our food safety budget to fund a
     nationwide early-warning system for foodbome illness, increase seafood safety
     inspections, and expand food-safety research, training, and education. We are hopeful
     Congress will provide the funds we requested and beginning next month we will be using
     that money to further reduce the incidence of foodbome illness.

     This new initiative is the natural next step. With significant measures already taken to
     ensure the safety of meat, poultry, and seafood, we are now directing our efforts to the
     produce consumed by Americans.


Q:   Given the dramatic increase of food imported into the U.S., and the seemingly related
     increases in outbreaks infoodbome disease, shouldn't the Administration be taking more
     immediate steps to protect Americans from unsafe foreign food?

A:   First, it is important to remember that the experts in food safety have not concluded that
     there is an increase in outbreaks offoodbome illness in the U.S. that is the result of
     imported food.
                                                                    Automated Records Management System
                                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion
         Even though our food supply is among the safest in the world, each year there are still
         millions of Americans who get sick from the food they eat. The overwhelming majority
         of these cases are what is known as sporadic illnesses. These illnesses are isolated cases
         and are not caused by a single, specific contaminated food. An "outbreak" of foodborne
         disease is when many people become sick from being exposed to the same source of
         contaminated food.

         As a result of steps we have taken over the last four years, we are doing a more thorough
         job looking for outbreaks than we have ever done before. Experts we have consulted say
         that our improved surveillance is one of the primary reasons we are hearing about more
         food-related illnesses. We our catching and quickly responding to outbreaks of
         foodborne illness that we often missed in the past.

         Second, the steps we are taking today are on top of other actions the Administration has
         already taken. For example, next week we will complete work on an FDA automated
         import system known as OASIS (Operational and Administrative System for Import
         Support). OASIS ties together electronically 435 ports of entry around the U.S. and
         dramatically increases the efficiency of FDA inspection efforts. In the past, some
         importers engaged in what was known as "port-shopping" taking potentially harmful
         products through the busiest ports where their products would receive the least scrutiny.
         OASIS ends that practice.


    Q:   How will the new guidance that you have asked the Secretaries to develop make our food
         safer?

    A:   Today the produce industry is simply required to produce safe food, but is not given
         direction on how to do so. Thabs like telling drivers in a big city to drive carefully
         without providing them road signs, traffic lights, and speed limits. Under our new plan
         government food safety agencies will provide the industry specific guidance that will alert
         them to the potential hazards and the hazard-reducing steps they should take to produce
         safe food. For example, FDA will issue guidance on good agricultural practices to
         minimize the risk of microbial contamination. This guidance will address, among other
         things, standards for worker and field sanitation, irrigation, and the use of manure.


    Q:   Are the steps you are taking today sufficient to solve the problem or should we expect
         additional proposals in the future?

    A:   We are cornmitted to ensuring that the food that we eat is as safe as possible. It is
         important to keep in mind that the steps we are taking today are adding additional layers
         of protection to a food safety system that is already the best in the world. The steps we
         are announcing today represent the best ideas of our experts in government and the
         experts outside government in both industry and public health.

                                                                    Automated Records Management System
                                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion

    Q:     Why didn't you address this problem in the President's food safety initiative announced
         , in Mayor in the budget the President introduced last January?

    A:    The food safety initiative did identify imports as an area of concern. The additional
          measures we are putting in place build on our plan.
