Elena:

With respect to your/Rahm's questions about the Consumer Products Safety
Commission (CPSC) and/or ATF doing more on the gun safety side, here's a
preliminary response:

1. CPSC is definitely prohibited by statute from getting into guns.
Their enabling legislation specifically states that "The CPSC shall make
no ruling or order that restricts the manufacturer or sale of firearms
ammunition, including black powder or gun powder for firearms." Your pal
Pam informed me that they would love to get into the gun regulation
business -- and that they feel that they are more qualified than ATF to do
so -- but that they are expressly prohibited from doing so. Also, she
didn't think they could even distribute information on gun safety -- and
that such action would certainly cause the Hill to put a rider on their
appropriations to stop them from doing so. However, she's double checking
with their general counsel.

2.  In reviewing the '68 Gun Act it's highly doubtful that we have any
authority to require gun dealers to do anything on gun safety. The act is
meticulous in stating what the Secretary can and can't do. And while
simply providing information to gun dealers on safety may be allowable,
it's also likely to elicit an appropriations rider prohibiting them from
printing/disseminating such information.  I'm still waiting for a call
from ATF to confirm this.

One other thing:  I am told that Josh Sugarman of the Violence Policy
Center, who wrote the Rolling Stone report on regulating guns several
years ago, is shopping a proposal on the Hill to allow ATF to set and
enforce safety standards for guns.  I don't know if anyone's introduced
this Congress, but it's not likely to pass any time soon. Bruce and I had
reviewed this report when it first came out, and thought it went a bit too
far.

Jose'
