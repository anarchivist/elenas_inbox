DRAFT




The Honorable Cass Ballenger
Chairman
Subcommittee on Workforce Protections
Committee on Economic and Educational
   Opportunities
O.S. House of Representatives
Washington, D.C.  20515

Dear Chairman Ballenger:

I am writing to provide you with the views of the Department of Labor on
H.R. 2327.

The Department of Labor is committed to helping this nationD,s youth find
meaningful and productive employment; however, their safety and health
must not be placed at risk by such employment. H.R. 2327 would
substantially weaken existing restrictions on the employment of 16- and
17-year olds in jobs that require driving.  It will increase the
on-the-job driving time of young workers.  The Department is concerned
that the result of this legislation would increase the number of
automobile-related injuries and deaths caused by very young and
inexperienced drivers on the job.

The existing rules governing occupational driving for young workers, set
forth in Hazardous Occupations Order No. 2 (HO 2)', prohibit anyone under


the age of 18 from being employed to drive--with limited exception for
"incidental and occasional" driving of automobiles (and trucks weighing
6,000 pounds or less) under certain circumstances. H.R. 2327 would
greatly expand the exemption and allow teenagers--many of whom will have
just been licensed to drive--to spend as much as one-fifth of their
workweek behind the wheel on public roads and highways.  Sixteen and
17-year old youths could be employed to deliver pizzas or to shuttle
passengers to and from hotels, for example, as long as they did not exceed
the 20 percent limitation.

Although we realize that the proposed legislation seeks to reduce the risk
to teen drivers and the public by limiting their driving to a 50-mile
radius, we do not believe this offers sufficient protection.  Statistics
show that 80 percent of fatal accidents occur less than 25 miles from home.

The need to protect young workers in an increasingly fast-paced highly
competitive workplace is as real as when the child labor laws were first
enacted. According to a National Institute for Occupational Safety and
Health (NIOSH) study, automobile crashes are the number one cause of
occupational deaths for 16- and 17-year olds despite the fact that most
occupational driving is prohibited for this age group. At least a third
of all occupational fatalities involving young workers involved driving.
Newly licensed drivers are especially at risk, with higher crash rates
than any other age group. The American Automobile Association, the
National Safety Council and the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety
publicly support greater restrictions on teenage driving.  The Department
of Labor is aware of several examples of 16- and 17-year olds injured or
killed while driving.

The Department opposes the legislative changes proposed in H.R. 2327. We
believe that responsible public policy dictates that any modifications to
weaken child labor protections be carefully weighed against the potential
harm to the health and safety of these young workers.

We have heard concerns about the current regulations from those who
advocate more driving by teenage workers. We are looking at the
regulations to determine if there are changes that can be made to
accommodate these concerns without jeapordizing the safety and well-being
of these young workers.


The Office of Management and Budget advises that there is no objection to
the submission of this report to the Congress from the· standpoint of the
AdministrationD,s program.

                                           Sincerely,



                                           Alexis M. Herman
