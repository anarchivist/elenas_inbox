BR/EK:

FYI -- General McCaffrey has scheduled a Southwest Border meeting w/ the
whole spectrum of military and enforcement types for 2pm in his office.
While we're not invited, DOJ and Treasury called to ask me about his claim
that the President and Erskine have tasked him to get his border review
effort up and running.  The AG and Ray Kelly will be there.  So too will
reps from FBI, DEA, INS, DOD, Customs, and others.  I don't think any WH
types were invited.

Jose'
