        House floor action is expected tomorrow, Thursday (5/6), but we want to

        earlier.  Please provide comments/clearance by cob today.  Thank you.

        H.R. 3892 - English Language Fluency Act
         (Rep. Riggs (R) CA and 3 others)

        The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 3892, which would significantly
        amend the Bilingual Education Act. While there is a need to strengthen
        programs designed to help students with limited English proficiency (LEP)
        learn English, meet challenging standards in academic subjects, and
        successfully move into mainstream classes, H.R. 3892 would not accomplish
        these purposes.  It is a step in the wrong direction.
i


    H.R. 3892 is objectionable because it would:

    Force school districts to cut off services arbitrarily to students who
    need them, and deny funds to school districts if they fail to do so.

    Eliminate professional development programs that focus on the preparation
    of teachers, thereby exacerbating the current shortage of qualified
    bilingual and Eng"lish-as-a-second language teachers.

    Eliminate targeting of limited Federal funds on school districts with the
    greatest need and the highest quality programs, by replacing the current
    competitive grants program with a State block grant.

    Fail to include safeguards to prevent States and school districts from
    reducing their financial support for educating LEP students.

    Curtail necessary efforts by the Education Department to protect the civil
    rights of LEP students by voiding compliance agreements where local
    educational agencies (LEAs) have chosen bilingual education as the means
    of complying with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. This would generate
    costly and time-consuming law suits for LEAs and deny them the ability to
    resolve compliance issues voluntarily.

    The President has articulated a clear set of principles to strengthen
    education programs for LEP students.  This bill does not reflect those
    principles, and will not improve education programs for these students.
    It will not help them to learn English more rapidly, nor will it help them
    to meet challenging standards in academic subject areas.

    (Do Not Distribute Outside Executive Office of the President)

    This draft Statement of Administration Policy was developed by LRD (Connie
    Bowers) in consultation with the Department of Education (Hansen) and HRD
    (Mustain).    The position was agreed to by DPC (Cohen), WHLA (Johnson), and
    the Departments of Justice (Jones) and Interior
    (Cardinale) .

    OMB/LA Clearance:

    ADMINISTRATION POSITION TO DATE

    On June 4, 1998, Secretary Riley sent a letter to the House Committee on
    Education and the Workforce stating strong opposition to H.R. 3892 for the
    same reasons stated in this Statement of Administration Policy.   His
    letter also noted that the bill is inconsistent with the Administration's
    principles for strengthening bilingual education.   These principles are:
     (1) a goal thai students learn English within 3 years; (2) accountability
    for results, so that students not making adequate progress get the extra
    help they need and programs that do not measure up are improved; (3) local
    flexibility for determining how best to achieve results; and (4) assurance
    that an adequate supply of well-trained teachers is provided, to ensure
    quality no matter what instructional approach a community selects.    The
    letter also advised the Committee that "the President plans to send
    legislation to Congress fully consistent with these principles . .
    ED prepared a draft bill, but a decision was made not to transmit it to
    Congress.

    BACKGROUND
     '.\
i.



           The Bilingual Education Act was enacted originally in 1968 as part of the
           Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA).   It established a Federal
           policy of assisting local school districts to develop and implement new
           programs to meet the unique educational needs of children with limited
           English-speaking ability -- i.e., those "who come from environments where
           the dominant language is other than English." Over the years, the Act has
           been amended to broaden its coverage to any individual who has difficulty
           speaking, reading, writing, or understanding the English language, and
           whose difficulty denies them the opportunity to learn successfully in
           classrooms where English is the language of instruction.   In 1974, the
           Bilingual Education Act was amended to authorize transitional bilingual
           education (programs using children'S native language in instruction until
           they are proficient in English) as the basic instructional approach
           supported under the Act.  Although the Act has been amended several times
           since 1974, the emphasis on the transitional bilingual education approach
           remains.

           The Emergency Immigrant Education Act was enacted to provide funds to
           States to assist in the education of immigrant students who have been in
           the United States for less than three years. According to the committee
           report on H.R. 3892, more than half of recent program expenditures have
           been used on English language instruction or other bilingual education
           services.

           SUMMARY OF H.R.   3892

           H.R. 3892 would combine the Bilingual Education Act and the Emergency
           Immigrant Education Act and rename the combined Acts the English Language
           Fluency Act. The bill would replace the current competitive grant
           program, which targets funds to districts with the greatest need, with a
           State block grant program.  It would authorize "such sums" appropriations
           for FYs 1999-2003 and require that appropriated funds be used for programs
           designed to move students, in two years, to a classroom where instruction
           is not tailored to those learning English.  It would prohibit the use of
           funds to teach a child who has completed three years in a bilingual
           education program.

           In addition, H.R. 3892 would:

           void all current compliance agreements related to bilingual education
           between the Department of Education (ED) and local school districts or
           States receiving assistance for such programs under the ESEA.  Such
           agreements have emphasized the development of bilingual programs. The
           bill also would prevent the Secretary from entering into any future
           compliance agreements until the enforcement guidelines and compliance
           standards have been published in the Federal Register and become final
           regulations.

            Require that parents sign permission forms before their children could be
           placed in English instruction programs, and require schools to let parents
           remove their children from bilingual programs.  In addition, schools must
           allow parents to select the method of English language instruction --
           transitional bilingual education, English-immersion programs, et al --
           their child will receive if more than one method is offered.

           Prohibit States receiving funds under the Act from exempting children who
           are English language learners from State standardized tests, even if the
           test is given only in English.   Eliminate the direct funding of
           professional development programs, but allow States to use funds to assist
,   .
        personnel in meeting certification requirements for English language
        instruction and to train personnel in ways 'to improve such instruction.

        Change the name of ED's Office of Bilingual Education and Minority
        Languages Affairs to the Office of English Language Acquisition.

        PAY-AS-YOU-GO SCORING

        According to HRD (Mustain), H.R. 3892 wold not affect direct spending or
        receipts; therefore, it is not subject to the PAYGO provisions of the
        Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act.
