Q:   WHAT IS YOUR RESPONSE TO TODA V'S NEW YORK TIMES STORY THAT
     STATES THAT SENATOR BREAUX IS ASKING THE CONGRESS TO WAIT
     FOR THE MEDICARE COMMISSION BEFORE CONSIDERING THE
     PRESIDENT'S PROPOSAL TO OFFER MEDICARE FOR AMERICANS AGES
     55 TO 65?·

A:   We do not believe that this story fully reflects Senator Breaux's views on this issue.
     Senator Breaux has accurately stated that the Medicare Commission has been charged to
     look at this issue as well as a wide range of other issues in its evaluation of the challenges
     and possible solutions to strengthen the Medicare program. Having said this, Senator
     Breaux is not saying that he would explicitly oppose legislation in this area if the Senate
     Finance Committee and the Congress achieved consensus that we should move forward
     to pass legislation on this issue this year.

     The President's believes that this is a financially responsible and targeted policy
     that addresses a vulnerable population that the private insurance market has failed
     to serve. Americans ages 55 to 65 are one of the most difficult to insure populations: they
     have less access to and a greater risk of losing employer-based health insurance; and they
     are twice as likely to have healtl). problems. The policies proposed by the President are
     paid for and responsible, and will help people with few affordable choices for health
     insurance.

     While the work of the Medicare Commission will be extremely important, the
     President does not believe that the American public would sanction us putting on
     hold a targeted but important proposal that would help hundreds of thousands of
     Americans access health insurance. The President is confident that as Congress
     examines the needs of this population and the proposals to address it, the necessary
     consensus to move this legislation forward will be achieved.



Q:   ISN'T THIS EXACTLY THE WRONG TIME TO PROPOSE EXPANDING
     MEDICARE -- RIGHT WHEN THE COMMISSION IS GOING TO MAKE
     RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT THE OVERALL FINANCING OF THE
     PROGRAM?

A:   The President has a targeted proposal that is paid for within the Medicare program and
     therefore does not add any new burdens to the program. We believe this is a worthy goal
     that is not inconsistent with the charge of the Medicare Commission. The Medicare
     Commission will be working to develop proposals for the overall financing of
     Medicare. The President's proposed policy will not conflict with the Commission's
     work in this area.
