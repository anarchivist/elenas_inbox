     MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

     FROM:          BRUCE REED
                    GENE SPERLING
                    CHRIS JENNINGS

     SUBJECT:       Health Insurance Coverage Initiatives in the FY 1999 Budget

     Overview

             Throughout your Administration, you have worked to enact legislation to expand access
     to affordable health insurance. Your signing of the Balanced Budget Act included an
     unprecedented $24 billion investment for state-based children's health insurance programs. This
     historic initiative will clearly reduce the number of uninsured. However, there are other
     deserving populations whom we could target in our step-by-step reforms. These include the
     pre-65 year olds (referenced in the Medicare memo), workers between jobs, and workers in small
     businesses. In addition, we are working on possible proposals to expand Medicaid coverage to
     people with AIDS and disabilities through pilot programs. The policy development of these
     proposals is still underway, so we have not included them here.

             Taken together, these are not large initiatives, sununing to around $10 billion over 5
     years. This is les,:; th<Ul half of the health investments enacted as part of the Balanced Budget
     Act and less than a fraction of the premium assistance proposed in the Health Security Act.
     Having said this, none of your advisors believe the Medicare and Medicaid savings left after last
     year's deficit reduction effort are sufficient to fund these initiatives. There may be $0.5 to 1
     billion over 5 years in Medicaid savings, but those savings will be difficult to achieve and there
     may be other claims on them (e.g., child care, benefits to immigrants). It could also be argued
     that, given the link between tobacco and health care, any residual revenue from the tobacco
     settlement or a tax could be considered for coverage initiatives, particularly those related to
     children.

             Your advisors uniformly agree that we need to take all actions possible to achieve if not
     exceed your goal of increasing insurance coverage for 5 million children. A series of proposals
     are described to help accomplish that goal. There is less agreement on whether we address a
     new group of uninsured people in this budget. Labor strongly supports the workers between
     jobs demonstration; of all health initiatives in the budget, it is their highest priority. OMB also
     supports that demonstration if sufficient funds are available. While HHS believes that this
     proposal has merit, they are skeptical that it will achieve significant support since it has not in the
     past three years of trying.


                                                       1
                                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion

A.      CHILDREN'S HEALTH OUTREACH

        The Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) provides funds for coverage of
millions of working families' uninsured children, a population that previously had trouble
affording coverage. It also builds upon a strong Medicaid program that this Administration has
worked so hard to protect. However, important work remains to be done. In particular, we
need to work with states to enroll the millions of uninsured children in these programs.

        Medicaid eligible children are especially at risk of remaining uninsured. Over three
million uninsured children are eligible for Medicaid. Educating families about their options and
enrolling them in Medicaid has always been a problem, but it has recently become more
challenging. The number of children covered by Medicaid leveled off in 1995 and, according to
the Census, dropped by 6 percent in 1996. While some of this decline may be due to the lower
number of children in poverty, some part may also result from families' misunderstanding of
their children's continued eligibility for Medicaid regardless of the changes in welfare.

Options to Increase Outreach for Medicaid and the Children's Health           Insura~ce   Program

         To address the need for children's health outreach, we propose a series of policy options.
First, we could offer states enhanced match for enrolling children who are eligible but not
previously enrolled in Medicaid, giving states an incentive to find these children. Second, we
could build upon a new option in the Balanced Budget Act called "presumptive eligibility", that
essentially allows children to be given temporary Medicaid coverage while they are being
formally enrolled in CHIP or Medicaid. Third, we could modify the law to give states the
flexibility to use their 90 percent matching for Medicaid outreach authorized as part of TANF for
all children, not just those transitioning from welfare. Finally, we will continue to work on a
series of policies to simplify the application and enrollment process, making it easier to access
the system. Together, these initiatives could cost $1.1 to 1.6 billion over five years (or more
depending upon choices about the size of the incentive to states). Preliminary discussions with
NGA and some children's advocates suggest they strongly support these efforts. In addition, the
Administration is developing public-private partnerships to promote outreach.

         Enhanced match for outreach. One option for improving state outreach is to provide
 enhanced match to ellroll children who are eligible, but not previously enrolled in Medicaid. At
 the end of each year, if a state can document that it has increased its enrollment over its baseline,
 it would receive a increased matching amount per newly covered child or, alternatively, it could
receive match through an increase in administrative payments. This policy rewards states only if
they succeed in outreach, rather than just matching activities that mayor may not work.
Although its costs depend on the amount of the incentive and the ability to administer this system
 efficiently, we could probably constrain costs to $0.5 to 1 billion over five years.




                                                  2
                                                                          Hex-Dump Conversion

        Moving outreach to schools and child care sites. We could build upon the
presumptive eligibility provision in the Balanced Budget Act to make it easier to enroll children
in Medicaid and CHIP. This could be done by changing the law to allow schools and
appropriate child care sites, at the states' option, to determine "presumptive eligibility". This
means that certified people may, using a simple test, give a chiid up to two months of Medicaid
coverage on the spot as the formal application is processed. HCFA actuaries preliminarily
estimate that this would cost $400 million over 5 years (the cost of new coverage generated by
these efforts). Also, under the BBA, states that use presumptive eligibility must pay for its costs
out of the CHIP allotment, reducing the amount available for other coverage. States have
advised us that this is a disincentive to take this new option. HCFA actuaries are still working
on the costs.

        Accessing 90 percent matching funds for outreach. A third way to increase funding
for children's health outreach is to increase states' flexibility in using a special Medicaid fund set
aside in T ANF for outreach for children losing welfare. This $500 million fund is currently
allocated to states with a 90 percent matching rate for outreach activities to certain children .. We
could expand its use to all children, not just welfare children. HCFA actuaries preliminarily
estimate that this would cost $100 million over 5 years. NGA supports this change.

        Simplifying enrollment. A simple, accessible enrollment process from beginning to
end could encourage more families to enroll their children in Medicaid or CHIP. To help create
such a process, we propose several actions, all of which are low cost initiatives. First, we could
streamline the application process by simplifying Medicaid eligibility and by encouraging the use
of simple, mail-in applications. HeFA has already developed a model, single application form
for both Medicaid and CHIP. We could condition some of the financial incentives, described
above, on using a single or simple application. Second, we are reviewing the feasibility and
costs of a nationwide 1-800 number that will link families with their state or local offices.' Such
a number could be placed in public service announcements, on the bottom of school lunch
program applications, and on children's goods like diaper boxes, for example, allowing families
easy access to infonnation.

Departmental Positions

       There is unanimous support across agencies for focusing on children's health outreach.
For HHS and Treasury, it is their first priority in all health initiatives.. NECIDPC and OMB
believe that aggressive outreach will be needed to meet or exceed the Administration's goal of
covering 5 million uninsured children. Although we believe this policy will receive validation
by policy experts, children's advocates, and Governors alike, this package of outreach initiatives
may be a communications challenge so soon after the enactment of the $24 billion base
children's health program. In addition, even if this new investment is made, we cannot
guarantee that states will enroll all 3 million uninsured children who are eligible for Medicaid.
Given the link between children's health and tobacco, we should also consider whether outreach
could be done in the context of the tobacco settlement. We could, for example, consider


                                                  3
                                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion

allowing states to keep some of the Federal funds if they use them for children's outreach.
B.     WORKERS BETWEEN JOBS DEMONSTRATION

        Families who lose health insurance while they are between jobs are a small but important
group of uninsured Americans.' These families pay for health insurance for most of their lives,
but go through brief periods without coverage when they are temporarily unemployed. If they
experience a catastrophic illness during this transition, the benefit of their years' worth of
premium payments is lost. Worse, should a family lose insurance coverage during the period of
unemployment, they will not be protected by the provisions of the Kassebaum-Kennedy
legislation once they regain coverage. Coverage at that point could be subject to a new
pre-existing condition exclusion period.

Limited Demonstration

        This policy option is a modification of the program that we have carried in our last two
budgets. It would award grants to several states to provide temporary preinium assistance to
eligible low-income families. States would use this money to partially subsidize families'
premium payments for up to 6 months. To truly test how best to address this population's
needs, we would select states using a range of approaches like a COBRA-based subsidy,
Medicaid, or covering the parents of children covered by CHIP. Since it is a grant program, the
costs are a policy choice. To give a sense of the coverage for the options, last year's $10 billion
proposal over four years covered about 3.3 million people with incomes below 240 percent of
poverty. If we assume the same set of policy parameters, a demonstration of $1 billion over 5
years would coverage about 230,000, of $2.5 billion would cover about 600,000, and it would
take about $3.5 billion to cover about 800,000 people.

        An alternative way to design a demonstration would be to scale back the income levels of
the program. For instance, states could only receive assistance for persons whose income was
less than 100 percent of the poverty level in all states. Such options would probably cost at least
$3 billion over five years. It is important to note that it would not be possible to use either
Medicare or Medicaid savings to fund an initiative of this size.                              '

Departmental Positions

        On policy grounds, all of the agencies support this policy. It has been in our last two
budgets because of its merits. This policy remains Labor's first priority. They view the
unemployed uninsured as a particularly vulnerable and important group to target. They also
believe that this is a particularly important policy in the context of the trade debate and worker
insecurity issues. OMB would support this initiative iftbere are sufficient funds. HHS has
always been supportive of this policy but feels as though circumstances have not changed to
make this policy viable this year when it has not been in the past. They would focus the funds
on the children's outreach option. DPCINEC are concerned about dropping this policy
altogether and do support a demonstration. However, if resources are limited, we would

                                                                                 Automated Records Management System
        advocate for the children's outreach initiative before this proposal.    Hex-Dump Conversion

        C.     VOLUNTARY PURCHASING COOPERATIVES

                Workers in small firms are most likely to be uninsured. Over a quarter of workers in
        firms with fewer than 10 employees lack health insurance - almost twice the nationwide
        average. While 88 percent of workers in firms with 250 or more workers are offered health
        insurance, only 41 percent of workers in firms with less than 10 workers are offered coverage.
        This results in large part from the fact that the small group health insurance market does not
        function as well as the large group market. Studies have shown that administrative costs are
        higher and that small businesses pay more for the same benefits as larger firms.

        Grants to States.

                Given the disadvantages faced by small firms, the question is: are there policies that can
        make insurance more affordable for small businesses and their employees? In the last two
        budgets, we have included a policy to provide seed money for states to establish voluntary
        purchasing cooperatives. These cooperatives would allow small employers to pool their
        purchasing power to try to negotiate better rates for their employees. This year, we propose both
        the original policy and a variation: a competitive grant approach so that a more limited number of
        states could receive a smaller, but more targeted, pool of funds. The total costs would be $50 to
        $100 million over 5 years.

        Departmental Positions

                All agencies remain supportive of this policy and believe it should be included in this
        year's budget. It is important that we have some initiative that illustrates oUr understanding that
        a major problem of lack of insurance continues to exist in the small employer community. In
        the past, we have been unable to get this policy passed into law primarily because it has been
        viewed as an alternative to an initiative proposed by Congressman Fawell. His approach would
        make it easier for small businesses to self-insure and in so doing escape all state regulation.
        Governors and consumer groups have consistently opposed the Fawell approach, mostly
        because of the concem that the small group market will only be left with the most risky, most
        expensive groups, while all the low risk groups will move into the self-insured, non-regulated
        market. We have raised similar concerns and have also pointed out that a Fawell-type approach
        would eliminate all of the consumer protections state insurance regulation currently provides.
        Based on our preliminary conversations with Congressman Fawell, it may be that our impasse is
        resolvable since this is his last year as a Member of Congress and there are some compromises
        that seem within reach.
