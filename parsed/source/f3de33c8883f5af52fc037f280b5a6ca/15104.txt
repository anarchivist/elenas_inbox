    TEXT:
    The President is doing a joint press conference with Prime Minister
    Chretien on Tuesday of next week. We need to have updated Q&A by Monday
    at 9:00 so that Elena can review that morning and hand it in by 12:00 to
    the Press Office. No extensions folks.   Get this to me by E-Mail.

    Th~nks.
