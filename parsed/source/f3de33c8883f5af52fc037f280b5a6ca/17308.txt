TEXT:
The Women's Office is hosting a briefing/discussion for the 75+ state
coalition leaders from the National Network To End Domestic Violence with
Administration officials next Tuesday, October 14th, from 11:00 am - 12:30
pm, in the WHCC Truman Room. The group will be here for their annual
meeting and leadership institute from October 14-17. They have requested
this meeting to discuss issues relative to domestic violence including:
funding for battered women's shelters and programs; VAWA; Family Violence
Option; and welfare implementation particularly at the state level.

Audrey Tayse Haynes will moderate the panel of Administrations folks,
which includes: Bonnie Campbell (confirmed), Ann Rosewater (confirmed),
Olivia Golden (tentative), Susan Liss (tentative), and you (hopefully).
We would like for each of you to make 5-7 minute presentations the first
half of the program, and then open it up for discussion for the last half.

Please let me know as soon as you can if you or another DPC representative
will be able to participate. Give me a call at 6-7310 if you have any
questions.  Thanks!
