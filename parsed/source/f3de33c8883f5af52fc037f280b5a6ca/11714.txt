TEXT:
FYI, we have been refereeing a big fight between HHS and Justice re the
crime bill's health care fraud pieces.   It looks like they have
compromised with one another on almost everything except the nursing home
chain issue.   (The anti-kick-back issues were resolved by Justice
deferring to HHS). On the chain front, I am inclined to support Justice.
We will be trying to finalize this matter through a bfd meeting here
sometime early this week, (which of course you -- Elena and Hose -- will
be our guests of honor) ...
