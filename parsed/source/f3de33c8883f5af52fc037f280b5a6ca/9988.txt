Subject:         Hearing on Stem Cell Research

Thurm called today to inform us that Spector will be calling a hearing for
December 1st or 2nd on the promise of stem cell research.   Varmus and
others recently briefed Spector and Harkin on the science in this area.
Spector expressed an interest in addressing the ban on federal funding.
In addition, there are questions about whether the ban extends to
NIH-funded research that may be based on stem cells that are created as a
product of independently funded research.   We will clear testimony.   Let
me know if you want to discuss further.
