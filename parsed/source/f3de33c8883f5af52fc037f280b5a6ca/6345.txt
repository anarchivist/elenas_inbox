Question:   Won't raising the minimum wage hurt welfare-to-work efforts in the states?

Answer:     No. An increase in the minimum wage will support the goals of welfare reform
            by ensuring that wages keep up with the cost of living and people leaving welfare
            for work can support their families and break the cycle of dependency.

            This increase will not make it substantially more difficult for states to meet the
            welfare law's work participation rates (30 percent in FY 1998, rising to 40 percent
            in 2000 and 50 percent by 2002). While states that put welfare recipients in
            workfare programs will of course have to pay them the new minimum wage, in
            reality such workfare programs are only a small part of most states'
            welfare~to-work efforts, which focus primarily on getting welfare recipients
            private sector jobs but can also include work-related activities like job search,
            vocational education, and high school (for teenagers).

            After all, the purpose of welfare reform is to move welfare recipients into real,
            unsubsidized jobs. The President did not, by signing the legislation, intend to
            encourage States to establish large workfare programs. For states that do chose
            to create workfare programs, we have helped them pay the minimum wage
            by allowing them to count not only cash assistance, but also food stamps, toward
            the wage.

            And finally, state receive fixed block grants regardless of welfare caseloads,
            which have fallen dramatically -- by 20 percent or 2.4 million people since the
            new law took effect. This means that states that chose to invest in workfare
            programs should have the funds to do so.
