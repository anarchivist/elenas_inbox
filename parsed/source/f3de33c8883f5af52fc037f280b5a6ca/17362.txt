 TEXT:
 Gov. Whitman wrote the President a while back to complain that we are
 proposing to apply the
 FLSA to workfare participants.  She says it ought to be possible to pay
 the minimum wage and
 offer safety protections without the administrative burden of the full
 FLSA. Given her high profile,
 I wanted you to check over the attached draft response.  It's based
 largely on our talking points.


 Thank you for your letter regarding the application of the Fair Labor
 Standards Act to workfare
 participants.

  As you know, my Administration believes that worker protection laws, such
  as the Fair Labor
  Standards Act, should apply to workfare participants in the same way they
  apply to other workers.
  If a workfare participant counts as an "employee" under these laws, then
. she should get
  protection. No one doing real work should be paid a subminimum wage.

And we believe that paying working welfare recipients the minimum wage and
giving them
other worker protections will promote, not undermine, the goals of welfare
reform, because
it will give them the ability to support their families and break the
cycle of dependency.

Be assured that we will work with states to ensure that they can comply
with this policy, without
undue financial burden, while still meeting the welfare law's work
requirements. Of course,
if states place welfare recipients in private jobs, then the minimum wage
already applies.
And we are working to minimize costs associated with the application of
II""    r   h



       employment laws
       to workfare participants in other ways.

       Althoughgh we disagree on this issue, I hope that our common concerns for
       the benefit and
       well-being of all our nation's people will unite us as we address the
       challenges of moving
       people from welfare to work.
