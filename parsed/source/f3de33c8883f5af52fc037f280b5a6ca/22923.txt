BR/EK:

Don't know if these items merit a mention or heads up for tomorrow's
meeting, but I thought I'd mention them anyw~y.

(1) Crime Budget Hearing.  Ann Harkins called tonight to say that Senator
Hatch is pushing very hard for a DOJ budget oversight hearing the week of
3/22. This means that Bruce's suggestion for a month-long build-up of
crime events/leaks must be a priority for March. We should think about
raising this at Senior Staff as soon as possible.

 (2) Cyber-stalking. In addition to the previously discussed announcements
for tomorrow's VAWA event, the VP will be directing DOJ to study
cyber-stalking and report back with some recommendations.   Folks asked me
late tonight for my "sign off" on this proposal.   I expressed that I was
fine withem doing it and didn't want to hold up their event, but that I
would not personally recommend getting out in front of this issue -- and
committing to a policy fix in the near-term -- without a clear sense of
what the recommendations would be.   So, although I chose not to veto this
proposal, I wouldn't give it my seal of policy approval either. Mary and
I had both recommended to the VP's folks that they focus tomorrow's event
on VAWA II, not cyber-stalking, and helped them clear the Administration's
position in support of Biden's bill.   I only raise this because I know
you've had some exchanges w/Pat on DPC clearance, and because her staff
asked that I send you two an e-mail saying I was okay with the proposal.
Well, take this is as my last-minute, qualified okay to their proposed
study.

      Transportation called this morning to correct the number of injuries
      prevented each year by this new child safety seat rule from 20,000 to
      3,000. The following are the changes to the announcement and the Q&A:

      In his radio address today, President Clinton will announce a major step
      to protect our children -- a new rule requiring a single standardized
      system for installing child safety seats in cars and light ,trucks. Under
      the rule, all new child seats will have three standard attachments -- one
      on top and two at the base -- and all new cars and light trucks will have
      standard anchors in the back seat designed to link to these child seat
      attachments. The rule is expected to prevent as many as 50 deaths and
      3,000 injuries of children each year.

      Q:      How many lives will this rule save?   How many injuries will this
      rule prevent?

      A:      Annually, motor vehicle crashes result in 600 child fatalities
      and 70,000 injuries for children less than five years old.  Even though
      child safety seats are very effective in reducing death and injury, their
      effectiveness is substantially reduced due to incorrect use and occasional
      incompatibility with the vehicle seat and belt systems. This rule is
      expected to prevent as many as 50 child deaths and 3,000 injuries each
      year.  ==================== ATTACHMENT   I ====================

                     PRESIDENT CLINTON ANNOUNCES NEW RULE
                   TO IMPROVE SAFETY OF CHILDREN IN VEHICLES
                                  February 27, 1998

In his radio address today, President Clinton will announce a major step to protect our children --
a new rule requiring a single standardized system for installing child safety seats in cars and light
trucks. Under the rule, all new child seats will have three standard attachments -- one on top and
two at the base -- and all new cars and light trucks will have standard anchors in the back seat
designed to link to these child seat attachments. The rule is expected to prevent as many as 50
deaths and 3,000 injuries of children each year.

Current System Puts Children at Risk
Child safety seats are the most effective safety device to protect very young children traveling in
automobiles. When properly installed, they reduce the risk of death or serious injury to infants
by 70 percent, and they cut the fatality and injury rate for children aged 1 to 4 in half. But
according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), child safety seats
are not properly installed over 70 percent of the time, SUbjecting children to needless risk of
death or injury. With over 100 models of child seats and 900 models of passenger cars now on
the road, some car seats simply do not fit safely in some vehicles. And even when child safety
seats can fit properly in a vehicle, installation methods are often time-consuming and difficult,
and the wide variety of these methods confuses many parents.

New Standardized System Will Save Lives
The new rule will require all new child safety seats to have three standard attachments, one on
top and two at the base. The rule also will require all new vehicles to have two sets of standard
anchors installed in the back seat that will link to the child seat attachments. The anchors in the
vehicle will be clearly visible and easily accessible, and parents will be able to attach child seats
safely to the anchors in a matter of moments. The rule will be phased in over a period of three
years; in the interim, new child seats will remain installable with seat belts, to ensure
compatibility with older vehicles. According to NHTSA estimates, this new standardized
system for installing child safety seats, when fully phased in, will save as many as 50 children
from death and 20,000 children from injury every year.

New Rule Builds on Prior Efforts to Promote Safety on the Road
This new rule is the latest in a series of actions by President Clinton to promote safety on the
road. In May 1995, the Administration launched a comprehensive plan to preserve the benefits
of air bags while eliminating their risks. In June 1995, the President called on Congress to pass
legislation requiring all states to pass zero-tolerance laws for youth who drink and drive; a few
months later, Congress passed that legislation, the President signed it, and today all states have
zero tolerance laws. And in November 1998, the Administration announced a Blue Ribbon
Passenger Safety Panel that will recommend strategies to increase the use of booster seats for
children 4 to 8 years and the use of seat belts for children 8 to 16 years.

                                           2/24/99

Q:   What did the President announce today?

A:   The President announced a final rule to require a new universal method of installing child
     safety seats in cars and light trucks. Currently, parents use the vehicle seat belts to install
     child seats, with different models of seats requiring different methods for installation.
     The variety of methods confuse many parents, and using seat belts to attach seats is often
     difficult and time-consuming. In the future, each new child seat will have three standard
     attachments (one at the top and two at the base). New cars and light trucks will be
     equipped with standard anchors in the back seat designed to link to these child seat
     attachments. The seats can be attached to the anchors in moments, ensuring that children
     are fully protected when they ride in vehicles.

Q:   How many lives will this rule save? How many injuries will this rule prevent?

A:   Annually, motor vehicle crashes result in 600 child fatalities and 70,000 injuries for
     children less than five years old. Even though child safety seats are very effective in
     reducing death and injury, their effectiveness is substantially reduced due to incorrect use
     and occasional incompatibility with the vehicle seat and belt systems. This rule is
     expected to prevent as many as 50 child deaths and 3,000 injuries each year.

Q:   When will this rule take effect for cars and light trucks? For child seats?

A:   For vehicles, eighty percent of new cars will be equipped with the top tether attachment
     points starting September 1, 1999, and all new vehicles (cars and light trucks) will be
     equipped with the top tether attachment points by September 1,2000. The lower
     anchorages are phased in over 3 years, covering 20% of vehicles beginning September 1,
     2000,50% of vehicles by September 1,2001, and all vehicles after September 1, 2002.

     For the child seats all new child seats will be equipped with an upper tether by September
     1, 1999, and all new child seats will be equipped with the two lower attachments by
     September 1,2002. New child seats will also remain install able with regular vehicle seat
     belts to ensure compatibility with older vehicles and aircraft.


Q.   How effective are child safety seats?

A.   According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), when
     properly used, child safety seats reduce the risk of fatality for infants by 70% and for
     toddlers by over half.

                                                    Hex.()urnp Conversion
A:   According to NHTSA, the additional amount that consumers will have to spend on a new
     child seat will be as low as $15. Typically, child safety seats range in price from $50 to
     $100. The additional cost for a vehicle as a result of this rule is estimated at between $3
     and $7.


Q:   How does this differ from what the Administration proposed earlier?

A:   The Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), announced by the President on February
     15, 1997, proposed that every vehicle and child safety seat be equipped with either
     dedicated "mini-seat belts" for installing child safety seats, or two fixed rigid one-inch
     bars in the vehicle's back seat to which a child seat would attach. The final rule requires
     the latter approach. People commenting on the NPRM overwhelmingly favored having
     the government deciding on a single, universal attachment system.
