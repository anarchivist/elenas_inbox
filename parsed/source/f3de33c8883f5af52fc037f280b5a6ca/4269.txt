TEXT:
I wanted to let you both know that I successfully pushed for DPC to
co-chair the decision process on Supefund with CEQ and the NEC.  I believe
that Superfund, more so than climate change, is the only opportunity to
significantly affect environmental policy in this Congress. The policy
rationale for the DPC being involved is because it impacts public health
and safety.

Of course, this means that one of you will need to co-chair one of the
meetings at some point, I hope that is OK, but this is an important
issue.

For your information, Administrator Browner is in the process of meeting
with Sens. Smith, Chafee, Baucus, and Lautenberg on compromise language.
The economic agencies are very nervous about this because of the
experience with Browner on Ozone/PM.   I believe strongly that it is in
the best interest of the President to get a Superfund bill.  I believe
this is the Administrator's view as well as CEQ's.
