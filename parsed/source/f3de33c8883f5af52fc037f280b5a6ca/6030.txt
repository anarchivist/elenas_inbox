TEXT:
Bill Lee will be in Detroit on Monday making a speech in celebration of
MLK Day.  The speech was originally going to be on Hate Crimes but with
our discussion this morning we are thinking it best to have him speak on
the EEOC announcement and reinforce the VP's remarks.   We also thought it
would be useful to have Lee in the stories coming out on Monday.  To that
end, can we set up a time for you to brief Bill on the policy and then
could you refer reporters to Bill for comment after you have spoken with th
em on Sunday? Please call or page me.   Thanks
