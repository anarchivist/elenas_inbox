MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:             JOHN HILLEY & GENE SPERLING

SUBJECT:           COMP TIME/ FAMILY MEDICAL LEAVE ACT LEGISLATION

I.      BACKGROUND/ANALYSIS

This memorandum offers options for how to achieve the optimal outcome from
the current
legislative debate on comp time and expansion of the Family and Medical
Leave Act
(FMLA) .

This week and next week, the House and Senate labor committees are holding
hearings
regarding comp time legislation: the Ballenger bill in the House and the
Ashcroft bil~ in the
Senate. Both bills address only comp time and not FMLA expansion, and they
provide fewer
guarantees of employee choice and fewer protections against potential abuse
than your bill,
which was sent to Congress last September. For example, the Republican
bills:
     1)         Do not exclude vulnerable workers;
     2)         Do not include special protections for workers whose
employers go
                bankrupt or shut down unexpectedly;
     3)         Do not guarantee real choice for employees because they allow
                employers to refuse employees+ use of comp time if it would
 unduly
                disrupt operations. (Your bill, on the other hand, allowed
employees to


                take comp time for FMLA purposes at any time, and to take it
for other
                purposes with two weeks notice unless it would cause the
employer
                 substantial and grievous injury. );
     4)         Allow employers to cash out employees+ comp time over 80
hours,
               thereby denying them the use of comp time;
     5)        Provide weaker remedies for violations. Your bill has
solutions to all of
               these problems.

In addition, the Ashcroft bi·ll has additional provisions that would
effectively eliminate the 40
hour week by allowing employers to establish 80 hour biweekly schedules and,
in certain
circumstances, ~o pay employees straight time, not time and a half, for
hours worked over 40
in a week or 80 in two weeks.    Sen. Jeffords plans to mark up the Ashcroft
bill on February
26, and Rep. Ballenger plans to mark up his bill in early March.

Senator Dodd, Sen. Murray, Rep. Clay, and Rep. Maloney have instead
introduced bills to
expand the FMLA.    The bills introduced by Maloney and Murray would expand
FMLA for
an additional twenty-four hours for the purposes of routine medical care for
children and
elderly parents or school related activities, similar to your bill. The
bills introduced by Dodd
and Clay would lower the threshold of FMLA applicability from 50 employees
to 25
employees, which would cover an additional 10 million employees in small
businesses.

The FMLA bills have support from women+s groups and the labor movement, both
of which
are more enthusiastic about dropping the threshold than providing an
additional 24 hours of
leave. The labor movement strongly opposes the Republican comp time bills,
and finds the
provisions in the Ashcroft bill that eliminat.e the 40-hour work week to be
particularly
offensive. Most Republicans oppose any expansion of FMLA.

 The current legislative strategy. among congressional Democratic leaders is
·to criticize the
 comp time bills and try to add the various FMLA expansions to the Republican
 bills. Your
 bill has not been introduced, nor is there any Democratic version of a comp
 time bill.  The
 labor movement has requested that the Administration threaten to veto any
 bill that doesn+t 1)
 improve the comp time provisions to provide real choice and real protections
 for employees,
 and 2) link FMLA and comp time.

II.   ACTION-FORCING EVENT

The Vice President will be addressing the AFL-CIO at an annual meeting on


February 18 and
will be forced to address these issues either in remarks or in questions and
answers. Thus, a
decision must be made now regarding whether to adopt a strategy of insisting
on linkage
between FMLA and comp time, and whether to issue any veto threats.  The
options are laid
out below.  In each case, the Vice President would articulate the
Administration position on
February 18 at the AFL-CIO meeting.

III. OPTIONS

1.   Threaten to veto the bill if your principles are not addressed. The
Administration
     would layout a set of principles needed for a bill to be truly family
friendly. We
     would say that the bill should include FMLA expansion, and that any
bill that doesn+t
     meet certain principles will be vetoed, but we would not link a veto to
FMLA
     expansion. These principles are embodied in your bill from last year:

     A) Real Choice for Employees, including the right to take comp time
when needed for
     FMLA purposes, the right to choose to use comp time for any purpose
with two weeks
     notice to their employer unless use of comp time will cause substantial
and grievous
     injury to the employer, the right to cash out comp time for overtime
pay on 15 days
     notice and employers can+t choose to cash out comp time; and

     B) Real Protection Against Employer Abuse, including the various
protective
     provisions in your bill that are not present in the Republican bills,
such as exclusions
     for vulnerable workers, special protections in case employers go
bankrupt or close
     down unexpectedly, a prohibition against employers+ substituting comp
time for paid
     vacation or sick leave benefits, a prohibition against employers
penalizing employees
     who choose overtime pay instead of comp time, and strong provisions for
     enforcement.

      C) Preservation of Basic Worker Rights.  The Administration would
threaten a veto of
      any bill that eliminates the 40 hour work week, as the Ashcroft bill
does.

Pros: A. Would strengthen the position of congressional Democrats arguing
to improve the
      Republican bills. Would encourage congressional Republicans to
negotiate in an effort
      to produce a bill that would become law.

     B. If the strategy resulted in changes to the bills, it would
significantly improve upon
     bills that presently do not carry gu
