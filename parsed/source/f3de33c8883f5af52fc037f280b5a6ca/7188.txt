                                           Q&A
                                   International Tobacco

Q.   There appears to be a growing controversy over the international provisions of the
     McCain bill. What is the Administration's position on this?

A.   Tobacco use is a global health problem. Comprehensive tobacco legislation should
     address this problem by including funding to discourage youth smoking abroad through
     multilateral and bilateral efforts designed to promote education and public health. This
     will enable us to provide technical assistance to other countries, and will support
     diplomatic, media and grass roots efforts designed to reduce youth smoking.

Q.   Does the Administration support the provisions in the McCain bill?

A.   We certainly share the goals of these provisions. Our concerns are instead with the
     prescribed means. Some of these provisions raise important constitutional and foreign
     policy concerns. As we move forward in this area, we want to ensure that international
     tobacco control legislation does not interfere with our diplomatic and trade priorities or
     result in policies which are unenforceable abroad.

Q.   But don't we have a successful example of exporting US laws overseas -- such as, the
     Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (designed to prevent bribery of foreign officials)?

A.   Actually, the fight against corrupt practices in overseas business has become more
     successful once an international consensus was reached. Similarly, on tobacco, we need
     to work with other countries and encourage them to adopt laws similar to ours in order to
     reduce youth smoking on a global scale. Specifically, we need to work bilaterally and
     multilaterally through the World Health Organization and other entities to share our
     experiences and success with other nations, encouraging them to adopt laws similar to
     ours designed to reduce advertising and marketing to children.

Q.   Do you support the expanded Doggett language in the McCain bill?

A.   We support the Doggett rider contained in the FY98 Appropriations bill, which would
     prevent the federal government from promoting the sale or manufacture of US tobacco
     products overseas. This is current US policy, and we firmly stand behind it. In fact, we
     would like to see this language permanently codified. Weare concerned that the language
     contained in the McCain bill, however, could prevent us from negotiating tariff
     reductions on all other goods or enforcing US trade agreement rights. We believe that
     easing tariffs on tobacco products should never be the primary objective of any tariff
     negotiation, and that health considerations must be factored into any trade policy
     decisions regarding tobacco.

Q.   Do support the funding provisions in the McCain bill for international tobacco
     control efforts?

A.   Comprehensive tobacco legislation needs significant funding to discourage youth
     smoking abroad through bilateral and multilateral efforts designed to promote public
     health and education. This funding will enable us to provide technical assistance to other
     countries, and should support diplomatic, media and grass roots efforts designed to
     reduce youth smoking. The funding should be channeled through NGOs, federal
     agencies such as the CDC, and international organizations which have expertise in
     international public health efforts, such as the World Health Organization and the World
     Bank.

Q.   What level of annual funding for international tobacco control efforts do you
     support?

A.   $200 million.

Q.   The McCain bill creates a new NGO called ACT (the American Center on Global
     Health and Tobacco). Do you support this?

A.   Funding for international tobacco control efforts should go both to NGOs, such as ACT,
     and governmental agencies which have expertise in international public health initiatives,
     such as the CDC, and international organizations such as the World Health Organization
     and the World Bank. Funding should also be available to the Departments of State,
     Commerce and HHS to train personnel regarding tobacco policies and to work with other
     countries in promoting tobacco control policies.

Q.   Do you support a 2 cent per pack fee in order to fund international tobacco control
     efforts? .

A.   The 2-cent per pack fee for funding international tobacco control efforts in the McCain
     bill appears to be an unconstitutional tax on exports. Funding for international tobacco
     control efforts should instead come from the overall tobacco trust fund.

Q.   Then how could you guarantee funding for international tobacco control efforts?

A.   We would make international tobacco control funding an explicit policy priority within
     the annual appropriations process.

Q.   Do you support the code of conduct language in the McCain bill which would
     require other nations to abide by our advertising and marketing restrictions?

A.   We support working through the World Health Assembly on an international framework
     agreement which would allow us to work, on a multilateral basis, to encourage other
     nations to adopt laws similar to our own. In this manner, we can work to reduce
                                                     Hex-Dump Conve;sion

     marketing and advertising to children overseas. We are concerned that the McCain bill's
     approach of working on a unilateral basis to impose US laws on other nations will result
     in policies that are ineffective and unenforceable overseas. In addition, they raise
     extraterritorial issues that will be viewed with hostility by foreign nations, diverting
     attention and efforts away from solutions to these public health problems.

Q.   Is smoking really a global problem?

A.   Tobacco is expected to kill about 500 million people alive in the world today, including
     more than 200 million oftoday's children and teenagers. This will exceed deaths from
     HIV, malaria, tuberculosis and maternal conditions combined. By 2030, based on
     current smoking rates, tobacco will kill about 10 million people annually, with more than
     70 percent of those deaths occurring in developing nations.

Q.   What role do US tobacco companies play in terms of worldwide sales of tobacco?

A.   US companies and their subsidiaries and affiliates supply approximately one-fifth of the
     world's supply of cigarettes. In 1996, more than 70 percent of cigarettes sold by Philip
     Morris, and 57 percent ofthose sold by RJR Nabisco, were sold overseas.
