MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES
              SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE


SUBJECT:           INITIATIVE TO IMPROVE THE SAFETY OF BOTH
               DOMESTIC AND IMPORTED FRUITS AND VEGETABLES


        During my Administration, we have taken significant steps to strengthen our entire food
safety system, including expanded research, education, and surveillance activities. We also have
put into place enhanced safety standards relating particularly to meat, poultry, and seafood
products. These measures will greatly improve the safety of the nation's food supply.

         We need to build on these efforts, and today I ask you to do so by focusing on the safety
of fruits and vegetables. Although the produce Americans eat is very safe, we can and must do
even better, including with respect to produce imported from foreign countries. Last year, 38
percent of the fruit and 12 percent of the vegetables consumed by Americans came from
overseas. We must ensure that these fruits and vegetables are as safe as those produced in the
United States, especially as we upgrade our own domestic standards.

         I will propose legislation that will help accomplish this task. This legislation will
authorize the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to halt imports of fruits, vegetables, and
other food from any foreign country whose food safety systems and standards are not on par with
those of the United States. This authority, which is similar to authority the USDA currently has
to halt the importation of meat and poultry, will enable the FDA to prevent the importation of
potentially unsafe foreign food products. In addition, I will provide the necessary funds in my
Fiscal Year 1999 budget to enable the FDA to expand dramatically its international inspection
force. With this greatly increased ability to inspect food safety conditions abroad and at our
ports of entry, the FDA will be able to determine when to halt the importation of fruits and
vegetables from foreign countries.

        At the same time, I direct you to take administrative actions that will better ensure the
safety of fruits and vegetables coming from abroad, while continuing to improve the safety of
domestic produce. You should accelerate any food safety research that is necessary to support
these actions.

        First, I direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Secretary of
Agriculture to report within 90 days with a plan on improving the use of existing and projected
resources to monitor agricultural and manufacturing practices abroad, assist foreign countries to
improve those practices where necessary, and prevent the importation of unsafe produce,
including the detection of unsafe food at the dock or border. I urge you to consider ways to
target inspection and testing resources toward those new areas where problems are most likely to
occur.

       Second, I direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services, in partnership with the
                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion
Secretary of Agriculture and in close cooperation with the agricultural community, to issue
within one year guidance on good agricultural practices and good manufacturing practices for
fruits and vegetables. This guidance should take into account differences in both crops and
regions and should address potential food safety problems throughout the food distribution and
marketing system. By providing the first-ever specific safety standards for fruits and vegetables,
the guidance will improve the agricultural and manufacturing practices for all those seeking to
sell produce in the U.S. market. To ensure that this guidance has the widest possible effect, I
also direct the development of coordinated outreach and educational activities.

       These steps, taken together and in coordination with the legislation I will send to
Congress, will improve the safety of fruits and vegetables for all Americans. I will also direct
the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Secretary of Labor, and any other
necessary agencies to provide you with assistance in achieving this goal.
                                                                Hex-Dllmp Conversion
                         Initiative to Improve Safety of Both Domestic
                              and Imported Fruits and Vegetables

        Today President Clinton announced an initiative to improve the safety of fruits and
vegetables, including those imported from foreign countries. This initiative builds on the
President's prior actions on food safety -- including a new early warning system to detect
outbreaks of foodborne illness as quickly as possible; and enhanced safety standards for meat,
poultry, and seafood products.

       Recognizing the need to ensure that imported fruits and vegetables are as safe as those
produced in the United States, the President today proposed legislation that would authorize the
FDA to halt imports of fruits, vegetables, and other food products produced in countries that do
not meet U.S. food safety standards. Last year, 38 percent of the fruit and 12 percent ofthe
vegetables consumed by Americans carne from overseas. The President also directed the Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to work
cooperatively to improve the safety of fruits and vegetables by developing guidelines for
producers and industry to follow. This initiative has four parts.

Enhanced FDA Oversight for Imported Foods. The President proposed legislation that will
authorize the FDA to halt imports of fruits, vegetables, and other food products from any foreign
country with food safety systems and standards that are not on par with those of the United
States, or when a foreign facility has refused to allow an FDA inspection. This authority, which
is similar to authority the USDA currently has to halt the importation of meat and poultry, will
enable the FDA to prevent the importation of potentially unsafe food products. In coordination
with international agencies and organizations, the FDA, USDA, and the CDC will develop
information to help target import inspection and testing resources. The Administration also
supports efforts on the part of the FDA and USDA to encourage exporting countries to develop
their own good practices to address potential food safety issues in those countries. The FDA and
USDA will engage in technical assistance, training, and cooperative research efforts with
exporting countries to improve the safety of imported fruits and vegetables.

Development of Good Agricultural and Good Manufacturing Practices Guidance. FDA
and USDA will work cooperatively with the fruit and vegetable industry and others to develop
good agricultural and good manufacturing practices guidance within one year. This guidance
will take into account differences in both crops and regions and will address potential food safety
problems throughout the food production and distribution systern such as sanitation and water
quality. The guidance will improve the agricultural and manufacturing practices of all those
seeking to sell produce in the U.S. market, both foreign and domestic. To ensure that this
guidance has the widest possible effect, the FDA and USDA will develop a series of coordinated
outreach and educational activities.

Expanded Federal Resources for Testing and Inspecting Fruits and Vegetables. The
President called for an increase in FDA funding in FY 99 to allow the FDA to expand
dramatically its international inspection force. These funds will allow the hiring of new FDA
inspectors to inspect food controls in the exported country and to inspect food imported into this
                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion

country and will support research to improve our knowledge of disease-causing pathogens in
food, including, but not limited to, developing methods to detect and prevent contamination.

Improve the use of existing and projected resources for food safety. The President directed
the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Secretary of Agriculture to report within 90
days with a plan to improve the use of existing and projected resources to monitor agricultural
and manufacturing practices abroad, assist foreign countries to improve these practices, and
prevent the importation of unsafe produce, including detecting unsafe food at the dock and
border. The President urged consideration of ways to target inspection and testing resources
toward those areas where problems are most likely to occur.
