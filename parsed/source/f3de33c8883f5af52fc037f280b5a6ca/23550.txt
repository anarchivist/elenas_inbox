TEXT:
Coverdell's staff called the Labor Committee to find out if there are any
pending labor nominees.   Last year, at the end of the session, he held up
the noms over guestworker issues. Apparently, he plans to do it again
this year. This year, there are many nominees that could be affected [of
course, in this Congress, they might never move anyway] .   I know we have
not had a discussion on this one for a while but I wanted to mention that
it once again ·looms its ugly head.  I don't know if we can get out of this
box -- or whether it's worth it considering the odds of moving labor noms
-- but I'd appreciate your guidance.
