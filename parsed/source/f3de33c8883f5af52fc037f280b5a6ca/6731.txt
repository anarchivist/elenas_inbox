TEXT:
Today's Jeffords hearing quickly disintegrated into ad hominum attacks.
The fight started among Republicans, with Senators Gregg and Coats lashing
into Jeffords for not allowing them to offer Sense of the Senate
amendments, saying that he was being "dictatorial." Then Kennedy jumped in
and started calling the GOP members shills for the tobacco industry.

Jeffords recognized Kennedy for an amendment -- which ticked off Gregg and
Coats even more, and to get back at Jeffords, Coats and Gregg voted for
the Kennedy amendment. The amendment strengthened the youth smoking
targets (so the industry must reach an 80 percent reduction over 10 years
instead of 60 percent) and increased penalties on companies that
repeatedly miss the. targets.

Having acted on one amendment in 2 1/2 hours, Jeffords gaveled the hearing
down and said he would try to reconvene it on Friday. People seem to think
this will be delayed, and the committee won't reconvene until next week.
