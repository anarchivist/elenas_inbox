HRC News Release

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

CONGRESS POISED TO OFFER TWO AMENDMENTS THAT WOULD HARM GAY AMERICANS AND
PEOPLE LIVING WITH AIDS

Riggs And Hilleary Amendments Latest Salvo In Right-Wing's Attacks Against
Gay People

 WASHINGTON    Two amendments with grave implications for gay Americans
are
expected to be introduced today to the VA/HUD appropriations bill,
according to the Human Rights Campaign. The Hilleary amendment would
drastically cut housing funds for people with AIDS.  The Riggs amendment'
would seek to prohibit San Francisco from using VA-HUD funds to implement
its city ordinance against discrimination in city contracts.
        "With all the other major issues facing this country, Americans
should be alarmed about the inordinate amount of time Congress continues
to
waste in their attempt to appease the Far Right," said HRC political
director Winnie Stachelberg.
        The Riggs amendment, sponsored by California Republican
Congressman
Frank Riggs,  has been modified five times to make it more palatable.
Opposition to the Riggs amendment includes the U.S. Conference of Mayors.
        "The Riggs amendment is a thinly veiled attempt to attack San
Francisco and micro-manage the city. The modification of this amendment
is
like putting sugar on top of a rotten egg and calling it candy.  In the


end, San Francisco is still going to get burned," said Stachelberg.
        The Hilleary amendment, sponsored by Tennessee Republican Van
Hilleary, would freeze funding for the Housing Opportunities for Persons
With AIDS (HOPWA ) at fiscal year 98 levels. Van Hilleary says this is
possible because the annual number of AIDS cases has declined by 6%.
        "This drop in mortality is due to people living longer because of
new AIDS drugs.   However, the success of these new drug treatments is
dependent on people having a steady place to live where they can stick to
the often rigorous drug regimens.   If the Hilleary amendment passes,  many
people would not be able to continue effective treatment," said HRC senior
health policy advocate Seth Kilbourn.
        The Hilleary amendment would disproportionately affect veterans.
According to the Veterans Administration, 100,000-150,000 veterans are
living with HIV and roughly 17,000 access care through the veterans care
system.   Thirty percent of the homeless in America today are
veterans.
        The Human Rights Campaign is the largest national lesbian and gay
political organization, with members throughout the country. It
effectively
lobbies Congress, provides campaign support, and educates the public to
ensure that lesbian and gay Americans can be open, honest, and safe at
home, at work, and in the community.
