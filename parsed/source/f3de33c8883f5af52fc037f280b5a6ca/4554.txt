    1996
                                                                                          (Senate)




                          S. 25 - Senate Campaign Finance Reform Act of 1997(?)
                                  (McCain (R) Arizona and (?)cosponsors)

    The Administration strongly supports Senate passage of S. 25, as amended by the Senate on
    (xxxxx), for the reasons explained in the attached letter from the President dated September 23.

    This bipartisan legislation includes many proposals that have been endorsed by the President
    since 1992. It will limit put an end to the "soft money" system, increase disclosure on
    independent expenditures, and enforce strict prohibitions on contributions from foreign nationals.
     S. 25 will open the political process and shift power from special interests to ordinary citizens.

    S. 25 addresses many of the most pressing needs for reform. While the legislation does not
    include all the elements of reform we believe are needed, such as voluntary spending limits,
    restrictions on Political Action Committee (PAC) contributions, and free and discounted
    broadcast time, we consider S.25 to be an important first step and believe it represents the best
    opportunity to enact meaningful reform in this Congress.

                                                   *****

                                              September 23, 1997


              Dear:


           Senators McCain and Feingold have pledged to bring their campaign reform legislation
           to a vote. When that happens, the American people will be watching. I encourage you
           to act responsibly and support passage of this long-overdue, bipartisan legislation.

           This measure is of the utmost importance, and it deserves full consideration on the
           Senate floor. If any attempt is made to bring this bill up in a manner that would
           preclude sufficient time for debate, I will call on Congress to stay in session until all of
           the critical elements are fully considered.

           There is a real need for reform. The amount raised by both political parties is doubling
           every four years. And as candidates are forced to spend ever greater amounts of time
                                                                Automated Records \:,ana",ement System
                                                                                     '   a

                                                                Hex.Dump Conversion               2

     raising ever larger amounts of money, the people's business suffers.        We have an
     obligation to restore the public trust.

     The bipartisan measure that Senators McCain and Feingold intend to bring to the floor
     is balanced and effective. It addresses many of the most pressing needs for reform. It
     does not include every reform that I believe necessary. But it is an important first
     step --and it represents the only real opportunity to enact meaningful reform in this
     Congress. Any attempts to attach amendments that would make it unpalatable to one
     party or another are nothing less than attempts to defeat campaign finance reform. And
     a vote to filibuster this measure is nothing short of a vote to maintain the system

     The Honorable
     Page Two


     that favors special interests over the public good. For years, the special interests and
     their allies have filibustered reform. But this year, the American people will hold
     accountable those who vote to maintain the status quo.

     Despite formidable odds, the Congress faces the best opportunity in a generation to
     enact campaign finance reform. Let us work together in a bipartisan spirit, as we have
     throughout this legislative session, to thwart special interests who seek to smother
     reform and deny the will of the people. I urge you to support the bipartisan efforts
     embodied in the McCain-Feingold proposal, permit the Senate to debate their bill, and
     vote to enact these needed changes to our political system.

                             Sincerely,
