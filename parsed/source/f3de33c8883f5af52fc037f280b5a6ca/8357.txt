MEMORANDUM FOR ALL SENIOR STAFF

 FROM:                   VIRGINIA M. APUZZO
                         ASSISTANT TO THE PRESIDENT FOR
                            MANAGEMENT AND ADMINISTRATION

 SUBJECT:                Internship Application Deadlines


The deadline for applications for the fall session of the Intern Program
(September 2 - December 23, 1998) is Wednesday, June 24th. Although
completed application packets must be postmarked by this date, the Intern
Office will accept Senior Staff recommendations related to completed
applications through Thursday, July 3rd.

Because we will begin evaluating applications the week of June 29th, it is
important that we closely follow the deadlines identified above.  We
anticipate notifying applicants about the fall session of the program
during the week of July 20, 1998.

 Please share these deadlines with your staff and feel free to contact the
 Intern Office (x62742) or myself (x62861) with any questions.

Thank you.

As a reminder, to save e-mail server space, please delete this message
when you are finished.
