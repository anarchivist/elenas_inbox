TEXT:
I just heard from Eve Maldonado of the California League of Cities. They
are hopeful of Administration support for a compromise they are working on
in the House and Senate today that would protect the right of five local
juristictions to continue their Tobacco litigation: San Francisco, Los
Angeles, NYC, Cook County, and Erie County. While they would like to
retain the ability for all local jurisdictions to sue, they seem inclined
to settle for protection of these suits to procede. Eve says Mayor Willie
Brown is looking to talk with someone today. I asked that he start with
Lynn.
