TEXT:
Attached is what Steve Silverman thinks we should do at the summit meeting
today.  He thinks it should be more of a "bring everyone up to speed"
meeting rather than a strategy meeting.  He has even invited Wofford.  I
hope this will be productive and the focus will be clear, especially with
Sylvia there.  I will talk to him.  I think he envisions these as regular
meetings, perhaps weekly.

Sounds pretty good. You might be opening it up a bit too much with having
this group think about solutions for dealing with management issues, so I
would strike that from beginning. Also, I would have us do an Overview,
progress thus far, to start. Also, what paper should we give out. Potus
announcement? Maybe Harris should bring over 15 packets to give out.

For what it's worth, here's our take on the agenda. it's probably more
basic in some ways, but I don't assume that these folks have focussed that
much. Take of it what you will.

Also, we're reaching out to get Harris here.

Attendees: Mathews, Reed, Fortuna, Silverman, Smith for Kamarck, Hale,
Brophy, Hawley, Press. Maybe: Matsui, Verveer, Whalen, Eli Attie
Can't attend: Baer, Glynn, McHugh
