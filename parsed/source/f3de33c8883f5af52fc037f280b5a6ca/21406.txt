Q:   What are you going to do respond to the fact that HMOs serving hundreds of
     thousands of Medicare beneficiaries are dropping out of the Medicare program?

A:   As we have continually stated, we are absolutely unwilling to approve the managed care
     industry's request to allow every health plan to increase cost sharing and reduce benefits
     to Medicare beneficiaries. Our decision on this and every Medicare issue is based solely
     on our analysis of how it will affect the millions of Americans who depend on the
     Medicare program.

     At this point, we have no idea how many beneficiaries will be affected by HMOs
     decisions to withdraw from Medicare. As we get more information, we will determine
     what action, if any, we should take to respond to the decision of some HMOs to withdraw
     from the program.

Q:   How many Medicare beneficiaries do you think this is going to affect? Do you agree
     with those who say that it could be hundreds of thousands of beneficiaries?

A:   At this time, we do not know how many beneficiaries will be affected the decision of
     some HMOs to withdraw from Medicare. We do know that forty health plans are
     coming into Medicare this year, but we do not know how many are planning to withdraw
     so it would be inappropriate to comment at this time.
