fyi -- apparently the V-chip for the Internet comment has created quite a
stir. Kohlenberger says that he has given some additional talking points
to Ann Lewis et al--I have asked him for a copy.

     Let me reiterate Julie's message ... the President's remarks have
     generated phone calls ... from press, vendors, educators, and parents.
     The good news is that this is obviously a hot issue.    I'm waiting for
     the Congressional calls to start!

     On a related topic ... we are moving forward on the Parent's Guide to
     the Internet ... Julie forwarded you a working outline last week.  WE
     NEED YOUR REVIEW AND COMMENTS.

     Linda

     There has been quite a bit of press attention on the President's
     remark about the V-Chip in West Virginia.  I think we need to have a
     discussion on how to respond to this because we are getting a lot of
     questions as well.  I am not aware of any program existing or being
     developed to work on creating a V-Chip for the Internet. Tom - Are
     you aware of something in the works? I do know that there are
several


     software applications that already exist that essentially operate as
a
     V-chip and block out materials not suitable for children but so far
     there has not been any reference to this. Does that mean that we
     don't feel that those applications are working? Lets talk.
