                             POSSIBLE HEALTH CARE EVENTS

Unveiling new sanctions and investments in quality oversight for nursing homes. To
preempt the release of a GAO report in early January by Senator Grassley that criticizes our
nursing home quality enforcement record, this event could highlight our aggressive efforts and a
new investment of over $90 million dollars to implement effective nursing home enforcement
tools and improved nursing home quality and safety standards. These include proposing new
Federal legislation imposing civil and criminal penalties on nursing homes committing repeated
and egregious violations of Medicare or Medicaid regulations, increasing monitoring offacilities
that are repeatedly in violation of quality standards, and establishing a new national commission
to study the quality of care providing in nursing homes and assisted living facilities.

Announcing a new work incentives initiative for people with disabilities. The FY 2000
budget includes a historic workers incentive program that provides for continued and enhanced
access to programs that empower people with disabilities to work. This package includes the
Jeffords-Kennedy Work Incentives Improvement Act, which enables people with
disabilities to go back to work by providing them with the option to buy into Medicaid and
Medicare, a tax credit for work-related expenses for people with disabilities, a new
program to integrate local employment-related and support services for adults with
disabilities, and new efforts to provide assistive technologies to people with disabilities.
The unemployment rate among the 30 million working-age adults with disabilities continues to
be much higher than that of the general population -- close to 75 percent for people with
significant disabilities, who cite their inability to retain their health coverage as their main
impediment to returning to work. These announcements will reflect many of the
recommendations included in the President's Task Force on Employment of Adults with
Disabilities, and the overall initiative is strongly supported by the disability community. We
may be able to coordinate the event with the bipartisan introduction of the
Jeffords-Kennedy legislation.

Announce the President's multi-faceted long term care initiative. The President could
release new budget initiatives designed to address the growing national need for high quality long
term care services, including a new multibillion dollar long term care tax credit, proposals that
provide Federal employees the option of purchasing private long term care insurance, educate
Medicare beneficiaries about available long term care options, and invest $125 million dollars (if
included in budget) in a new national program to support Americans who care for chronically ill
or disabled family members or friends. About 2 million Americans live in nursing homes and
another 5 million Americans live in the community, but have health problems that make
them dependent on others for basic activities of daily living, such as bathing or dressing.
This multi-faceted initiative addresses a growing problem and represents our first significant effort
to introduce new long term care policy that is extremely important to the aging community.

Announcing new efforts to detect and manage bioterrorist attacks and resistant bacterial
strains (superbug). The President could announce a new budget initiative to protect the country
from the devastation of disease outbreaks due to bioterrorist attacks or bacterial strains that are
                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion

resistant to treatment. The new program provides funding for a new disease surveillance system
to collect and analyze epidemiological information on disease outbreaks, training epidemic
intelligence officers to identify and respond to attacks, developing a mass casualty emergency
response system, maintaining a stockpile of pharmaceuticals, and developing new vaccines and
antibiotics that could be used in the event of an attack.

Unveil new FY 2000 budget anti-asthma initiative. We could unveil a new budget initiative
that includes new funding for States to develop disease management programs through Medicaid
and for EPA to conduct a national asthma awareness campaign, initiate community based
activities to reduce asthma triggers in homes, and establish school based asthma programs in
every community. This initiative is especially critical as the number of children afflicted with
asthma has doubled to total about 6 million over the past 15 years.

Announcing new labeling requirements for over the counter drugs. The President could
announce the release of a new regulation requiring pharmaceutical companies to label over
the counter drugs in easily read and understandable language, ensuring that millions of
consumers understand how to take medication safely and effectively. Presently, labels for
over the counter drugs are often printed too small to read and in language that is often
difficult to understand. This regulation will be ready for release in sometime in January;
however, since the above mentioned initiatives are all budget related and may need to be
released prior to the State of the Union address, we may want to consider holding this
announcement for another time, since it will be timely regardless of when it is released.
