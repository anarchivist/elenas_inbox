Subject: Upgrade of Disk Space on Mail2

Mike and John,
We are ready to upgrade the disk space for Mail2.  However, given our past
experience with this equipment we would like to schedule this for a time
when we can have 24 hours of dedicated downtime.  If all goes well, we
won't need the full 24 hours, but if we have problems, we'll need the time
to run through the contingency plan and restore the old system.

We would like to propose doing the upgrade between midnight on a Friday
through midnight on a Saturday. Given the upcoming travel schedules, what
dates look feasible for this effort? Here are some suggestions:

    Midnight Friday-Midnight Saturday, April 17-18
    Midnight Friday-Midnight Saturday, April 24-25
    Midnight Friday-Midnight Saturday, May 1-2

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to call (or email) me.
Regards,
Laura
