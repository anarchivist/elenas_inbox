TEXT:
Elaine Kamarck has thought up a list of columnists to invite to the VP's
welfare event on 5/29, but we wanted to see if you had any different or
additional ideas.  Hers are:

Walter Shapiro, USA Today
Mort Kondracke
Ron Brownstein, LA Times
Chris Matthews, SF Chronicle
Steve Barr, WPost (fed. page?)
Joe Klein
Bill Raspberry
Ellen Goodman
Bob Herbert
Jim Pinkerton, Newsday

Melissa gave Elaine the list of reporters to invite, so that is a good
list.

Elaine also wonders if you and she should make some calls to columnists
before our May 20 event to try to interest them in the story of our
various efforts to make welfare reform a success, including both events.
