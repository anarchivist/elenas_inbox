    Attached are our weekly submissions, with new ones on the Medicare
    Commission and the Vice President's PBOR event scheduled for Tuesday.

    Chris asked me to point out that the dates on the OTC and the Genetic
    Discrimination events have changed -- OTC isn't until Thursday of next
    week and genetics has moved to the week of the 15th.

    Please call with questions. Thanks.

Release of new regulation to promote the safe and effective use of over-the-counter drug
products. Next Thursday, the White House will unveil a new FDA regulation requiring over the
counter drug products to use a standardized format with larger print that makes it easier for
consumers to understand product warnings and comply with dosage guidance. The Vice
President will join Secretary Shalala and FDA Commissioner Henney in announcing that the
regulation has been put on display. This action will be widely heralded by consumer
representatives, physician and other provider groups, and even by product manufacturers. Studies
indicate that parents often have difficulty determining the correct dosage of over-the-counter
medications, and that many of the elderly, who take significantly more over-the counter drugs
than the rest of the population, have difficulty reading the small type on the product labels. This
new regulation represents a critical first step towards preventing the thousands of unnecessary
hospitalizations caused by misuse of over the counter medications each year.

Signing of Executive Order on Genetic Discrimination. You are tentatively scheduled to
sign a new executive order the week of March 15 directing Federal agencies to take all necessary
action to guard against employment discrimination in Federal hiring practices through the
inappropriate use of genetic information. The prohibition against using genetic information to
inappropriately deny individuals access to health insurance coverage for Federal employees and
many (but not all) of the insured population was effectively applied when you signed
Kennedy-Kassenbaum into law in 1996. We currently plan to unveil your EO in an event with the
Vice President and a bipartisan group of members who are supporting Federal legislation to
apply these protections to all employers and insurers.

Medicare Commission Update. As you saw from your Thursday meeting, the base Democrats
are solidifying their position of opposition to virtually anything the Medicare Commission
produces. Senator Kennedy, Senator Rockefeller, Congressman Dingell, and Congressman
McDermott were all quite pleased with the meeting, particularly with your understanding of the
weaknesses of the current Commission plan and your commitment to keep them informed apout
any movement towards an alternative Administration proposal. On Friday, Laura Tyson and
Stuart Altman particpated in another meeting with Senator Breaux, Congressman Thomas, and a
number of other Republicans to discuss compromise options. It now seems likely that it will be
impossible to reach complete agreement on the details of any plan. As such, Senator Breaux and
Congressman Thomas are trying to convince Stuart and Laura to join them in voting for a report,
which is now expected to take place on March 15, that suggests agreement on general provisions.
Recognizing that such an approach could be misused and mischaracterized as an implicit
endorsement of subsequently flawed legislation, Laura and Stuart have rejected this alternative.
However, they are considering two other options. The first would be to agree to vote for the
Commission recommendations, (which makes it possible for the Commission to acheive the
necessary 11 votes to report out their proposal), in return for being able to include in the report
their detailed objections and recommendations to make the plan acceptable. The second option
would be to vote against the Commission recommendation, but issue a joint public statement
(because Commission rules do not allow for minority views) that explains why the two of them
chose not to support the proposal and that provides the outlines of an approach that they believe
is desireable. Laura (and to some extent Stuart) are leaning towards the first option; they believe
that this option may be more likely to provide momentum for Medicare reform -- their number

one priority. The major argument against option one in their minds is that the headline coming
out of the vote will be a misleading and incomplete "Bipartisan Commission Votes out Premium
Support and Other Controversial Medicare Reforms." Laura and Stuart have not made any final
decisions. The details on the underlying plan are not satisfactory to make them comfortable
enough doing so. They both have indicated, however, their desire to learn about your feelings on
this matter. We will keep you posted of developments.

Patients Bill of Rights Update. On Tuesday, the Vice President will participate in an event on
the Hill with the Democratic leadership to highlight the Daschle-Kennedy-Gephardt-Dingell
Patients Bill of Rights. The Democrats want to make certain that the Administration helps them
define this issue as a Democratic priority which Republicans may only support after a relentless
advocacy campaign. The theme of this event will once again be the need for a strong and
enforceable Patients Bill of Rights that distinguishes itself from the approach that the Republican
leadership has taken to date. We do believe, however, that we need to follow up this event with
some of the Republican mavericks in the House and Senate who are supporting similarly strong
bills. We anticipate being able to do so within the next two weeks, and will keep you posted on
development.
