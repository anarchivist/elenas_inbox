 Subject:         FAA scheduling request


 Here is the scheduling request for the President to announce the award of
 contracts to manufacture more than 150 new FAA-certified explosive
 detection devices for installation at airports throughout the United
 States. While this is part of an ogoing effort to strengthen airport
 security since the Gore Commission report came out in 1996, neither the WH
 nor DOT has ever done an event on it.   Are you OK with submitting this?
 Let me know, Mary

    TO:                         Stephanie Streett

    FROM:                       Bruce Reed

    REQUEST:                    For the President to announce the award of contracts to
                                manufacture more than 150 new FAA-certified explosive
                                detection devices for installation at airports throughout the
                                United States.

    PURPOSE:                    To amplify the President's commitment to airport
                                security and to help combat terrorism in our Nation.

    BACKGROUND:                In 1996, the White House Commission on Aviation
                               Safety, led by Vice President Gore, recommended that the
                               FAA purchase innovative security equipment to help
                               insure the safety of the flying public. This announcement
                               would be the purchase of21 FAA-certified explosives
                               detection systems and 135 trace explosives detection
                               devices, which add to the multi-year deployment of
                               innovative security equipment recommended by the
                               Commission. In FY99 , FAA has $100 million to
                               continue this deployment, and the President requested
                               $100 million in his FY2000 budget.
