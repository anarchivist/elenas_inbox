                               Q's and A's on GOP Education Agenda

      Q:   Today Senate Republicans held a press conference outlining their education agenda
           for he year. Their "BOOKS" package will reportedly include Sen. Coverdell's $2.6
           billion K-12 education lRAs, $200 million to train teachers and parents to teach
           reading, $75 million for vouchers, and more funds for disabled students, anti-drug
           programs, and charter schools. The package will also include provisions requiring
           that federal funds go to the classroom level and allowing states to use federal funds
           for teacher testing and merit pay increases. What is the Administration's response
           to the Republican proposal?

      A:   As you know, the President considers education a top priority and has already begun to
           outline a very ambitious agenda for the coming year. We are glad that Republicans have
           recognized how important improving education is to the American people and we look
           forward to working with Congress in a bipartisan fashion on key areas of agreement, such
           as public charter schools and efforts to improve student reading skills in the early grades.
           In particular, we encourage them to act on legislation that the House has already passed
           on the President's America Reads proposal, as well as on expanding charter schools. We
           also hope that they will support the President's proposals in areas such as expanded
           after-school programs, school construction, urban and rural Education Opportunity Zones
           and resources to recruit and prepare teachers for underserved areas.

      Q:   The RepUblican agenda seems to include several items that the Administration
           rejected in the last session of Congress: the Coverdell proposal, a voucher
           demonstration, and the Gorton bill.. What is the Administration's reaction to those
           proposals and do you expect to reach some kind of agreement on these proposals in
           order to move forward with your education agenda?

      A:   The President's agenda is to strengthen public schools through high standards, greater
           choice in public education and more accountability for results. He remains strongly
           opposed to legislation that would undermine public schools or substitute arbitrary block
           grants for key investments in such areas as technology, school safety, and charter schools.

      Q:   What about the Republican proposals to allow states to use federal funds for teacher
           testing and merit pay?

      A:   The President has said many times that he thinks that good teachers should be rewarded
           and bad teachers should be counseled to improve or removed from the profession. The
           President's new proposals, such as the Education Opportunity Zones, will stress the
           importance of teacher and school accountability for raising student achievement, and we
           will continue to encourage states to reward master teachers who attain national
           certification. We would also point out that some federal program funds, such as Goals
           2000, could already be used for these purposes if states wish to do so as part of their
           school reform efforts.



                                                                       Automated Records Management System
                                                                       Hex-Dump Conversion


     Q:   Could you explain again why you object to the Coverdell proposal, given that you
          supported education IRAs for postsecondary education?

     A:   ·      The Coverdell provision, as proposed in the last session of Congress, would have
                 diverted attention and resources from public schools, where 90% of the nation's
                 students attend.

          ·      The Coverdell Amendment would have disproportionately benefited the most
                 affluent families and provided little benefit to lower- and middle-income families.

          ·      As Secretary Rubin noted, the legislation provided virtually no guidance in
                 identifying appropriate expenses and would have led to significant additional tax
                 complexity for families.

          ·      Finally, the legislation would have essentially rewarded families, especially
                 upper-income families, for what they would have done anyway.


     Q:   You spent much of 1997 fighting with RepUblicans over the Administration's
          proposal for Voluntary National Tests in reading and math. RepUblicans have
          signaled that they expect to continue their efforts to kill the tests in 1998, and many
          Democrats are sympathetic. Do you plan to continue to work for the national tests
          this year?

     A:   Absolutely. High national standards and national tests in the basics are critical for our
          students, especially students in our poorest communities. There is nothing worse that we
          can do than allow the tyranny oflow expectations to limit a child's future. We need to
          have rigorous expectations for students and then do everything we can to help them·
          succeed. Last year we worked hard to reach a bipartisan agreement allowing the tests to
          move forward under an independent board, and I will work with Congress in a bipartisan
          fashion this year to insure continued progress.
