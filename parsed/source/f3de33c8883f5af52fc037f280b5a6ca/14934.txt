TEXT:
I am concerned that the CEOs will feel,we are jerking them around.  They
got geared up for the Mar 24 event in California, then were told to stand
down. Now we would be telling them to fly here, which would force them to
abandon a day-long event with Sen. Daschle in California. I worry we
would be snatching defeat from the jaws of victory if we go this direction.

Moving this at least to the next week would likely make a significant
difference in CEO participation -- both in terms of how many can come and
how many are on the endorsement list. Also, a number of these CEOs will
be in DC the week of April 14.

If this date is not firm, I know this is something in which the VP would
like to be involved. Can this be done the next week?

I am awaiting a call from Delaine confirming that she will be able to
come. I've alerted Jim, and I understand he's concerned that it will be
difficult to get ceo's on short notice.
