TEXT:
I am leaving Monday morning for Nashville for the 7th Annual VP Family
Conference.  I know you both are quite envious; I cannot tell you what a
special experience this has been. Most important, of course, is that you
will have to endure a Monday morning meeting without my presence and my
recounting of my never-ending and fascinating woes.  I know it will be
difficult.

Seriously, if you need me, please page me through Sky Page.

Although I believe there will be a brief USA Today story, I am not
expecting a lot of break-through news. We will do all that we can to push
the kids outreach Exec Memorandum and the announcement of new Medicare
benefits and information assistance initiatives.  However, there is little
doubt in my mind that the tobacco statement will get the most news.

Bruce, Elena can fill you in on the latest on the Hyde and Medicare
coverage issue, as well as the increasing pressure to mandate
contraceptive coverage for FEHBP and the rest of the private sector as
well.  FYI, Rich is pushing on us to release the Donna letter to Nickles,
outlining our position on Hyde, as early as Monday afternoon.   The hope is
that our letter confirming we can do this administratively will
significantly reduce the likelihood that the Republicans will legislate
over this issue this year.

Other notables this week include Tuesday's FDA Commissioner nomination
announcement, as well as the likely release of CBO's estimates on the
Dingell bill. That is just some quick rambling to substitute for my
appearance tomorrow. Must go.   Page me if you need me.
