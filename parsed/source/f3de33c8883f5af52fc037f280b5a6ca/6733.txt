                                                H-IB VISAS

             There have been increasing reports of skills shortages throughout the economy. The
     information technology industry is the most vocal and visible industry to claim a shortage,
     however, shortages have also been argued for truckers, welders in shipyards, and other such
     occupations. H-lB visas are one way by which companies can alleviate such short-term "skills
     shortages." The H-lB visa category allows foreign workers in "specialty occupations" with a
     BA (or equivalent experience) to enter jobs requiring a BA. The visas are issued for a 3-year
     period, and almost always renewed for one additional 3-year period. There is an annual cap of
     65,000 such visas. And, we know that about one-half of individuals who enter through the
     H-lB visa program remain in the U.S. permanently. Last year was the first year that the 65,000
     cap was reached; it is estimated that the cap will be reached by May (or so) of this year. Thus,
     there is growing pressure, from the IT industry in particular, to increase the H-l B visa cap.

             There are likely to be two bills addressing this issue moving through Congress next
     month. The first, introduced by Senator Abraham, would raise the cap permanently; the second.
     which is being drafted by Senator Kennedy, would increase the cap temporarily. Both also
     contain some education or training component, although Kennedy's bill provides much stronger
     protections for American workers.

             You should be aware that while there are estimates of large numbers of vacancies,
     particularly in the IT industry. there are different views as to both the numbers and the ability of
     U.S. workers to fill those jobs. Secretary Daley, for example, thinks that much of the shortage is
     the result of labor market inefficiencies and the unwillingness of some companies to retrain U.S.
     workers. The NEC, Commerce, and Labor strongly believe that we need to stress training of
     U.S. workers rather than simply lifting the Hl-B caps (which is all that industry is talking about).


     Q:    What is the administration's position viz-a-viz the alleged shortage of skilled
     workers in the IT industry?

       A:      We recognize that there is a rising demand for skilled workers in some industries. That
       is why our first priority is to help U.S. workers get the skills they need to satisfy employers'
       rising demand for skilled workers. Key components of this strategy are our HOPE Scholarships,
       the Lifetime Learning Tuition Credit, the expansion ofPell Grants, and the extension and
     . expansion of Section 127 (that excludes employer-paid tuition assistance from income). This is
       also why it is critical that Congress pass the G.!. Bill for America's Workers this spring.

             Our second priority is to protect U.S. workers which is why we must refomi the H-lB
     visa program.


      Q:     What, specifically, do you think of raising the cap on the number of H-IB visas?

      A:     This is an issue that we are looking at very carefully.
