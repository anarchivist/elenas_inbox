BR/EK:

DOJ is on the verge of distributing just over $300 million to all 50
states from the Victims Fund. This is a pretty huge amount and very good
from a message perspective -- taking from the law breaking to give to the
law-abiding ... very Robinhood.  They were thinking of announcing it at the
AG's availability this Thursday, but might we want to do something
instead ... either this week, weekend or add to next Thursday's crime
roll-out?

Think about it and let me know your thoughts.

Jose'
