TEXT:
I just spoke with Broderick -- he will call in later as a clearer schedule
develops.  Here's where things stand:

Next four hours will be spent on the motion to proceed (largely
Wellstone).  The vote should take place around 1:30. Broderick says there
is a manager's package, but he isn't sure how complete it is -- and is
trying to get more information on the amendments included in the package.
Right now, Broderick expects them to spend the day on accountability.   He
thinks there is a chance that the Senate may get to class size late today,
but it will likely come up tomorrow (where they will try and string out
discussion over the weekend) .  It looks like the Senate won't finish
Ed-Flex before Wednesday.
