         President Clinton will recommend a $72 million expansion of his National Food Safety
Initiative in his fiscal 2000 budget proposal. If enacted, the budget would result in a third year
of significant growth in government efforts to prevent potentially deadly foodbome illness
through a comprehensive, science-based inspection, surveillance, research and education system.
 The new funds are to shared by the Department of Agriculture (USDA), which which would
receive $32 million, and the Department of Health and Human Services would receive about $40
million for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC).

Improving Domestic and International Food Safety Inspections

        The President proposes to greatly expand inspections of domestic and imported food
products. He would ensure that the FDA inspect every high risk food manufacturer under its
jurisdiction in the United States at least once each year (FDA is still checking). (Other food
manufacturers would be inspected twice as often as they are now. FDA checking to see if they
can still do with $30 million) Imported food would also be subject to increased scrutiny.
FDA would double the number of inspections conducted offoreign food production systems.
from 100 to 200. The FDA has jurisdiction over all food products except meat, poultry, and egg
products, which are under USDA's jurisdiction. For USDA, which conducts daily inspections
of meat and poultry products, funds would be provided for continuing phase-in ofHACCP, the
Agriculture Department's science-based, prevention-oriented meat and poultry inspection
system, which has already helped to reduce significantly dangerous pathogens levels. HACCP,
currently in effect in the nation's largest plants, will be phased in at smaller plants over the next
 13 months.


        The President's plan also envision.s even greater coordination among federal and state
agencies handling food safety issues. For the first time, state and federal inspection results will
be shared by electronic connection, reducing overlapping efforts and enhancing the ability of
authorities to focus on public health improvements. USDA will strengthen its 26 federal-state
partnerships to facilitate the interstate shipment of state-inspected meat and poultry products.

Public Health Research and Surveillance

        The funding increase would also enable better surveillance offoodbome illness. CDC
would expand its foodbome illness monitoring system, called "FoodNet," and its computerized
database to identify unique illness "fingerprints," called "Pu1seNet." This expanded surveillance
network if the heart of our nation's foodbome disease early warning system and was helpful in
identifying the recent Listeria monocytogenes outbreak.

               Finally, USDA and FDA's food safety research efforts would also benefit from the
        President's budget proposal. Expanded research would focus on:

        ·      creating new detection tests for dangerous contaminants such as Salmonella in eggs,
               Cyclosopra in fresh produce, and test methods for E. Coli 0157 :H7 in foods in which it
               cannot now be tested,
        ·      helping farmers better control potentially dangerous bacteria and fungi in fruits and
               vegetables,
        ·      combating antibiotic resistance in food-producing animals,

                The President's Joint Institute of Food Safety Research will continue developing a
        strategic plan for conducting and coordinating all federal food safety research efforts and work
        closely with the private sector and academia in the process.

                The President's proposal builds on a strong record offood safety accomplishments,
        ensuring that Americans eat the safest possible food. Last year, the President proposed a
        $101 million increase in food safety funding, more than $80 million of which was ultimately
        approved by Congress in the final budget. The Administration has put in place improved
        safety standards for meat, poultry, and seafood product, and has begun the process of
        developing enhanced standards for fruit and vegetable juices. [Add other accomps.] With
