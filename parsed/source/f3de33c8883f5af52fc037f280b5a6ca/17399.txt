Diana--

Here's the draft blurb. We were leaning towards taking the last sentence
out, and were struggling with how to clarify the rest. THANKS!


IDEA Regulations to Be Published Next Week.  Next week the Department of
Education will publish proposed regulations implementing the
AdministrationD,s Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA)
reauthorization bill. The regulation attempts to strike a ,balance between
the goals of parents and disability advocates on the one hand and those of
school districts, states, and teachers' unions on the other, although it
will probably please the former group more than the latter.

For example, on the controversial issue of disciplining disabled students,
.1   "




the new law permits hearing officers to remove a child from a classroom
for up to 45 days.  However, the regulation states that the hearing
officer may not act unilaterally and must still conduct a hearing with
both sides present.  In another example, the law does not allow a student
to be moved from a classroom during a dispute between a parent and a
school on that placement, but the regulation provides that the child may
be moved if the hearing officer agrees with the parent, even if the school
appeals.

The regulation also reflects the DepartmentD,s interpretation of new
statutory requirements for services to youth with disabilities
incarcerated in adult correctional facilities, currently the subject of a
dispute with Governor Wilson of California and an appropriations rider
sponsored by Rep. Riggs.
