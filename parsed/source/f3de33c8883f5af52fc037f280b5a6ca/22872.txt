TEXT:
BR/EK;

Spoke to DOJ, OMB about Brady NICS.    Here's where we are:

1. DOJ wants to stick by their proposal to retain records for 4 months/120
days.  They think it's the best way to go substantively, and they're
willing to fallon their sword for it.   Also, they say their August reg --
in the wake of the Smith Amendment -- specifically promised to reduce
records retention to less than 6 months, so it's not credible for them to
now come out with an ambiguous reg.  While they say this may be legally
doable, it is probably much more problematic to appropriators than their
proposed 4 months/120 days.

2.  OMB prefers retaining records for 2 or 3 months at the most.  Deich
and his appropriations folks don't think we get way with anything less
than a serious reduction of the records retention period.  They point out
that the appropriators already know we were willing to accept a records
retention period of 30 days or less, so anything longer will draw
opposition we're not likely to overcome.  Thus, Deich recommends that we
reduce the records retention to no more than 3 months -- one-sixth of our
original proposal for 18 months and half of our fall back of 6 months.   He
believe that, while not necessarily acceptable to the appropriators, such
a reg would be credible, consistent w/our previous negotiations and
possibly allow us to keep records for 1 or 2 months.

I told Michael I'd send you guys a note and get back to him in the
morning.  Let me know what you think.  I think I agree with Michael.
