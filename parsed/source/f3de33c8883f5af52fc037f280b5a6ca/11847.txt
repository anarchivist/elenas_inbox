$17.5B GOP Anti-Crime Bill Unveiled

                             By LAURIE KELLMAN Associated Press Writer

                            WASHINGTON (AP)   -- Senate Republicans unveiled a
$17.5
                            billion anti-crime agenda today that would
protect programs the
                             Clinton administration wants to eliminate and
impose harsher
                             sentences on illegal drug users.

                             " I t is based on what we know   r~.duces   crime,"
said Sen. Orrin
                            Hatch, R-Utah, chairman of the Judiciary
Committee.

                            Hatch clashed with Attorney General Janet Reno
last week on
                            her proposal to cut several anti-crime grants
from her budget.
                            Reno said crime was down significantly
nationwide, and she
                            wanted to shift money to other priorities.

                            But Hatch said today that crime in the United
States is still
                             "significantly high by historical standards, ' ,
and violent crime
                            rates here remain the highest of any
industrialized nation.

                            Senate GOP leadership sources who demanded


anonymity said
                           the GOP bill marks a new willingness among some
senior
                           Republicans to take on legislative initiatives
that approach the
                           gun-control issue. Republicans, many of whom
have opposed
                           such legislation in recent years, feared they
would lose such a
                           battle after nationally publicized firearms
tragedies at schools and
                           elsewhere.

                           Hatch's agenda, however, faces little risk of
igniting a gun battle,
                           GOP sources said. It would expand a Richmond,
Va., program
                           in which the U.S. attorney prosecutes as many
local gun-related
                           crimes in federal court as possible and seeks
federal mandatory
                           minimum sentences. Hatch said homicides in
Richmond dropped
                           50 percent in that city after that program took
effect. It also
                           includes a media campaign to spread the message
that "an
                           illegal gun will get you five years in federal
prison. ' ,

                           Aides close to Hatch said they anticipate the
bill moving through
                           the committee this spring and to the Senate
floor during the
                           summer.

                           Much of the bill's funding has already been set
aside for federal
                           grants Reno proposes cutting, but which Hatch
would protect:

                           --A grant used for equipment and technology for
state and local
                           law enforcement crime-fighting.

                           --Federal assistance to states for
prison-building and
                           incarceration of violent and repeat offenders
for at least 85
                           percent of their sentences.

                           --Juvenile crime block grants for youth
detention centers, drug
                           testing and improved record-keeping.

                           Hatch and other Republican senators also are
proposing
                           increasing penalties for the most serious drugs,
including powder
                           cocaine and methamphetamines.



                     The GOP senators also are calling for the
ratification of a
                     constitutional amendment that would improve
restitution laws
                     and steer federal money toward efforts to fight
violence against
                     women and children.
