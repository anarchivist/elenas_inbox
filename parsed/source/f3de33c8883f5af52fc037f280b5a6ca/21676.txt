November    Food Stamp Fraud Directives
           The President could sign three directives to crack down on food stamp fraud:
           (1) The President would direct the Social Security Administration to share its
           death records with the Food Stamp agency to ensure that Food Stamp
           recipients who die are immediately removed from the rolls; (2) The President
           would direct USDA to develop a plan to create an interstate matching system
           to ensure Food Stamp recipients are not receiving benefits in multiple states;
           and (3) The President would direct Treasury to collect (through offset of
           federal payments and other means) unpaid fines owed by retailers that have
           violated Food Stamp rules, such as exchanging Food Stamps for cash. The
           first two directives will build on the Lugar legislation that passed at the end
           of the session. (Ready)

December   Work Participation Rates
           The President could visit a welfare-to-work program and announce: (1) new state
           work participation rates, showing that almost all states are meeting the welfare
           law's single-parent requirements, but some are failing to meet the law's separate
           two-parent requirement; (2) new caseload data showing continuing declines; and
           (3) new data on the number of people who were on welfare in 1997 and working
           in March 1998. (Expected to be ready in mid December.)

December   Welfare to Work Housing Vouchers
           The Congress approved in the VAIHUD appropriations bill full funding for the
           President's request for 50,000 welfare-to-work housing vouchers. The President
           could hold an event announcing the opening of the first competition for these
           vouchers. This is the first time ever that housing vouchers will be linked to
           welfare reform, and represents an improvement in the way welfare, employment,
           and housing agencies can work together. (Ready in December.)




                                                     Automated Records Management System

           As required by the Executive Order the President signed in March, the Task Force
           has prepared a six month report which includes recommendations on
           administrative and legislative policies to improve employment opportunities for
           people with disabilities. The President could meet with the Task Force
           (Secretary Herman, chair, and Tony Coehlo, vice chair) and formally announce
           his endorsement of the Kennedy-Jeffords Work Incentives Improvement
           Act -- the disability community's top health priority. The President could
           also possibly announce at this time new budget proposals affecting people
           with disabilities, including a tax credit for people with disabilities to help
           them pay work-related expenses and/or a BRIDGE program to foster more
           integrated state and local services help people with disabilities go to work.
           (Ready -- certain components pending budget decisions).

 December    Counteradvertising
             The state tobacco settlement is expected to include significant funds for state
             tobacco counteradvertising and education. To assist states in using these funds
             most effectively, the President could direct HHS to: (1) designate a National
             Clearinghouse on Tobacco Counteradvertising at the Centers for Disease Control
             (the President could release at the event a package of "top-10" t.v. ads); and (2)
             make effective anti-tobacco curriculum available to every school. Two of the
             "top-10" ads feature supermodel Christy Turlington and musical group "Boyz II
             Men" who could be invited to participate in the event. (Ready) .


. December   Second Hand Smoke

             The President could sign an Executive Order directing OSHA to issue within one
             year a standard establishing a smoke-free workplace for all private sector
             employees. ETS exposure in the workplace poses significant risks to employees
             who are non-smokers, including lung cancer, heart disease, and respiratory
             problems. This standard would be similar to the August 1997 Executive Order
             banning smoking in Federal building. (Ready in early December)
