TEXT:
Here is some news from the summit meeting you were lucky enough to miss
today.  Present were Don, Steve, Ann, Melanne, Michael Waldman, Lorraine
Voles, more press/communications types.  Special guest presentation was by
Benjamin Barber.

The most relevant development was on this week's radio address.     People
got excited about the following 4-part approach:

1.      a framing of the President's view of service (probably due to
Barber's encouragement);
2.      announcing the week of service (it's back again);
3.      praise Maryland's program (and have Townsend and some kids
there); and
4.      call for states/school systems to do what Maryland has done
impose a service req.

I am checking to make sure we haven't called for #4 already.    If not, do
you view this as an appropriate venue to announce this?

Everyone thinks the HS service scholars is so good it should be a
freestanding event later on; plus Gomperts left me a message that the
search for more match is going "rotten."

I mentioned this anti-drug youth academy idea as a possible add-on if any
or all of these ideas go south.  People seemed interested, and I am trying
to see how solid it is.  (Ricia McMahon says it's extremely solid.)

Don asked Waldman to do some thinking about the speech at the summit
itself, and call a meeting on it.

Let me know what you think.  If you want to go ahead with highlighting
Maryland, let me know if you want to call Townsend, or if I should.
