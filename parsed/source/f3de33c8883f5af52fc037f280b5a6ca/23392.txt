MEMORANDUM TO THE PRESIDENT

FROM: Charles F.C. Ruff, Elena Kagan, Daniel Marcus

RE: Petition for certiorari in Helms v. Picard

         The Solicitor General has discussed with us his conclusion that the United States should
not file a cert petition (due April 13) in this case, in which the Fifth Circuit held unconstitutional,
as applied, a provision of Chapter 2 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act that
authorized local educational agencies (LEAs) to use federal funds to purchase computers and
other materials for loan to private schools, including sectarian schools. That ESEA provision
was replaced by a similar provision in Title VI of the Improving America's Schools Act of 1994,
which remains in effect today. The U.S. Department of Education, as well as the state
(Louisiana) and local (Jefferson Parish) public school authorities, were defendants in the case
and are subject to an ongoing injunction.

        The Fifth Circuit found that two longstanding Supreme Court precedents -- Meek v.
Pittenger, 421 U.S. 349 (1975), and Wolman v. Walter, 433 U.S. 229 (1977) -- dictated the
conclusion that the Title VVChapter 2 program was unconstitutional. In those cases the
Supreme Court struck down state laws that authorized public authorities to lend instructional
equipment and materials to private schools, including sectarian schools, reasoning that such
materials could be used directly in aid of the sectarian enterprise of parochial schools -- unlike
secular textbooks, the lending of which to sectarian schools the Court had upheld in Board of
Education v. Allen, 392 U.S. 236 (1968). Th~ Fifth Circuit rejected arguments that the Title
VVChapter 2 program was distinguishable from those held unconstitutional in Meek and
Wolman. And it also rejected arguments that Meek and Wolman had been repudiated or
modified by the Supreme Court itself in later decisions particularly Agostini v. Felton, 521
                                                          n




U.S. 203 (1997), in which a closely divided Court upheld the constitutionality of using Title I
ESEA funds to send public school teachers into private sectarian schools to provide remedial
education to disadvantaged children.

          The Fifth Circuit's decision conflicts with an earlier decision of the Ninth Circuit in
  Walker v. San Francisco Unified School District, 46 F.3d 1449 (1995), upholding a similar Title
  VVChapter 2 program. In Walker, the Ninth Circuit found that Meek and Wolman were no
  longer good law in light of later Supreme Court decisions that the Ninth Circuit viewed as
. establishing the principle that the Establishment Clause simply required neutrality between
  secular and religious schools in the provision of government aid.

        After the Fifth Circuit decision, the Department of Education, in consultation with the
Department of Justice, published a Guidance on compliance with Title VI, directing LEAs to
employ several safeguards to ensure that equipment and materials lent to sectarian schools will
not be diverted to religious purposes. The Guidance provides that LEA should obtain written
assurances from private schools that materials will be used only for secular purposes; should
                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion

review the contents of library books lent to private schools and conduct periodic on-site
monitoring; and should ensure that violations are promptly corrected, including, if necessary,
removing the materials from the private school. This Guidance amplifies for the first time the
very general requirement of ensuring secular use contained in the statute and the Department's
regulations.

        After extensive consideration, the Solicitor General has concluded that, although it is
important to persuade the Supreme Court to revise its Establishment Clause jurisprudence to
permit programs of this kind, this is not the appropriate case in which to ask the Court to take
that step, and we should therefore not file a petition for certiorari. His reasoning is basically as
follows: While the Supreme Court (most notably and recently in Agostini) has opened the door to
some forms of assistance by public authorities to sectarian schools (or their students), its
decisions have not called into question its longstanding holdings that direct aid to the sectarian
school enterprise -- even on a "neutral" basis -- is forbidden, and that the provision of
instructional materials that are capable of use by the sectarian school for religious purposes is
therefore also forbidden. The distinctions of this case from Meek and Wolman proffered to the
Fifth Circuit unsuccessfully by the Justice Department as well as the state and local authorities
are unconvincing and should not be the basis for a petition for certiorari. Accordingly, any
petition would have to ask the Court to overrule in substantial part Meek, Wolman, and several
other precedents. (We agree with Waxman that if we seek Supreme Court review we will have
to ask the Court to overrule, at least in part, the Meek -Wolman precedents.)

        The Supreme Court could be asked to overrule these precedents on one of three theories.
First, we could embrace the "neutrality" principle advocated by Rehnquist, Scalia, and Thomas,
and argue that the Court should allow direct aid to parochial schools so long as it does not prefer
one religion to another and does not favor the religious over the non-religious. Second, we
could urge the Court to abandon its treatment of elementary and secondary sectarian schools as
"pervasively religious" institutions, regarding them instead -- like religiously-affiliated
universities -- as institutions in which the secular and the sectarian aspects of operations can
easily be kept separate. The Solicitor General believes that neither of these broad arguments
would be successful or should be made, and we agree.

        There is a third, less radical argument that the Solicitor General believes can and should
be made in an appropriate case. This argument would not challenge the principle that the
Government cannot directly aid the religious mission of a sectarian school, but would urge the
Court to abandon its insistence that materials be "incapable of diversion" to sectarian purposes,
and substitute a test that would look to whether there are adequate safeguards against such
diversion.

        Justice O'Connor is the key to the success of any such argument. Four Justices --
Rehnquist, Scalia, Kennedy, and Thomas -- have indicated a willingness to go this far, and
probably further. But the four "liberal" Justices -- Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg, and Breyer, all of
whom dissented in Agostini -- would almost certainly reject it. O'Connor wrote Agostini, but
has not questioned the principle that public funds may not be usedtosupport the religious
enterprise of a sectarian school. The Solicitor General believes, however, that she could be
                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion



persuaded to uphold programs such as Title VI if she were convinced that there were adequate
safeguards to ensure that the comp~ters or other materials lent to the sectarian schools would in
fact be used for secular, not religious, purposes. These safeguards could take the form of
certifications by the private schools, monitoring visits by public school teachers or officials,
prescreening of library books, and sanctions for violations. (The Court would have to find that
such safeguards did not amount to the "excessive entanglement" of state with church forbidden
by decisions such as Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602 (1971), or would have to revise its
"excessive entanglement" doctrine.)

         But the Solicitor General believes that Helms v. Picard is not the right case in which to
make that argument. The statute itself and the federal regulations in place at the time the case
was decided contained only general requirements that the public agency ensure that the loaned
materials be used only for secular purposes. Nor did the State of Louisiana or Jefferson Parish
establish an ambitious monitoring program. Since the Solicitor General believes that it will be
difficult, even on a good record, to persuade Justice O'Connor to embrace an "adequate
safeguards" exception to the Meek and Wolman line of cases, he worries not only that she will
reject that argumen, but also that she will react negatively to what she will regard as a
disingenuous argument by the Solicitor General that there were adequate safeguards in this case,
and that her unhappiness will carry over to other cases in which We need her vote. The
Guidelines adopted recently by the Department of Education are an improvement in this regard,
but Waxman thinks they are too late to be of much help in this case, and he has advised the
Department to adopt an amended Guidance or (preferably) regulations embodying more specific
safeguards against diversion of computers and other materials to use for sectarian purposes.

                                                                       Of course, if no cert petition
is filed, the injunction in Helms v. Picard would remain in effect. The Solicitor General notes,
however, that the Fifth Circuit decision does not strike down the statute on its face, and applies
only to the particular program at issue in the Helms case.
The decision is the law only in the Fifth Circuit, and even there LEAs are free to devise other
programs under Title VI. Waxman hopes that, with a new Guidance or regulations, a more
attractive program-with-safeguards could be adopted by an LEA and become a more promising
vehicle for winning over Justice O'Connor and a majority of the Court.

         The Secretary of Education and his General Counsel do not want to wait for that better
case. They think our friends in the private school community will not understand why the
Administration, having supported the legality of this program during more than a decade of
litigation in the lower courts, is abandoning them at the Supreme Court stage and allowing the
Fifth Circuit decision to stand. They are not convinced that we should give up on the
distinctions urged unsuccessfully in the Fifth Circuit but successfully earlier in the Ninth Circuit.
 And they think the Justice Department understates the difficulty that LEAs will have in devising
viable Title VI programs during the time (perhaps a long time) before a better case can be found
and work its way up to the Supreme Court. They recognize that Helms v. Picard is not the ideal
case to present to the Court and that it is by no means a sure winner. But they are not as
pessimistic as the Solicitor General is, and they think the importance of this kind of program
from both a policy and a political standpoint should lead us to take the risk involved in
