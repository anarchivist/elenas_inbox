TEXT:
Before I start setting up interview times for people next week, I
have some questions:
1) Are there any times that you are not available (besides 9-9:30
MWF)?
2) Since all four from the first batch are at local schools, would
you prefer in-person interviews or by phone?
3) How much time should I schedule for each interview?

Thanks for your guidance on this!
        Marna
