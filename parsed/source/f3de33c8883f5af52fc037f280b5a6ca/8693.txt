TEXT:
We need to change this language in the letter again.   I assume we will
support, but have not seen the language.

- An alternate Lowey amendment (similar to the section 516
language but written only as a funding issue) to require FEHBP
insurers to cover prescription contraceptives (with exceptions
for certain religiously oriented plans) was adopted   224-198.
