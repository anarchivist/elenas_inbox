TEXT:
Our assumption is that McCain wanted $5.2 billion of $6.5 liability fund
to be part of the annual assessment, right, i.e., within the $1.10? And
the $1.3 billion co-pay would be outside, right?

You should know that the table OMB handed out at the meeting yesterday
assumes all the $6.5 billion is outside the annual payment.  In other
words, the table shows $32 billion in "receipts less spending" because
they did not assume $26 billion ($5.2 billion x 5 years) is eaten up by
the liability fund.

Obviously, then, we have less money to play with than expected.
