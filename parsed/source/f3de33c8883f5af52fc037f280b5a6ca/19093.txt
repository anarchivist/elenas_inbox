         The President supports efforts in the Congress to develop a comprehensive legislative package to
         address the increasing demand for skilled workers. Investing in training and education is the
         cornerstone of such a package to sustain our economic growth and make sure that all of our
         people benefit from this growth. Key components of this strategy are our HOPE Scholarships,
         the Lifetime Learning Tuition Credit, the expansion of Pell Grants, and the extension and
         expansion of Section 127 (that excludes employer-paid tuition assistance from income). This is
         also why it is critical that Congress pass the GJ. Bill for America's Workers this spring.

         The other essential component to ensuring an adequate supply of skilled workers to meet industry
         needs is reform of the current HIB visa program. Since 1993, this Administration has sought
         reforms of the HIB program, such as requiring employers to "recruit and retain" U.S. workers
         before hiring temporary foreign workers, prohibiting lay-offs of U.S. workers to replace them
         with foreign temporary workers, and reducing the maximum stay for HI B workers from 6 to 3
         years. These reforms, if enacted, would help to target HI B usage to industries and employers
         that are exhibiting genuine labor shortages.

         With commitments to education and protection of American workers, it would be appropriate to
         respond to the short-term concerns to increase the number of visas for temporary foreign
         workers. Senator Kennedy's bill provides for such an increase for the next three years as well as
         for some of the long-term strategies that we support. His bill is the appropriate vehicle for
         addressing the labor market needs of our rapidly changing economy.
