PRINTER FONT 12 POINT COURIER
DRAFT
MAY 18, 1998
1: 20 PM


Honorable Frank Riggs
Chairman, Subcommittee on Early Childhood,


        Youth, and Families
Committee on Education and the Workforce
United States House of Representatives
Washington, DC 20515
Dear Mr. Chairman:
I am writing to express my strong objections to H.R. 3248, the
"Dollars to the Classroom Act," which would convert a wide array
of Federal education programs to block grants.  The President
stated last fall that such a step is unacceptable, and that he
would use his veto power to prevent this approach from becoming
law.  If H.R. 3248 were presented to the President, I would
recommend that he veto it.
Block grants would halt many of our most successful efforts to
improve education, including our efforts to raise educational
standards, make computers available in every classroom, and keep
our schools safe and free of drugs. H.R. 3248 could also
seriously harm the ESEA, Title I program, which provides extra
help to low
o
-income stude~ts so that they can master the basic
skills of reading and. math, paving the way for them to reach high
academic standards.
The American people rightly look to the Federal Government to
focus its efforts not on general aid to school districts, but on
national priorities, such as improving educational opportunities
for poor children and other children with special needs,
combating youth drug abuse and school violence, and researching
and disseminating information on what works.   This Administration
has worked diligently to eliminate unnecessary regulations and
take other steps to promote State and local flexibility in
carrying out these targeted efforts, while supporting strong
accountability mechanisms, such as the Government Performance and
Results Act of 1993, that ensure program effectiveness and
results and that justify continued support by the taxpayers.
Block grants would replace these worthy efforts with general aid,
providing no focus, no accountability for results, and no
rationale for ongoing support.
The issue here is not about who controls public education -- we

all agree that that responsibility rests at the local and State
levels. The question, rather, is .whether the Federal Government
will maintain its long
o
-standing, bipartisan commitment to helping
local communities strengthen accountability, raise standards, and
improve student achievement, by providing assistance that focuses
on our neediest children and schools and on activities in which
national leadership can playa critical role.
The Office of Management and Budget advises that there is no
objection to the submission of this report from the standpoint of
the Administration's program and that enactment of H.R. 3248
would not be in accord with the President's program.

                                                          Yours sincerely,


                                                          Richard W. Riley
