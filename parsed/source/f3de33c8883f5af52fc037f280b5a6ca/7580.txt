TEXT:
I just spoke to Haskins.  He said Shaw doesn't want to take the lead on
such an exemption but that, if someone else took a strong position on it,
he would probably go along and not cause trouble.  This is even though
they think it's a bad precedent.  I raised the possibility of our taking
"not opposed" position, and he said this thing is dead if we don't do
something on it.  So our support would appear to boost an exemption's
prospects more than we thought, but not a "not opposed" position. What do
you think?
