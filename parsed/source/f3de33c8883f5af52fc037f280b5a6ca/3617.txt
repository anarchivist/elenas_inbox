TEXT:
He has some antitrust concerns. Can you give him a call (514-2401)? He
says he understands we don't want to scuttle the whole thing, but he has
some suggestions on how to improve it.  I told him we'd start including
him in our economic group too.

We should probably at least say they can't do price-fixing ...
