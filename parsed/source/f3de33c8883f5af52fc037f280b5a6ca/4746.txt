      Subject: FL second hand smoke suit reported settled

      Settlement reached in
         secondhand smoke trial

                             October 10, 1997
                             Web posted at: 10:14 a.m. EDT (1414 GMT)

                              MIAMI (CNN) -- A settlement
                              was reached Friday between the
                              tobacco industry and flight
                              attendants, who filed a lawsuit
                              claiming second-hand smoke
                              sickened them·.

                              The settlement was said to be worth hundreds of
      millions of
                              dollars, but the exact amount was not immediately
      disclosed.

                              Attorneys for both sides met Friday with Dade County
      Circuit
                              Court Judge Robert Kaye to discuss the settlement.

                              In the class-action suit, 60,000 nonsmoking flight
'   ..
           attendants sued
                                 the tobacco industry for $5 billion. They maintained
           they were
                                 suffering from cancer and smoking-related illnesses
           from years of
                                 flying aboard jetliners before smoking was banned on
           domestic
                                 flights in 1990.

                                 It was the first class-action lawsuit against the
           tobacco industry to
                                 reach court.

                                 The lead plaintiff in the case is Norma Broin, a
           Mormon who was
                                 diagnosed in 1989 with an aggressive form of lung
           cancer. She
                                 said she "never took one puff on a cigarette."
