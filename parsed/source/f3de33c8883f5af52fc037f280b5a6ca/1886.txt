TEXT:
Per an earlier ok from Bruce, I've been talking to will Marshall about a
White House/DLC welfare to work conference.  Next Thursday, April 24 from
10 a.m.-II a.m. Will, Margie Waller (DLC/PPI), and Eli Segal are coming in
to talk about what such as event might look like.  It obviously doesn't
make sense to have the conference before Eli's launch and it is unlikely
anything could be done before June, but Will is very anxious to talk about
it and agree upon a format and groups that might be included so he can
begin talking to people and planning.

T·he DLC has given me an outline for a half day conference at which the
President would speak and other organizations would take part.   I'll pass
around a copy of the outline.

Bruce, can we have the meeting in your office -- or is it better to have
it in 211?
