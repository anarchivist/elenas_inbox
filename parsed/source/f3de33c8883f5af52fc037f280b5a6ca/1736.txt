TEXT:
Talking Point on Prop. 209 -- Our official position at this time:

Yesterday, a three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals
overturned a district court injunction which had stayed implementation of
Proposition 209, ruling that the initiative was constitutional.
Obviously, we are disappointed with the panel's decision.  The U.S. is a
party to the case as amicus curiae and had argued forcefully at the
Preliminary Injunction stage that Prop. 209 was unconstitutional.   The
Department of Justice is considering what next steps can be taken by the
U.S. in its role as amicus in the case.
