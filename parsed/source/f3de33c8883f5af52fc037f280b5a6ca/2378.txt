TEXT:
You mentioned that you had done a Q&A on how to respond to press

inquiries regarding the NY Times (and today's wall St. Journal)

article on the H-1B policy deliberations.      I assume that we should be

saying much of the same thing to Congressional inquiries.      Could you

send me a copy of your Q&A so that I could put it in Ray Uhalde's

briefing book?



I will send to you and others several other Q&A's that we are

preparing for Ray later this afternoon for your review and input.



Thanks
