     TEXT:
     Folks--Mark hasn't received a response to his e-mail.  We have a dzn or
     more people coming tomorrow and we need to set the agenda and
     presentations.  Basically, we need someone from leg to give the current
     status and likely votes etc and someone from DPC to explain (one more
     time) why we're going to fight like hell for national standards and why
     that's good for all students, including minorities.   {Mike--did you get
     paper from ED re the results being announced in Philly today (I didn't see
     it--and I thought there might be info useful for the minority students
     talking points we need).}
