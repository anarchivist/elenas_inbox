                 MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT

                 FROM:                      Bruce Reed
                                            Elena Kagan

                 SUBJECT:                   Federal Tobacco Claims

                       . Over the last few months, we and Bruce Lindsey have had many conversations with
                 Department of Justice attorneys regarding the feasibility of bringing suit against the tobacco
                 companies for Medicare and other losses stemming from the use of tobacco products. We also
                 have asked DOJ lawyers to consult with a number oflaw professors and trial attorneys who have
                 considered the viability of a lawsuit.

                         The Department now has concluded that it should not bring suit against the companies.
                 Almost everyone at DO] agrees that such a suit could be brought consistent with Rule II (1.&"
                 with minimum professional standards). Most DOJ lawyers also acknowledge that given the size
                 of the claim and other factors, the companies might well choose to settle the suit (as they are
                 settling state claims) for a substantial sum of money plus public health concessions. DO]
                 attorneys believe, however, that they should not bring suit unless they would stand a reasonable
                 prospect of actually winning the suit at trial and on appeal (i.e., putting aside all settlement
                 possibilities). The attorneys have concluded that under existing law governing Medicare and
                 other potential federal claims, they cannot meet this standard. The lawyers principally argue that
                 current law precludes the federal government from aggregating (i.e., bringing in a single suit)
                 claims for each Medicare beneficiary's tobacco-related health care costs.

                          At the same time, most DO] attorneys appear amenable to settling federal claims against
                 the tobacco companies without bringing a prior lawsuit. (The lawyers reason that although they
                 cannot bring suit against the companies for want of an effective aggregation device, they do in
                 fact have millions of individual claims against the companies, which they could settle all at
                 once.) Under this approach, the government would enter into negotiations with the tobacco
                 companies to resolve potential federal claims; if an agreement were reached, the parties would
                 file in court a settlement agreement and proposed consent decree, which would release federal
                 claims against the tobacco companies in exchange for some combination of monetary damages
                 and injunctive relief. No legislation would be necessary.

                         We have some reason to believe that the companies -- at least Philip Morris and Lorillard
                 -- would have an interest in entering into this kind of negotiation in the wake ofa settlement with
                 the states (which, as you know, is rumored to be in the offing). The principal outside counsel
                 for Philip Morris (Meyer Koplow) recently suggested to Elena that his client wants.to resolve all


                                                                             Automated Records Management System
                                                                             Hex-Dump Conversion
                                                                                                       2

     government claims against it, including potential claims by the federal government. He implied
     that a potential settlement agreement could include money, FDA jurisdiction, and marketing
     restrictions.

             The prospects of actually reaching a good agreement with the companies are uncertain.
     We know that the companies want to rid themselves of potential government litigation, primarily
     so they can spin off non-tobacco assets. But without an actual suit against the companies, we
     would have relatively little leverage in negotiations. Moreover, we could encounter serious
     legal difficulties in trying to achieve some of our objectives -- particularly, an assurance of FDA
     jurisdiction -- through a non-legislated settlement.

              We believe the Administration should attempt to engage the companies in such a
     negotiation, but we wanted your approval first. There is always some risk that Democrats will
     fret that we are letting the companies off too easily. However, they will be reassured somewhat
     by the Justice Department's involvement in these negotiations -- and the only relief the
     companies can get out of these talks is from a suit we have not brought. The advantage of
     entering into negotiation is that we might be able to get something done on tobacco without
     Congress -- and if not, we could lay the groundwork for legislative action next year.
