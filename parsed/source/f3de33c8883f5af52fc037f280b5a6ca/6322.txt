     Here are some suggested line edits for my three comments in the youth
     surcharge section, as well as a few others:

     Inflation adjustment.  Title I, sec. 102, p. 23 line 14.  "(A) the
     percentage increase in the medical consumer price index ... "

     Youth surcharge baseline. Title III, sec. 302, p. 2 line 3. Insert
     sentence specifying overall baseline level:  "The baseline level of
     tobacco product use (referred to in this title as the 'baseline level') is
     the percentage of individuals under 18 years of age determined to have
     used the tobacco product in the first annual performance survey for 1998."

     Youth usage reduction. Title III, sec. 303, p. 4 line 5.   "required
     percentage reduction from the baseline level in the percentage underage
     use ... "

     Youth penalties. Title III, sec. 304, p. 6 line 18 and p. 7 lines 6, 8,
     10, and 12. Penalties should be stated in cents as "10 cents", not "$.10
     cents"

     Actual percentage reduction.  Title III, sec. 304, p. 8 line 9.  Insert
     "multiplied by 100" to convert fractional percent to integer percent for
     comparison to the reduction target.




I also have two other technical comments that raise policy issues.

        1. Tax deductibility.  We could suggest language to clarify the tax
status of the basic assessments.  It seems the intent of the language is
that they be deductible.  OTA would probably be a lot happier if this were
stated more clearly in the bill.

        2. Youth reductions. The penalties on manufacturers for not meeting the
youth targets would make the most sense if they were computed on a
manufacturer-wide basis for all brands sold by that manufacturer.  It is
not clear from the bill whether this is the intent or not.  If this is the
intent, we could suggest language to that effect.


I am also sending these comments by fax to Thomas Freedman at DPC.
