                            PeU Grants and HOPE Scholarships Hex-Dump Conversion


Q:   Do some people receive both Pell Grants and HOPE Scholarships? How do the two
     benefits interact?

A:   Some will get both, depending on tuition, income, and financial aid levels. Pell Grants
     are the foundation of aid for low-income students and families. The poorest students
     receive the maximum grant ($3,000 next year). A student's Pell Grant eligibility
     decreases as family income increases. If a Pell Grant (or other scholarship) does not
     fully cover tuition and fees, then the student would be eligible for a HOPE Scholarship to
     cover the remainder. (However, the lowest-income students would not be able to benefit
     from HOPE because they do not have tax liability and therefore cannot use a tax credit.)


                           PeU Grants for Independent Students


Q:   Why did the Administration propose the additional Pell Grants for adult students?

A:   Because without the President's policy change, these students would not benefit enough
     under either HOPE or Pell. Under HOPE, they are so poor that they do not have
     sufficient tax liability to benefit fully. But under the fonnula for Pell Grants, they are not
     considered poor enough for aid. The change would acknowledge that they should
     receive Pell Grants.
                                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion


               Impact of Alternative Minimum Tax on Education Tax Cuts


Q:   ISN'T IT TRUE THAT MANY AMERICANS WILL NOT GET THE
     EDUCATION TAX CUTS AS ADVERTISED BECAUSE OF THE
     ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX?

A:   The overwhelming share of families will be unaffected by the AMT. The AMT will
     affect only a small fraction of taxpayers. The balanced budget delivered a HOPE
     Scholarship to 5.8 million students and 7.1 million students will qualify for a Lifetime
     Learning Tax Credit. Additionally, it included a child tax credit for 27 million families.
      Out of these many millions of taxpayers, a very small fraction, (about 200,000) will be
     affected by the AMT in 1998 because of these tax cuts.      [Absent the tax cut bill an estimated
     1 million people would be affected by the AMI in 1998. Ihe new tax cuts will add 200,000 people in
     1998 and about 500,000 in 1999]


·    This is not a big issue now but the number of taxpayers affected by the AMT will grow
     over time, making it a significant issue down the road. It therefore should be studied and
     that is what the Treasury Department is doing. [By 2007, about 11 million people will be
     affected by the AMI -- of which 2.4 million will be affected by the AMI "because of the new tax cut law]
                                                                       Hex-Dump Conversion
                                    Rising College Costs


Q:   On Wednesday, the College Board released the Annual Survey of Colleges, 1997-98, that
     indicates that undergraduates at American colleges will pay, on average, approximately 5·
     percent more this year than last in tuition and fees at four-year institutions, and from 2 to
     4 percent more at two-year institutions. How do these increase relate to the
     Administration's policies? Specifically, will the availability of the increased aid - both
     the tax credits and Pell Grant increases - fuel the increases in college costs?

A:   The report by the College Board reinforces our reason for being at a community college.
     Nearly half -- 46 percent -- of undergraduates are attending community colleges. The
     College Board, in the report released on Wednesday, estimated that tuition and fees
     increased by only 2 percent at these institutions between 1996-97 and 1997-98. This is
     below the general rate of inflation and reflects the commitment that these institutions
     have made to keeping higher education affordable for all students.

     Moreover, historically, tuition has not increased at a faster rate when federal aid has
     increased significantly.

     We are concerned that some institutions might raise tuition and fees so that they can
     gamer additional revenues. We will carefully monitor the tuition and fees charged by
     colleges and universities as the tax credits are implemented and will work to actively
     encourage institutions to keep tuition and fee increases to a minimum.

                                                                       ,ex-Dump onversJOn


Question:   In the past, welfare recipients often went to community college to prepare
            themselves for the workforce. What is the impact of the new law's work
            requirements on these individuals? Doesn't the law force them to drop out of
            college to work?

Answer:     The welfare reform law that President Clinton signed last year emphasizes work
            and personal responsibility. Under the new TANF program, people on welfare
            can combine required work activities with additional education.

            Although it is not easy to raise children, work in a job, and go to school at the
            same time, many Americans do so each year. Most undergraduate students,
            whether or not they are raising a child, work while attending college.

            The Administration has clarified that it will recognize work performed inthe
            federal Work Study as counting toward the law's work participation requirements,
            provided the required number of hours of work are performed. We are also
            encouraging colleges to work with state and local officials to explore other ways
            to accommodate college attendance with the requirements of welfare reform.
            Under the T ANF program, states have the authority to use an array of services and
            activities, including education and training, to prepare welfare recipients for work
            and self-sufficiency.
