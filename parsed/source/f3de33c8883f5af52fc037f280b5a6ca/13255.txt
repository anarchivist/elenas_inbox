TEXT:
I explained to Harold what we knew at the earlier meeting today
about the two potential appeals. Based on that information, he
felt we should appeal the ruling on the enjoined sales and should
also appeal the ruling on the sales where the top bidder went out
of business, unless DoJ has a compelling argument that they have
no case and we would be hurt by the appeal -- i.e. it would be
frivolous and they would be sanctioned.  If you get contradictory
information, please page me and we can raise this with Harold
again.  But if you find only that DoJ thinks it is legally
acceptable to appeal one or both rulings, then Harold thinks we
should go ahead and appeal them.
