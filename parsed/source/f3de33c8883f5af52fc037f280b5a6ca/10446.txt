TEXT:
Charter schools. A report on 17 California charter schools was released
on December 3
that emphasized a number of ways in which charter schools have "failed to
live up to their promise".    The report's primary criticisms are that
charter schools 1) are not yet being held highly accountable for academic.
achievement, 2) generally depend on private resources to supplement their
public funding, 3) exercise some control over the type of students
enrolled through contracts requiring parental involvement and strict
discipline codes, 4) don't frequently collaborate with -- or spark changes
in -- other local public schools.   To address these concerns, the report
recommends strengthening accountability through requirements for more
specific performance goals, targeting federal and state charter school
funding to low-income schools, expanding access through better information
and transportation and curtailment of parental participation requirements
and strictly enforced discipline codes, and facilitating more colaboration
among charter and other public schools.   The recently enacted Charter
School Expansion Act of 1998 addresses some of these issues --
establishing a funding priority for states that have increased the number
of quality, accountable charter schools and for states that adopt stronger
accountability provisions for charter schools, and by creating a 10% set-
aside for "cross-fertilization" grants to support collaboration among
charter and other public schools.
