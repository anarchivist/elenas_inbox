           TEXT:
           As a follow-up to my earlier e-mail, here is the Wolf Amendment language
           that was rejected by the House Appropriations Committee.  HHS expects Sen.
           Craig to offer something similar in the Senate Appropriations Committee
           tomorrow. The draft HHS language would serve as a substitute to it.

           "None of the funds appropriated under this Act shall be expended to pay
           for any abortion or to assist in the purchase, in whole or in part, of
           health benefit coverage that includes coverage of abortion.

           The Limitation established in the preceding section shall not apply to an
           abortion ---

           (1) if the pregnancy is the result of an act of rape or incest; or
           (2) in the case where a woman suffers from a physical disorder; physical
           illness, or physical injury that would, as certified by a physician, place
           the woman in danger of death unless an abortion is performed."
