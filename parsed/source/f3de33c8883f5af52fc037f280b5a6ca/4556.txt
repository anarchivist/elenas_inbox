  TEXT:
  I'm re-sending this statement to you with everyone's proposed changes in
  bold. The lines on "nation of immigrants" was a suggestion made by Rob
  Weiner-- if you don't think they sound right, we can drop them.

  We've heard from everyone including INS and DOJ at this point.   Maria is
  out today so she'll let us know in the morning if she has any major
  problems.  Otherwise, everyone is fine with the statement.

  Please let me know if you have any other changes.   I will ship off to the
  press folks tonight.  Thanks!

STATEMENT ON THE FINAL REPORT OF THE COMMISSION ON IMMIGRATION
REFORM

The Commission on Immigration Refonn, chaired by the Honorable Shirley Hufstedler, and the
late Barbara Jordan, issued its final report today. This report, which reiterates many ofthe
excellent recommendations contained in the Commission's interim reports, further contributes to
our country's understanding of the role of immigration in the United States. I commend the
Commission's work and its contribution to the national dialogue on immigration policy.

[America has always been a nation of immigrants. From the start, a steady stream of
people have left their own lands to make this land their home.] I am proud of the significant
progress my Administration has made toward improving America's immigration system. My
Administration has curtailed illegal immigration through tougher border control, strengthened
worksite enforcement, and the removal of record numbers of criminal and other illegal aliens.
We have also worked to improve and tighten the naturalization process, and have made
needed refonns to our asylum system for refugees fleeing persecution.

One of the Commission's recommendations is to restructure the immigration system by
reallocating the main functions ofthe Immigration and Naturalization Service to other agencies.
 This proposal raises difficult and complex issues, which need further consideration. I have
asked the Domestic Policy Council to coordinate with the affected federal agencies to evaluate
carefully the Commission's proposal and other refonn options designed to improve the
executive branch's administration of the nation's immigration laws.

With this report, the Commission completes its work. I want to thank all of its members and
staff for their service and contribution on these important issues.
