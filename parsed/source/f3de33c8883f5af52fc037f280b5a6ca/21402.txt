The House is expected to take up H.R. 3789 - Class Action Jurisdiction Act
of 1998 first thing tomorrow (Friday) morning.  position: Attorney General
would recommend veto.  please review & provide comments/clearance by 9am

DRAFT --.NOT FOR RELEASEOctober 1, 1998

(House)

H.R. 3789 - Class Action Jurisdiction Act of 1998
(Hyde (R) Illinois and 10 cosponsors)

The Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 3789, and if it
were presented to the President, the Attorney General would recommend that
he veto the bill.

H.R. 3789 would grant Federal district courts jurisdiction in almost all
class action cases where any class member is a citizen of a State
different from the State of any defendant.   This would have the effect of
transferring a significant number of class actions into Federal court and
LJ&.federalizing08 class action standards. States should be permitted to
manage their own courts unless it can be demonstrated that there is a
nationwide problem interfering with the fair adjudication of cases.   Since
this has not been demonstrated, the responsibility for handling class
action litigation should continue to be shared between the State and
Federal systems.

Class action litigation provides an important mechanism for vindicating
the rights of plaintiffs whose individual claims would not warrant
separate litigation and for resolving large numbers of related claims in a
single action. H.R. 3789 also would require class action cases that are
not certified in Federal court to be remanded to State courts and stripped
of their class allegations, even if such a class could have been certified
under applicable State standards. This provision would eliminate a viable
remedy for individuals suffering injuries who could not otherwise afford
to bring suit on their own and would significantly infringe on State
courtsO, ability to offer redress to their citizens.

H.R. 3789 would move substantial numbers of State class actions to Federal
courts at a time when the Chief Justice, among others, has expressed
serious concerns about the workload of the Federal courts. A study by the
Federal Judicial Center demonstrated that class actions are much more
resource-intensive than other kinds of civil litigation.  Particularly at
a time when so many vacancies on the Federal bench exist, moving virtually
all class actions to Federal courts would be counterproductive.

(Do Not Distribute Outside Executive Office of the president)

This Statement of Administration Policy was developed by the Legislative
Reference Division (Schroeder), in consultation with the Departments
Commerce (Clark) and the Treasury (Levy), Administrative Office of the
u.S. Courts (Blommer), WHC (Wilson), WHLA (Johnson, Jacoby), OVP (Brown),
NEC (Rosen), OMB/GC (Aitken), HTF (Chapin), TCJS (Thompson), and BASD
(Balis) .
Justice, SEC, and DPC did not respond to our request for views on this SAP.

OMB/LA Clearance:

The House Judiciary Committee reported H.R. 3789 as amended on September
10, 1998.

Justice advises that the Attorney General will veto recommend of H.R. 3789
and that the Office of Legal Counsel may have a constitutional issue with
the provision of H.R. 3789 related to remanding an action to State court
(see description of provision below) .

Administration position to Date

On July 27, 1998, the Department of Justice sent a letter to the House
Judiciary Committee strongly opposing H.R. 3789. Although the letter
acknowledged that the· SubcommitteeD,s revised bill did address some of the
DepartmentD,s concerns, the Department strongly opposed H.R. 3789 because
it would transfer a significant number of cases to Federal courts and woul
d D&federalizeD8 class action standards.

On June 18, 1998, the Department of Justice sent a letter to the House
Judiciary Subcommittee on Courts and Intellectual Property opposing H.R.
3789 because it would have the effect of narrowing access to class action
procedures.

Major Provisions of H.R. 3789

Federal Court Jurisdiction.  H.R. 3789 would grant Federal district courts
jurisdiction over all class action litigation, in which any member of a
proposed plaintiff class is a citizen of a State different from the State
of any defendant or if the plaintiff or defendant is a citizen of a
foreign state.

Exceptions.   The bill states that district courts D&shouldD8 abstain from
exercising their jurisdictional authority in cases where:        (1) a
,;&substantial maj ori tyrJ8 of the plain tiff class and the primary defendants
are citizens of the same State; and (2) the claims asserted will be
governed primarily by the laws of that State.

District courts would have the discretion, but would not be required, to
assert jurisdictional authority over cases in which:   (1) all proposed
plaintiff class members are seeking a total of less than $1 million in
damages; (2) there are less than 100 members in the plaintiff classes; or
(3) the primary defendants are States, State officials, or other
governmental entities against whom a u.S. district court may be prohibited
from ordering relief.

In situations where the defendant is a corporation and deemed a citizen in
multiple States,  Federal court jurisdiction would only apply if a member
of the plaintiff class is a citizen of a State different from all States
where the defendant corporation is deemed a citizen.



H.R. 3789 would not apply to certain class action litigation brought under
the Securities Act of 1933.

Procedures for Removal.  H.R. 3789 would permit any defendant or any
plaintiff class member who is not a named or representative class member
to request the removal of a case from State court to Federal court. The
request for removal may occur at any time before or after the c
ertification of a class.

Under current law, a defendant who receives paper (e.g., a pleading,
motion, order, etc.) from which it may be ascertained that the case is
removable, must file for removal within 30 days of receipt of the paper.
A defendant may file for removal beyond the 3D-day limit only if it can
prove that it did not receive paper from which it could be ascertained
that the case is removable.
H.R. 3789 would apply this provision to an unnamed plaintiff and would
require the party filing for removal to Federal court (the defendant or an
unnamed plaintiff) to exercise O&due diligence08 when filing for removal
beyond the 3D-day limit.

Remanding to State Court.  In situations where an action was removed to
Federal court and subsequently O&no aspect08 of the class action can be
maintained under Federal law, the action would be remanded to State court
and stripped of its class action allegations.

In addition, the period of limitations for any claim remanded to State
court on behalf of any member, named or unnamed, of the plaintiff class
shall be tolled to the full extent provided under Federal law.

General Accounting Office Study. H.R. 3789 would require the Comptroller
General to report to Congress, within one year of the date of enactment,
on how the bill has affected the workload of the Federal courts.

Applicability.  H.R. 3789 would apply to any action commenced on or after
the date of enactment.

Pay-As-You-Go Scoring

According to BASD (Balis) and TCJS (Thompson), H.R. 3789 would not affect
direct spending or receipts, and therefore is not subject to the
pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act. CBO
concurs.
