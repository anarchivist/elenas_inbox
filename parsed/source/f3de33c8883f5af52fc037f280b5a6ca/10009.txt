I chatted with Bruce about this when I couldn't reach you on the phone and
all but the last sentence is some version of what he said -- which doesn't
mean it couldn't be improved!==================== ATTACHMENT   1 ===================

Q:   Will the President propose higher cigarette taxes, as reported in today's Wall Street
     Journal?

A:   Absolutely no decisions have been made about what if anything the President's budget
     will include on tobacco. No recommendations have been made to the President, and no
     proposals have been considered. Certainly, the President will continue to do everything
     he can to reduce youth smoking, but its too early to say what his budget will or won't
     include.

Q:   But won't a $200 billion state settlement make it more likely that the President
     would propose something less than $1.10 per pack?

A:   It is completely premature to speculate on what the President will include in his budget.
     We have not even seen the state settlement yet and as you know the amount of that
     settlement will depend on how many states opt into it.
