TEXT:
Elena,
I just heard from Ingrid and Peter that the H1B Abraham/Smith compromise
bill is scheduled to go to the House and Senate floor next week.
According to Peter, Abraham may have altered this proposal to include some
of the changes that we had suggested.  Peter is trying to schedule a
meeting on the Hill with Abraham's staff this afternoon to discuss this in
detail.
