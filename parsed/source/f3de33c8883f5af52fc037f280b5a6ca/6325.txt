TEXT:
Good news!  I have received word from industry lobbyists that the
leadership has decided to put off the cloture vote and ask the Judiciary
Committee to review the Bond/Frist and Feinstein/Kennedy bills (although
technically the bills will remain on the calendar and not be referred to
committee). The leadership made this move after the most recent vote
count showed they had lost 10 Rs and the Ds were united.  I am checking
with HHS to see if they agree with this intelligence.

Next Hurdle -- there is a House Judiciary Committee hearing on Thursday at
llam and we still haven't decided who we are sending. Varmus would seem
the obvious choice, but HHS has some reservations.  The hearing is already
stacked against us.  Armey, Bond, and Ehlers are testifying. There is
also a panel of pseodo-scientists who will present the right-to-life view
point.  It is critical we send a scientist with stature to make our case.
