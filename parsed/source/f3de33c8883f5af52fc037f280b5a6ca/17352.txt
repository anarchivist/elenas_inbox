TEXT:
tomorrow nga will release a poicy resolution on tobacco that says hhs
indicated that letters would be sent to states claiming that a portion of
the funds from settlements belonged ot the feds, that the govs believe
that as a matter of law the entire amount belongs to the states, and that
if the feds wanted part of the settlement they should have joined the
lawsuits.
