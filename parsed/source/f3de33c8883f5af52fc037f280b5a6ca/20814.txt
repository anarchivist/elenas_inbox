TEXT:
I agree that the upcoming NAS report on single food agency is a potential
problem (we don't know how much attention it will get) but it also may be
a good opportunity to move the agencies into bolder than usual action.
Here is my preliminary list of options for preempting/responding to the
report:

1.   Create a Joint Food Safety Council. Currently, there is a joint food
safety budget but it comes about basically by combinig the budget requests
of the relevant agencies.  By EO, the President could appoint the relevant
agency heads to a council to annually produce a unified budget and
strategic plan. One of the major criticisms is the disperate resources
the different agencies have (USDA 5,000 inspectors, FDA 300). The Council
could be charged with creating a plan to properly allocate resources and
authority.

2.   Follow-up the NAS report by appointing a panel to see how it should
be implemented. This is the informal recommendation of the food safety
advocates at CSPI. They would like to see the Mike Taylors, the Kesslers,
etc. appointed to a panel to recomend what the next step should be in
coordinating and creating a single food agency.

3.   Public hearings with interested parties. The agencies have drafted a
plan for this for the federal register. The hearings would center on a
'mission statement' they wrote which I'll give you at the Team leaders
meeting.   I think the hearings are worthhile, I don't think the mission
statement stands up to scrutiny.

4.    Endorse all or part of the Pallone bill.  Pallone has a bill that
would require all non-registering plants to register with FDA (currently
meat register with USDA).   It also requires quarterly inspections and
works to even out the inspectors problems. The farm community has big
problems with this bill, but I'm trying to get USDA to break out parts
that would be done by EO or reform the bill into one we could push for.

I like the first idea the most.  It is a tangible step towards unifying
food safety planning. We should also try and combine it with some EO that
actually does something, like from the Pallone bill.
