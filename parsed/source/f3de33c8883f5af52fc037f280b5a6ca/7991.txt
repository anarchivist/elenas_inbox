                                         Tobacco Q&A
                                          June 8, 1998


Q.     What is your position on the CraigiCoverdeU amendmentto the tobacco bill?

A.     Drug abuse among youth is a deadly serious issue, and that is why I have taken numerous
       actions to prevent it. But we should not allow people to manipulate this issue -- and
       others even further afield to kill tobacco legislation. The Craig-Coverdell amendment
       includes numerous provisions that have nothing to do with youth smoking including
       school voucher proposals and anti-union actions. We should focus in a tobacco bill on
       reducing youth smoking and not allow Members of Congress to inject these kind of
       poison pills.

Q.     What is your position on the Daschle amendment to the tobacco bill?

A.     I am skeptical of attempts to divert funding away from public health and medical research
       for a tax cut. I am concerned that these amendments will endanger our priorities --
       namely, providing for smoking cessation and prevention, counteradvertising, research
       into smoking related diseases such as cancer and heart disease, assistance to farmers and
       farming communities, and reimbursement to the states for their expenditures for
       smoking-related illnesses. Of course, I would very much prefer Senator Daschle's
       amendment to the Gramm amendment, because it is reasonably sized and because it is far
       more targeted at families who actually experience a marriage penalty.

[Background: Senator Daschle's amendment would provide married couples with a 20 percent
deduction against the lower-earning spouse's income, phased out between $50,000 and $60,000
of income. The amendment would also provide full-deductibility of health insurance costs for
the self-employed. The Daschle amendment would cost significantly less than the Gramm
amendment, and targets tax relief at those couples who are actually penalized by the tax code.]

Q.     Do you think the bill is dying?

A.     Absolutely not. Certainly I would have preferred for Congress to pass the bill last week.
        But these are complicated issues and members have a range of different priorities that
       need to be worked through. I always knew that passing a comprehensive tobacco bill
       would not be easy, and we are making steady progress. I continue to believe that the
       Senate, and then the full Congress, will pass this bill. They will otherwise have to
       explain themselves to the American people.
                                                             Hex.oump Conversion
Q.   What is your view of activity in the House?

A.   Last week, I said how pleased I was to see that momentum for tobacco legislation is
     now building in the House of Representatives. I believe that the bipartisan,
     comprehensive legislation proposed by Representatives Hansen, Meehan and
     Waxman, which has over 90 co-sponsors, is a good, tough bill. I look forward to
     working with Representatives Hansen, Meehan, Waxman and all of their House
     colleagues to improve this bill in order to protect farmers and farming communities.
      With this change, I would be pleased to sign this bill. I call upon the House of
     Representatives to take up the bill and get down to the serious business of reducing
     youth smoking in this country.
