TEXT:
Dottie Rayburn from USAID (who handles Leg. Affairs there) called to
discuss the situation on the Hill with international family planning
what she describes as multiple pending dangers for Mexico City language to
be added as amendments to pending appropriations bills. Apparently, an
alternative to Chris Smith's amendment, which we supported (allowing
federal funds to go to organizations that do not promote abortion as a
means of family planning), was narrowly defeated in the House last week
and Smith's version is still alive (having passed in the. House by the
largest margin yet, 234-191).

Martha Foley and Al Maldon are the leads in WH Leg Affairs tracking this,
but Dottie thought that it might be time to expand the discussion to
examine the outreach/women's policy implications of the congressional
fight.  As you know, Ann Lewis and Maria had been involved during the
battle in the Spring.

please let me know if or how you think we should get involved. Do you
think it makes sense to call a meeting on this? Do you want to check in
with Martha or Al first or would you like me to? Thanks.
