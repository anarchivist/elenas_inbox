TEXT:
SSA tells me that Rep. Franks and Sen. Torricelli may introduce the week
of May 10th a bill to preclude payment of Social Security benefits to
those who participated in Nazi persecutions or genocide.   As you may
recall, there was lots of talk last Congress about a Franks bill being
introduced, but nothing came of it.    (Note: we never agreed to an
Administration position on the draft legislation.)
