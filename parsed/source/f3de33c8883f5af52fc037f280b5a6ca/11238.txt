                                    Medicare Questions
                                     February 18,1999


Q.   Will you support the Breaux plan now that he is indicating that he will include
     prescription drugs?

A.   We look forward to seeing any proposal that provides affordable, accessible prescription
     drug benefit to all Medicare beneficiaries. But as you know, the Senator did not release
     any details of his proposal yesterday.


Q.   Yesterday,.the Medicare Commission released its estimates of the Breaux plan,
     saying that it will save hundreds of billions of dollars. Doesn't this suggest that
     premium support is the answer to Medicare's solvency problem?

A.   A premium support proposal designed properly can probably produce savings. However,
     our independent actuaries have not yet finished their analysis to be able to assess and
     affirm the Commission staff estimates.


Q.   Is it possible for this Medicare Commission to finish its work on time, and if not,
     would you support an extension past its March 1 deadline?

A.   It would be inappropriate for us to comment on the Commission's time frame before
     consulting with Senator Breaux and Mr. Thomas on this matter. At the moment, they
     have not asked for an extension.


MEDICARE COMMISSION

Q:   Do you support Senator Breaux's Medicare proposal?

A.   First, let me remind you ofthe President's position on Medicare. He believes that we
     should dedicate 15 percent of the projected surpluses over the next 15 years to extending
     until 2020 the life of the Medicare Trust Fund. As the President indicated, however, his
     preference is to utilize these new resources in the context of broader improvements in the
     program which modernize the program, make it more efficient, provide for prescription
     drug benefits, and still extend the life of the Trust Fund until 2020. With respect to
     Senator Breaux' proposal, we believe it serves no useful purpose to comment on each
     proposal that emerges as part of the Commission's deliberations. However, the
     President has stated that he will evaluate any proposal to see that it:

            Dedicates Surplus to Secure Medicare until 2020.
            Modernizes Medicare and Make It More Competitive.
                                                                 llex-Dump Conversion

            Guarantees Defined Set of Benefits wlo Excessive New Costs to Beneficiaries
            Use Savings from Refonn to Help Fund a Prescription Drug Benefit.

     We look forward to working with Senator Breaux and the rest of the Commission as they
     move forward with their important work.


Q.   What do you think of the premium support proposal that the Commission is
     considering?

A:   "Premium support" is a concept worth considering but, as with any initiative, the devil is
     in the details. We will carefully review the proposal and see whether it meets the
     following principles:

            Dedicates Surplus to Secure Medicare until 2020.
            Modernizes Medicare and Make It More Competitive.
            Guarantees Defined Set of Benefits wlo Excessive New Costs to Beneficiaries
            Use Savings from Refonn to Help Fund a Prescription Drug Benefit.


Q:   The Medicare Commission may propose to raise the Medicare eligibility age from 65
     to 67 --making it consistent with phase-up for Social Security. What is the
     Administration's position on this proposal?

A:   As we have said many times, we have serious concerns about raising the Medicare
     eligibility age. Indeed, the President has emphasized that we need to focus our attention
     on the most rapidly growing group of uninsured Americans -- Americans between the
     ages of 55 and 65. So we would view any such proposal with a good bit of skepticism.


Q:   Senator Breaux is recommending an income-related premium. Do you support
     this?

A:   The President has indicated in the past his openness to this concept. However, any such
     proposal would have to be considered in the context of an entire package of refonns.


PRESCRIPTION DRUGS

Q.   The President's Medicare Commission appointees have said that they would only
     support the recommendations of the Medicare Commission if they include a
     prescription drug benefit. Is this a litmus test for the President?

A.   The President believes that any proposal to provide a long-overdue prescription drug
     benefit should take place within the context of broader Medicare refonn. He does
                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion


     believe, however, that a meaningful prescription drug benefit for all beneficiaries can and
     should be included in any such proposal. We have learned that successfully achieving
     meaningful Medicare reform can only happen in a bipartisan fashion. For this reason,
     we look forward to working with members on both sides ofthe aisle to add this important
     benefit this year.


Q.   Won't a prescription drug benefit, even in the context of broader reforms, result in
     higher Medicare spending? How can it be afforded at a time when the program is
     facing a serious financing crisis?

A.   Senator Breaux has said that not having a prescription drug benefit in 2000 is like not
     having hospital coverage in 1965. Prescription drugs have become an essential part of
     treatments and cures, and are expected to play an even greater role in health care in the
     next century. The President believes that additional savings from making Medicare
     more efficient should be used to help finance a long-overdue prescription drug benefit for
     all Medicare beneficiaries. It would be penny-wise and pound-foolish not to add this
     benefit.


Q.   Is it true, as some Medicare Commission appointees suggest, that since 65 percent of
     Medicare beneficiaries already have some type of coverage, a new Medicare drug
     benefit would simply replace private dollars with government subsidies?

A.   Absolutely not. Medicare beneficiaries have no coverage (35 percent), inadequate or
     declining private coverage (38 percent), Federally subsidized coverage through Medicare
     managed care or Medicaid (20 percent) or coverage that changes in the course of the year
     (7 percent). Thus, there is no stable, private source of financing for this critical benefit.
     Moreover, it would be virtually impossible to design a policy that only targets those
     beneficiaries without coverage, since existing coverage is so rapidly changing.


SURPLUS

Q:   Doesn't the President's plan to reserve part of the surplus for Medicare represent a
     "pass" on real Medicare reform?

A:   Absolutely not. Improving and strengthening Medicare requires adequate financing,
     making the program more competitive, and assuring a more modernized, defined benefits
     package. By assuring a significant infusion of much-needed revenue, the President's
     proposal actually makes it easier for Democrats and Republicans to come together to
     develop reforms that strengthen the program.
                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion



Q:   Could the surplus just be used for a new prescription drug benefit?

A:   The President believes that a new prescription drug benefit should be included as part of,
     not independent from, a broader set of policies to improve the Medicare program. He
     believes that it would be irresponsible to focus only on expanding benefits without
     addressing the financial and structural challenges facing the program.
