To All:

As you know, we (finally!) reached an agreement with Sen. Abraham


tonight. Attached are the agreed upon changes to the Abraham-Smith
proposal.  There is a chance that the bill will reach the House floor
tomorrow (Thursday), but we're trying to get it moved to Friday to give us
more time to look over legislative language.

Changes to Abraham-Smith Proposal

1.    Requires a $500 fee for each nonimmigrant for which an application is filed or renewed.
      Fee to fund training provided under JTPA Title IV (approx. 65%) and a percentage for a
      NSF scholarship and mentoring programs for minority students (approx. 30%). In
      addition, a portion of these revenues would fund the administration of the H-IB visa
      program, including the cost of enforcement (approx. 5%).

2.    Defines H-IB-dependent employers as:

      a.     Employers with fewer than 25 employees and more than 7 H-IB workers; and

      b.     Employers with 26-49 employees and more than 12 H-lB workers; and

      c.     Employers with more than 50 workers where at least 15% of their workforce is
             H-IB.

3.    The recruitment and no lay-off attestations applies to: (1) H-IB dependent employers; and
      (2) any employer who, within the previous 5 years, has been found to have willfully
      violated its obligations under this law.

4.    H-IB dependent employers attests they will not place an H-IB worker with another
      employer, under certain employment circumstances, where the other employer has
      displaced or intends to displace a U.S. worker during the period beginning 90 days before
      and ending 90 days after the date the placement would begin.

5.    DOL has the authority to investigate compliance either: (1) pursuant to a complaint by an
      aggrieved party; or (2) if the Secretary receives specific credible information, provides
      reasonable cause to believe that a willful violation, or pattern or practice of violations, or
      serious violations affecting multiple employees (or job applicants) may have occurred.

6.    Appropriate sanctions for violations of "whistleblower" protections.

7.    Closes loopholes in the attestations:

      a.     Strikes the provision that "[n]othing in the [recruitment attestation] shall be
             construed to prohibit an employer from using selection standards normal or
             customary to the type of job involved." Substitute with "[n]othing in the
             [recruitment attestation] shall be construed to prohibit an employer from using
             legitimate selection criteria relevant to the job that are normal and customary to
             the type of job involved, provided that the criteria are not applied in a
             discriminatory manner." Plus report language that this provision is not intended
             to subvert the recruitment attestation.

      b.     Clarifies that job contractors can be sanctioned for placing an H-IB worker with
             following placement.

      c.     Does not exempt H-1B workers with at least a master's degree or the equivalent
             from calculations of the total number ofH-lB employees; and does not exempt
             workers who earn at least $60,000.

      d.     Rather than defining lay-off based on termination for "cause or voluntary
             termination," adds "Nothing herein is intended to limit an employee's rights under
             collective bargaining agreements or other employment contracts."

8.    Maintains status quo with regard to LeA approval and petition processes.

9.    Makes more explicit that the definition of U.S. workers does not include other H-1B
      workers for purposes of this bill.

10.   Includes a provision that prohibits unconscionable contracts (with civil fines).

11.   Includes a "no benching" requirement that an H-1B nonimmigrant in "non-productive
      status" for reasons such as training, lack of license, lack of assigned work, or other such
      reason (not including when the employee is unavailable for work) be paid for a 40 hour
      week or a prorated portion of a 40 hour week during such time.
                 .                                                                         .
12.   Increases the annual cap on H-lB visas to 115,000 in FY 1999, 115,000 in FY 2000, and
      107,500 in FY 2001. After FY 2001, the visa cap returns to 65,000.

13.   Eliminates the 7500 cap on the number of non-physician health care workers admitted
      under the H-lB program to make the bill consistent with our obligations under the GATS
      agreement.

14.   Amends 212(n)(2)(C) (willful violations) to specify $5000 penalty and 2 year debarnlent.
       Amends the new penalty section for willful violations plus layoff to specify $35,000
      penalty and 3 year debarment.

15.   Pennanently broadens the definition of prevailing and actual wages to include other fonns
      of compensation and benefits.

16.   Transfers administration of the arbitration process to the Attorney General.
