TEXT:
Ken tells me that Frank plans to emphasize how we are saving 55,000 kids
in press conference in response to questions on childrens' SSI. This is
getting a lot of press interest (Pear, Havemann will come to SSA press
conference today to cover this).

I wanted to flag this to you because it increases the risk that people
figure out we spent $2 billion and they add it to the fix package total.
That $2b is nowhere in our documents.  We can say this is an
administrative interpretation, not a policy change, so it shouldn't be
added to $17.9, but it is a risk.
