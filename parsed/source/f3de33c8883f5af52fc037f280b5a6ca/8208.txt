                                          H-2A Reform Proposal


      This proposal is for a NPRM in four parts. Part I would discuss the steps already taken by DOL
      to streamline the H-2A program. Part II would layout the reforms that are being noticed for
      rulemaking. Part III would preview a proposed rule that is under development and would give a
      firm deadline for noticing that rule. Part IV would mention other areas where we are
      considering reform.

       Part I
     . Actions accomplished
       (by General Administrative Letter (GAL) directive)

      a.     The Labor Department now requires "positive recruitment" of U.S. farmworkers only in
             areas where DOL finds that there are a significant number of qualified workers willing to
             make themselves available for employment at the time and place needed.

      b.     The Labor Department now counts as "available" for employment only those U.S.
             workers who are identified by name, address and social security number.

      c.     The Labor Department has submitted a reprogramming request to Congress that would
             allow for the provision of automated support for the labor certification process. Such
             automation could be implemented within six to eight months of the availability of
             funding.

             This automation would affect both the goal of meeting the existing 7-day deadline after
             receipt of initial application to notifY employer of deficiencies precluding adjudication of
             the application and the 20-day deadline -- prior to the employers' "date of need" -- to
             issue approved certifications.

      Part II
      Rulemaking proposals -- Stage 1

      a.     Require employers' H-2A labor certification applications to be submitted 45 (rather than
             60) days prior to the employers' "date of need."

      b.     Reduce the deadline for employer-provided housing to be available for inspection from
             30 to 15 days prior to the employers' "date of need."

      c.     Growers will no longer be required to use a registered farm labor contractors (FLCs or
             "crew leaders") as a source of U.S. workers if the FLC has a demonstrated history of
             employing illegal or unauthorized workers or of other labor abuses.

      d.     Eliminate requirement that certified H-2A employers provide notice ofH-2A workers'
             departure for the place of employment.
                                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion
Part III
Rulemaking proposal -- Stage 2
This notice would set a deadline (120 days?) for noticing a rule that effects this reform. This
reform would likely require rulemaking by both DOl and DOL.

a.     INS to delegate H-2A petition approval authority to DOL. Removing the INS
       adjudication step will result in a two-step (State -- DOL) process, rather than a three-step
       (State -- INS -- DOL) process. DOL will then provide simultaneous approval ofH-2A
       certification and petition approval.

Part IV
Rulemaking proposal -- Stage 3
This notice would mention the following other reforms as possibilities for future rulemaking.

a.     Allow H-2A program applicant-employers to include a bonding requirement for FLCs
       they employ. This will help protect employers from risks such as the FLC employing
       unauthorized workers or failing to perform.

b.     The Wage & Hour division at the Labor Department will have the authority to
       temporarily debar employers who commit serious labor standards or H-2A program
       violations from future use of the H-2A program.

c.     INS (or DOL) will issue petition approval (1-797) for replacement of certified H-2A
       workers upon proof of the worker's repatriation.

d.     SimplifY H-2A application and related documentation -- both job order applications and
       accompanying disclosure documentation -- for ease of integration with America's Job
       Bank (AJB). This simplification will accommodate electronic filing by
       employer-applicants and will further ease application information burden on previous
       program users found in compliance with program requirements.
                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion


1.   Does the substance and schedule seem reasonable?

2.   Will this proposal be effective in staving off congressional efforts to enact new
     guestworker legislation?

3.   Labor wants to be able to tell members of Congress that OMB has promised to expedite
     their review so that the new regulations will be in place by January or February of 1999
     (next growing season). What kind of promise can Labor make?

4.   Should we, as our proposal reflects, preview the reforms that we hope to pursue in a
     future rulemaking (Part IV)? Or should we wait until we are ready to issue the next
     NPRM?
