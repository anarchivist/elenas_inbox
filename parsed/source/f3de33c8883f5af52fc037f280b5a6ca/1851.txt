                FIRST LADY HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON
     WHITE HOUSE CONFERENCE ON EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT
                           THE EAST ROOM
                         WASHINGTON, D.C.
                            APRIL 17, 1997

       Welcome to the White House Conference on Early Childhood Development and
Learning.

       Welcome to those who are here with us in the East Room today, and to the thousands
who are joining us via satellite from universities, hospitals, and schools around the country.
Nearly 100 sites in 37 states.

       At first glance, it may seem odd to devote this august space to talking about babytalk.

         But that discussion has never been more important. Because science, as we will hear from
the experts who are with us today, has now given us a blueprint for child development in the
earliest years of life. Revolutionary new work has confirmed what many parents have
instinctively known all along: that the song a father sings to his child in the morning, a story a
mother reads to her child before bed, are some of the most important and lasting transactions
Americans can have. They lay the foundation for a child's life. And, in tum, for our nation's
future.

        So the President has convened this conference with a clear mission: To give the leading
experts in the field of early child development -- scientists, pediatricians, researchers, and others
-- the opportunity to synthesize their discoveries, make their insights accessible, and to put this
invaluable body of knowledge at the service of America's families.

         But not America's families alone. This information is crucial for anyone in the position of
leaving an impression on a child's growing mind: Day-care workers. Teachers. Doctors and
nurses. Television writers and producers. Government policy-makers. The list goes on. The plain
fact is: The responsibility for raising happy, respectful, well-adjusted children who will then
grow into happy, respectful, well-adjusted and productive citizens reaches far beyond any
individual family's front door. It belongs to all of us.

        It is astonishing what we now know about the young brain and about how children
develop. Just how far we have come is chronicled in a report being issued today by the Families
and Work Institute entitled Rethinking the Brain. Fifteen years ago, \ye thought that a baby's
brain structure was virtually complete at birth. Now we understand that it is a work in progress --
and that everything we do with a child has a good or bad physical influence on the rapidly
forming brain.


                                                  1

                                                                       Automated Records Management Systei,
                                                                               Kax.Dump Conversion
sounds and smells and feelings they encounter, the challenges they meet -- determine how their
brains are wired. The brain shapes itself through repeated experience. The more something is
repeated, the stronger the neuro-circuitry becomes. The connections, in turn, can be permanent.
In this way, the seemingly trivial events that a baby cannot recall -- hearing a song, getting a hug
after falling down, knowing when to expect a smile -- are anything but.

        For the first 3 years of their lives, children are laying down the fundamental circuitry that
will last them for as long as they breathe. They will learn to soothe themselves when they are
upset, to empathize, to get along. These experiences can determine nothing less than whether
children will grow up to be peaceful or violent citizens; focused or undisciplined workers;
attentive or detached parents themselves.

        We have reached the point where our understanding of a child's mind is catching up with
our understanding of a child's body. During the first part of the 20th century, science built a
strong foundation for the physical health of our children: Vaccines for polio and measles; a
knowledge of nutrition; a score of other remarkable, life-saving achievements. The last years of
this century are yielding similar breakthroughs, but for the brain. We are completing the job of
primary prevention. We are coming closer to the day when we will be able to ensure the
well-being of children in every domain -- physical, social, intellectual, and emotional.

          I have very high hopes for this conference. There are, however, two things I hope it will
not do.

        The first is to burden or overwhelm parents. Parenting is the hardest job in the world. The
information we offer today is meant to help parents, not to imprison them in a set of rules. If you
forget to read to your child one night, it's okay. There won't be any scars. Think of this
conference as a map. And like any good map, it shows you lots of different ways to get where
you need to go.

        I should add that many American parents have been asking for just such a map. A new
survey from the National Center for Infants, Toddlers, and Families shows a real hunger, on the
part of parents, for knowledge on how they can playa positive role in their child's early
development. I hope this conference will answer their call.

         The second is to create the impression that once that third birthday rolls around, the
important work is over. The early years are not the only years. The brain is the last organ to
become fully mature anatomically. The neurological circuitry for many emotions isn't completed
until a child reaches 15. This, I think, is reason for tremendous hope. It means that there is always
the chance to save a child. And it has special relevance for adoption: adoptive parents can make
an enormous difference -- even for older children.

          That said, here's what I hope this conference will accomplish.


                                                   2

                                                                           Automated Records Management System
                                                                                  Hex-DiJmp Conversion
with your child are also the best for his or her development: Singing, playing games, reading.
Some of my best memories are of reading to Chelsea -- even ifI fell asleep in the middle of
Goodnight Moon. Reading to her when she was young was ajoy to Bill and me. We think it was
ajoy for her. But we had no idea that it was literally turning on the power in her brain, firing up
the connections that would enable her to speak and then to read.

        I hope the science presented in this conference will ease the minds of parents whose
children are in day care. Good care is good care -- whether that care is given at home or at a
day-care center. This conference will provide a template for what that care looks like, ensuring
that even more young children get the attention they need to grow up right.

        I hope, too, that this conference will drive home a simple message -- one supported, in
great detail, by a report being issued today by the President's Council of Economic Advisers: If
we commit ourselves now to modest investments in the sound development of our children --
including our very youngest children -- we will lay the groundwork for an American future with
increased prosperity, better health, fewer social ills, and ever-greater opportunities for our
citizens to lead fulfilling lives in a strong country.

        Every child needs the stimulation of learning, reading, playing, singing and love to really
reach his or her highest emotional and intellectual potential. Children can lose out long before
they even get to preschool. And we cannot afford to lose even a drop of the potential of our
nation's children. It's a stark equation: invest now, or pay later.

       There's a line from the Talmud that says every blade of grass has an angel over it,
whispering grow, grow. Well, we must be angels unto our children. We knew this instinctively.
Now we know it scientifically.

        I am pleased to introduce someone who has been saying this for a long time -- maybe not
quoting the Talmud, but certainly expressing the sentiment. And who, as President of the United
States, has acted on these beliefs -- putting the security of children at the very center of national
policy. My husband. President Bill Clinton.
