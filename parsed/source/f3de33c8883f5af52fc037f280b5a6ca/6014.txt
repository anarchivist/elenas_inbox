TEXT:
Marca Bristo, Chair of the National Council on Disability, and the senior
Administration appointees with disabilities have requested another meeting
with Erskine to discuss the disability executive order, budget, personal
assistant services, child care, etc.  Instead, we will meet with the group
without Erskine and attempt to address their agenda.

The meeting will take place tomorrow (Friday, Jan 16) at 3:00 PM in room
211. Diana and I will circulate a short backgrounder before the meeting.
