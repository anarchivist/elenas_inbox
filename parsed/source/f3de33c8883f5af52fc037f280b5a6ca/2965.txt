TEXT:
FYI, ADAPT just sent the Pres. a letter delivering an ultimatum to the
President to endorse the principles of CASA by today, complaining we have
not delivered on our promises. Bill White is circulating it, with a draft
response from Maria for your ok, saying we are prepared to do a Pres.
meeting in September with staff meetings before (an option they reject in
their letter) .
