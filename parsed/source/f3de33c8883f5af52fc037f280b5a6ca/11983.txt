SUBJECT:                      ESEA OUTREACH

You asked for some recommendations on ESEA Outreach. Below is a summary of proposed and
on-going outreach activities as we ramp up to the transmittal of the administration's bill.

1. Constituency Outreach
The Education Department has conducted briefing with all of the key education group, the civil
rights community, special education groups, and other constituencies with strong interest in
ESEA. There are at least three groups that we should meet with both to brief them on any new
developments in our proposal and to allow an additional opportunity for input before we transmit
the bill.

We should schedule meetings the week of 3/29-412 with the following:
      - Civil rights groups -- LCCR, NAACP Legal Defense Fund, etc around accountability
      Issues.
      - Hispanic education groups -- Council of Great City Schools (urban districts), MALDEF,
      Nat'l Assoc of       Bilingual Educators, etc. (note: outstanding internal issue around use
      of" three year goal" language)
      - NEAl AFT -- particularly around the teacher quality and other accountability proposals.

2. Legislative Outreach
WH Leg affairs is working with ED's legislative affairs office to set up a series of discussions with
key House and Senate 'staff over the Congressional recess. ED has suggested the following
members as possible sponsors for key aspects of the legislation (they also have a list of sponsors
for other parts ofthe bill that the WH will probably not be involved with e.g., technical assistance
section). Broderick is reviewing this list and will work with Scott Fleming on setting up these
meetings over the next two weeks.

3_ Governors
This week, Mike Cohen and Bill White (IGA) met with Democratic governors' staff to brief them
on our ESEA proposals. The staff were particularly concerned about the civil rights implications
of the "no social promotions policy". IGA (BilllMike) will set up a conference call briefing
with the Democratic Governors' education advisors next week. IGA is also setting up a
bipartisan state
education advisors briefing for early April, prior to the ESEA rollout.

4. MayorslLocal Officials
Lynn Cutler has held a series of briefings on our ESEA proposal (and other matters e.g. census,
welfare) with various groups of local officials. Her staff is working with me to detennine
whether an additional briefing - prior to the introduction of the legislation - would be useful with
the US Conference of Mayors staff and possibly one or two other local elected officials groups.
