TEXT:
E-rate. The Chairmen and ranking members of the Senate arid House Commerce
committees (Mccain, Hollings, Dingell and Bliley) sent an extraordinarily
strongly worded letter to the FCC Thursday, asking that the e-rate program
be suspended.  The FCC will need to make a decision by Wednesday about how
to proceed. The Senate Commerce Committee has also called FCC
commisioners to testify at a Wednesday hearing to discuss further.    The
Vice President made a strong statement about the importance of the e-rate
in response to questions from the press during a Friday event, and he will
make another strong statement to the press at the beginning of an event on
another subject Monday morning.   The White House and Administration will
also continue to lead an aggressive congressional and press strategy to
highlight the importance of the e-rate over the next several days.
