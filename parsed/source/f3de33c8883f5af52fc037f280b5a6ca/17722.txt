Subject:         Senior Staff Coverage for Veteran's Day

As per Jason's email yesterday, I am collecting information on Senior
staff office coverage for Veterans Day, Tuesday, November 11. The Chief
of Staff has requested a complete list of senior staff (Assistants to the
president and Deputy Assistants to the President only) who will be working
the holiday, as well as the names of those senior staff on call and how
they can be reached.

Please submit your names to me no later than 10 am on Monday, November
10. We will be submitting this information to the Chief of Staff Monday
afternoon.

Also, remember to provide the WHCA Signal Switchboard with information of
how the senior staff who will be out of town may be reached.

Thank you.
