MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:          Bruce Reed
               Elena Kagan

RE:            DPC Weekly Report




       L Disability: Meeting Next Week with Disability Groups, Including ADAPT -- Next
Wednesday you will meet with disability advocates including ADAPT, the group that uses
disruptive tactics to push its message that Medicaid should cover personal attendant services.
The Office of Public Liaison committed to hold this meeting after ADAPT staged a disruption in
Georgia last year. We have broadened the agenda and the attendance to include other disability
advocates and issues, including the ADA, IDEA, employment, and the cutoffs of children on SSI.


ADAPT will push for your support of their bill, the Community Attendant Services Act (CASA),
which would mandate coverage of community-based attendant services for those now entitled to
nursing home. care. Speaker Gingrich introduced CASA in June without endorsing it, instead
calling it a "starting point" for dialogue and noting the cost implications. Because of the cost,
we will be unable to support CASA. However, we can discuss intermediate steps we are taking
to move ahead on this issue, although these are unlikely to satisfy ADAPT. Not all disability
groups are strong supporters of CASA.

         2. Crime: Crime Bill Anniversary -- Next Saturday will mark the third anniversary
of the Crime Act. In next week's radio address to commemorate the Crime Act, we plan to
release a community policing report prepared by the COPS Office and the last round of COPS
universal hiring grants for the fiscal year-- bringing the total number of community police
officers funded through the COPS program to over 65,000. The report highlights the
achievements of your signature community policing program as well as making the case that
community policing is making a difference is fighting crime. (NOTE FOR BRUCE: Rahm is
pretty unhappy with the latest draft that we got today. He's threatened to pull the radio address if
it's not improved by Monday. I'm planning on rewriting parts of it this weekend-- I wasn't sure if
you still wanted to include the bullet in the weekly with this caveat.)
                                                                                      Hex-Dump CJnversin'

        3. Education: Preliminary Injunction Denied in High Stakes Testing Case in North
Carolina. On August 29, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of North
Carolina refused to grant a preliminary injunction against a local school district policy which
requires all students in grades 3 through 8 to achieve a specified score on the North Carolina state
reading and math tests before they can be promoted to the next grade. Approximately 480
students have been retained as a result of the policy, which had been challenged on behalf of the
NAACP Legal Defense Fund and parents of 14 of the students affected. In denying relief, the
court found that the plaintiffs were "less than likely" to prevail on the merits of their claim.
Department of Education staff understands that the school district is adding additional measures
of student achievement for promotion purposes.
