    I will be around to help on this event until the night before.  I also
    think this event would be a very good opportunity for Andrea to have her
    first chance to brief POTUS. She has been doing a fabulous job     since
    she started, but especially since I got wrapped up in tobacco land -- and
    we need to make sure she's recognized for it.

    Subject:         Welfare to Work Partnership Event

    Based on the Ann Lewis meeting with Eli Segal and Partnership folks, here
    is the update on the May 27th welfare event.

    Program:
    Eli Segal - growth of Partnership (5,000 companies), success in terms of
    retention.
    Jerry Greenwald, United Airlines - good for business, tell his retention.
    success.
    Former Welfare Recipient - tells personal story of transition to work
    POTUS

    - Cabinet will be seated on Stage.
      CEOs/Board of Directors will be seated in the front row.
    - 10-15 former welfare recipients/success stories that the POTUS has met
    w/ previously and new ones will be seated in the front row.
    - 100 business members of the partnership in the audience.
 ,
 I/O




ISSUES NEEDING RESOLUTION:
1.   FYI: The welfare recipient the Partnerhip has recommended is
african-american.   She is from Smith-Barney and is featured in the PSA
campaign. Apparently, she has a magnificent story, but we are getting
other options.

2. The Partnership has requested a working meeting with the President,
Cabinet, Governors, and their Board of Directors prior to the event.
Ideally, they would like a longer substantive meeting, but Stephanie
Streett indicated that we can probably only get POTUS to drop-by for 15
minutes at the conclusion of their meeti.ng. The meeting would be in the
Roosevelt Room prior to the event.  This will come up at the next COS
scheduling meeting.

3. Governors will not have a speaking role, however, they will be invited
to a meeting before hand.  Are you okay with them not speaking --
particularly if they are not part of a substantive meeting wi POTUS before
hand if he only drops by.

Press Strategy:
Leak Partnership polling data and state by state numbers to USA Today for
weekend story over the 4 day Memorial Weekend prior to the Wednesday event.
Work stories for day of event wi Wall Street Journal (perhaps give them
the Fortune 500 companies that have signed up), and A.P.
CEOs meet with Washington Post Editorial Board morning of event.
CEOs submit Op-Ed's to key regional papers (ie. Chicago, Philadephia,NYT,)
Eli is meeting wi Peter Jennings to pitch good success stories for ABC to
follow leading up to the event.
TV and Radio PSAs are being distributed to networks and Bloomberg.   HBO
has committed to running them.
pitch CEOs for morning shows.
