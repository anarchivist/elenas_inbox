TEXT:
I have been thinking of trying to set up a weekly short (20 min.) meeting
with those in the office whose work impacts race policy. After each
meeting, I could do a short progress report to you. Does that sould like
it would be helpful?

Also, have you had a chance to look over my e-mail of last week re: the
PIR and the President's report? How would you like for me to proceed?
Thanks.

Julie
