TEXT:
Next week senior OMB staff will be conducting a series of briefings on the
FY 2000 federal budget.  As the agencies are still working on their
proposed budgets, these briefings are primarily an opportunity for groups


to tell OMB about their concerns. As space will be limited, I will have
to allot groups on a first come/first served basis.  I have listed the
times, briefers, and topics below.  If you would like to attend, please
e-mail me your name, organization, title, and date of birth and Social
Security numbers.  I will confirm your attendance bye-mail.   Please feel
free to pass this notice on to others in your office who might be
interested. The briefings will be in the Indian Treaty Room (ITR in the
list below) .
