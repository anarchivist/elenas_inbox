TEXT:
I've spoken to all the reporters on our list, and everybody seems fine.
My guess is we'll get medium sized stories on the inside pages (the Post
is putting it on the Fed page, for example) .

On the outreach front, I tried again to reach Obey, who has gone home
sick. Mike is giving the scoop to his staff.   I have calls into Rangel
and both civil rights leaders who didn't show today.
