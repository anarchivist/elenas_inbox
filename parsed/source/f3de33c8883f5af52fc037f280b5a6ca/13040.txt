TEXT:
        The House Judiciary Committee will mark up RLPA this Wednesday.
Nadl~r will offer his amendment to limit the bill to small landlords (in
the case of housing laws) and small employers (in the case of employment
laws. His amendment will probably fail and the bill will probably be
reported out, both by voice votes. Canady says he has a commitment for
floor time so we can expect a bill on the floor fairly soon. At that
point, Nadler may offer his amendment again if the Rules Committee lets
him. The prospects in the Senate are unclear. Hatch has not yet introduced
a bill. He hold an "informational" hearing this Wednesday.
        It seems unlikely that the religious coalition and the bill's
opponents will reach some compromise, at least in the near future. We
could try to get them in the same room and get very involved in attempting
to broker something, but I don't think either side has an incentive to
agree to anything. That dynamic may change when the bill reaches the
Senate. In the meantime, I think we need to meet to discuss the
Administration's response to the bill and the Nadler amendment.
