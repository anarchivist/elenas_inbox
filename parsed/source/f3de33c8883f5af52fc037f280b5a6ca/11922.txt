NATIONAL ORIGIN DISCRIMINATION/LANGUAGE RIGHTS: There are two areas
that are relevant to national origin discrimination the based on language that· are discussed below.

       A. National Origin Employment Discrimination based on Language - The EEOC is
       focusing its attention on national origin discrimination in the form of "language" issues
       such as speak-English- only rules and discriminatory practices based on accent These
       practices affect a wide range of people suffering from discriminatory treatment by virtue
       of the way they speak

               1. Goal: The goal is to eliminate employment discrimination based on
               language issues such as speak-English-only rules and discriminatory employment
               practices based on accent

               2. Objectives: Promote and enforce Civil Rights Act

               3. Tasks: Promote language rights; educate employers and employees that this
               practice may constitute discrimination; and develop strategic enforcement of the
               Civil Rights law.

               4. Timing: In two weeks, the EEOC will provide recommendations.


       B.    Meaningful Access to Government Programs and Programs -

               1. Goal: Ensure that Limited English Proficiency CLEP) persons have
               meaningful access to government programs and services.

               2. Objective: To ensure that Agencies are complying with Title VI of the Civil
               Rights Act as it relates to provision of services to LEP persons. We discovered
               that Agencies do not have a consistent policy in this area. However, the
               Department of Justice has filed a brief in a case in which a patient was denied
               emergency medical services because he was a Limited English Proficiency CLEP)
               persons.

               3. Tasks:. (1) The Department of Justice will provide legal guidance as to
               government agencies responsibilities under Title VI; (2) Agency representatives
               will consult with their General Counsels as to their compliance with Title VI; (3)
               develop a strategy to educate the agencies about their responsibilities and to
               ensure their compliance with Title VI.

               4. Timing: In two weeks, the agencies will report on their findings after
               consultation with General Counsels.
                                                                                  Hex·Dump Conversion

WORKER EXPLOIT ATIONITRAFFICKING OF WOMEN:

A. Worker Exploitation - On April 23, 1998, a Federal Worker Exploitation interagency task
force co-chaired by the Departments of Justice and Labor was established to combat cases of
worker exploitation in the United States. The Worker Exploitation inter-agency task force is
coordinating the investigation, prosecution and prevention of these cases; establishing a central
information bank of information; and establishing a blueprint for addressing the unique needs of
victims of worker exploitation where they will be more willing to come forward and report these
terrible crimes. The task force has found that while there are a number oflaws used to prosecute
these cases, current criminal and labor statutes restrict efforts to prosecute these cases and
discourages victims of worker exploitation to report these cases. The President's proposed
Crime bill will include some provisions that help to address these restrictions. However, the
more can be done to Administration to highlight this problem and to encourage victims to come
forward by providing adequate protection and assistance for victims. There is press interest in
this issue. Parade is working on a cover story on this subject for publication in about three
months. Also, the anniversary of the task force is upcoming and may be an opportunity to
elevate this issue.

       1. Goals: Eradicate the practice of worker exploitation.

       2. Objectives: Objectives include: (1) coordinating the investigation, prosecution and
       prevention of these cases; (2) establishing a central information bank of information; and
       (3) address the unique needs of victims of worker exploitation where they will be more
       willing to come forward and report these terrible crimes including the provision of
       appropriate services to victims of worker exploitation; (4) build support for President's
       Crime bill proposals.

       3. Tasks: The interagency task force working with other agencies including HHS and
       EEOC and the CRCC will (1) develop a communications strategy to educate and
       highlight that eradication of worker exploitation is a high priority to build support for the
       President's proposals and to support law enforcement efforts to prosecute these cases; (2)
       develop a proposal to ensure the provision of appropriate services to victims of worker
       exploitation; (3) consider and develop other legislative and administrative proposals to
       address this issue; (4) identify additional resources to combat worker exploitation.

       4. Timing:      Ongoing


B. Trafficking of Women and Children - Worker exploitation is often a result of women and
children who are victims of trafficking which includes recruitment, transport, and harboring,
transfer, sale or receipt of persons within the US and international borders through deception or
fraud, coercion or force, or abduction for the purposes of placing in situations of forced labor or
services such as forced prostitution or sexual services, domestic servitude, or debt bondage--or
any other forms of slavery-like practices. On March 11, 1998, President Clinton issued an
                                                                                    Hex-Dump ConversIon
Executive Memorandum on Steps to Combat Violence Against Women and Trafficking in Women
and Girls that directed the Federal government to increase its efforts within the United States and
in partnership with other countries to address this issue. Currently, there is no comprehensive
law in the United States that sanctions the range of activities recognized as trafficking or that
protects its victims. Law enforcement now relies upon a number of criminal, labor and
immigration laws that compose some of the component crimes involved in a trafficking scheme.
In accordance with this directive, the President's Interagency Council on Women chairs an
interagency working group to develop a strategy consisting of: prevention; protections and
assistance for trafficking victims; and prosecution and enforcement against traffickers. There is
legislation pending on this issue introduced by Representative Chris Smith (R-NJ) and Senator
Wellstone is working on legislation.

       1. Goals: Eradicate the trafficking of women and children.

       2. Objectives: Develop a strategy consisting of: prevention; protections and
       assistance for trafficking victims; and prosecution and enforcement against traffickers.

       3. Tasks: The President's Interagency Council on Women working with the CRCC will
       (1) develop a communications strategy to build support for the President's proposals in
       the crime bill that address trafficking of women is a high priority; (2) develop a proposal
       to ensure the provision of appropriate services to victims oftrafficking;(3) consider and
       develop other legislative and administrative proposals to address this issue; (4) identify
       additional resources to eradicate this practice.

       4. Timing:      Ongoing
