Anyone who has a secure id card and the appropriate software can access
NOTES from off the complex. We don't usually give secure id cards to
everyone, but we do give them to those in need as approved by you or
Paul. Anyone who will be getting a laptop or who has a laptop should have
a secure id card which can be requested with an OA65 plus a dial in user
agreement.
