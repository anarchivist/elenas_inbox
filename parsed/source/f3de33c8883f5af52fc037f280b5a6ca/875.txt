TEXT:
I think we're in good shape for tomorrow.  I still haven't seen a final
copy of the report, so I can only trust that our changes have been made.
Two things I just learned:

1) I raised with Carol your desire to take out "to the states" in the
reasonable efforts segment in which the Department commits to "working
towards amending the Title IV-E provision to similarly illustrate to the
states circumstances in which renunification may not be appropriate."
Carol explained as the Title IV-E money is transmitted in grants directly
to the states, any amendment to the grant program would directly affect
the states and, in essence, be targeted to them.  I think that makes sense
and agreed to leave it in.

2) I suspect, fyi, that "well-being" was slipped in with safety and
health, and with "safety and permanence" for the federal goal for the
child welfare system (it crept into the HHS talking points, which I know
were lifted from the final report). I didn't have the strength to argue,
knowing that Carol "well-being" part of the HHS mantra.  I can live with
it.

Keep your fingers crossed for the event. And by the way, I meant it when
I said that our staff RARELY meets the way we did yesterday (in the Yellow
Oval Room, that is), but you can never tell ...
