                           PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
                         RADIO ADDRESS ON PROSTATE CANCER
                                    JUNE 20,1998

        Good morning. Tomorrow is Fathers Day, the day we pay tribute to the lasting role
fathers play in the lives of their children.

       I want to talk to you today what we are doing to protect our fathers, our grandfathers, and
all men from one of the greatest health threats they face: prostate cancer. This year, nearly
200,000 people will be diagnosed with prostate cancer -- and 40,000 will die from it. In fact,
every year, as many men die from prostate cancer as women die from breast cancer.

        For far too long, too little was known about prostate cancer. Too little was said about it,
out of embarrassment and fear. And because of this, too little was done about it, as precious
research dollars were spent on other problems.

        For five years now, we have worked hard to increase public awareness about prostate
cancer -- and to find a cure. Since I first took office, we have increased funding for prostate
cancer research at the National Institutes of Health by 100%. This year alone, we are funding
more than 450 critically important research projects on prostate cancer, ranging from prevention
to detection to treatment. Last year, scientists at the Human Genome Project and Johns
Hopkins University located the first gene known to predispose men to prostate cancer. And
prostate cancer is the first disease being studied by the Cancer Genome Anatomy Project, a very
exciting new program we recently launched at the NCI. We are closing in on this silent killer.

        As far as we have come, we know that many questions about prostate cancer remain
unanswered. We do not fully understand the role of environmental and dietary factors in
prostate cancer. We do not fully understand why the disease progresses at such varying rates in
different men. We do not yet know why prostate cancer disproportionately affects African
American men. And we do not yet know how to eliminate the risks of treatment for prostate
cancer that discourage too many men from seeing their doctors.

        The only way we will ever answer these questions -- and the only way we will ever beat
prostate cancer -- is by continuing to invest in research. Today, on Fathers Day, I am pleased to
announce that the Department of Defense is awarding $60 Million in grants to some of the most
promising research projects in the country. These grants will fund innovative new studies to
determine the causes of prostate cancer, new methods of prevention and detection, and most of
all, ground breaking new treatments that will save lives.

        These grants are an important step in our fight against prostate cancer. But we must
press on. This year, as part of historic legislation to protect our children from tobacco, I
proposed to make the largest commitment in history to fund cutting edge cancer research. My



    proposal would also allow people on Medicare to participate in cancer clinical trials. This will
    be especially important for prostate cancer, which overwhelmingly affects men over 65. The
    more older men are able to participate in these trials, the more we willieam about this disease,
    and the faster we will be able to find a cure.

           But three days ago, the Republican minority voted against my proposal to increase cancer
    research when it voted against protecting our children from tobacco. [TOBACCO INSERT TK]

           Thanks for listening.
