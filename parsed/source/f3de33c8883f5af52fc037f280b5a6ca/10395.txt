TEXT:
1. The Transportation press event to highlight December as Drunk and
Drugged Driving.month is now scheduled for Friday, December 18 at 9:30am,
instead of Thursday.   In addition to the Secretary, the head of the
National Highway Safety Board, the President of MADD and other safety
advocates will attend.   I've heard that later that day, the President of
MADD is coming to the WH for a photo op with the First Lady to "tie a
ribbon" against drunk driving.

2.  Regarding the Cabinet Affairs entry on CDC/impaired driving -- it
looks like CDC released a fact sheet on Friday on impaired driving which
uses 1997 data announced earlier this summer by the Department of
Transportation.   (We did a Presidential statement on some of these numbers
in August.)  I've called HHS to figure out whether their CDC document
contains additional analysis to the DOT data which may be of interest.
It appears that the fact sheet was released to press.
