TEXT:
Caroline Frederickson called me last night to say that Harkin now plans on
being here for the event and is pressing for a speaking role.  I don't
think we have told his office officially that we cannot support his
bill.   We should all sit down and discuss this.  I think Karen is going
to talk to Larry Stein about this.
