       TEXT:
        Many of the initiatives the President has recently announced raise Puerto
       Rico issues and some raise issues concerning the smaller territorial
       areas. Many of the benefits would not apply to Puerto Rico because they
       are tax credits, but the initiatives raise other issues as well relating
       to the underlying programs not applying to the areas or only applying to a
       limited extent.



      We will not need to address the areas' treatment in the case of most of
      the issues (e.g., tax credits) but we should seriously consider
      territorial provisions in others. The noteworthy issues of which I am
      aware are listed in the attached. While most will not need to be
      addressed, they are included because they will affect other issues such as
      Puerto Rico's status debate. Those most likely to require attention are in
      boild type.  ==================== ATTACHMENT 1 ====================
