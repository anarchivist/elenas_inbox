TEXT:
EK, et.al.:

Spoke to DOJ about the COPS announcements. They're fine w/either day and
holding.  Ricki is unhappy about collapsing the Early Warning Guide w/COPS
and hopes we'll reconsider, but she understands ...

Spoke to HHS about the Survey, and they're checking w/McCaffrey to see if
they can move it up to this week or postpone until Monday morning.
However, HHS public affairs still believes that the survey should go out
on Friday.  I've suggested that Melissa Skofield call EK directly on this.

Also, I spoke w/Cabinet Affairs to make sure we're all saying the same
things on these scheduling matters, and they've touched based the COS at
each agency.

Jose'
