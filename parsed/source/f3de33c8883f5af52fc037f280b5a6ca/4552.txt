              I've been told by DOJ and INS that they will be using our statement. Could
              this be a first?!?!  I will be emailing it to Larry Haas who wants to
              discuss it at the communications meeting tomorrow morning.  I will also
              send around this version to the other WH offices that contributed. Thanks.

     STATEMENT ON THE FINAL REPORT OF THE COMMISSION ON IMMIGRATION
     REFORM

     The Commission on hnmigration Reform, chaired by the Honorable Shirley Hufstedler, and the
     late Barbara Jordan, issued its final report today. This report, which reiterates many of the
     excellent recommendations contained in the Commission's interim reports, further contributes to
     our country's understanding of the role of immigration in the United States. I commend the
     Commission's work and its contribution to the national dialogue on immigration policy.

     [America has always been a nation of immigrants. From the start, a steady stream of people
     have left their own lands to make this land their home.] I am proud of the significant progress
     my Administration has made toward improving America's immigration system. My
     Administration has curtailed illegal immigration through tougher border control, strengthened
     worksite enforcement, and the removal of record numbers of criminal and other illegal aliens.
     We have also worked to improve and tighten the naturalization process, and have made needed
     reforms to our asylum system for refugees fleeing persecution.

     One of the Commission's recommendations is to restructure the immigration system by
     reallocating the main functions of the Immigration and Naturalization Service to other agencies.
     This proposal raises difficult and complex issues, which need further consideration. I have
     asked the Domestic Policy Council to coordinate with the affected federal agencies to evaluate
     carefully the Commission's proposal and other reform options designed to improve the executive
     branch's administration of the nation's immigration laws.

     With this report, the Commission completes its work. I want to thank all of its members and
     staff for their service and contribution on these important issues.
