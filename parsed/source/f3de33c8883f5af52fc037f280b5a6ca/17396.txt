TEXT:
There will be a briefing by the DPC Working Group on American Indians and
Alaska Natives on Monday, October 20 at 4 p.m. in Room 472 on two
executive orders they have been drafting.

The two executive orders are:


1.      Executive Order on Comprehensive Indian Education. This proposed
executive order provides that each agency will appoint a senior official
to serve as a liaison for Indian education activities.  The executive
order also contemplates that a Board, under the auspices of the National
Advisory Council on Indian Education (NACIE), will be appointed to monitor
and report on the progress made by the agencies in fulfilling the purposes
of the executive order.  Each agency will be tasked with drafting as-year
strategic plan to promote educational change, systemic reform, and student
achievement.  In drafting the strategic plans, agencies will promote the
President's national education goals.

2.      Executive Order on Indian Youth.  This proposed executive order seeks
to improve the quality of life for Indian youth by coordinating and
expanding services related to health, community empowerment, crime, and
education. This executive order also contemplates that each agency will
appoint a senior official to be a liaison from the agency to promote the
goals of the executive order. The order also establishes in HHS a
Presidential advisory committee entitled the Federal/Tribal Partnership
Council to be comprised of tribal representatives and members of various
Native American groups.

Attendees of the meeting will be:

Michael H. Trujillo, Indian Health Services
Leo Nolan, IHS Staff
William Craig Vanderwagon, IHS Staff
Phyllis Eddy, IHS Stafff
Michael Anderson, Indian Affairs
Dennis Fox, Office of Indian Education Programs, BIA
David Beaulieu, Education
Ed Simermeyer, Interior

If you have any questions, let me know.   Mary
