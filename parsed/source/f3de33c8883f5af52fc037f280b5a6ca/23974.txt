PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
REMARKS ON CHILDREN, VIOLENCE AND MARKETING
THE ROSE GARDEN
June 1, 1999

Acknowledgments: the First Lady; AG Reno; FTC Chairman Robert Pitofsky;
Arthur Sawe [sah-WAY] and his mother Caroline; Mayor DeeDee Corradini, US
Conference of Mayors

         In recent weeks, and in the wake of tragedy, we have witnessed
something truly remarkable: Americans from all regions and all walks of
life are coming together to prevent youth violence.   As you may recall,
the First Lady and I traveled to Colorado recently and spoke with the
students of Columbine High School.   In one sudden, violent moment, just
six weeks ago, they lost much of the innocence of youth; but I am pleased
to say that they have lost little of its .idealism.  They have held fast to
their faith in a better future O} a future where hatred no longer hardens
the heart; a future where values, and not violence, make up our common
culture.

         The national grassroots campaign that Hillary described is rooted
firmly in that same faith: that we can and will prevent youth violence by
working together, across all the lines that may divide us; and by assuming
responsibility rather than assigning blame. That responsibility begins at
home.  Parents must guide children as they grow, and stay involved even as
children become more independent. That responsibility must be reinforced
at school; in houses of worship; and in the community as a whole. The
more invested we are in the lives of our children, the less isolated they
can become.


          Those of us in public service must also do our part, and fulfill
our responsibility to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and
children.   To that end, there is a broad and growing national consensus
that says we must do more.   I am grateful that a number of gun
manufacturers came here to the White House last month and voiced their
support for our common-sense approach.   And I am encouraged that the
Senate D) by the narrowest of margins D) agreed to close the deadly gun-show
loophole; require that safety locks be sold with every handgun; and raise
the age of handgun possession from 1B to 21.   To the House of
Representatives I say:   Pass these common-sense measures into law, and do
so swiftly when you return to Washington.   Put our childrenD,s safety on
top of your agenda 0) not on hold.

'Members of the entertainment industry must also do their part.  They D) and
 the rest of us D) must not kid ourselves:  our children are being weaned on
 a dependable daily dose of violence. Violent movies and television
 programs; violent CDs and video games; violent ads for violent products.
 Studies show that the typical 1B-year-old has seen 200,000 dramatized acts
 of violence and 40,000 dramatized murders.  Kids become numb to it.  They
 have to. And as their tolerance for violence grows, so, in many cases,
 does their taste for it. As Arthur Sawe [sah-WAY] just told us,
 advertisements egg children on and draw them in:  a recent ad for a Sony
 video game invites players to D&get in touch with your gun-toting.
 cold-blooded murdering side.DB So we should not be surprised that half the
 video games the typical seventh-grader plays are violent ones.

Anyone who doubts the impact of this cultural assault can look at hundreds
of studies, three decadesD, worth, showing the direct link between violent
entertainment and violent behavior. What these studies tell us is that
for adults, the boundary between fantasy and reality is a bright line; but
for vulnerable children, it can be blurred.  Kids who are steeped in the
culture of violence become desensitized to it and more capable of
committing it themselves.

That is why I have strongly urged people in the industry to consider the
consequences of what they create. Our administration has also worked to
give parents the tools to protect their kids 0) and block violent
programming from entering their living rooms.  We have developed a
voluntary rating system for television, and a V-Chip that enables parents
to enforce it. WeD,ve also made progress on parental screening for the
Internet and ratings for Internet game sites.

But these filters are designed to keep out violent programs and games, not
the ads for violent programs or games. We know that all too often,
children make up the audience for violent advertisements D) whether TV
commercials, print ads, or movie trailers.  A recent study in the Journal
of the American Medical Association looked at violent ads shown during a
nonviolent, family-friendly broadcast D) the baseball playoffs.  During
each and every game of the World Series, an average of ten violent
commercials appeared. Ten per game.   Most of the ads were for violent TV
programs or violent movies.  Kids may not get to see the show, but in the
commercial, theyD,re seeing the commercial.

Now, no parent wants to tell a child to stop watching baseball because the
commercials are too violent.  But all parents know the effect that ads for
sugar cereals D) or the newest D&Star WarsDB toy 0) have on our kids.  So we
had best be concerned about the effect that violent ads have on our kids.
These advertisements are troubling. TheyD,re pure, packaged violence, and
totally stripped of context or consequence.


If violent products are made, they should not be marketed to children.   I
 "




think all Americans can agree on that. Today, I am asking the Department
of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission to study the·extent to which
the video game, television, music and movie industries market violence to
children 0) and whether those industries are abiding by their own voluntary
systems of regulation.   I want to acknowledge Senators Brownback,
Lieberman, Hatch, and Kohl for the work theyO,ve done to raise this issue.
And I also want to issue this challenge to owners of movie theaters and
video stores, to distributors, and to anyone at the point of sale:
enforce strictly the ratings systems on the entertainment you sell.  Check
IDs.  Draw the line.   If gratuitous viole
