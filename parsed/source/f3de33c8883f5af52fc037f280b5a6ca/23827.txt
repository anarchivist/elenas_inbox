TEXT:
There have been numerous studies and surveys showing parentsD, desires for
a content-based ratings system.  Such a system would give parents the
opportunity to know whether or not to view a movie or television program
according to their own values and their own assessment of their kids
needs.  In fact, a 1996 National PTA survey showed that 80% of parents
prefer a ratings system that identifies program content rather than the
age group it is intended for. Eighty percent of the parents surveyed also
want separate ratings for sex, violence, and language content, not a
single summary rating for a show or movie.
