TEXT:
should we support, strongly support or commend the effort by the
Governors?


Q. What is the Administration's response to the trust fund for tobacco
farmers announced yesterday in North Carolina?

A.  While complete information is not yet available, the Administration
strongly supports the effort by Governors Hunt, Patton and others to
provide much needed resources to tobacco farmers.  The Administration
remains commited to protecting tobacco farmers and their communities, a
commitment the President re-affirmed in his State of the Union address
this week. We look forward to working with all parties as this process
continues, including Members of Congress, to ensure the financial
well-being of tobacco farmers, their families, and their communities.
Farmers who never marketed cigarettes to children and worked hard to sell
a legal crop should be protected.
