Health Care Budget Reconciliation Developments. The House and Senate Committees of
jurisdiction (Ways and Means, Commerce, and Senate Finance) sent preliminary counteroffers
to one another at the end of the week. While no issues have been finally resolved, Thursday's
overwhelming support (over 400 votes) for the Sense of the House Resolution to reject the 65-67
eligibility age increase has apparently removed this provision from any serious consideration.
The income-related premium and the home care copayment still remain potentially viable,
although the latter is losing steam.

We are advising Democrats and Republicans that you support income-relating the Medicare
premium, but only if your administrative concerns (Treasury, not HHS administration) and policy
design concems (e.g., reducing maximum premium payment from 100 percent to 75 percent of
Part B program costs to reduce the incidence of well-to-do elderly leaving the program) are
adequately addressed. Although Senator Domenici and many other policy-oriented Members
have explicitly or implicitly acknowledged the advantages of your approach, many Republicans
are not as yet interested in considering any premium administered through the Tax Code.

There are numerous other important and controversial Medicare issues still in play. They include:
(1) Medical Savings Accounts, (2) the House-passed medical malpractice provisions (which we
believe will be struck either in conference or through the Byrd rule) and (3) the provisions that
allow physicians to "balance bill" (charge over Medicare approved rates) in certain
circumstances. This latter issue is being hotly criticized by some House Democratic Members.
While we believe we have a chance to "Byrd" rule some of these ''balance billing" provisions,
it is quite likely we will not prevail on every one of these issues.

In Medicaid, as we suspected, the last-second controversy and time commitment will be on the
allocation of the disproportionate share hospital (DSH) payments. On Thursday, Senator
Doinenici and Congressman Spratt asked the Administration to help co-chair a DSH study group
to help determine alternative formulas. They are particularly concerned about excessive cuts
coming from high DSH states. Our first meeting with them will be either Monday or Tuesday;
in the end, because the low-DSH states do not want to be shifted-back any of the burden, there
may be a great deal of pressure to simply find some additional money to reduce the overall DSH
cut.

On the children's health front, it looks as though attention will focus on three major questions:
(1) How many dollars will be invested -- $16 billion without a tobacco tax or $24 billion with
one; (2) What will be the benefits package -- the House is apparently still insisting on a provision
that dedicates at least some of the funding to go to direct services and NOT explicit coverage
expansions, as well as insisting on a much less significant package of benefits than the Senate
passed; and (3) How do we set up state accountability provisions (to ensure dollars do not
replicate current state spending) without imposing excessive and undue bureaucratic
requirements on the states.
                                                                             Hex-Dump Conversion
Genetic Screening. We have worked this week on preparing for Monday's genetic screening
event. During the event, you will be releasing a new HHS report that documents both the
potentials and perils ofthe use of genetic screening. The report will cite survey data that
concludes that more than one-fifth of people in families where someone has a genetic disorder
report that they have been discriminated against by an insurance plan. It also includes specific
legislative recommendations designed to prevent health insurers from using genetic screening
infonnation to discriminate against people who may be predisposed to a particular illness.
You are scheduled to conclude the event by challenging the Congress to pass bipartisan
legislation that prohibits such discrimination -- legislation that is totally consistent with the
recommendations by the report you are releasing.
