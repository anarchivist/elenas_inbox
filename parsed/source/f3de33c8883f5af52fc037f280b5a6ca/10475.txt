Subject: draft homeless release




Here is a release we would like to put out on Wednesday when the
President announces homeless grants. Also included is an attachments
listing the grants to each state. We will also have two more
attachments:  1) list of all grants 1,420 grants, organized by state
2) vignettes telling success stories of five people (who do not want
their full names used)  who were homeless.   I will get you these when
they are done. The grant list will be useful for regional press.     We
plan on contacting media around the country from here and from our
regional offices after the President's announcements.  We should talk
to discuss what we are doing.

I know Ginny Terzano, our Assistant Secretary, is dealing with the
White House on logistics of the event.

Please get back to me Monday and let me know:   1) Do you have any
problems with the release and want any changes?    2) If the quote I
drafted for the President OK, or do you want to change it?
3) Do you want to distribute our release along with your material at
the White House, or .do you just want us to use our stuff for faxing
and for our website?

Fred Karnas, our homeless expert, has made edits to the fact sheet the
White House has drafted, and shown this to me.  All the numbers and
descriptions in the fact sheet and my release are consistent.

         PRESIDENT CLINTON ANNOUNCES $850 MILLION IN ASSISTANCE
             TO HELP MORE THAN 330,000 HOMELESS AMERICANS

       WASHINGTON - President Clinton today announced $850 million in grants to help
more than 330,000 homeless Americans get housing, job training, child care, mental health
services and substance abuse treatment so they can move from homelessness to self-sufficiency.

          A total of$700 million of the Department of Housing and Urban Development assistance
  is targeted to 1,420 long-term programs around the country to help individuals and families
. permanently end their homeless status. These programs will provide transitional and permanent
  housing assistance and will help people overcome problems that can lead to homelessness, such
  as a lack of basic education and job skills, mental illness and drug addiction.

        The remaining $150 million in grants are for emergency shelter programs that provide
food and shelter on a short-term basis to homeless people so they aren't forced to live on the
streets and go hungry.

        (UNAPPROVED) "These grants will save andtransform the lives of some of the most
vulnerable people in oui' country," President Clinton said. "In this holiday season, they give
homeless Americans the most valuable gift of all- a brighter future filled with hope and
prosperity, instead of despair and poverty. Our assistance will enable homeless people across
this nation to achieve the American Dream of decent housing, a job with a living wage, and a
chance to help their children build successful lives."

         "The President's policies recognize that if we give homeless people the help they need,
they can overcome their problems and work their way out of poverty," Cuomo said. "I have met
men and women across this nation who would be dead today or would be living on the streets if
not for our programs."

        The $850 million in assistance announced today will go to over 300 communities, all 50
state governments, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and American territories. In addition,
over 1,000 non-profit organizations such as the Salvation Army, Volunteers of America and
Catholic Charities will receive funding for homeless assistance programs.

        "Every homeless person is a victim of enormous personal tragedy and incredible
and isn't cheap, but it's one ofthe most important investments we can make. It's an investment
that says America is the land of opportunity not just for some of us, but for all us."

       HUD will award $975 million in the homeless grants a year from now, as a result of
increased funding for homeless programs in HUD's fiscal 1999 budget. President Clinton had
sought an even larger increase to $1.15 billion for the program in the 1999 budget he proposed.

       HUD has invested nearly $5 billion in programs to help homeless Americans since
President Clinton took office in 1993. That's more than three times as much as the $1.5 billion
HUD spent on homeless assistance programs from the time they were created in 1987 until 1993 .

      . The $700 million in competitive grants for long-term programs announced today are part
of HUD's Continuum of Care approach to addressing homelessness across the nation. The grants
are awarded to states, local governments and non-profit groups based on a number of factors that
measure the effectiveness of plans to help homeless people become self-sufficient.

        The $150 million emergency shelter grants are awarded through a formula based on a
community's housing and poverty needs. States and cities select projects to receive the funding
at the local level.               .

         The Continuum of Care, which is the centerpiece of the federal policy on homelessness
announced by President Clinton in 1993, stresses permanent solutions to homelessness through
comprehensive and collaborative community planning. Communities submit plans to HUD that
reflect efforts to address the complexities of homeless ness through a range of housing and
services.

       This year, the Continuum of Care was one of is finalists, out of 1,400 competitors, for
the prestigious Innovations in American Government Award that is awarded by the Ford
Foundation and the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University.

        Cuomo said the Continuum of Care approach has been successful because it brings
together non-profit groups, the private sector and local and state governments in a partnership to
design local programs to help homeless people become self-sufficient.

       A Columbia University study concluded that RUD's homeless policies spelled out in the
Continuum of Care "have had a positive impact on communities across the nation" and were an
improvement from past efforts that focused on short-term emergency shdter.

       Key elements of the Continuum of Care are:

·   Outreach and assessment efforts to identify individual and family needs and make
    connections to facilities and services.

·   Provision of emergency shelter and appropriate social services as safe alternatives to the
    streets.

·   Transitional housing and necessary social services to help people move to permanent housing
    and,independent living.
