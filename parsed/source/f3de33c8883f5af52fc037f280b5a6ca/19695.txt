TEXT:
"Choice among private schools should be paid for with private funds,.with
public funds used to fund choice among public school".  If incorporated
into what I just sent you, it would read ....

"The President opposes the use of public funding for private school
vouchers because this would drain critical funds from the public school
system attended by 90% of our this nation's children with little or no
accountability for how those funds are used. The President is not opposed
to privately funded scholarships for private school tuition    .As made
clear in a Statement of Administration Policy this week, "Choice among
private schools should be paid for with private funds, with public funds
used to fund choice among public schools "
