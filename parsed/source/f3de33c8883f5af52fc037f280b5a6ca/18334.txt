math standards, pitting the math educators who favor a major emphasis on problem solving skills
and who downplay the importance of basic computational skills (in both their documents and
their rhetoric) against conservative critics who favor a more basic skills approach. Last month
the California State Board of Education adopted the more conservative approach, over the
objections of State Superintendent Delaine Eastin. Last month, the head of the Education
Directorate at the National Science Foundation sent an letter to the Chair of the California State
Board of Education strongly criticizing the state board's decision, and strongly implying that this
decision would jeopardize continued NSF funding for six Urban Systemic Improvement sites in
California. The letter has caused much consternation among conservatives as an example of
inappropriate federal intrusion in state curriculum matters (which it was), and we had clear
signals from Checker Finn, Diane Ravitch and others that the NSF letter would provide the
pretext for Bill Bennet (who has received a fair amount of criticism from conservatives for his
support of your national testing initiative) to withdraw his support. This week DPC and OSTP
worked with NSF to produce a letter from NSF Director Lane to the California State Board
clarifYing that it is the job of states to set standards and that NSF would not pull the award based
on California's math standards, and emphasizing the importance of basic skills. Based on recent
conversations with Finn and others, we believe this step has been sufficient to prevent Bennett's
reversal.

Education Week Report on Urban Education: This week Education Week issued its annual
report on education reform in the 50 states, focusing on the progress in urban school districts.
The study noted that approximately 40% of students in urban districts reached the basic level on
the most recent NAEP 4th grade reading and 8th grade math and science exams in 1994 and
1996, compared to over 60% in each of these subjects in non-urban areas. The study also found
discrepancies in resources, with urban districts spending about $500 less per child annually than
non-urban districts. The Education Week issue also discussed, in detail, a dozen promising          W§:

Single Sex Schools in New York City: DPC has been meeting with the White House Counsel's
office, the Education and Justice Departments, to address the OCR response to a complaint
against the existence of the all girl's Women's Leadership Academy in New York City. Both

you and Secretary Riley are in complete agreement that, as a matter of policy, school districts
should be (encouraged??? free???) to establish single sex schools as part of the mix of education
options. The Office of Civil Rights has placed its investigation of the compliant on hold, and
will take no steps in the foreseeable future to press New York City to change the status of the
school. However, civil rights offices in both Education and Justice believe that such schools
ultimately may be difficult to justify under Title IX or Article (relevant Constitutional reference),
    in part because they have discriminatory admissions policies, and partly because separate schools
    will inevitably become unequal and to the ultimate disadvantage of females. They believe that
    the strongest legal case for permitting single sex schools is an argument that they are an
    appropriate remedy for past discrimination, such as low academic performance offemales in
    co-educational settings. Neither of the cognizant Civil Rights offices want to take formal
    action on this issue, because they believe they will be forced to oppose single-sex schools.

    Late in December, Secretary Riley and Rudy Crew agreed to appoint small teams of educators
    from the Education Department and the NYC Schools to work collaboratively to develop the
    strongest case for the Women's Leadership Academy. The teams will begin to plan their work
    next week. This process may take some time, and during this period the Education
    Department's Office of Civil Rights will not take any further actions on this case.

    Life-long learning card: You had asked us to respond to Bob Reich's proposal to you
    concerning Life-long learning cards, which would allow all federal education benefits (Pell,
    IRA's education tax credits and deductions as well as job-training funds) to be consolidated on
    one card, like a bank card, against which education expenses could be credited. DPC and NEC
    staff have begun to look into this issue. While we think this is an idea with some promise, we
    do not yet have specific recommendations. The Education Department has already initiated a
    feasibility study on the use of cards for student aid delivery, with the aim of initiating a pilot
    project with postsecondary schools to have their students receive federal aid disbursements
    through such cards, by October 2000, though this may be an optimistic estimate of when such a
    pilot program could begin. Further, while this may be an effective approach to delivery grants
    and loans, we believe it will be much more difficult to incorporate tax credits and deductions as
    well. DPC and NEC will continue to explore this issue.

    [Elena--I'm sharing this one with Bob Shireman and Anne Lewis, so NEC and DPC wind up
    saying the same thing]
