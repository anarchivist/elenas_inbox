TEXT:
You and Mike were copied on a memo from Michelle Crisci about an event
Campbell's Soup wants to do in DC in October.   I don't see this as a
POTUS or VP event. Since they want to do it at a DC school they are
assisting, maybe the FLOTUS would be interested. Does somebody need to
respond to Crisci?

-- Bill
