TEXT:
Can you find out from DOT what the ISTEA hook is for welfare reform? It's
probably in the priorities deal they sent us. We should include it in the
weekly if we can.

there were a few things that came up on the trip:

1.   The relationship of ISTEA and welfare via a Moynihan question.

2.  The issue of whether or not welfare students should be forced to work
instead of go to school and the related question of should welfare
students get to work on campus.  (Shalala said that she was going to raise
with the Chancellor? of CUNY.
