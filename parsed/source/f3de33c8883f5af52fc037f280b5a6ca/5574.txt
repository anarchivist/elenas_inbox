Eli:

Thanks for the heads up, though I'm afraid we well aware of DOJ's wanting
to max out on about 70,000 cops. We're not off track for lOO,OOO yet, but
it does become increasingly difficult with Congress starting to earmark
unobligated funds, DOJ not wanting to cross their appropriators, OMB more
concerned with "lOO,OOO cops on paper" than "lOO,OOO cops in practice",
and minimum attention from the White House. My guess is that the White
House -- DPC, Intergovernmental, Leg. Affairs, OMB -- will have to ,step-in
before the next budget cycle and do a bit of our own problem solving.

It does trouble me, however, that the Acting Associate AG seems so willing
to concede the President's 100,000 goal ... though I wouldn't say it
surprises me ...

Jose'
