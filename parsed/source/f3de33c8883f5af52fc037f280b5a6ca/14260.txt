         Procedures
         First para ok -- change attest to believe in first line
         Second para -- Legal immigrants who believe that they may be
         eligible based on Social Security coverage should be asked the
         following questions:
                 1.        How many years have you lived in this county? Your
         spouse? Your parents before you reached the age of 18?
                 (If the answers to question 1 total less than 10 years,
         the State agency does not need to ask questions 2 or
         3) ·
                 2.        In how may of the years reported in answer to question
         1, did you, your spouse, or your parent work?
                  (If the answer to question 2 is less than 10 years, the
         State agency does not need to ask question 3.)
                 3.       Approximately how much did you or your spouse or parent
         earn in each of these years?
                  (To determine whether the estimate of earnings provided
         appears to be sufficient to establish "quarters of
         coverage" in a particular year, the State agency should
         use the attached chart.)
         If the applicant's answers indicate that s/he or his/her spouse
         or parent has had sufficient earnings in ten or more years, the
         State agency shall verify, from INS documents,    the date of entry
         into the country of the applicant, spouse and/or parent.    If the
         dates are consistent with the reported work history, no further
         documentation is required at this time; the State agency shall
         include the immigrant in the household pending verification from
         SSA. The State agency shall inform these recipients that a claim
         will be established for any benefits to which they were not
         entitled. The State agency shall keep a record of each
         individual certified pending verification from SSA.
         If the dates of entry are inconsistent with the reported work
         history, the State agency shall determine the applicant
         ineligible. The State agency shall then inform the applicant of
         his or her fair hearing rights.
         At application, the applicant shall also provide, for purposes of
         future verification, the full name, Social Security Number, date
         of birth, and sex of each individual for each individual for whom


        quarters are claimed.    In addition, the applicant shall provide a

        release form signed by each individual for whom quarters are
        claimed (copy enclosed) giving SSA permission to release
        information on that individual to the state agency and the
        applicant.  This form shall be retained in the case file to
        document consent.
        o
        SSA is drafting an addendum to the current Computer Matching and
        Privacy Protection Act agreement between SSA and each state
        agency.  In accordance with that revised agreement, and within
        three months after the month in which the SSA verification system
        is operational, the state agency will send the identifying
        information provided by the applicant to SSA for overnight
        processing.  In its response, SSA will provide information about
        qualifying quarters of work.  If the immigrant believes the
        information from SSA is inaccurate or incomplete, the State
        agency shall refer the applicant to SSA for review. An immigrant
        who provides verification that SSA is reviewing the number of
        quarters can receive benefits for up to 6 months pending
        clarification of his or her status.
