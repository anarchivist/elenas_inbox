As you saw in the e-mail, Janet Murguia suggested I contact you to see if

you would be willing to assist me as we prepare the VP for a meeting

tomorrow morning with the national Hispanic Leadership Agenda.              The topics

that I believe you are the expert on that they are going to discuss with

the VP are naturalization, temporary status for Central Americans and

benefit restoration . . . . . . . . . . . . . . do you think you could help me by putting

together some brief talking points for him and a short backgrounder on

each---



If I need to seek assistance elsewhere, will you let me know?



Thanks so much
