 SUBJECT:               Study on Marketing Practices of Entertainment Industries

New technologies have enabled us to learn, work, and grow in ways that were unimaginable just
a few years ago, and modem media has brought culture, entertainment, and education to a wider
audience than ever before. With this great power, there also comes an enonnous responsibility to
ensure that parents have the tools they need so that the movies children watch, the music they
listen to, and the video games they play reflect the values that parents want to pass on to their
children.

Too often today children are exposed to images that glamorize violence and desensitize children
to it. Numerous studies have shown that this kind of violent programming can promote violent
tendencies in children. Media violence increases children's aggression towards others and
promotes the development of a sense of callousness towards violence. And such programming
can have a particularly negative effect on children who are already vulnerable.

 Our Administration has worked hard to give parents the information they need to make the right
 choices for their children. This Administration has brought about a breakthrough agreement by
 the television industry to create a content-based voluntary ratings system that informs viewers of
 the appropriateness of the programs they watch. Along with the V-Chip, this rating system will
 enable parents to choose the programs their children watch, and allow them to better control the
 images their children are exposed to.

 Today, the movie, recording, and video game industries also all use content-based ratings to
 improve the choices parents have. If and to the extent, however, that these industries market
 violent or other inappropriate materials, rated for adults, to children, then they undennine the
 effective functioning of the ratings systems. And the industries make it harder for parents to
 control the movies, music and games to which their children are exposed.

  Therefore, today, I am writing you to request that the Federal Trade Commission and the
  Department of Justice conduct a study on the marketing practices of the motion picture,
  recording, and video game industries with regard to material rated for adults to detennine
  whether and to what extent these industries market such material to children. Among other
  matters, the study should examine whether such violent material rated for adults is advertised or
  promoted in media outlets in which minors comprise a substantial percentage of the audience .
. The study also should examine whether these advertisements are intended to and in fact attract
  underage audiences.

     As a result of this study, we willieam more about how violence is marketed to our children. I
     thank both of you for your efforts in this area and your attention to this project.
