                      and creation of Tobacco Use and Cessation Board.

UNDERAGE TOBACCO      Sets reduction targets of underage use based on the
    USE TARGETS         number of years after enactment of the legislation.
                                     Cigarettes Smokeless
                        3 yrs. --    15%             12.5%

                        10yrs--      60%                     45%
                        No targets are set for underage use of other tobacco
                        products, such as cigars, little cigars, roll-your-own, or
                        pipes.

    LOOK-BACK           Industry-wide penalties only (no firm-specific).
    PENALTIES           Requires HHS to annually determine through surveys
                        (beginning in 3rd year after enactment) the underage
                        daily use of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco during the
                        preceding year.
                        Requires Industry to pay tiered monetary penalties
                        (non-tax deductible) for falling short of youth reduction
                        targets.
                        1-5 percentage points short: $80 million per point.
                        6-10 percentage points short: $160 million per point.
                        11 and above percentage points short: $240 million
                        per point.
                        Yearly cap of 3.5 billion with no tax deductibility of

                        Joint, several & strict liability for penalties. Provides
                        legal actions for companies against another for financial
                        liability.
                        If any company misses its share of target by more than
                        20 points, company's liability cap is waived for 2 years or
                        until goal is met, whichever is later, with due process.
                        Liability cap is waived for criminal convictions of violations
I
                        under this act.


    USE OF PENALTV      Transfers 90% of penalty receipts to grants for
    AMOUNTS             states/local governments to further reduce youth
                        smoking. Secretary may retain up to 5% of penalty
                        receipts for administration of the look-back assessment.
                        The final 5% of receipts is for a compliance bonus to
                        reward states and retailers who prevent youths (less than
                        5%) from successfully purchasing tobacco products.
                        Secretary may withhold 5% of any state's grant if state
                        fails to enforce compliance with youth access restrictions.

    STATE ENFORCEMENT   Compliance goals set (see above Use of Penalty
    OF YOUTH ACCESS     Amounts) for state and tribal governments. Funding
    LAWS                from settlement for enforcement efforts.
                        Repeals the 1992 Synar Amendment, which was an
                        earlier effort to set targets for the percentage of youths
                        who successfully purchase tobacco products.
                        Percentage of funding withheld for non-compliance is
                    greater in Synar (ranging from 20- 40%, although
                    difference in absolute dollar values are not known). This
                    amendment is no longer needed because these
                    requirements replace it.

LICENSING OF        Requires state, tribal and federal licensing program to be
RETAILERS           funded from settlement. FDA would draft model state
                    program in consultation with state and local officials.


FDA REGULATION OF   Recognizes FDA has broad authority over tobacco
TOBACCO PRODUCTS    including advertising, youth access, and new products.
AND NICOTINE        FDA authority over tobacco is separate chapter of FD&C
                    Act to assure FDA authority over tobacco will not affect
                    FDA authority over other regulated products.
                    Provides for FDA authority over youth access. FDA
                    approval of new products.
                    Any ban on nicotine, retail sales, or category of tobacco
                    products would require Presidential notification to
                    Congress and include two-year waiting period for
                    Congress to act. If Congress does not act ban goes into
                    effect.
                    No FDA authority over farmers (e.g., would be no control
                    over genetic manipulation of tobacco leaf).
                    FDA rules must take into account the impact of actions
                    on demand for unregulated contraband products.

CORPORATE           Calls for national and state protocols requiring an industry
CULTURE AND         plan to comply with all new laws on the manufacture and
COMPLIANCE,         distribution of tobacco. Protects industry whistle
LOBBYISTS AND       blowers. Requires lobbyists to comply with the act and
WHISTLE BLOWERS     agree not to support or oppose any federal or state
                    legislation without consent of manufacturers. Disbands
                    the Tobacco Institute and the Council for Tobacco
                    Research. Industry plan would include specific
                    assessment mechanism and enforcement standards of
                    industry plan to be included in the protocols.

SMOKING             Restrict smoking in public facilities to enclosed areas.
RESTRICTIONS IN     Specifies that employees may not be required to enter
PUBLIC FACILITIES   smoking areas. Exempts restaurants (other than fast
(ETS)               food), bars, private clubs, hotel guest rooms, casinos,
                    bingo parlors, tobacco outlets, prisons, private residences
                    and any building with any of the above facilities/functions
                    in them.
                    Allows states to opt out.
                    Authorizes incentive grant program for states.

INDUSTRY PAYMENTS   Establishes National Tobacco Settlement Trust Fund.
                    Calls for industry to pay $10 billion up-front.
                    Yearly payments required of industry:
                     1999 -- $14.4 billion
                     2000 -- $15.4 billion
                     2001 -- $17.7 billion
                     2002 -- $21 billion
                     2003 -- $23.6 billion
                     Each year thereafter, $23.6 billion in real dollars (though the
                     bill has a misprint and says the 2004 amount is $21.0 billion.)
                     Payments are volume adjusted -- increased if consumption
                     volume increases and decreased if volume decreases from 2004
                     levels.
                     Payments are tax deductible.
                     Nominal Net Receipts (FY99-03) -- $71.1 billion
                     Implied Per-Pack Equivalents (Real 1999 $):
                     1999 -- 65 cents per pack
                     2000 -- 70 cents per pack
                     2001 -- 80 cents per pack
                     2002 -- $1 per pack
                     2003 -- $1.10 per pack

SPENDING FROM        Most spending decisions are left to the floor of the
TRUST FUND           Senate.
                     Committee mark specifies funding for:
                                                   5-Year Funding
                     FDA:                          $2 billion
                     States:                               $26 billion (OMB
                                                   estimate)
                     Farmers:                      $11 billion
                     International:                $1 billion
                     Total Spending:               $39 billion
                     Receipts Less Spending:$32 billion
                     Although it is not clearly indicated in the bill, we
                     understand that McCain intended to allow manufacturers
                     to deduct 80% of the $6.5 annual liability cap (see liability
                     section below) from their annual payments. This could
                     reduce the net receipts by an additional $26 billion over 5
                     years.
                     The bill also authorizes funding for NIH, CDC, and
                     AHCPR research using language from the Conrad bill,
                     which included $17 billion for these activities.

FUNDING PRIORITIES   In absence of specific funding recommendations, the bill
                     includes a "Sense of the Senate" amendment indicating
                     that the funds raised by this act should be used to
                     support the following priorities:
                     1. Tobacco use prevention and cessation.
                     2. Tobacco related health research.
                     3. Assist tobacco farmers and tobacco dependent
                     communities.
                     4. Reimburse public health care financing programs for
                    tobacco related costs, including Medicare.
                    5. Settle with and reimburse states for tobacco related
                    health care costs and damages, including Medicaid.
                    6. Create a Tobacco Asbestos Trust Fund.
                    7. Provide funding for the Federal Black Lung Program.
                    8. Child Care
                    9. Clinical Trials at NIH.
                    10. Veterans.


CONSENT DECREES     Manufacturers and states enter into consent decrees that
AND NATIONAL        include many of the provisions of the Act, and include a
PROTOCOL            waiver of Constitutional claims.
                    Within 6 months of enactment requires each
                    manufacturer to enter into a legally binding and
                    enforceable contract (The National Tobacco Control
                    Protocol) on both the federal and state level. Federal
                    protocol to be executed with U.S. Attorney General in
                    consultation with the Secretary of HHS. State protocol
                    to be executed with State Attorney General in
                    consultation with state Governor.

NON-PARTICIPATING   Denies non-participating manufacturers liability protection
MANUFACTURERS       and imposes user fees on them equal to the annual
                    assessment paid by participating manufacturers. In
                    addition, non-participating manufacturers must make
                    annual payments into a reserve fund to settle liability
                    claims; the amount is equal to 150% of the payment it
                    would have paid under the bill if the manufacturer had
                    actually been a party to the Settlement.

ATTORNEYS' FEES     All attorney's fees and costs paid by industry outside the
                    payments made under this act.
                    Three member arbitration panel in which plaintiff
                    representative and defendant representatives pick a third
                    member.

CIVIL LIABILITY     Establishes a $6.5 billion cap on annual industry
RESTRICTIONS        payments for individual liability claims against
                    participating manufacturers.         Permits suits by private
                    plaintiffs (incl. class actions and third-party suits), and
                    claims by the federal government, but preempts suits
                    brought by states, local governments and Indian tribes.
                    Permits punitive damages for past conduct (within the
                    cap) and punitive damages for future conduct (outside
                    the cap). Prohibits addiction and dependence claims.
                    Creates a federal cause of action with concurrent
                    jurisdiction in state and federal courts for tobacco-related
                    health injuries. Requires courts to sever trials involving
                    participating and non-participating manufacturers.
                    Creates rebuttable presumptions that: 1) nicotine is
                    addictive; and 2) certain s~ecified diseases are caused
                    by use of tobacco products.
                    The bill does not appear to establish a fund of money
                    from which judgements and settlements are paid
                    (although this may have been intended). Instead, the bill
                    requires the Secretary of the Treasury to keep a record of
                    payments made and judgments and settlements. By
                    rule, the Secretary is to establish a mechanism for
                    ensuring that payments are made to all entitled in the
                    year which the award was made or in a subsequent year.
                      The press release accompanying the bill suggests that
                    the drafters of the bill intended to include the 80%
                    payment; the bill, as drafted, however, does not clearly
                    establish such a fund and makes no reference to the
                    20%/80% model.
