TEXT:
Barbara Chow briefed Frank Raines on Monday's meeting, and reports the
following:

1.  Frank has "grudgingly" conceded to call the the class size initiative,
even though he still thinks it should be a teacher initative. According
to Barbara, this means that he still thinks that districts should be able
to use the $ to hire teachers whether or not it is for the purpose of
reducing class size. This still makes no sense to me, but rather than
continue to argue and simply accepted Franks concession as good news.

2.  Frank feels strongly that the funds ought to be distributed within
states according to the Title 1 formula, as well as among states.  They
want to limit state discretion in order to prevent states from giving the
$ to wealthy districts.  I told Barbara that we shared that objective,
but, lacking district-by-district class size data, didn't know if the
Title 1 formula would in fact drive the funds to the districts that needed
it most for class size reduction.  That's why we came at it the way we
did, though I'm not convinced that we've got the best way to deal with it
yet myself.   We agreed that, given our common objective, we ought to
continue to find the best way to meet it.

3. OMB thinks we need more work to figure out appropriate maintainance of
effort requirements. I agreed, and asked her to have Barry do some more
work on that.

I'm going to keep the DPC/ ED/OVP/OMB working on these issues.
