        HHS Defines Programs Off Limits to Illegal Aliens -- In the next few weeks, HHS will publish a
        list of benefits that illegal immigrants may not receive. The welfare law states that illegal
        immigrants are not eligible for "federal public benefits," and HHS is now providing its
        interpretation of that term. HHS will state that illegal immigrants are not eligible for child care,
        low-income heating assistance, and Community Service block grant benefits, among others.
        However, HHS believes the law does allow illegal immigrants to remain eligible for services at
        community health clinics and for benefits under the Maternal and Child Health block grant and
        the Older Americans Act. Republicans such as Rep. Lamar Smith and Gov. Wilson of
        California will argue that HHS should have defined the term federal public benefit far more
        broadly to include these programs, but we are comfortable with HHS's legal rationale. HHS
        feels strongly that community health clinics, which are often the only providers of prenatal care
        in poor communities, should remain open to all.

        The welfare law also requires that those programs classified as federal public benefits verify the
        immigration status of all applicants, including U.S. citizens. The INS will soon issue a
        regulation to implement this requirement, and we expect to hear complaints about the burden this
        will impose on those programs.
