                   EXECUTIVE ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR JOSH GOTBAUM

FROM:      OMB LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS

DATE:      MAY 12, 1998

SUBJECT:           LEGISLATIVE REPORT

Budget Resolution: House Budget Committee markup of the FYO,99 budget
resolution has slipped to next week, at the earliest.

The House Ways and Means Health Subcommittee marked up Medicare/VA
Subvention legislation. A full committee markup is expected Thursday.
Chairman Thomas expressed his opposition to the Administration's views.

Today, Representative Horn, Chairman of the House Subcommittee on
Government Management, Information and Technology, held a hearing on
"Creating the Office of Management."   The hearing sought views on moving
general management responsibilities out of OMB into a new Office of
Management in the Executive Office of the President with a Director
reporting to the President. OMB would become the Office of Budget with
its Director continuing to report to the President. According to Chairman
Horn's proposal, approximately 125 current OMB staff would move to the new
organization, and another 125 would be recruited from the agencies or
outside government.  Chairman Horn contended that the Federal Government
needs better management, and that the "M" in OMB is not working, because
it is driven out by budget. The CRS and GAO expressed no view regarding
the proposal.
