TEXT:
The Ehrenrich article is on its way.   The guy who does those memos, Drew
Hansen, is really very good. he's helping with our family numbers (also
on the way), helped with a good survey on child care financing (Jen K. has
it, I can get you a copy if you want), and the diseases and minorities
backgrounder. he works like hell, and has pretty good political instincts.

He's just finished his Rhodes and is headed to Yale law school next year,
but would like to stay.  If you know of a spot, I think we should grab him.
