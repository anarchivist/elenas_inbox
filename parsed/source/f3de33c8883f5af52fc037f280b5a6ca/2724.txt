TEXT:
My staff noticed that the Haskins draft picks up the outlay stream from
the agreement, but the numbers read as BA.  If it is BA (which would make
sense in terms of the grant process envisioned), those numbers won't hit
the outlay stream in the Agreement; in particular, the bill would likely
be scored as having outlays in 2002, which is a no no.

I've asked DOL (Uhalde) to call this to Ron's attention tonight.  One fix
would be to back the BA up into the earlier years.  Ron may have other
ideas.  The point is to avoid having CBO score the bill as inconsistent
with the budget agreement.
