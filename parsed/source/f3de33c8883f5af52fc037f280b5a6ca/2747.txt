TEXT:
I'm giving you both revised versions of the sex offender directive. As
you may (or may not) recall, a previous version of the sex offender
directive had gone through an expedited clearance about one month ago. At
the time, Staff Secretary's office raised concerns about two things:

1. The first three background paragraphs of the directive were nearly
identical to a directive from one year ago; and

2. The term "federal and military sex offenders" used throughout the
directive sounded like a legal term of art, which it is not.

Phil Caplan suggested condensing the first three paragraphs of the
directive, and changing the langauge on "federal and military sex
offenders."

I've been working with Justice to do both, and the new version reflects
these changes.  I've also attached the old version of the directive which
shows how the language has been changed.   I've indicated where I
re-inserted part of one sentence that is lined out in the old version.

Please review and let me know if you have changes.  I would like to get
this version cleared through ASAP since it looks like we may be doing this
before next Thursday's hearing on Wetterling. Thanks!

Elena- I'm sticking this on the fax to you.
