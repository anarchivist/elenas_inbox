 TEXT:
 Not really. My only concern was the administrative burden that this would
 put on the INS.  Right now, LPRs can cross back and forth into the country
 with little or no check if they are out of the country for six months or
 less.  This leg. would require a check for all crossings. According to
 INS,  a huge number of LPRs (including a large number of Mexican
 nationals) leave the country for short periods of time each month -- to go
 on vacation, visit relatives, etc. This would put a new (and potentially
 large) paperwork requirement on their readmission each time.
