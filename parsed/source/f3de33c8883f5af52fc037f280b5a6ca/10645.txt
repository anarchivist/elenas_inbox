Gene gave Jon Orszag and Ceci Rouse the outline of the memo he wants to
write. They are going to produce it by tomorrow afternoon and get Gene's
sign off by tomorrow evening. Then NEC and DPC can combine if that is what
you want to do Elena.  Phil is this timing okay? Let me know if you have
any concerns. Thanks
