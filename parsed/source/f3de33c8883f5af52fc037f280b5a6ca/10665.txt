TEXT:
I gather we want to do an accountability event next week.  If so, my
initial recommendation would be to see if we can go to a school in
Maryland--either Baltimore or PG County, in which the state is undertaking
the kind of serious intervention we envision in our failing schools
policy.

What do you think? I will need to make sure there are failing schools
that are now showing signs of success as a result of the state's
intervention, and I don't know if we can find enough progress yet.   I
don't want to start looking if this doesn't seem about right to you.
