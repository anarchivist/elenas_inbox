TEXT:
One thing we might consider - depending where things are on the Hill
negotiations - is having the President address tobacco while in Seattle
friday.  He will be with a Governor (Locke) who will have - that very
morning - just signed his state budget which puts 100 mil into smoking
cessation and who is fully behind a federal menu ( and would even call on
the President to veto the budget supp over this if we thought it was
helpful), and the state Atty Gen who lead the national negotiations and
who will also support a smoking cessation set aside. It is a very
attractive place to make a statement and get validation.
