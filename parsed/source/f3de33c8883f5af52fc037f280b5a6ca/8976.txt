TEXT:
Spoke w/ Rep. Velasquez' staffer on the issue welfare reform/case load
changes in NYC.  They do not have any other data other than what was
reported in the NYT. I let her know that we are interested in the issue
and in process of gathering additional information.  She said she's let me
know if she got any hard data over the recess.
