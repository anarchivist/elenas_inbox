TEXT:
I have been helping to get ready for the First Lady to announce on Tuesday
at the Sacagaweq coin event the AdministrationD,s support for legislation
to create a nonprofit entity called the American Indian Education
Foundation, similar to the National Park Foundation,  in order to help
leverage private resources for the education of Native American children.
This Foundation will accept and administer private gifts of real and
personal property, including cash, stocks, or bonds, to support the goal
of improving the educational opportunities of American Indian and Alaska
Native students from early childhood through high school. This Foundation
would be able to fund projects such as research that advances Indian
education; teacher development programs; model programs to advance the
educational opportunities of Native American students, and the development
of American Indian cultural programs for use in schools.
