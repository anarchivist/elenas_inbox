     STATEMENT BY THE PRESIDENT ON CONFIRMATION OF DR. JANE E. HENNEY
          AS COMMISSIONER OF THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION
                              October 21,1998

     I am extremely pleased that today the Senate, with strong bipartisan support, overwhelmingly
     voted to confirm Dr. Jane E. Henney to be the next Commissioner of the Food and Drug
     Administration. As the first woman and first oncologist to be confirmed as FDA Commissioner.
     I am confident that Dr. Henney will live up to the trust the Senate has placed in her.

     The nation now has an FDA Commissioner who is committed to assuring that Americans have
     safe food, safe and effective drugs and medical devices, and improved public health. Dr. Henney
     has blazed many trails and no one is more qualified to lead the FDA. She has served four
     Presidents and helped guide some of America's finest academic health centers. Her expertise in
     science and technology and lifelong dedication to individual patients will enable her to strike the
     important balance between the need for timely approval of prescription drugs and medical
     devices, while maintaining safety and quality.

     I commend the Democrats and Republicans who worked to give Dr. 'Henney a full and fair
     hearing and help expedite this confirmation. I also want to thank representatives of consumers
     physicians, nurses, and many within the industry for their steadfast and strong support for Dr.
     Henney. Their combined leadership made a vital contribution toward assuring we have the
     right person to lead FDA into the 21st century.
