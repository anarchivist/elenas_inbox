SUBJECT:               Following up on the Service Summit

Since the successful Presidents' Summit for America's Future in Philadelphia, we have met with
the leaders of "America's Promise," General Powell's non-profit organization; worked to
implement the substantive announcements you made in Philadelphia; begun to develop a
communications strategy to ensure that your vision of service is included in continuing coverage
of the summit effort; and begun to design a strategy for reauthorizing AmeriCorps and other
Corporation for National Service programs. Below is an update on these efforts.

America's Promise
The 501(c)3 non-profit organization to follow up on the goals ofthe summit has gotten off to a
slower than expected start. The original CEO, Rick Little, has moved to a more limited
fundraising role. General Powell and his team are looking to hire a CEO, a COO and several
other senior staff to work on communications and developing new commitments. We will
forward appropriate names for their consideration. America's Promise is expected to have about
35-40 staff members. The team has managed to elicit about 100 new commitments by
corporations and non-profits since the summit.

As you know, in March we suggested some names for the board of directors and for the five
advisory task forces. Out of 19 Board members, two are based on your suggestions: Jamie
Gorelick and Lou Holtz. Henry Cisneros and Lynda Robb are expected to continue to serve as
vice chairs. Other members ofthe board include Herman Cain, Ray Chambers, and Billy Shore.
 The task forces (one for each of the five resources for children) are essentially not operational at
this point; questions have been raised about their role and utility.

A threshold question for future discussion is what connection if any the Administration
should have with America's Promise and its goal of reaching two million children by the
year 2000. If you agree, we will continue to meet with General Powell's people on a regular
basis to demonstrate our desire to work together on these issues, to find areas of commonality,
and to find opportunities that might be appropriate for joint appearances. In this regard, we have
agreed to identify Cabinet members who might participate in the numerous local summits that
are planned around the country. General Powell has already participated in three such summits
and is expected to do others. Needless to say, he receives very positive press when he
participates (St. Louis, Boston, rural Pennsylvania). Moreover, the General often talks about
summit themes in his other speeches, and apparently spends considerable time on the telephone
withCEOs.

Substantive FOllow-Up
We have begun to implement the policy initiatives you announced before and at the
                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion

summit. The Corporation for National Service is confident it can meet our target of
adding 50,000 new AmeriCorps scholarships over the next few years. (For your
information, Harris Wofford has met with the Rev. Tony Campolo about his "Mission
Year" service program. Rev. Campolo's program may be eligible only for part-time
rather than full-time scholarships because participants spend some time on religious
activities. Because of these concerns, Campolo is not sure he wants to apply for
AmeriCorps scholarships, although he remains very supportive of the program.) We are
tracking federal agencies' work as they implement the more than 40 commitments they
made to the summit. We will include our proposal to subsidize all loan deferments for
service in our proposed legislation to reauthorize higher education programs.

Communications Follow-up
Reporters have not yet focused critically on what has been achieved since the summit, but it is
inevitable they will do so in the next few months. In your public appearances since the summit,
you have demonstrated your continuing commitment to its goals by mentioning it in appropriate
forums, including the Welfare to Work Partnership event and the Business Roundtable speech,
while the Vice President's announcement in May of a new welfare mentoring partnership with
civic groups is very much in line with the summit's goals. You and the other principals should
continue to do so. To this end, we will work with the speechwriters to ensure that you refer to
the summit's success, the challenge of its ongoing task, and the theme of service and AmeriCorps
at appropriate venues.

Moreover, we will work with communications and scheduling to develop ideas for additional
events. Possibilities include an event to publicize the new high school service scholars
program you announced last year; an event with AmeriCorps to publicize the new
scholarships and announce the winners of their latest competition; bringing in CEO's to
report on their progress since the summit; or events that would tie the summit's themes to
our initiatives, such as linking our juvenile justice initiative to the "safe places" goal [note:
this was his idea). We could seek other synergies between the summit and the
Administration's core themes, especially welfare to work. Finally, members of the Cabinet
will shortly begin to participate in local summits around the country.

AmeriCorps
AmeriCorps' initial authorization expired last year. While reauthorization is not necessary for
AmeriCorps to get funding, this may be our best opportunity to take this issue on and seek the
program's first reauthorization, one that would carry it past the year 2000. The Corporation for
National Service has prepared a draft bill that appears to be solid and that takes a middle course
on issues that have been divisive in the past. We could launch that new legislative proposal in a
bipartisan event that focuses on AmeriCorps' achievements to date.

We will keep you apprised of our efforts as we go forward.
