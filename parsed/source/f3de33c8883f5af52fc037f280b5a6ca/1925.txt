MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT
                                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion

FROM:                 Bruce Reed

SUBJECT:              Policy Announcements for the Summit

DATE:                 April 23, 1997

The following are potential policy announcements you could make at the upcoming Summit on
service and in the radio address on Saturday.

RADIO ADDRESS
You will announce that we are sending our America Reads legislation to the Hill, and use that
opportunity to emphasize AmeriCorps' role in America Reads. You can also talk about your
vision of the Summit and highlight America Reads as a great example of meeting the Summit's
challenge on volunteering and literacy. [Add work-study here.] In addition, you can announce
that Federal agencies are making a "commitment" to the Summit that they will expand the
number of schools that they have adopted or established partnerships with from approximately
1,500 schools to 2,000 schools by the year 2000. Working through partnerships established by
their agencies, Federal employees tutor, purchase equipment, and hold career days.

MONDA Y SPEECH AT SUMMIT
Each of the potential announcements we have developed below expand the concept of service
beyond the current AmeriCorps model to focus on critical fields of service that we want to
encourage young people to enter -- teaching, police, and child care. In this way, you can talk
about your concept of service and about the summit's theme of young people without being too
hemmed in by the current limitations on AmeriCorps' size.

Teacher Corps
[Note: this is current draft, but Mike says he is doing a fairly significant rewrite that he will
get to you soon]

We recommend that your Summit speech feature the announcement of a new initiative to help
address a major challenge of the next decade: attracting and retraining well-prepared teachers for
under served urban and rural areas. This initiative would combine your message on the value of
public service with your Call to Action challenge to put a caring and well-prepared teacher in
every classroom.

The Challenge: Over the next decade, the nation will need to hire some 2 million teachers. Of
these, approximately y%, or xxxxx (approximately 50,000) per year, will be hired in central
cities, in schools with large concentrations of low income students. An additional zzzzz
teachers per year will be needed in isolated, and often poor, rural areas. These types of
communities face the greatest difficulties in attracting and retaining qualified teachers. Urban
                                                 2                     Hex-Dilmp Conve:sion

areas in particular receive significantly fewer applications for positions than neighboring
suburban districts, and attrition rates in urban areas can often reach 30% to 50% in the first five
years. They are therefore most likely to fill classroom vacancies with teachers who lack
preparation, don't meet licensure requirements, or who are teaching out of field. As a result, the
students in these communities -- who need the most qualified teachers in order to meet higher
academic standards -- often have exactly the opposite in the classroom.

The Initiative: We propose to establish an Urban and Rural Teacher Corps, that will provide
incentives for well prepared individuals to teach in public schools in central cities and poor rural
communities. It will accomplish this by providing fellowships for teacher candidates who
commit to teach in urban or rural schools, as well as incentives for participating school districts
and institutions of higher education to work together to upgrade the quality of teacher preparation
and provide adequate support and continued professional development for beginning teachers.

This new initiative would be a part of the Administration's proposal for the reauthorization
of Title V of the Higher Education Act (HEA), to be transmitted to Congress later in the
Spring or Summer. In order to allow for continued planning and consultation, we
anticipate that the basic framework for this initiative be announced at the summit, while
many of the details be further developed by the Education Department over the coming
months. The framework includes the following elements:

~      Undergraduate student fellowships: The program would provide fellowships for
       $3,000 per year, for up to three years, for undergraduate students preparing for
       careers in teaching. The fellowship amount is pegged to the average tuition at
       public institutions of higher education (approximately $3,xxx). It is expected that
       students would begin the fellowship in their junior year, and continue through a
       "fifth year" that would provide intensive and sustained classroom experience.

       Similar fellowships would be available to teachers' aides and other education
       paraprofessionals seeking to move up a career ladder into full teaching positions, an
       approach which will help increase the number of minority teachers as well. Since
       teachers' aides will continue to work while pursuing further education, these
       fellowships may need to be structured somewhat differently than for traditional
       undergraduates.

       Post-baccalaureate fellowships: The program would provide one-year fellowships of
       $7500 for post-baccalaureate students, including recent liberal arts graduate and
       mid-career professionals seeking to enter teaching.

       Partnerships between institutions of higher education and local school systems,
       selected competitively: The new program would be competitive, aimed at fostering
       partnerships among local school districts (city or rural), institutions of higher education
       (both colleges of education and arts and sciences) and others as appropriate, including
                                                   3                        Hex-Dump Conversion

          teacher unions and existing networks for recruiting and supporting teachers ..

          Successful competitors would demonstrate that they have a high quality teacher
          preparation program, and that the program fits into a comprehensive, thoughtful strategy
          for recruiting and retaining teachers. To qualify for funding, local partnership strategies
          would need to address the full range of teacher preparation, induction, and professional
          development, as well as leverage other local, state and federal resources in a strategic and
          coordinated fashion. Local partnerships will be also be required to provide matching
          funds; comparable foundation-funded programs have required a 2-1 matching
          requirement. As the details of this program are further developed, we will determine the
          level and structure of the local matching requirement.

          Local flexibility: School districts, working collaboratively with institutions of higher
          education that provide rigorous teacher preparation programs, would determine their
          greatest recruitment needs and the types of prospective teachers they wish to target (e.g.,
          traditional-age college students, paraprofessionals, mid-career and post-baccalaureate
          condidates, etc.), and use the federal funds to most effectively support locally determined
          strategies.

Budget and Impact: The Education Department estimates that funding for this program, and
the range of participants (depending upon design decisions to be made over the next few months)
would be structured as follows:

                         Funding level (in millions)            Range of participants
FY 1999:                        $ 35
FY 2000:                        $ 73
FY 2001:                        $105
FY 2002:                        $130
FY 2003:                        $130

Totals:                  $473

Police Corps
You can announce $20 million in grants to 17 states for the Police Corps program. The Police
Corps was created in your 1994 Crime Bill to increase the number of community police officers
with advanced education and training, and was one of your pledges during the 1992 presidential
campaign.

The Police Corps offers educational assistance to qualified college students who commit to enter
the police after graduation and serve in the force for at least four years. Students accepted into
the Police Corps receive up to $7,500 in educational assistance for up to four years of
undergraduate study. In addition, Corps recruits receive 16 weeks of rigorous training to heIp
make them effective community police officers. As an incentive to police departments to take
                                                                          Hex-Dump Conversion
                                                  4

recruits, state and local law enforcement agencies receive cash assistance for employing Police
Corps officers-- $10,000 per participant for each year of the recruit's service.

The announcement nearly triples the number of states that will receive Police Corps funds, from
6 to 17 states, and is double the funding appropriated in FY 1996 for the program. Your FY 1998
budget contains $20 million in funding for Police Corps.

Child Care Corps
You could also announce that you will expand AmeriCorps to include a new child care corps.
The child care field has great difficulty attracting and retaining qualified workers, especially
well-educated and trained workers who can go on to become leaders in the field. Your recent
conference on early learning was the latest confirmation that it is critical to increase the quality of
child care. Yet very few of our most talented young people enter this field.

The program would offer AmeriCorps scholarships to individuals who agree to work in child
care in low-income areas for two years. It would be open both to those currently working in the
field and to those seeking to enter. Members of the corps would not get a stipend from
AmeriCorps, but a scholarship of $4,725 a year for two years, which could be used either to
repay existing student loans or to pay for further education.

The Corporation for National Service estimates that it could support a corps of2,000 people a
year without any increase in their budget or permission from Congress, as long as these
individuals get only scholarships and not stipends as well. Under pressure from members of
Congress to reduce the cost of an AmeriCorps member, the Corporation has begun to diversify
its basic model of offering both stipend and scholarship. Instead, it is looking to non-profit
groups to fund the stipend while AmeriCorps funds the scholarship. The Corporation is in a
good position to add these "scholarship only" AmeriCorps members, because its scholarship trust
fund has excess funds.

Non-profit groups would apply to become part of this program, and would have to demonstrate
that they could offer participants high-quality training and mentoring during their two years of
service, including development of management and leadership skills.

One unknown is whether the program will attract applicants if it does not include a stipend, since
child care organizations tend to be strapped for cash. Possible solutions include working with
major child care organizations to see if we could line up support for the program in advance;
providing some funds for training and planning support; and challenging corporations and
universities to assist in this effort. Corporations could sponsor members by paying for their
salaries, and universities that specialize in early childhood education could match our
scholarships.

The alternative is to offer stipends, either by asking the Corporation to earmark current
AmeriCorps slots for this purpose (and reduce its programs in other areas); by seeking a budget
                                                                            Hex-Dump Conve:sion
                                                 5

 increase for this purpose either within AmeriCorps or in HHS; or by using the Corporation's
 demonstration authority (which would allow for only a very small program). It is also important
 to note that we would need legislation if we want to require a service commitment that goes
 beyond the period of AmeriCorps' membership.

 One important question is whether welfare recipients would be targeted as members of the corps.
  HHS believes we should limit these scholarships to college graduates because the greatest need
 is for highly trained professionals and our emphasis should be there, rather than entry level, low
 wage slots. They note that we could ask AmeriCorps to earmark some of its current stipended
 slots for welfare recipients. However, we could also create a second track for welfare recipients
 to get associates' degrees if we wished.

  [Bruce: I'm not sure this proposal distinguishes very well how this corps would be different
  from regular AmeriCorps members who do child care (currently a very small number -- in
  the hundreds), and why it isn't actually worse than that, since it has no stipend. We
. should discuss this.]

 Interest-free Year of Service
 As you know, Rev. Tony Campolo has urged you to make it easier for college students and recent
 graduates to take a year off for service. Since students can already take time off for service
 without having to begin repayment of their loans, the only remaining barrier is the interest that
 accumulates on unsubsidized loans during the period of service. The cost of having the Federal
 government pay that interest is minimal -- $7 million over 5 years. This is a fairly minor
 proposal, but it would allow young people to take time off to serve without increasing their debt
 burden.

 FIRST LADY SPEECH AT CLOSING CEREMONY
 The First Lady will represent the Administration at the closing ceremony on Tuesday. We are
 exploring the option that she could announce Kaiser Permanente's commitment of$100 million
 over the next five years to provide health coverage to 50,000 children in California.
