                            NOVEMBER 10, 1997

Q:   What is a hate crime?

A:   As a general matter, a hate crime is a crime committed against a person or property that
     is motivated by bias against the victim's race, color, religion, gender, national origin,
     sexual orientation, disability, or familial status. However, it is important to understand
     that hate crimes are defined by various federal and state criminal statutes, and these
     statutory definitions differ in their particulars from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. The
     principal federal hate crimes statute, for example, is currently limited to crimes
     committed because of the victim's race, color, religion or national origin; it does not
     include crimes committed because of the victim's gender, sexual orientation, or disability.

Q:   What policies did the President announce at the Hate Crimes Conference?

A:   The President announced several initiatives to ensure effective law enforcement,
     including the creation of working groups in every U.S. Attorney's district in the country
     to improve coordination among local, state, and federal prosecutors; the addition of new
     FBI agents and prosecutors to work on enforcement of hate crimes laws; the development
     of model curriculum for training law enforcement officers to deal with hate crimes; and
     the establishment of a new program at the Department of Housing and Urban
     Development to ensure that perpetrators of housing-related hate crimes pay money
     damages to their victims. The President also announced support for expanding the
     principal federal hate crimes statute to prohibit hate crimes based on gender, sexual
     orientation, and disability.

Q:   What specific changes to current federal law is the President supporting?

A:   The President announced his support for new federal legislation, which will soon be
     introduced by Senators Kennedy and Specter, to expand the principal federal hate crimes
     statute. The current statute prohibits any use of force that is based on a person's race,
     color, religion, or national origin and that is intended to interfere with certain specified
     federally protected activities. The proposed legislation would make illegal any act of
     force based on these prohibited characteristics and leading to bodily injury, even ifthe act
     did not interfere with federally protected activities. Further, the proposed legislation
     would prohibit any hate crime causing bodily injury that is based on sexual orientation,
     gender, or disability, as long as there is a connection with interstate commerce.

Q:   How many hate crimes are there each year? Are hate crimes increasing?

A:   In 1991, there were 4,558 reported incidents of hate crimes; in 1995, there were 7,947


                                              1
                                                                       Hex·Dump Conversion

     reported incidents of hate crimes; and in 1996, there were 8,759 reported incidents. But
     these statistics almost certainly under-report hate crimes to a significant extent, and the
     rise in the number of reported incidents may be due to improvements in reporting, rather
     than to increases in crime. There are two reasons for thinking that current statistics
     under-report hate crime. First and most important, submission of hate crimes data to the
     FBI is voluntary, and many law enforcement agencies do not submit data at all or submit
     incomplete data. In addition, many victims of hate crimes fail to report the incidents
     because of fear, humiliation, or language difficulties. For example, 60% ofthe victims
     of anti-gay incidents who reported their incidents to private tracking groups did not report
     the incidents to the police, in many cases because of a fear of mistreatment or unwanted
     exposure ..

Q:   Is the Hate Crimes Conference part of the Race Initiative?

A:   The Hate Crimes Conference addresses many of the ideas that the President will consider
     as part of the Race Initiative -- in particular, the enormous harms caused by intolerance
     and prejudice. The Hate Crimes Conference, however, addresses not only racial
     differences, but also differences in religious beliefs, sexual orientation, gender, and
     disability. Members of the President's Initiative on Race are actively participating in the
     Hate Crimes Conference as well as at some of the 50 or so satellite sites across the
     country.

Q:   What is the Administration doing about hate on the Internet?

A:   It is important to distinguish between hate crime and hate speech. Speech on the Internet
     is protected by the Constitution. The Clinton Administration is not regulating the
     Internet. However, there are many organizations such as the Anti-Defamation League
     that are working in cooperation with software companies such as America Online to
     develop programs for use by parents to be able to protect their children by filtering out
     hate sites.

Q:   Didn't the Clinton Administration overreact to the church arson problem?

A:   No. President Clinton established the National Church Arson Task Force (NCAFT) in
     June 1996 to oversee the investigation and prosecution of arsons at houses of worship
     around the country because federal authorities noticed an increase in the number of arsons
     reported toward the end of 1995, especially at African American churches in the South.
     Since January 1995, there have been 240 arrests and over 100 convictions, though not all
     the incidents were racially motivated. The Clinton Administration identified a serious
     crime problem and responded swiftly to it, ensuring close coordination among law
     enforcement agencies and effective prosecutions.

Q:   Why isn't the President increasing penalties for hate crimes?

                                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion ·

A:    The Clinton Administration has already increased penalties for hate crimes in the
      Sentencing Enhancement Act, passed as part of the 1994 crime bill, which authorizes the
      impo~ition of enhanced sentences for federal crimes found to have been motivated by
      race, color, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, or disability. The Act
      became effective in November 1995.

Proposed Legislation

Q:    Why is this legislation needed?

A:    The legislation is needed for two compelling reasons. First, the problem of hate crimes
      based on sexual orientation, disability, and gender are serious, and are currently not
      covered under federal law. Second, the Department of Justice has been hindered in its
      efforts to prosecute racial hate crimes because of the need to show that the victim was
      engaged in a federally protected activity such as enrolling in or attending any public
      school or college. This amendment will ensure that all Americans are protected under
      federal law from any hate crimes causing serious bodily injury.

Q:    Why is federal hate crimes legislation necessary at all? Shouldn't this really be a
      matter for local prosecutors?

A:    The federal government has an important supporting role to play in prosecuting hate
      crimes. As a matter oflongstanding practice, federal officials defer to state prosecutors
      to make the initial detennination whether to bring a hate crimes case. But the problem of
      hate crimes is serious enough to warrant providing the federal government with authority
      to act if local prosecutors fail to respond adequately. And the proposed legislation will
      ensure that the federal government has this necessary authority.

Q:    Won't this expansion ofthe new federal hate crimes statute require extra resources?

A:    Any new criminal law requires new resources to enforce it, and this one is no
      exception. The Administration will work to ensure that its new responsibilities. are
      carried out as efficiently as possible.

Q:    Doesn't providing protections based on sexual orientation legitimize the gay
      lifestyle?

A:    No. Whatever their views about homosexuality or about providing antidiscrimination
      protections to gays and lesbians, all people of good will should agree that people should
      not be subject to physical attack based on their sexual orientation. People in this country
      have a fundamental right to be safe and to live without fear of violence. This statute
      ensures that people will receive this protection.

                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion

Q:   Won't the addition of gender to the federal hate crimes legislation federalize all
     rapes?

A:   No. The bill does not make every rape a federal crime. In addition to the violent act,
     there must be evidence of bias toward the victim because of the victim's gender and a
     showing that the offense implicates interstate commerce. Prosecutors may be able to
     prove these elements in some rapes: for example, in the case of a serial rapist who travels
     from state to state, and whose conduct, including language used and mutilation, suggests
     a gender bias. But most rape cases will not be covered under the proposed federal hate
     crimes statute. The Department of Justice will develop internal guidance on this issue to
     ensure that federal prosecutors do not use the statute inappropriately.
