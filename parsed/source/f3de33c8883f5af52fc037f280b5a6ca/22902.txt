                    Q&A on Child Trends Report on Child Poverty
                                February 25, 1999


Q:   The AP reported on a new report saying millions of children were poor even though
     their parents were working. What is the Administration doing to address this
     issue?

A:   We are currently reviewing this study, which shows that in 1996, 20 percent of American
     children were living in poverty and 35 percent of these had working parents. This
     Administration does not believe parents who are working should be remain in poverty.
     That is why we have fought so hard to expand the Earned Income Tax Credit, and why
     we continue to fight hard to raise the minimum wage, and expand child care and health
     coverage for working families. It should be noted that this study measured the status of
     families in 1996, prior to full implementation of welfare reform. We will continue to
     monitor these trends closely.
