TEXT:
I understand that you had a followup meeting on racial profiling while I
was away.  I assume that you were having a staff level discussion to
explore further the options for the crime section of the book, as we had
discussed at the last meeting I hosted.  From the readout I've received it
appears that the agencies are in agreement to go forward with some type of
data collection but not an executive order, primarily because of the
difficulties presented by INS and customs eforcement needs.   Did you
discuss what an executive order would look like or did you all conclude
that the difficulties presented by INS and customs forced the decision not
to have an executive order? At this morning's radio address, both wade
and Raul raised the issue of the INS and I told them from what I knew
there was some legal basis for stopping people based on ethnicity--they
would like to talk about this in greater detail. Also, Mfume told me he
thought we were vulnerable because in the 94 crime bill, DOJ was
authorized to collect data on profiling/police abuse but congress had
never appropriated money and we had never asked for money.  do you know
anything about this? What can you tell me about all of this and where we
go from here?
