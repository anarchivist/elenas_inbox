TEXT:
Since it sounds like yesterday's meeting with Dem Govs staff on tobacco
recoupment went no where, I suggest that we have POTUS make a call to
Carper. Timing is good because we just signed Carper's Ed-Flex Bill,
which the Governor has been crying about for a full year.  President could
(jokingly) give Carper a hard time for not attending the bill signing,
tell Carper recoupment prevention legislation will die unless we reach a
compromise 90r something to that effect), and ask Carper to reach out to R
Govs and signal to the Hill that the NGA wants a deal now so that states
get the their money this year.

Reactions?
