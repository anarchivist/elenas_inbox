TEXT:
Statement on Achieve's announcement that a group of governors and
corporate leaders
 will create a new 8th grade math test -- and teacher training and lesson
materials -- to help U.S. students perform as well as their peers in other
countries.  {Note:  Education is being careful not to describe the
assessments as "high-quality", but is framing their comments as
"supportive of the goal of high-quality curriculum and assessments."}

I applaud the news of this partnership with the goal of promoting
high-quality curriculum, instruction and tests to improve student
performance in math.  We must do everything we can to help our children
