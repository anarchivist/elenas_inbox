TEXT:
I am working with Presidential Correspondence on a response to the
distilled spirits council regarding the President's recent announcement on
hard liquor advertising.

The council is challenging the President to bring together all alcohol
manufacturers (beer, wine, and spirits) and broadcasters to develop a
common code on alchohol advertising. Apparently, each segment of the
alcohol industry has their own code on issues of responsibility and youth.

This could be a good bully pulpit issue and give our position greater
consistency. However, it would be difficult to bring the wine and beer
industries to the table.

If you think this idea is filled with landmines, then I can work on the
letter declining the challenge.  If you think it's something I should
pursue further, I will hold the response on the letter.  Thanks.
