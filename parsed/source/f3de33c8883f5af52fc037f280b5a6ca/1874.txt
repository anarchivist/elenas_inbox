TEXT:
Elena: Those parts of the Conference I had time to watch yesterday were
great.  I think you folks did a good job putting it together. A few
attendees got back to me and were concerned that Neal Lane, Director of
the NSF, was nowhere to be seen. Was he invited? We might need to mend
some fences if he wasn't.

I brought some language to your office yesterday with possible changes to
the NSTC Kids report along the lines of our discussions earlier in the
week.  please let me know if this works for you and if so, how you see
Monday'S release of the EO, etc. Thanks Cliff
