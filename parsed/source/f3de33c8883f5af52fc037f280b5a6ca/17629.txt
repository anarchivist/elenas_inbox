Elena -- Just to keep you updated

1.
  Attached is the one-pager that Richard drafted that we would like to
give to the press people today.  Let us know what changes or edits you
have. Also after you have reviewed this document, we would like to put
this up on the White House website.

2.      Accomplishments document.Neera Tanden is drafting the accomplishments
document, which she will have for us tomorrow. We would like to give the
accomplishments document to the press people by COB tomorrow, Tuesday,
November 4,

3.      Pre-Briefing memorandum for the President. We are meeting with DOJ and
Education today at 6:30 p.m. to finalize what the deliverables for the
Conference will be.  Please come to the meeting if you would like.  In any
event, once we have solidified what initiatives are ready for announcement
and in what form, I will have the pre-brief memo to you by tomorrow
afternoon so that we can give it to the Staff Secretary tomorrow night,
Tuesday, November 4.
Michael Deich has requested to see a copy of this memo, so that he can
review the policy announcements portion of the memo.

4.      President's Panel. We thought that, in addition to the other seven
people you have seen for the President's panel discussion, we needed a
local prosecutor. We thought we might add Dick Devine from the Cook
county State Attorney's Office in Chicago.  This would make 8 people for
the panel. What do you think?

5.       Briefing Book. We will have the briefing book to you by Wednesday
evening.   It needs to be reviewed by Thursday afternoon at the latest,
because there is printing involved. The Cabinet Secretaries will be
briefed on Friday.

Let me know if you need anything else.     Mary

                    THE CLINTON/GORE ADMINISTRATION:
                      GETTING TOUGH ON HATE CRIMES

President to Announce Significant New Law Enforcement and Prevention Initiatives


          "Hate crimes ... leave deep scars not only on the victims, but on our larger community.
  They weaken the sense that we are one people with common values and a common future.
 They tear us apart when we should be moving closer together. They are acts of violence
 against America itself. And even a small number of Americans who harbor and act upon
 hatred and intolerance can do enormous damage to our efforts to bind together our increasingly
 diverse society into one nation realizing its full promise."
           "As part of our preparation for the new century, it is time for us to mount an all-out
 assault on hate crimes, to punish them swiftly and severely, and to do more to prevent them
 from happening in the first place. We must begin with a deeper understanding of the problem
 itself."
                                    President Clinton, Radio Address to the Nation, June 7, 1997


              THE WHITE HOUSE CONFERENCE ON HATE CRIMES
                            November 10, 1997

         On November 10, 1997, the President will convene the first ever White House
Conference on Hate Crimes, a day long event to be held at The George Washington University.
At the Conference, the President will announce significant law enforcement and prevention
initiatives which the Administration will be taking to get tough on hate crimes and hate crime
perpetrators. The Conference will also examine the positive actions some communities are
already taking and which we all can take to do more to prevent hate crimes from happening in the
first place and to make certain they are treated seriously when they do occur.

        A hate crime is the embodiment of intolerance -- an act of violence against a person or
property. Perpetrators of hate crimes pick their targets for no reason other than a victim's race,
color, gender, national origin, religion, sexual orientation or disability (although various federal,
state and local laws define hate crimes somewhat differently). The crime is a manifestation of
the perpetrator's hate.

        Every year, tens of thousands of Americans are victims of hate crimes -- and it is
suspected that many more go unreported. Teenagers and young adults account for a significant
proportion of the country's hate crimes -- both as perpetrators and victims. Each one of these
crimes tears at the fabric of our communities and our democratic society, creating fear and
inter-group tensions, ultimately affecting all of us.

        The Conference is an important element of the President's Initiative on Race, although it
will also examine hate crimes motivated by characteristics other than race.

     50 states. Thousands more will participate at satellite-linked events across the country.
     Members of the President's Advisory Board on Race will participate at various satellite
     locations.

     Americans will join.

            In the afternoon, Members of the Cabinet and other senior Administration officials will
     chair ten separate, concurrent working sessions which will examine various aspects of the issue.
