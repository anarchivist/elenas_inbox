Gang:

Here's my take on a tobacco/drug enforcement amendment, back w/real money,
to put at the beginning of any drug substitute·. Here's what it does:

1. Takes $200 million of the top of the Trust Fund each year to fund
state and local tobacco/drug enforcement (but does not include state and
locals in enforcement section of public health account).  This is about
1/2 a billion less than the latest Leahy amendment proposed spending.

2. Authorizes $75 million and $25 million each year for ATF and Customs,
respectively, to fight tobacco smuggling and drug trafficking.

3. And guarantees a minimum of of 15% (10% ATF, 5% Customs) out of the
enforcement funds in the public health account, or roughly about 100
million per year.
