TEXT:
We are going to set up a meeting for early next week on expanding the crop
insurance program for farmers.  Carl Whillock and Joe Glauber from USDA
will be at the meeting.  We will explore options in order to better
address risk management for farmers.  Apparently, this issue is hot right
now as Glauber will be addressing a Farm Bureau meeting on this topic this
week.  Mary
