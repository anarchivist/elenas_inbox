       Here are the intial thoughts we discussed ... still brainstorming ... jc3

       1. Initial Response Statement. Tomorrow morning before his departure (or
       in lieu of his previously scheduled event), the President could make a
       lengthier statement on the shooting; say he'd met w/Riley and Reno; spoken
       with the local school superintendent and Mayor; and confirm that the
       federal government would make available an emergency response team to
       assist local authorities.

       2. School Resource Officers. On Thursday, the President (or the AG in
       her press availability) could announce that the COPS office would help
       local school districts hire some 600 police officers to work in schools.
       We could also encourage all schools and communities to apply by June 1st
       for the more than $300 million that will be available under the Safe
       Schools, Healthy Students initiative.  [NB: Both of these proposals were
       first announced at the White House Conference on School Safety.]

       3. Safe and Drug-Free Schools Reauthorization. On Friday (or as part of
       the Saturday radio address, or later next week), the President could
       unveil the Safe and Drug-Free Schools proposal that will be included as
       part of the ESEA reauthorization to be unveiled later this month.  The
       proposal formally authorizes our FEMA-like emergency response teams,
       requires participating schools to adopt comprehensive school safety plans,
       and renews the requirement that schools adopt "Zero Tolerance" policies
       for guns. [NB: If the President speaks or meets with Reno and Riley before
       then, he should insist that -- in light of the recent shooting -- they
       review our proposal and ensure that it adequately addresses school safety
       issues .]

       4.           Tough New Gun Legislation.  Sometime next week -- and just days before
       the          NRA convention takes place in Denver, CO (April 30 through May 2)
       the          President could unveil the new firearms provisions to be included in
       his          21st Century Crime Bill/Initiative, including:

       -- Making permanent the Brady waiting period for handgun purchases;
       -- Closing the gun show loophole by applying background checks to these
       sales;
  ·

    Banning the continued importation of grandfathered large capacity
magazines;
-- Banning the possession of handguns by violent juveniles when they turn
21;
-- Requiring that child safety locks be issued with every gun sold;
-- Holding adults criminally responsible for allowirig easy access to
firearms; and
[-- Limiting the purchase of handguns to one per month;]
-- Enhancing certain gun penalties, providing for the forfeiture of guns
used to commit crimes, strengthening the federal firearms licensing system
and procedures, and providing for Brady background checks to purchase
explosives, etc.
