TEXT:
I spoke to an industry representative about recent cloning-related events,
especially events on the Hill, and here is what I was told.  There was a
meeting between Republican leadership staff and representatives from the
pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry. Republican staff complained
loudly about the industry's efforts to defeat Republican sponsored cloning
legislation. As a result of that meeting, and because industry staff had
not yet had a chance to confer with their boards, industry staff were
unusually quiet during sessions that had been previously scheduled w"ith
House and Senate Democratic staff.  Industry staff did then meet with
their boards and the bottom line was that there would be no sea change in
their opposition to current cloning legislation.  Industry staff were
instructed to be more respectful in their opposition.

Several other points:  1) Industry representatives who have been working
the Hill don't perceive a rush at this point by Republicans to bring up
cloning legislation.  In fact, House Republican's who are trying to craft
legislation are struggling with what should be prohibited.  2) It would be
helpful if we held a meeting with our allies to shore up our base (because
of scheduling conflicts, we are now trying to set up a meeting for next
week).   3) Genentech's CEO asked the President about cloning while the
President was in SF. The President said he supported the
Feinstein/Kennedy approach, but urged the industry to reach out to Frist
(have we heard from our people what was said in this conversation?).   4)
The industry is interested in the advisory committee approach to oversee
reasearch. This approach would be modeled after NIH's recombinant-DNA
committee that oversees gene therapy research and it would be combined
with FDA regulation.
