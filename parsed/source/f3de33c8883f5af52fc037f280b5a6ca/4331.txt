TEXT:
At today's weekly welfare meeting, DOL argued rather effectively that we
should make an immediate, concerted effort to alert Democratic Governor
staffs to the fact that, as written, Shaw's draft appears to undermine the
employee status of those on workfare, even though Shaw says that that was
not his goal. Emily has chatted with Carper and Chiles staff, but she
hadn't yet reached Miller and Dean.   I know we don't want to get drawn
into discussing how to fix Shaw's draft.  But if we avoid that, it would c
ertainly be helpful to scare them out of signing on.  If we want to limit
it, we could talk only to Miller and Dean and ask them to pass the word.
(We would presumably also say we continue to oppose weakening the work
requirements. )

Cynthia and I think this is a good idea.     What do you think?
