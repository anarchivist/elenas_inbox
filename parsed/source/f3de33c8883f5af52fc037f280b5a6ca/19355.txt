TEXT:
Elena,
Sally talked to Kennedy yesterday.  He wants to know what the
Administration'S bottom-line position is on the various HIB reforms, in
preparation for negotiations that will take place after the break.  Sally
wants to have a Deputys and then a Principals meeting on this question.

I have suggested that Ceci and I put together an options paper for you and
Sally that outlines each reform, what we have advocated in the past, and
what our bottom line would be. To do this, we would consult with INS,
Labor and Commerce. We could have a draft of this to you early next week.

Does this sound o.k.?   Thanks.

Julie
