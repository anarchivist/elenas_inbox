TEXT:
I spoke to OMB about logistics of the reg publishing.   How about this for
timing:

        The President announces both regs on the 17th. On the 17th, the
DOL reg will be on public display (published on the 18th) and we will have
just sent the TANF reg to the Fed Register (to be displayed on the 19th
and published on the 21st).

        As long as we've sent the reg to the Federal Register, we can talk
about it as much as we want. Sally would have to do some special pleading
to have such a long reg delivered on Monday published by the end of the
week, but OMB thinks it can De done.
