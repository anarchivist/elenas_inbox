TEXT:
Yesterday the President issued a statement on his petition to the FECon
"Soft Money". Attached is a letter that we would like to release along
with the letter to the FCC on Free TV time.  The purpose of the letter is
to place additional pressure on the FEC commissioners prior to their
February 12 meeting to discuss the proposed rule. The letter is a little
more detailed than yesterday'S statement.

Please let me know by 4:00 pm today if you are ok with this draft and
releasing the letter tomorrow.

To the Members of the Federal Election Commission:

        I strongly support action to end the soft money system raised by both political parties.
That is why last year I asked the Federal Election Commission to ban soft money, under its
current legal authority. I am very pleased that the agency's general counsel has proposed a new
rule prohibiting national parties from raising soft money. Banning soft money fundraising by
national party committees will enable our election laws to catch up with the reality of the way
elections are financed today, and along with new campaign finance reform legislation, will take
significant strides toward restoring public confidence in the campaign finance process. Now I
ask the members of the Commission to step up to their responsibility and act, within their legal
authority, to end soft money. The American people deserve nothing less.


                                           Sincerely,



                                   William Jefferson Clinton
