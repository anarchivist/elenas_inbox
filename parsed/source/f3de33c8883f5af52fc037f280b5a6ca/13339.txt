DRAFT   February 23, 1996 11:45 a.m.




OOption 1   Partial RepealO

Under this approach, the Administration would support repeal of those provision
s of the logging
rider that pertain to oldgrowth sales and the Northwest Forest
 Plan (these are the provisions the
courts have interpreted so broadly). The p
olicy wouldl include buyback and replacement timber
provisions, giving the Admin
istration tools to address environmentally problematic sales already
released.
 The salvage program would not be repealed, but we would announce significantly

intensifiedl management oversight of the program and the establishment of speci
al boards or
other mechanisms to handle citizen complaints about particular sal
es during the remaining 10
months of the rider.

OPROSO
"White House and agency staff agree that this is the most logical and reasonabl
e approach
as a matter of policy.
"Proenvironment approach, but not an uncritical embrace of their perspective an
d
allegations.  May be seen by general public as balanced
"No patent flipflop from previous support for salvage program
"Previous, possibly outdated, indications of support from Governor Kitzhaber, C
ong.
DeFazio, and thenCongressman Wyden.

OCONSO
"No presently identified support from any Northwest or other political leader.


OOption 2   Full RepealO

Under this approach, the Administration would support repeal of all provisions
of the logging
rider (i.e., oldgrowth, Forest Plan, and salvage). As in Option
 1, the policy would include buyback and replacement timber provisions. We wou
ld commit to propose some form of permanent
 forest hea.lth legislation without
sufficienc)( language in lieu of the salvage provision.

OPROSO
"Patterned after expected legislative strategy from Sen. Murray
"May be supported by Senator Wyden
"Similar to Cong. Furse legislation and probable Bradley/Boxer legislation
"Unequivocal proenvironment approach (except, depending on the details, for the
  forest
health legislation)

OCONSO
"Repeal of salvage provision will deeply anger labor and timber industry
"May go beyond what Gov. Kitzhaber will support
OOption 3  Heightened POTUS criticism and generalized call for reformO
·
    Under this approach, the' President would sharply criticize the impacts of the 1
    ogging rider. He
    would emphasize the environmental damage and social conflict,
     the risk of renewed gridlock,
    and the erosion of public confidence in the fore
    st management process.  He would emphasize
    problems in the oldgrowth arena, bu
    t also note concern over possible problems with the
    salvage program.

    In order to go beyond what the President said in his October statement, he woul
    d cite
    unsuccessful efforts in court and the Congress to fix the logging rider.
      The President would say
    that something must be done and would speculate that
     the appropriate response could include
    repeal of some or all of the provisions
     of the law. He would announce that he will work with
    Senator Murray, Senator
    Wyden, other members of the delegation, and the governors to define
    exactly the
     correct approach. He would also announce that he is directing the Secretaries
    of the
    Interior and Agriculture to investigate allegations of abuse in the salv
    age program.

    The President would also refer to the example set by the Seventh American Fores
    t Congress
     (now underway in washington, DC) as representing the type of broad c
    ooperation and
    consensus seeking that should characterize foiest policymaking.


    DPROSD
    "Allows us time to reach policy agreement with Sen. Murray and others

    DCONSD
    "May be seen as irresolute or redundant by all sides
    "Environmentalists will be dissatisfied by lack of clear commitment to   full re
    peal
