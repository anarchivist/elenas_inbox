TEXT:
Timing question. Leslie Thorton seems to be able to do the meeting
Tuesday of next week. She seems to be coordinating things on this issue
and Kinciad says she's not very good by telephone in meetings. I suggest
the m~eting be held Tuesday, you'll be leading it anyway, and I'll call
in by phone.

If you agree, I'll also call Mike Smith in the meantime and see if he has
any ideas on the topic.
