     INFORMATION

                                          Draft February 24, 1998

     MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

     FROM:          GENE SPERLING, BRUCE REED

     RE:            ADMINISTRATION POLICY ON SKILLED TEMPORARY FOREIGN
                    WORKERS

     We are providing you with this informational memo on the "HI-B visa" issue because the New
     York Times recently ran a story on the basis of a leaked internal Administration options memo,
     and because this is an important topic to Silicon Valley companies. During your trip to
     California later this week, you will be interacting with high-tech CEOs and may get asked about
     this. A suggested Q&A is attached.

     Current U.S. law permits 65,000 HI-B visas each year for skilled (BA or equivalent) temporary
     foreign workers. The computer and health care industries are the primary users of the HI-B
     program. The annual 65,000 visa cap was met for the first time in FY 1997. This year, we
     expect to reach the limit in Mayor June -- several months before the end of the current fiscal
     year. Accordingly, the cap is likely to become a legislative issue in this session of Congress.

     The information technology (IT) industry, along with Senator Abraham, Representative Zoe
     Lofgren, and other members of Congress, support either the removal of or a significant increase
     in the HI-B cap. Unions, other worker organizations, Senator Kennedy, Congressman Dingell,
     and other members of Congress are likely to oppose any increase.

     A DPCINEC working group with representatives from Labor, Commerce, State, and INS has
     started to meet to develop Administration policy on:

     1.      Steps we can take to work with industry and institutions of higher education to address
             the shortage of workers with IT skills;

     2.      Reforms of the H 1-B program (e.g., a prohibition against laying off U.S. workers to
             replace them with foreign workers); and

     3.      Whether or not to increase the HI-B cap from its current level of 65,000.
                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion


We have tentatively decided that in addressing shortages of workers within the IT industry, we
should focus on increased training, education and recruitment of American workers -- not on an
increase in the cap for temporary foreign workers. We intend to initiate a partnership with the
IT industry to make this happen. We have, in at least one similar context, used such a
partnership to effectively address perceived labor shortages. We successfully addressed
concerns about the shortage of shipbuilder workers in Louisiana by bringing together industry,
labor, and state and local elected officials. Through this partnership, it was ultimately
determined that the temporary shortage that existed within this industry was 1,000 workers,
rather than the 10,000 originally claimed.

The interagency group is willing to consider, if necessary, an increase in the HI-B cap as part of
_an overall package that includes industry commitments to training, education and recruitment and
reform of the HI-B visa program. However, we do not recommend starting our discussion with
the cap increase on the table. Moreover, any increase in the HI-B cap (even a 20,000 to 35,000
increase) is not likely to address either the short or long term problem ofIT worker shortages,
given the projected growth in demand for workers with IT skills.

Our next step is to meet with high-tech industry executives to develop an "action plan" that
builds on a series of announcements that the Departments of Commerce, Education and Labor
made at a January 1998 conference in Berkeley, California.

Q. Mr. President, will your Administration grant more visas to high-skilled foreign
workers who are in demand by high-tech industries?

We have made no decision on this issue. In reviewing our options, my Administration's first
priority will be to ensure that American workers have the skills they need to fill these jobs, and
that they have priority over any foreign workers with similar training. The growing demand for
workers with high-tech skills shows how critical my agenda for life-long learning is -- HOPE
scholarships to open the doors of college, tax credits for employer investment in life-long
learning, and making sure that all of our children are technologically literate.
