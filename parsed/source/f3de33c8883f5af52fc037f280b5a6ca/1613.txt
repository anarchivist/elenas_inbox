TEXT:
NYTimes reports this morning that Justice has decided not to object to the
NY legislation changing the role of community school boards.   Good news
for the forces of education reform!

Elena, the ED/Justice meeting is still on today as far as I know, and I
understand that you and Rob Weiner will be attending.  I'm checking with
Judy Winston's office for precise time and location -- I lost track of
that when it looked like it would be rescheduled.  I'll get the info. to
you and Rob as soon as I get it.
