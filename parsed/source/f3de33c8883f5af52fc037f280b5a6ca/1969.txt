Subject: taxing workfare/welfare benefits

Cynthia,
It seems to me that IRS will not be getting helpful advice out very soon
on the
issue of what types of welfare/workfare payments are taxable for income
and
payroll tax purposes.  It might be appropriate to put together a joint
DPC/NEC
decision process that would develop legislative options in this area and
run
parallel to the process involving IRS.  I could imagine a proposal being
developed that would simply codify current practice in the area of
taxation and
provide some reasonable safe harbors for tax treatment and that would cost
nothing in terms of foregone revenue (because the legislation just
followed
current practice). Alternatively, the exclusion for benefits could be
expanded
at some revenue cost.

What do you think about this?
                                           Mark
