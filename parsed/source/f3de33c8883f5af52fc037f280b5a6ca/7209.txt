                                   CHILD CARE EVENT

                             DATE:                  April 23, 1998
                            -LOCATION:              Rose Garden
                             EVENT TIME:            10:00 am - 11:00 am
                             FROM:                  Bruce Reed

I.-   PURPOSE

      To urge congressional. action on child care, and release two reports which. document
      business efforts on child care: (1) the Treasury Working Group on Child Care report,
      Investing in Child Care; and (2) the Department of Labor report, Meeting the Needs of
      Today's Worliforce: Child Care Best Practices. You will also announce a new
      commitment by the Department of Labor to reach out to 1,000 new companies within the
      next year, to serve as a clearinghouse for businesses interested in child care, and to set up
      a business-to-business mentoring program on child care.

II.   BACKGROUND

      Legislative Update on Child Care
      While the event will spotlight best practices in the corporate community and urge greater
      private sector commitment to child care, the purpose of this event is to emphasize the
      importance of a federal commitment to child care and to urge Congress to act on child
      care legislation this year. Numerous child care bills have been introduced by Democrats
      and by Republicans since you announced your child care initiative earlier this year.
      Many of the bills incorporate the Administration's key child care priorities -- substantial
      new subsidies and tax credits to help low- and middle-income families pay for child care;
      investments to help states and communities improve the quality of early childhood
      programs; a new tax credit for businesses that provide child care services; and an
      expansion of before- and after-school programs. Further, several of the tobacco
      proposals (McCain, Conrad, Fazio, and Kennedy) would direct a portion of tobacco
      revenue to child care and early childhood programs.

      Some key Members of Congress are committed to Congressional action on child care this
      year, including Senators Dodd, Kennedy, Kerry, Chafee and Snowe, and Representatives
      Kennelly, Tauscher, and DeLauro. Importantly, the bipartisan Congressional Women's
      Caucus, lead by Representatives Norton and Johnson, recently released it letter to Speaker
                                                                     Hex-Dilmp Conversion
Gingrich urging that Congress pass child care legislation.

Despite the interest in child care, there are serious obstacles to enacting the
Administration's proposals. First, as you know, the Senate Budget Resolution targets all
tobacco funds to Medicare. While the Resolution allows for up to $9 billion for
expanded child care tax credits and $5 billion to increase discretionary spending for the
Child Care and Development Block Grant, cuts in other essential programs would be
required to offset the discretionary spending increase. Second, both Houses have passed
some of the Congressional resolutions emphasizing that any child care proposal must
include significant new funding for stay-at-home parents, thereby pitting child care
investments against programs and tax cuts that would help parents who stay home care
for their children. Finally, the Republican leadership is stalling child care legislation for
political reasons. The House Ways and Means Committee has not scheduled any
hearings on child care, and Senator Chafee was only recently able to schedule a child care
hearing before his Finance Subcommittee (which was held today).

Release of Final Report of Treasurv Working Group on Child Care
Investing in Child Care is the final report of the Treasury Working Group on Child Care,
which you had asked Secretary Rubin to lead at the White House Conference on Child
Care. This initiative has garnered significant enthusiasm from the children's advocacy
community, as it represents the first time a Treasury Secretary has focused on child care
issues. The report discusses what businesses can do to promote access to affordable,
high quality child care for their employees, highlights a wide range of best practices, and
presents evidence that investing in child care makes good business sense. Child care
problems can reduce productivity and profits -- recognizing this, businesses support child
care programs. The Working Group report finds that businesses benefit from providing
child care assistance in a variety of ways -- through improved productivity, lower
turnover, better recruitment, reduced absenteeism, and improved morale. The report also
notes that while business sector commitment is important, it cannot solve the existing child
care problem alone. A recent study found that only one percent of revenues for child care
and early education came from the private sector. [Stoney and Greenberg, 1996]

The Treasury Working Group will meet with the First Lady and Erskine Bowles before
this event. The Working Group consists of business and labor leaders, and includes
Sandy Weill, CEO, The Travelers Group; Randy Tobias, President, Eli Lilly; John
Sweeney, President, AFL-CIO; Doug Price, CEO, First Bank of Colorado; George
Stinson, President and CEO, General Converters and Assemblers; and Marcy Whitebook,
National Co-Director, Center for the Child Care Workforce.     (Please note that the
group was not subject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act and therefore will not
make recommendations.)

Release of Labor Department Report and Announcement of New Commitment
The Labor Department report that will be released at t~e event, Meeting the Needs of
Today's Worliforce: Child Care Best Practices, highlights best practices of the corporate
sector to offer child care assistance to their workers. The examples are primarily gleaned
from the Labor Department's Honor Roll of companies with model family-friendly
workplace practices. You will also announce a new commitment by the Department of
Labor to reach out to 1,000 new companies by this time next year, to serve as a
clearinghouse for businesses interested in child care, and to set up a business-to-business
       mentoring program on child care.                      Hex·Dump Conversion

       Take Our Daughters to Work Day
       April 23rd is the sixth annual Take Our Daughters to Work Day. The Ms. Foundation
       for Women began the program in 1993 to address issues facing adolescent girls aged nine
       to fifteen. The program gives girls the opportunity to visit a work setting with a parent
       or friend so they can see all of the different jobs women do; Many guests at this event
