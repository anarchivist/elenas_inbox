     As far as I know, we don't have any committement from Obey to add $90
     million or any other amount to Chapter II--so getting $45 million in FY99
     (probably more than we will need) is a better deal than Obey's offer. But
     after the first year, I'm suggesting we take Obey's offer, and if we can
     get a committment to additional Chapter II funds from him, so much the
     better.  I just think it's more important to get the first year money
     clearly nailed down, or we will have a much harder time getting this off
     the ground.

     with regard to the caps, I simply viewed that as something we could give
     the Republicans without actually giving away much at all, while getting
     some protection for ourselves if we are unable to scale up very quickly.
     I'll admit I hadn't considered the timing with respect to the end of the
     President's term.  I take it from your response that you are not
     volunteering to break the news to the President yourself.  I take hints
     well, so I wouldn't either.

     We could handle this in a few ways. One would be to remove the cap after
     the first year.   The main value would be in limiting the effort we'd be
     asking Obey to com~itt to in next year's budget, as a way of preserving
     1st year funding.   In my formulation, this would make the 1999
     administration a demonstration or field test, but as long as we get to 51%
     in the next year we would be implementing national tests. And I suspect
     that if we don't have half the country by then, the story will be that
     Clinton didn't get his national tests in place before he left office.

     Another would be to try a different approach all together, still trying to
     keep 1st year money and give us some basis for dealing with Obey and
     Porter in terms they would recognize based on their own proposals. What
     about a new line in Chapter II just for the tests--a discretionary grant
     program to districts signing up to the test.  When the % of kids
     participating reaches a set amount (50%, 80%???), then the separate funds
     just get rolled into the main Chapter II program as Obey would have done
'.

     originally.
