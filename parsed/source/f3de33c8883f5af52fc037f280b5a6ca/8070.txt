                                  PRESIDENT CLINTON:
                          MOVING AMERICA INTO THE 21ST CENTURY

                                                    June 9, 1998

"This Act will strengthen America. It helps communities modernize and build the roads, bridges, and railways that link
people of our great and vast nation together and permit the free flow ofgoods and services. "

                                                                                        President Bill Clinton
                                                                                        June 9, 1998

Today, President Clinton is joined at the White House by Secretary of Transportation Rodney Slater and a
bipartisan group of Members of Congress to sign the Transportation Equity Act for the 21 st Century. This
law authorizes investments in our infrastructure over the next six years, including funding to rebuild roads,
bridges, and highways.

A NEED TO INVEST FOR THE FUTURE. When President Clinton took office, the broad network of roads
and highways which have connected millions of Americans was crumbling. The President has long said that
if America is to move forward into the 21st Century, the transportation system which has served our country
must be ready for the future as well.

LANDMARK INVESTMENT IN OUR NATION'S INFRASTRUCTURE. With today's bill signing, the
transportation needs of America are being met. This bill strengthens our infrastructure by helping
communities rebuild, renovate, and modernize the highways, roads, bridges, and transit systems that link our
country together and keeps our economy strong and vibrant.

A LAW WHICH REFLECTS THE PRESIDENT'S PRIORITIES. President Clinton insisted that this bill reflect
the priorities of this Administration:

·        Environmental Protection. Strengthens proven strategies to protect public health and the
         environment, expands recreational trails and bike paths, promotes mass transit use, and extends the
         Ethanol tax credit through 2007;
·        Fiscal Discipline. The highway bill does not touch the budget surplus and is fully paid for with real
         offsets;
·        Welfare-to-Work Provisions. Invests in the President's transportation plan to help move people
         from welfare to work;
·        Safeguarding Our Roads and Drivers. Allows our nation to develop advanced air bag technology,
         offer incentives for increased seat belt use, make roads safer, and get bad drivers and vehicles off the
         road;
·        Investment in Border Infrastructure. Authorizes the Administration's program to target resources
         at border crossings to improve traffic flow and reduce illicit activity;
·        Protection of Critical Investments In Our Future. The transportation bill invests in our
         infrastructure without reducing investments in education, health care, research and development, and
         the environment.

STRENGTHENING OUR INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THE FUTURE. Today, the President affirms his
commitment to providing the resources necessary to rebuild and modernize our invaluable transportation
system. The investments made today will pay dividends for years to come, as the roads, highways, bridges,
and transit systems which are built or refurbished continue allowing all Americans to travel around and enjoy
our great nation.
