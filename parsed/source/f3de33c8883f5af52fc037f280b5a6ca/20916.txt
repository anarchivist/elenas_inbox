TEXT:
DOJ did send a letter with "oppose" on 5/7/98 regarding HR 2070. Our SAP
elevated that to "strongly oppose".  Please let me know if you didn't
receive the copy that I faxed.  When we prepared a revised SAP for the
Senate, I will forward the draft for you to review. Thanks for your help
on this one.

Subject:         HR 2070 - Correction Officers Health and Safety Act

OMB/LA reports that HR 2070 passed by voice, before we were able to get
the issue on the SAP resolved.  Justice has heard that Hatch is interested
in taking this bill up when the Senate returns.  So although we have a few
weeks to breathe on this, it looks like it is going to come up in the
Senate. Stay tuned.
