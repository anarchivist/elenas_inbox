VICE PRESIDENT GORE UNVEILS 1999 NATIONAL DRUG CONTROL STRATEGY
February 8, 1999

Today Vice President Gore will release the 1999 National Drug Control
Strategy,
a comprehensive long-term plan to reduce drug use and availability to
historic


new lows.  The Strategy is backed by a $17.8 billion counter-drug budget
--the
largest ever presented to Congress. The Vice President will also
highlight the
extraordinary efforts of the private sector to join forces with the
successful
Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign to get the right message on drugs to kids,
parents, and teachers.

A long term commitment to fight drugs. Year in and year out, the
Clinton-Gore
Administration has proposed the largest anti-drug budgets ever, helping to
increase federal counter-drug spending by nearly 40% between FY 93 and FY
99.
Our sustained effort is having an impact: overall drug use is half the
level it
was at its peak in the 1970's; drug-related murders are down by 40 percent
since 1992; the first-ever paid anti-drug media campaign has been launched
nationwide; and youth drug use is on the decline for the second year in a
row.
The 1999 National Drug Control Strategy builds on this progress and takes
the
next steps to reduce drug use and availability across the board.

Keeping kids the number one priority.   If our children can make it to
adulthood
free of substance abuse, the vast majority will avoid addiction for the
rest of
their lives. That is why the first goal of the Strategy is to educate and
enable kids to reject drugs. And while recent studies show declining youth
drug
use in 1997 and 1998, we have more work to do. The Clinton-Gore Strategy
and FY
2000 budget ref·lect a strong commitment to meeting this challenge:

  $195 Million for National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign. The
PresidentD! ,s
budget continues this unprecedented, 5-year campaign to use the full
power of
the mass media to educate millions of young people, parents, teachers and
mentors about the dangers of drugs.  In just six months, the private
sector has
joined our national effort and made over $165 million in matching
contributions
--helping us to reach even more people by creating their own anti-drug ads,
producing shows about drug prevention, and giving scores of non-profit
organizations free air time to run their drug-related messages.

  $590 Million for Safe and Drug-Free Schools.   In addition to calling for
increased funds, the President is committed to.reforming·the Safe and
Drug-Free
Schools Program to make it even more effective. The PresidentO!,s
proposal will
require schools to adopt rigorous, comprehensive school safety plans that
include tough, but fair discipline policies; safe passage to and from
schools;
effective drug and violence policies and programs; annual school safety and
drug use report cards; and links to after school programs.

Breaking the iron link between drugs and crime.   A third of state


prisoners and
one in five federal prisoners commit their crimes under the influence of
drugs. Nearly 20 percent of state prisoners " and 15 percent of federal
inmates
commit their crimes to buy drugs.  The presidentD!,s budget provides new
resources for states and localities to break crime-committing addicts of
their
addictions and reduce recidivism:

  $215 Million for Zero Tolerance Drug Supervision. The President
proposes the
most comprehensive drug supervision ever to help keep offenders drug-and
crime-free: $100 million in new funds to help states and localities to drug
test, treat, and sanction prisoners, parolees and probationers; $50
million to e
xpand innovative drug courts; and $65 million for residential drug
treatment
for prisoners with the most serious drug problems.

Strengthening law enforcement.  One of the StrategyD!,s goals is to
increase the
safety of AmericaD!,s citizens by substantially reducing drug-related
crime and
violence. To help keep crime coming down to record low levels, the
PresidentD!,s budget includes:

   $1.275 Billion for a 21st Century Policing Initiative, to help
communities
hire, redeploy and retain up to 50,000 law enforcement   officers with an
effort to target crime and drug "hot spots"; to equip    officers with the
latest crime-fighting technologies; and to engage entire   communities to
work
together to prevent and fight crime.

    $22 Million Increase for DEA Drug Intelligence, including $13
million to
assist the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) with its efforts to    automate and
improve access to critical law enforcement and intelligence    information,
and
$9 million to support investigations to dismantle drug   trafficking organ
izations.

Closing the treatment gap.  Dependence on drugs exacts an enormous toll in
individuals, their families, businesses, communities, and the nation.
Treatment can help end dependence on addictive drugs --and its destructive
consequences. To help make treatment available to more Americans in need,
the
PresidentD!,s budget provides:

  $85 Million to Increase Drug Treatment. The PresidentD!,s budget
provides an
additional $55 million in Targeted Capacity Grants to expand the
availability
of drug treatment to meet existing or emerging needs, and $30 million more
for
the Substance Abuse Block Grant --the backbone of federal efforts to help
states and localities reduce the gap between those seeking treatment and
the
capacity of the public treatment system.


     Stopping drugs at the border and breaking foreign sources of supply.     The
     Strategy will help shield our borders and strengthen multinational
     cooperation
     on drugs by including:

       $50 Million Increase for the Southwest Border. The PresidentO!,s
     budget
     includes additional funds for INS to deploy "force     multiplying"
     technology,
     such as infrared and color cameras and    ground sensors to aid Border
     Patrol
     enforcement and drug interdiction   efforts.

       $29 Million More for International Programs. to fund the State
     Departmen to! , s
     International Narcotics Law Enforcement AffairsO!, efforts in the Andean
     countries, and Mexico, and to provide assistance to enhance multinational
     cooperation in our anti-drug efforts.
