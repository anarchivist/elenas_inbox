TEXT:
I heard through the grapevine that you are preparing a Presidential
Decision Memo regarding the Executive Order on Genetic
Non-discrimination.  Since Jack/Sylvia would be required to sign-off on
any such EO I think that it may be a good idea to show them the draft memo
before it goes to the POTUS.  Let me know if this is possible or if there
is some reason why you think that this may not be a good idea.

Thanks
