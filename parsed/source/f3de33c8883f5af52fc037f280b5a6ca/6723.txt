TEXT:
You wrote me a note asking what events we are considering for the
anniversary of the service summit in late April. Ann Lewis is having a
meeting tomorrow at 11 on this that I'm going to, so I'll have a more
complete menu by tomorrow.  Nothing too great so far.  The top ideas are
trying to piggy-back onto one of a variey of related events around that
time (like Earth Day) and attending a mini-summit sponsored by America's
Promise and the Corporation in Kansas City or Arkansas. SteveSilverman
thinks that the working assumption by Scheduling is that there will not be
a summit commemoration per se, but a piggy-backing approach. We'll also
get a report from America's Promise on its accomplishments and update our
own federal agency commitments.
