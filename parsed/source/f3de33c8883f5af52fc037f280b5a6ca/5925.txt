MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:          Bruce Reed
               Elena Kagan

RE:            DPC Weekly Report



         Crime -- Slain Officers: The National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund
(NLEOMF) reports that the number of officers killed in the line of duty in 1997 increased by
nearly 40% to 159 deaths as compared to the 116 officers slain in 1996. This essentially wipes
out the gains made in 1996 -- the lowest number killed since 1959 -- and exceeds the 1990s
average of 151 line-of-duty deaths per year. The NLEOMF attributes the rise in deaths to: (l) a
sharp increase in firearms-related deaths (70 v. 56 in 1996); (2) an usually high number of traffic
fatalities; and (3) 10 multiple death incidents resulting in 22 officers being killed.

        Crime -- Brady Handgun Checks: Arkansas remains the only state that is not
conducting background checks prior to handgun sales. As noted to you earlier, Governor
Huckabee continues to resist background checks, despite an opinion issued by Arkansas Attorney
General Winston Bryant that Arkansas has the necessary authority. Attorney General Bryant has
asked the Treasury and Justice Departments to make him the designated chieflaw enforcement
officer authorized to conduct background checks statewide. The Justice and Treasury
Departments have been working with Attorney General Bryant to de-designate the Governor and
to designate Bryant as the chief law enforcement officer authorized for background checks. This
proposal will likely be contentious with the Governor, who is not aware of the negotiations
between the agencies and Bryant. The proposal is expected to be signed on January 22.

         Drugs -- Substance Abuse and Prisoners: On Thursday, the National Center on
Addiction and Substance Abuse released a study on the substance abuse problems of the nation's
prisoners. The three-year study found that drug and alcohol abuse and addiction were
implicated in the crimes and incarceration of 80% of the 1. 7 million individuals in prison or jail.
This means that 1.4 million offenders were either high on drugs or alcohol when they committed
their crimes, stole property to buy drugs, have a history of drug and alcohol abuse -- or some
combination of these factors.




                                                       Automated Records Management System
                                                       Hex-Dump Conversion
eligible receive treatment. According to the Bureau of Prisons, this requirement has been met.
Since enactment of the 1994 Crime Law, we have tripled the number of inmates treated in the
federal system, increased the number of residential treatment centers in federal prisons by 30%
(from 32 to 42), and some form of substance abuse treatment is available in every federal prison
facility. Under your prisoner drug testing initiative, states are required to submit comprehensive
plans of testing, sanctions, and treatment by March 1998 as a condition of receiving their prison
construction funding. To build on this effort, we are preparing a directive to: 1) require states to
establish baselines of prison drug use and to measure their progress yearly; 2) allow states to use
their prison construction funds to implement their testing and treatment plans; and 3) encourage
states to enact increased penalties for smuggling drugs into prisons.

        Drugs -- Anti-Drug Media Campaign: On Thursday, the anti-drug media campaign
was kicked off in Washington, DC -- the first city in the 12-city pilot. In DC, anti-drug
advertisements have started to air during prime-time network programming, with radio and
Internet ads to start next week. ONDCP will rollout the media campaign in the remaining pilot
cities during the month of January. The other 11 pilot cities and rollout dates are as follows:
Atlanta (1/20), Baltimore (1/13), Boise (1/13), Denver (1116), Hartford (1/23), Houston (1/15),
Milwaukee (1/21), Portland (1122), San Diego (1/9), Sioux City (1/20), and Tucson (1115).

        Child Care -- Announcement Reponse: The response from the Hill, the Governors,
and the advocates to the child care announcement was extremely positive, and the press has been
generally favorable. Congressional Democrats and some moderate Republicans have
enthusiastically supported the package. The response from state officials has been very positive;
Governors have particularly praised the state flexibility within the plan. Children's advocates
and child care experts have been very supportive, stating that this is an historic investment and a
thoughtful, balanced package. Conservative groups and Members have criticized the initiative
on two grounds: first, as too big and somewhat unnessary given the amount spent on child care
already during welfare reform; and second, because it does nothing to help parents who want to
stay at home to care for their children. You asked about an op-ed by David Blankenhorn in the
December 19th New York Times, which criticizes tax cuts for child care and which supports
expanding the child tax credit to help parents of young children stay at home. Our general
response to this criticism is that your record reflects your commitment to provide real choice and
opportunities for families. The balanced budget agreement last year included $80 billion over
five years for a $500 per child child tax credit, a strong commitment to help parents who stay at
home. In addition, you have championed the Family and Medical Leave Act, the Earned Income
Tax Credit, increases in the minimum wage, and health insurance for children. We examined
expanding the child tax credit for parents of young children. According to the Treasury
Department, an additional tax credit of $250 for parents of children aged zero to three would cost
roughly $6.5 billion over five years, while an additional tax credit of $500 for parents of children
zero to one would cost roughly $5 billion over five years. Because of its expense, we did not
include an expansion of the child tax credit in the child care initiative, but are open to such
proposals in our discussions with Members of Congress during the budget process.


                                                 2
light of a recent report in the Washington Post that some college students on welfare are
dropping out of school because they can't meet the welfare law's work requirements and keep up
with their studies. You asked specifically about work-study jobs. Under the welfare law,
education that is not directly related to ajob does not count toward the work requirements.
However, states have significant flexibility to allow college students to continue their studies,
since the percentage of the welfare population that is required to work is now 30% and peaks at
50%. Further, many college students not on welfare combine work with their studies.
However, some states are apparently not making it a priority to help welfare recipients stay in
college, although there are no precise numbers. Also, many welfare recipients are not
well-informed about how the law works, and may believe there is no alternative to dropping out.

         At our direction, Secretaries Riley and Shalala wrote to the nation's college presidents in
September, explaining the law's flexibility, and noting that work-study jobs are one good way to
meet the law's work requirements while remaining on campus. (Most work-study jobs are 10
hours per week, but that is by practice rather than a legal requirement, which was explained in
the letter.) We have as you know also asked college presidents to use work-study jobs for
America Reads, but we believe it can be a good alternative in the welfare reform context as well.

        Welfare Reform--Delaware Releases Evaluation: On Monday, Governor Carper
released an evaluation of the state's welfare reform waiver program called A Better Chance. The
program began in 1995 as one of the first comprehensive statewide waivers granted by this
Administration. Initial results encouraging: by the fourth quarter after the program started,
program participants had 24% higher employment, 16% higher earnings, and 18% lower average
benefits than the control group. The evaluation found a relatively high rate of sanctioning: 49%
of the participants had been sanctioned at least once for either failing to comply with the
program's employment or family responsibility (immunization, school attendance) requirements.
State officials characterized the sanctions as tough but fair. The study also found that while
participants broadly understood the new policies, they did not fully understand the details. For
example, 84% knew benefits were time-limited, but only 27% knew about the initial limit of24
months. The study, by Abt Associates, involved random assignment into control and
experimental groups in 5 of the state's 18 offices during the first 18 months of the program,
beginning in October 1995. NOTE: Delaware's caseloads have not gone down as dramatically
as a number of othf;r states--the decline has been 21 % since January 1993. This may be because
the program has a 'make work pay' incentive that allows recipients to keep more earnings and still
remain eligible for welfare.

        Welfare Reform -- Child Support Computer. Systems: We are now working closely
with a House-Senate group convened by Rep. Clay Shaw's staff on the child support computer
systems issue you discussed with Senator Feinstein this fall. Our goal is to put in place a new
system of penalties which are large enough to ensure states develop the statewide computer
systems needed to locate and withhold child support from deadbeat parents, but penalties that are
not so large as to disrupt states' child support collection efforts. As you know, current law


                                                 3
support computer system -- a penalty we intend to retain (at least as a threat) for egregious cases.
 Shaw's initial proposal, which we think makes sense, would impose an initial penalty of 4
percent of federal child support funds in the first year, with higher penalties in later years. Once
a state's system is complete, it could earn back a portion of the penalty. Shaw wants to
introduce legislation the first day of Congress and pass it through the House by the second week
of February. As always, the Senate is expected to move more slowly, but we expect to be able
to enact these new rules by April. By then, HHS expects nine states to still be without statewide
computer systems, which were required by the 1988 Family Support Act (California, Michigan,
Illinois, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Indiana, Hawaii, Oregon, and New Mexico).

        Welfare Reform -- Report on Involving Males in Preventing Teen Pregnancy: On
Wednesday, the Urban Institute released a report on why and how young men should be involved
in teen pregnancy prevention efforts. The report includes a new analysis of the 1995 National
Survey of Adolescent Males (most recent available data) and finds that, contrary to stereotypes,
males playa key role in preventing teen pregnancy and this role can be increased. For example,
most males in the study believe preventing pregnancy is their responsibility and express a desire
to use contraceptives, but don't do so consistently. The encouraging news is that behavior can
change--condom use among adolescent males doubled between 1979 and 1988, and continued to
increase through the 1990s.

        The report also profiles 24 programs that have successfully involved young men (though
there are not yet rigorous evaluations to prove whether, once involved, the programs successfully
changed male behavior). Lessons from the 24 programs include: know community and client
needs, include male staff as positive role models and to put teens at ease, integrate efforts with a
larger agenda offering employment, training or recreation, tailor messages to the audience's
developmental needs, offer services over a sufficient time to gain trust and develop lasting
interest, avoid negative stereotypes and encourage positive change, and accept young men as they
are. The report makes several policy recommendations: create a national information
clearinghouse for program planners, start rigorous evaluations to learn whether programs alter
young men's behavior, and provide more funding for innovative approaches.

        Immigration -- Skills ofImmigrants: The attached U.S. News article discusses the
issue of whether we should change our legal immigration system to strengthen preferences for
skilled and well-educated prospective immigrants over those that are poorly educated and
unskilled. The current immigration system is set up to favor keeping families intact. Thus, the
vast number of legal immigrants are brought to this country through family-based visas, which do
not take into account education or skill level. The article cites a Rand study proposal to create a
point system of immigration which continues to give weight to immediate family reunification
but would also give points for education, language skills, and work experience. The final report
of the Commission on Immigration Reform also recommends a shift in priority toward higher
skilled immigrants. Instead creating a point system, the Commission recommends revising
skill-based admissions (approximately 100,000 visas) to favor highly-skilled and educated


                                                 4




    immigrants and eliminating altogether the category of unskilled workers. Though we think that
    these ideas are well worth exploring, it is unlikely that Congress will want to consider an
    overhaul of legal immigration this year. Efforts to reduce legal immigration levels were
    defeated during consideration of the 1996 illegal immigration law.

             Education -- California Math Standards: There has been a heated debate in
    California over the proposed math standards, pitting the math educators who favor a major
    emphasis on problem solving skills and who downplay the importance of basic computational
    skills (in both their documents and their rhetoric) against conservative critics who favor a more
    basic skills approach. Last month the California State Board of Education adopted the more
    conservative approach, over the objections of State Superintendent Delaine Eastin. Last month,
    the head of the Education Directorate at the National Science Foundation sent an letter to the
    Chair of the California State Board of Education strongly criticizing the state board's decision,
    and strongly implying that this decision would jeopardize continued NSF funding for six Urban
    Systemic Improvement sites in California. The letter has caused much consternation among
    conservatives as an example of inappropriate federal intrusion in state curriculum matters (which
    it was), and we had clear signals from Checker Finn, Diane Ravitch and others that the NSF letter
    would provide the pretext for Bill Bennet (who has received a fair amount of criticism from
    conservatives for his support of your national testing initiative) to withdraw his support. This
    week DPC and OSTP worked with NSF to produce a letter from NSF Director Lane to the
    California State Board clarifying that it is the job of states to set standards and that NSF would
    not pull the award based on California's math standards, and emphasizing the importance of
    basic skills. Based on recent conversations with Finn and others, we believe this step has been
    sufficient to prevent Bennett's reversal.

             Education -- Education Week Report on Urban Education: This week Education
    Week issued its annual report on education reform in the 50 states, focusing on the progress in
    urban school districts. The study noted that approximately 40% of students in urban districts
    reached the basic level on the most recent NAEP 4th grade reading and 8th grade math and
    science exams in 1994 and 1996, compared to over 60% in each of these subjects in non-urban
    areas. The study also found discrepancies in resources, with urban districts spending about $500
    less per child annually than non-urban districts. The Education Week issue also discussed, in
    detail, a dozen promising reform strategies being pursued to raise achievement in districts around
    the nation (e.g., setting high standards; holding schools accountable for results and giving
    schools greater flexibility; creating small, more intimate schools or schools-within-schools;
    recruiting well prepared teachers and providing them with continuing training and support;
    training principals to be effective school leaders; and, promoting school choice). Your existing
    and planned initiatives (including the new Education Opportunity Zones proposal that you
    announced in December) match up very well to support most of these key areas.

           Education -- Single Sex Schools in New York City: DPC has been meeting with the
    White House Counsel's office, the Education and Justice Departments, to address the OCR
    response to a complaint against the existence of the all girl's Women's Leadership Academy in


                                                    5


    New York City. Both you and Secretary Riley are in complete agreement that, as a matter of
    policy, school districts should be (encouraged??? free???) to establish single sex schools as part
    of the mix of education options. The Office of Civil Rights has placed its investigation of the
    compliant on hold, and will take no steps in the foreseeable future to press New York City to
    change the status of the school. However, civil rights offices in both Education and Justice
    believe that such schools ultimately may be difficult to justify under Title IX or Article (relevant
    Constitutional reference), in part because they have discriminatory admissions policies, and
    partly because separate schools will inevitably become unequal and to the ultimate disadvantage
    of females. They believe that the strongest legal case for permitting single sex schools is an
    argument that they are an appropriate remedy for past discrimination, such as low academic
    performance of females in co-educational settings. Neither of the cognizant Civil Rights
    offices want to take formal action on this issue, because they believe they will be forced to
    oppose single-sex schools.

           Late in December, Secretary Riley and Rudy Crew agreed to appoint small teams of
    educators from the Education Department and the NYC Schools to work collaboratively to
    develop the strongest case for the Women's Leadership Academy. The teams will begin to plan
    their work next week. This process may take some time, and during this period the Education
    Department's Office of Civil Rights will not take any further actions on this case.

            Education -- Life-long learning card: You had asked us to respond to Bob Reich's
    proposal to you concerning Life-long learning cards, which would allow all federal education
    benefits (Pell, IRA's education tax credits and deductions as well as job-training funds) to be
    consolidated on one card, like a bank card, against which education expenses could be credited.
    DPC and NEC staff have begun to look into this issue. While we think this is an idea with some
    promise, we do not yet have specific recommendations. The Education Department has already
    initiated a feasibility study on the use of cards for student aid delivery, with the aim of initiating a
    pilot project with postsecondary schools to have their students receive federal aid disbursements
    through such cards, by October 2000, though this may be an optimistic estimate of when such a
    pilot program could begin. Further, while this may be an effective approach to delivery grants
    and loans, we believe it will be much more difficult to incorporate tax credits and deductions as
    well. DPC and NEC will continue to explore this issue.

    [Elena--I'm sharing this one with Bob Shireman and Anne Lewis, so NEC and DPC wind up
    saying the same thing]
