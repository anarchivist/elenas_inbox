TEXT:
Apparently the press conference is at 10:00 am Monday, and they want to be
able to read from the President's statement then.

Here are some changes I would suggest to Tom's version:

I congratulate the representatives of public health and tobacco producer
organizations communities for their working together in promoting to
promote bipartisan, comprehensive tobacco effective legislation that to re
duce disease caused by tobacco products dramatically reduces youth smoking
and protects American farmers and their communities. Their efforts are a
step in the right direction towards enacting bipartisan, comprehensive
tobacco legislation.  I am firmly committed that tobacco legislation
protect farmers and their communities, and have made this commitment one
of the five key elements that I will insist upon before signing tobacco
control legislation.  I hope you will continue your efforts to expand your
coalition and to enact comprehensive tobacco legislation this year.

Subject:         Draft Statement for Monday Press Conf.

Scott Ballin from the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids called today asking


if the President could give a statement to be read at their press
conference with farmers and public health groups announcing their core
principles. There are no members invited.   I'll drop off the Campaign's
draft release for the press conference.  Attached is a draft statement.

I've talked to Ford and Robb's offices, as well as OPL and USDA who are
fine with doing it.  I also talked to the NC Farm Bureau which didn't sign
on.  The Farm Bureau wasn't really against the coalition and principles,
and wouldn't be unhappy if we gave a general statement of support. They
didn't sign on because they think the principles should include immunity
and they are worried that the public health groups may end up in a
different place then farmers so they "don't want to get in bed now."

The main objection I can think of might be from Lugar (the principles come
out in favor of continuing a tobacco program, he doesn't).   But the
statement I've attached would just applaud the coalition for working
together and trying to get a bill, I don't think we need to say more than
that.  I talked about it with Tarplin and he thought the attached
statement would be fine.
