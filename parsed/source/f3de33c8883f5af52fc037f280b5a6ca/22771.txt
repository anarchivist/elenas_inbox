 EDC-14.        AFFORDABLE HOUSING

 14.4           Programs Serving the Homeless

 Summary

 The NGA supports the combining of the seven programs authorized by the Stewart B. McKinney
 Homeless Assistance Act into a block grant to state and local goveniments.

 Analysis

 The Administration does not support this proposal. While the Administration supported the
 notion of performance-based block grants six years ago, HUD has now administratively
 consolidated the various McKinney Act programs -- as has the Appropriations Committee. The
 Continuum of Care provides a coordinated community approach to homelessness in moving
 persons into jobs and permanent housing. Each community submits a single Continuum of Care
 plans to HUD that reflects efforts to address the complexities of homelessness through a range of
 housing and services. These plans are prepared by the private sector, non-profit groups, and
 local and state governments working together. HUD then determines which individual projects
 to fund from these plans. The Administration is committed to furthering the benefits of the
 Continuum of Care. The FY2000 budget provides $1.125 billion in homeless assistance -- more
 than a 15 percent increase from the $975 million enacted last year.


 EDC-6.         THE ROLE OF STATES, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, AND INDIAN
                TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS WITH RESPECT TO INDIAN GAMING AND
                OTHER ECONOMIC ISSUES.

 The committee proposes the reaffirmation for six months of existing policy EDC-6, "The Role of
 States, the Federal Government, and Indian Tribal Governments with Respect to Indian Gaming
 and Other Economic Issues." The NGA proposes to permit its Committee on Economic
 Development and Commerce review the policy for necessary changes to be considered at the
 1999 NGA Annual Meeting. While recognizing the sovereignty of Tribal governments, the
 NGA proposes changes to the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988 (lGRA) which would
 clarify the role of states and tribal governments in negotiating gaming issues.

 6.2.1   Clarification of the Scope of Gaming

 Summary

          The NGA seeks amendments to IGRA that make clear that tribes can negotiate to operate
. gambling of the same types and subject to the same restrictions that apply to all other gambling
  in the state. The NGA believes that governors should not be compelled by federal law to
  negotiate for gambling activities or devices that are not expressly authorized by state law.
                            Hex-Dump Conversion
Analysis

        The Administration has taken the position in court filings that a State has no duty under
IGRA to negotiate with a Tribe with respect to particular Class III (casino-type) gaming that State
law completely and affirmatively prohibits. However, the Administration has never taken a
position as to what the outcome should be if a type of gaming is neither expressly prohibited nor
expressly authorized.

6.2.2   Application of the "Good Faith" Negotiation Standard

Summary

         The NGA would like to amend IGRA to apply the "good faith" negotiation standard in
tribal-state compacts to tribes as well as states.

Analysis

        While the Administration has never articulated a position on whether the "good faith"
negotiation standard should apply to tribes as it does for states, the legislative history indicates
that the "good faith" standard was added to address the issue of unequal bargaining power
between states and tribes.

6.2.3   Regulatory Oversight

Summary

        The NGA believes that in many cases, federally imposed minimum regulatory standards
for the operation of tribal gambling facilities may be appropriate.

Analysis

        The Administration agrees that certain federal minimum standards are necessary.

6.3     The Effect of the Seminole Decision on the Authority of the Secretary of the U.S.
        Department of the Interior

Summary

        The NGA opposes the Department of the Interior promulgating a rule permitting the
Secretary to provide a remedy to a tribe to permit Class III gaming in the event that the State and
the tribe are unable to reach agreement and the State then raises immunity as a bar to a suit by the
tribe.

Analysis
                               Hex-Dump Conversion

        The Administration disagrees that the Secretary of the Interior has no authority to create
an administrative compact process. While there is a Congressional moratorium on Interior
promulgating its rule before March 31, 1999, it is likely that the Interior rule finally issued after
that time will authorize the Secretary to create an administrative compact process.

6.4     Federal Enforcement

. Summary

        The NGA wants the federal government to actively use existing IGRA enforcement
authority to shut down Class III gaming conducted on Indian lands in violation of or in the
absence of a tribal-state compact:

Analysis

       The Administration agrees with federal enforcement of unlawful gaming consistent with
the Attorney General's tribal gaming enforcement policy.

6.5     The Governors' Role in Congressional and Other Federal Decisionmaking

Summary

       The NGA believes that in cases where a new tribe becomes federally recognized, there
should be the concurrence of the Governor of the state in which the tribe is located.

Analysis

       The Administration opposes the concurrence. of states in the process for providing federal
recognition to tribes. This function has historically been the sole purview of the federal
government. Furthermore, under current procedures, states are permitted to comment on
whether a tribe should be federally recognized.

6.5.1   Trust Land Acquisition for Gambling Purposes and
6.5.2   Trust Land Acquisition in General

Summary

        The NGA seeks the commitment to preserve the current required concurrence of a state to
acquire land in trust for gambling purposes. In addition, the NGA seeks state concurrence when
land is taken into trust for nongaming purposes.

Analysis

      The Administration generally supports state concurrence in trust land acquisition for
gambling purposes. However, the Administration opposes gubernatorial concurrence on
                         Hex-Dump CClnnnion
nongaming trust acquisitions. This is the subject of a proposed rulemaking to be submitted to
OMB in the Spring of 1999. The proposed rule will somewhat ease the burdens required to take
land into trust for nongaming purposes, but will increase the requirements for consultation with
third parties and will provide for a showing of demonstrated need for acquiring land into trust for
gaming purposes.

6.5.2.1 State and Local Taxation Authority Over New Trust Lands

Summary

       The NGA seeks a requirement that before new trust land is acquired, the federal
government, the state, and the tribe should reach an agreement regarding the application of state
and local taxes on the land.

Analysis

       The Administration opposes state and local taxation of new trust land.
