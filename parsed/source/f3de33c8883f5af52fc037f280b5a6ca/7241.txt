TEXT:
Can we get guidance on the Unz Initiative and bilingual education.
possible by 11:30 a.m. today for guidance?

Tomorrow, the board of the Nat'l Assoc. of Hispanic Journalists will be
here for meetings with Mickey Ibarra, Judy Winston and Mike McCurry.  The
issue is bound to come up.

Mickey tells me we will probably come out opposed to Prop. 227, but POTUS
may not announce until May 5th. What shal we say in the interim?
Additionally, we need guidance on Admin position on bilingual ed
overall ... we are for it right? aren't we proposing an increase for bil.
ed programs in our budget? Thank you very much.
