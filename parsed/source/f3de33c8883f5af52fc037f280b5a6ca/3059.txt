TEXT:
The VP is attending the National Conference of State Legislators in Phila.
so the President will not speak to them.  This opens up greater
possibilities for the DLC Conference. Also, Margie from the DLC said that
Al From spoke to Erskine yesterday about the conference proposal and
Erskine said that it would "have to happen."
