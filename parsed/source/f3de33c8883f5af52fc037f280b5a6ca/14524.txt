TEXT:
Next Wednesday night, the FLOTUS will be speaking to the leadership of the
prayer breakfast group about welfare-to-work. Melanne wondered if you
could put together talking points on the specific things that churches and
other religious organizations can do -- more specific than what the POTUS
said already. She could say this is what some of you are doing, and more
could do it or you could do x, or y, or z.

I understand Lyn is already working on this.    Is this doable?
