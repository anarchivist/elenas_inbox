                                   Senate Republican Crime Bill
                                      Questions and Answers
                                          March 20, 1999


    Q:   Yesterday, Senate Hatch and other Republicans unveiled an omnibus crime bill, the
         21st Century Justice Act, and accused the Administration of cutting funds to law
         enforcement. What is your reaction to it?

    A:   While we have not had a chance to review Senator Hatch's bill in detail, we already know
         that we have one very serious concern: like the Republican budget resolution, the Hatch
         Bill proposes cutting the President's community policing program (COPS) by about $1
         billion. As you know, COPS has provided funds to over 11,000 communities to hire
         more than 92,000 police officers. It has helped spread community policing methods to
         thousands of police departments across the country, and it has been credited by countless
         law enforcement officials as one of the key reasons for the significant reduction in the
         crime rate over the past 6 years. We simply won't go along with Senator Hatch's
         attempt to dismantle this program. Indeed, the President's crime bill will propose
         extending the COPS program by: putting up to 50,000 more police on the street; funding
         new crime fighting technologies for police departments; hiring more local prosecutors to .
         work with police; and helping to engage the entire community -- including principals,
         pastors, and parents -- in the fight against crime.

         In other respects, most of the Hatch bill is not new. It reauthorizes a series of state and
         local crime programs, many of which we support. And it includes a number of old
         proposals on juvenile crime and drugs, which we will continue to discuss and debate on
         the merits.

         As for the recent criticisms by Senator Hatch and other Republicans on the President's
         law enforcement budget, we will let the record speak for itself. Since 1993, the Justice
         Department's budget has essentially doubled, and funding for state and local law
         enforcement has increased by more than 500%. There can be no question that this
         Administration has provided unprecedented support for law enforcement at all levels --
         state, local and federal. By contrast, this year's Republican budget proposal, on top of
         cutting the entire COPS program, would provide 12 percent less than the President's
         budget for Administration of Justice programs.
