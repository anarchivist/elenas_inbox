TEXT:

OMB and others have mentioned that you apparently are taking
Marvin's place on the English-only issue.   I don't know what sort
of transitional info Marvin gave you, but I wanted to know that as
a result of our interagency meetings on this subject I have a lot
of material on this (supplemented by papers from various groups) .
If you would like any of this, let me know.
Also FYI, I should have general talking points finalized on the
issue for tomorrow.
Thanks.
