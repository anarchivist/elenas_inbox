Subject:

Gov Chiles will be in DC tomorrow and is looking to set up a call with you
to discuss the anticipated FICA ruling.  I have been attempting to
convince him that a decfsion is forthcoming and a call is not necessary.
He has not accepted this response and is seeking a more firm and higher
level guarantee.
