TEXT:
My recollection from our last meeting was that Elena was to pull together
a meeting (and let my office know when, in case I had time to stop by)
with leg and opl and others who would have an opinion about who should be
advised of our problem with naturalization and how we propose to deal with
it--basically I wanted a plan for when we would gfo public with this,
especially in light of what INS and Meissner in particular has not been
saying. Has that taken place? If not, I don't see the purpose of us
getting together this pm--if Michael you have something to report from
your conversations with INS and DOJ, email is fine for me, unless you
think we really need a meeting.  I hope that this clarifies what we were
meeting about.l
