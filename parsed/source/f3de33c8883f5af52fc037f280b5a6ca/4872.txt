TEXT:
Elena and Jose - the President called Judy Winston earlier to discuss
several points in the weekly report that the Initiative sent to him
regarding the past week's activities. The President also mentioned the
weekly report from Bruce Reed on how policy options.  Judy would like to
see if we can quickly get from you a copy of this report (I presume this
is your regular weekly report which includes a section on Race Initiative
activities as suggested last week by Erskine Bowles).  If possible, I
would like to give this to Judy this afternoon.  We should also work out a
mechanism for us to receive the information from you on a weekly basis.
Thanks
