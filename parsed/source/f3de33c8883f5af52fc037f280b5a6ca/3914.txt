Three comments:

1} Please attach a copy of the CEA Weekly Econ Briefing you reference in
Item #1.  It gives him context to see what he asked you.  If you don't
have it, give Anna in my office the date and she can get it.

2} Under Item #3 at the end, you don't need to "propose" an interagency
working group on child support enforcement -- POTUS doesn't need to
approve it. You should just say "we will be establishing." It's a minor
point but he shouldn't feel he needs to respond to you.

3} Same kind of point under Item #4, although I don't feel as strongly
about it.  Speeches are written for him and I don't think you need to
"suggest" what he should announce -- I think you can just say "you will be
annnouncing ... xyz"

Get it over here as soon as you can.   Thanks.
