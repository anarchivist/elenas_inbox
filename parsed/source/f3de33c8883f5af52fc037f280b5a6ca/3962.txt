TEXT:
Elena: We are putting together actions (building blocks) for the S&T
pillar on science and math education, research on racism (understanding it
and dealing with it), and children's issues. Since your office might be
working on similar actions, thought you might want to coordinate OSTP/DPC
offerings. Please let me know how you want to proceed.   Cliff
