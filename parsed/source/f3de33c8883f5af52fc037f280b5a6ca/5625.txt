TEXT:
Here are some questions to be discussed during Monday's MLK day meeting.
Please forward them to your bos·s if appropriate.  If anyone sees a
compelling reason why the town hall could not occur on MLK day, please·
e-mail Sylvia and cc me as soon as possible. Otherwise, the most likely
scenario will involve service events by POTUS and/or other principals and
cabinet members possibly with a town hall meeting sometime during the same
day.

        Does anyone see any con's with having a town hall on that day?
Would anyone argue that the town hall would be too focused on our
differences than coming together? Is it more conflict vs. healing?

        Does DPC or NEC have any policy announcements that can tie in with
MLK?
        Tie in with SOTU ramp-up?

POTUS has a definite desire to do service event. Should it be in.the
District? If he were to go to another city would he not catch criticism
for ignoring needs in his own back yard08? If not, what cities have some
appropriate events/programs?


Rev. Jackson-Wall Street event--what is the fallout, if any, if POTUS
does not participate? Would the event go on without him? Is there an
appropriate surrogate for P?

                Any requests from key Members of Congress?

                Mayors, Governors, etc.?

Are there any built-in "traditional" observances (Ben Johnson) which could
be combined with service somewhere?   Are they primarily morning,
afternoon, or evening events?
                        African-American church
                        Lincoln Memorial


                National Service
                Is there a tie-in with General Powell/America's Promise?
·
    What are the pitfalls/downside to doing an event with him? Any other
    outsiders to include?
                    Since the President is very high on service theme, if he
    were to end up doing town hall and not service, 1) how big of a problem
    would this be; 2) if ok, we will still need a strong presence by the
    Cabinet doing service.

    What events are currently on the board for PIR? What are the specific
    events in which cities?

            Activities of other principals
                    What are the existing plans by VP, HRC, MEG (Jen Palmieri)?


    These are many of the questions which we will try to bring together on
    Monday. Thanks. Again, if there are any major problems with town hall
    being scheduled on MLK day, please express those to Sylvia ASAP so thlt
    she can incorporate them into the decision on town hall scheduling.
