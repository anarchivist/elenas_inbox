TEXT:
Peter/Elena:
According to Steve M., Doris told Michael Deich that Abraham would be
willing to strongly support our efforts to remove INS reform from CJS if
we give him something on HIB. We need to consider, I suppose, whether we
want the INS reform discussion to be part of what we are doing on HIB.   I
am both unsure what Abraham is giving by supporting our INS reform efforts
 (he already has made st~tements that this should be done by authorizers
(him) and not through the appropriations process) and what else we can giv
e up in the HIB negotiation (we have already made lots of concessions to
Abraham and the business community).   I have mentioned this to Ceci for
her to solicit Gene's input, as well.
