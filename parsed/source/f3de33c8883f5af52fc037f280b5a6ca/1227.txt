           WELFARE REFORM AND THE FAIR LABOR STANDARDS ACT


        As the work requirements of the new welfare law begin to go into effect, a critical
question for both the labor movement and the states is whether worker protection
laws -- particularly the minimum wage law (Fair Labor Standards Act) -- protect welfare
recipients who take part in workfare or subsidized employment programs. The DPC and
OMB have been running an interagency process (involving DOL, HHS, USDA, and others)
to hammer out an answer to this question. We expect to have a detailed recommendation
for the President within the next week, as well as a strategy for rolling out this
controversial Administration policy. We believe there are advantages to announcing a
decision regarding the Fair Labor Standards Act and privatization at the same time
because the overall package will look balanced, favoring neither labor nor the states too
much.

       There is general agreement among the agencies, as a matter of both law and policy,
that the Fair Labor Standards Act should be read to require payment of at least the
minimum wage to most people in workfare and wage supplementation programs. On this
reading, participants in such programs would count as "employees" under the Act, thus
qualifying for minimum wage protection -- except for a few who would count as "trainees"
instead. Bruce has given the AFL private assurances that the Administration will adopt
this basic position.

        Requiring the minimum wage for workfare recipients, however, will raise obvious
difficulties for the states, in light of the new welfare law's work provisions. Even if a
recipient is working only 20 hours each week, the existing welfare grant in many states will
fall short of a minimum wage salary. As the work requirement in the law increases to 25
and then to 30 hours, and as the minimum wage also increases, more and more states will
discover that their welfare grants are insufficient.

       One way to mitigate this new burden on the states is to count benefits other than
cash assistance toward the minimum wage. There is a very strong legal argument, based
on provisions in the food stamp law, that states may add the value of food stamps to the
basic welfare grant for purposes of complying with the minimum wage. Even if both these
streams of benefits are counted, however, a number of Southern states will immediately
come up short, and as the minimum wage increases and the work requirements become
more severe, other states will join them over time. Allowing states to count the value of
other benefits -- child care, housing, or transportation -- toward the minimum wage would
remove this problem, but this proposal raises a number of legal and policy questions.
DPC and OMB are currently working through these and similar issues with the affected
agencies in an effort to apply the minimum wage law to working welfare recipients without
imposing large new costs on states. If the Republican majority in Congress is unhappy
with our decision, they could react by passing and sending to the President a measure to
exempt the new welfare law from the Fair Labor Standards Act or to require certain

                                                                                        3/9/97

benefits to count towards the minimum wage.


        The interagency group also is reviewing what other labor protections apply to
welfare recipients in workfare or subsidized employment programs. The consensus view
is that OSHA, unemployment insurance, and anti-discrimination laws will apply in the
same way they do for other workers. We have yet to get a firm opinion from Treasury as
to whether the monies paid to these welfare recipients will be subject to FICA and other
taxes, as well as eligible for the EITC, but we believe they will not. Finally, these workers
may well become eligible to unionize. Recent newspaper articles have suggested that some
unions will undertake large-scale organizing efforts targeting welfare recipients, and we
probably should expect some of these efforts to succeed.

                        STATE FLEXIBILITY TO PRIVATIZE
                      WELFARE, FOOD STAMPS, AND MEDICAID


       The new welfare law explicitly allows states to administer and provide Temporary
Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) through contracts with private entities. Now, two states
(Texas and Wisconsin) are seeking federal approval to contract out certain functions of the Food
Stamp and Medicaid programs as well. Organized labor is concerned that privatizing these
government functions will displace state and local government workers and will undermine
beneficiary rights to due process and confidentiality.

       The DPC and OMB have been running an interagency process (involving the
Departments of Agriculture, HHS, Labor, and OPM) to consider these requests. The group has
concluded that legally:

       ·   The T ANF law explicitly allows contracting to private organizations;

       ·   The Food Stamp law says "certification" must be completed by "merit system
           employees." Allowing private contracting in the Food Stamp program would require
           the Administration to waive or seek legislative changes to portions of the
           Intergovernmental Personnel Act, which is administered by the Office of Personnel
           Management; and

       ·   The Medicaid law forbids the State agency responsible for Medicaid from delegating
           authority to non-governmental entities to "exercise administration discretion in the
           administration or supervision of the plan." The Administration has sought a
           legislative change -- in its current and last year's Medicaid budget proposals -- which
           would allow states to delegate such authority.

        Thus, we believe we can allow privatization for all three programs and it is our current
policy is to allow it for T ANF and Medicaid. Currently, most states have one-stop
government-run eligibility centers, in which one worker determines eligibility for TANF, Food
Stamps, and Medicaid. If we do not allow private contracting in Food Stamps, then states will
be discouraged from contracting out T ANF and Medicaid eligibility, to avoid forcing some
individuals to go to one location to apply for TANF and Medicaid and another for Food Stamps.
