TEXT:
What do you think about inviting a small bipartisan group of Govs to
participate in release of TANF rule? Possible candidates might be:
Thompson, Engler, Carper, O'Bannon, Whitman. We're going to discuss
general roll-out strategies with HHS today, but wanted to get your general
reaction on this.
