TEXT:
Although still in the decision process       the following may happen and I
just wanted to give you heads up --

The Senate and House are planning a Medicare event for the 18th -- we were
planning to roll-out USA Accounts -- after meeting w/ the Senate and House
message staff on Friday -- John thinks it may make more sense to do a
joint Medicare event w/ House/Senate. This would mean moving USA Accounts
-- John wants to talk w/ Gene -- decision is not likely until Monday but
wanted to let you know what the thinking is currently

Also, the Senate/House are planning a Patients' Bill of Rights event on
the last day of the recess April 9 -- we agreed to do something w/ them
--- they would be organizing district events --

Finally, Patients' is being mocked -up on the 17th --- according to the
AFL-CIO Kennedy has another plan for amendments etc.  --- given how
skilled his amendment strategy was for Ed Flex -- we should probably talk
about this in the 8:30 -- what do you think?
