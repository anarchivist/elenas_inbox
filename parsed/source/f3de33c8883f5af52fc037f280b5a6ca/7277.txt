TEXT:
As Todd mentioned earlier, Mr. McAffrey has been seeking to place op-eds
in leading papers apparently arguing that needle exchange programs take
advantage of African.Americans and Latinos. We understand the Wall Street
Journal is going to print it on Monday.  We don't know if it's going in
under his signature or someone else's.

This is just not right.  The statement released by Maxine Waters, and the
letter to the President from the CBC, criticize McAffrey's role in this.
An op-ed is only going to inflame the racial divisiveness.  Help!!!
