 TEXT:
 Attached is the next version of the class size memo.  It makes most of
 Elena's edits, and it includes a new section at the end showing options
 for reducing the cost.  I fear/suspect that the way it is laid out will
 invite the selection of the lowest cost option. Let me know if you think I
 either need to change how these are presented, or include some kind of pro
 and con discussion of the options.

 I indicated in the memo that I'm still uncomfortable with--actually, I'm
 opposed to--the idea of requiring districts to have a procedure for
 getting rid of failing teachers.  Let me layout why, and what I propose
 we do instead:

 Why a provision on getting rid of bad teachers is a bad idea.
 1. We are really stepping over a federal intrustion/micromanagement line
 here, especially if we try to do this well:    Unless we are going to
 simply allow districts to check a box and promise that they have an
 evaulation system in place (which they already to, though most of them are
 terrible) that enables them to fire incompetent teachers, we are going to
 wind up having to approve the design of key parts of local personnel
 systems. This is the wrong role for the federal government,    and we don't
 have the capacity for doing this even if we want to.

 Further, coupling class size reductions with firing bad teachers puts in
 one proposal two components that are in fact intrusive on what are local
 responsibilities--the shape of the local school budget, and the nature of
 their personnel policies. In the main, we have spent the last 5 years
 making sure that federal education programs given out on a formula basis
 to all school districts have fewer strings and greater accountability for
 results. This moves in the other direction.

 2. On political grounds, we complicate our lives in three ways":   First,
 while the public at large may well like a tough stance on incompetent
 teachers, this is one initiative that is going to be so popular that we
 don't need to add anything just for the purposes of making it more
 attractive. The public will resonate with the idea of smaller classes
 whether we get tough on teachers or not.

 Second, it will indeed cause problems with AFT and NEA--partly because of
 the tough rhetoric, and partly because of design issues.   Sandy and Bob
 are indeed ok (though not always thrilled) with tough talk on firing bad
 teachers. They use that rhetoric with their members to promote
 union/school board partnerships to get rid of failing teachers, along the
 lines of ones in place in Toledo, NYC, Cincinnati and other places. But
 union involvement is key to them, and key to their ability to sell it to
 their members.  I can't imagine us proposing a failing teachers req


uirement that also requires the unions to be involved--it wouldn't look
tough any more in the abstract; it would automatically cause problems in
southern states where unions have a limited role, and it would start a
nationwidefight between the unions and the local school boards, which
can't possibly help any of us.

Third, we will invite a Republican "federal intrusion" attack; even while
they might like the tough stance, we will give ammunition to those who
want to claim that the feds are trying to take over local education.

Here is what we should do instead:
1. Stick with the tough rhetoric and accountability requirements in the
education zones proposal. Because this is a competitive program rather
than a formula funded program, we will avoid both the design and political
issues around federal intrusion. And it leaves the unions free to work
with their districts on this issue--in fact, it encourges them to do this.

 2. Further developthe proposal we already have in the class size memo to
 require states to have a performance-based way of determing if new
 teachers are equipped to teach reading in the early grades. This means
 that they will need some kind of test , serious classroom observation or
 a combination of the two.   We need to give states a few years to get
 this in place, but it will enable us to say that we are requiring states
 to make beginning teachers prove they've got the knowledge and skills to
 get the job done, or they won't be allowed in the classroom.

3. Begin a serious discussion with Chase and Feldman over how we and they
combat the expected Republican attacks and efforts to paint them as the
protectors of low quality in the system. We should approch the political
challenge here along the lines of what we are doing with the Hispanic
community for the California bilingual education initiative--consult with
them about a shared political challenge while retaining our options for
independent action. And we should push them hard both the strengthen their
own efforts to promote teacher accountability, and to support any new
steps we choose to take.==================== ATTACHMENT   1 ====================

MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:


SUBJECT:       Proposed Class Size Reduction Initiative

We are proposing for consideration in the FY 1999 Budget a $9.2 billion, 5-year initiative to
improve early reading by reducing class size in grades 1 and 2 from a national average of 22.5, to
a maximum of 18, and by taking the steps necessary to ensure that all teachers in those grades
have the knowledge and skills necessary to teach reading effectively in small classes.

Reducing class size has long been an important goal for parents and teachers throughout the
country. While there are conflicting findings in the research on the impact of lower class size,
two major, well controlled experiments undertaken in the 1980's in Tennessee and Indiana
showed that reducing class size in the· early grades to between 15-18 students has a significant
effect on student achievement. While all students benefit from smaller classes, the effects are
largest for the most disadvantaged -- low-income and minority students in inner cities.

A number of other states are now launching their own class-size reduction initiatives. A
national effort to reduce class size, led by you and structured as a partnership between the federal
government and state and local governments, would help spread this effort nationally. It also
would provide a concrete way to demonstrate your commitment to help all students meet
challenging national standards.

Large scale reductions in class size raise significant issues, especially involving teacher quality.
For example, California's new initiative to reduce class size to 20 in the primary grades has
exacerbated the shortage of fully qualified teachers and, particularly in urban districts, has
resulted in increased hiring of noncertified teachers. It has also increased the need for
professional development for the existing teaching force, in order to help teachers take full
advantage of smaller classes. And many schools have been limited in their ability to reduce
class size because of space limitations in already overcrowded facilities.

Notwithstanding these challenges, the benefits of significant reductions in class size are clear.
In the first year of implementation, many teachers report that smaller classes enable them to pay
greater attention to individual students, to assign and help them with more challenging work, to
communicate more often with parents, and to have less disruptive classes. Many parents echo
these reports, and support for public schools appears to be on the rise throughout the state. And
many schools and districts are finding ways of meeting the challenges of teacher quality and
facilities. They have found effective ways of training new and experienced teachers. Schools
have been willing to purchase portable classrooms or make other changes in how they use
facilities in order to make room for smaller classes.
                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion

The proposal described below is designed. to help states and districts take advantage of the
opportunities afforded by reductions in class size and to respond effectively to the challenges.

Design of the Class Size Reduction Initiative
This initiative aims to reduce class size in the early grades to 18, in order to help all children
leam to read well. To accomplish this objective, this initiative creates a partnership among
federal, state and local governments, with the federal government providing the bulk of the
funding, and states and local school districts retaining the responsibility for designing the
program and achieving the results. It provides funds to improve the quality of teaching as well
as to reduce class size, and it offers substantial flexibility to school districts, including allowing
districts that cannot possibly reach the class size objective due to insufficient space or qualified
teachers, to use other methods to improve reading achievement through other methods. And it
holds school districts accountable for results by tying continued funding to demonstrated learning
gains, thereby providing a strong incentive for schools throughout the country to use practices
that work.

Purpose: The purpose of this initiative is to reduce class size and provide quality teachers in
the early grades, so that all students leam to read independently and well by the end of the 3rd
grade. Specifically, this initiative will help states and local communities hire an additional
89,000 teachers in order to reduce class size in grades 1 & 2 from a nationwide average of 22.5,
to a maximum of 18. At the same time, it will help states and school districts recruit and
prepare new teachers and upgrade the skills of existing teachers in the early grades so they have
the skills necessary to teach reading effectively in small classes.

Funding Stream: The initiative would provide states and local communities with $9.2billion
over 5 years. Funding in the first year would cover the costs of hiring an additional 17,800
teachers, and a similar number would be hired in each succeeding year. Funds would be
distributed to states on a formula basis, taking into account the number of additional teachers
each state would need to reach the class size target, as well as salary differences among the states,
and poverty levels. Within this framework, we are also exploring ways to provide funds directly
to the largest urban areas, as we did in last year's school construction initiative. Funds would
pay for hiring additional teachers, as well as for steps to improve teacher quality, such as
improved preservice training to enhance the supply of qualified new teachers, professional
development, or incentives for qualified teachers to teach in underserved areas. The federal
government would cover 80% of the costs, with state and local communities providing matching
funds for the rest. .


State and Local Plans: States would be required to work with local school districts to develop
a statewide plan for class size reduction. The plan would include a timetable for phasing in
class size reduction, strategies for ensuring that every classroom had a qualified teacher and for
addressing school facility needs, and a plan for financing the state and local share of the costs.
In developing their plans, states and school districts would be encouraged to look first at how
they could reduce class size by making better use of existing staff and resources, including by
reassigning certified staff who are not in classroom teaching positions to the classroom, and by
                                                                          Hex-Dump Conversion
using Title I and other federal funds to reduce class size rather than continue programs that pull
students out of the regular classroom in order to receive extra help.
States and districts would be given considerable flexibility in designing these plans. They would
be permitted to carry over federal funds from one year to the next, enabling jurisdictions with the
need to invest in preparing and training teachers at the front end of the process, and scale up class
size reductions in later years. In cases where the lack of facilities or ·qualified teachers made it
virtually impossible to meet the class-size reduction target, jurisdictions would be able to propose
altemative approaches--such as Reading Recovery or Success for All--to provide intensive, high
quality reading instruction in the early grades.


  Quality Teachers: State and local plans would be required to address teacher quality i~ a
 number of ways. First, the plans would show how states and local districts will work with
  institutions of higher education and others to recruit and adequately prepare the increased
 numbers of teachers they will need. Second, the plans will show how new and experienced
  teachers would be given high quality, sustained professional development focused on effective
 teaching in small groups, on language acquisition, and on effective reading instruction. Third,
  states would be required to show how they will recruit and hire new teachers without increasing
  the percentage of uncertified teachers already in the classroom--thereby placing a floor on the
  quality of teachers to be hired. Fourth, states would be required to commit to establishing
. performance-based teacher certification requirements, at least for teaching in the primary grades,
  so that new teachers would be required to demonstrate the knowledge and skills necessary to
 teach reading effectively in small classroom settings. Finally, we are considering a requirement
  that states and districts demonstrate that they have effective ways of identifying low-performing
  teachers, giving them help and, if necessary, quickly and fairly removing them from the
  classroom. (1 continue to think this is a mistake)

While states and districts will be given great flexibility in how to address these issues, the
Education Department will launch a major effort to disseminate information about best practices
and proven approaches to improving teacher quality and reading achievement.            States and
school districts would use funds from this initiative, as well as state and local funds and funds
from other federal programs, including Title I, America Reads, the Eisenhower Professional
Development program, and Chapter 2, to fund the teacher quality component of the initiative.

Facilities: This initiative will place added burdens on existing facilities, and many school
districts will have difficulty finding adequate space for smaller classes. While states and local
communities continue to have the primary responsibility for addressing this issue, it will be
especially important for the Administration to propose a school construction initiative along with
this proposal, and continue to press the Congress to enact it. In addition, as indicated above, this
initiative will provide schools with the flexibility to adopt other proven approaches for providing
intensive instruction in small groups in order to teach young children to read.

Accountability for Results: Local school districts will be required to evaluate the impact of
their class size reduction initiative on reading achievement, and make midcourse corrections as
needed. If, after 3-4 years a district cannot show significant gains in reading achievement, it

                                                                          Aut~mated Records Management System
                                                                          Hex-Dump Conversion
    would not receive continued funding under this initiative. This provision will provide a strong
    incentive for all school districts to make the most effective use of the all of their resources, and in
    particular, to use proven practices to improve the quality of teaching through this initiative.
    In addition, the Education Department will conduct a national evaluation of this initiative, to
    identify implementation problems that need to be addressed and to learn about the most effective
    practices.

    Budget Options: If the cost of this proposal needs to be scaled back, we can reduce the overall
    cost by setting an objective of reducing the average class size to 18 (rather than a maximum of
    18) while setting a class size ceiling of 20, or by reducing the federal share of the initiative to
    70% rather than 80%. The chart below shows the total5-year cost of these options.


                                       80% Federal Share                 70% Federal Share

     Class size ceiling of 18          $9.2 Billion                      $8.0 Billion

     Class size average of 18,         $7.7 Billion                      $6.7 Billion
     ceiling of 20
