Here's the edit you requested.

****************************************************************
Dear <salutation>,
Thank you for your letter of March 14 on concerning legislation to
create national uniform standards for some certain types of
securities litigation.  The new regime put in place by the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act is still unfolding in its infancy, and
one of the issues that will need to be considered as we gain
experience with the Act is how its provisions affect the roles of
state and federal courts in private securities fraud litigation.

The Securities and Exchange Commission has just released a
report I asked them to prepare for me and for Congress that I
requested, assessing the impact effects of last yearO,s legislation
part.icularly the impact of its "safe harbor" provisions. , including
not only issues relating to litigation, but also the impact of the "safe
harbor" for forward looking statements on information available to
investors. Other studies also have been done. We will be
reviewing the SEC study and other reports and data to assess the
need for further legislation. We look forward to working with you
on this important issue.                        .
