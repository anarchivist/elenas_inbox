TEXT:
i don't want to sound grumpy, and i know this weekend ,was a little funny,
but we didn't get your weekly until 5 something last night, which is just
crazy late, even given our conversation late saturday.   it's probably our
own fault for letting the deadline slip routinely, but can we please go
back to the presumption of a friday night deadline, latest before noon
saturday? it's not fair to the president to do it any later - - and to
boot it hangs up our office. thanks.
