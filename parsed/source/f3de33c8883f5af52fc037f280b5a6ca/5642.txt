TEXT:
You recall that OLC's opinion on HHS's draft definition sent HHS back to
the drawing board.

Latest problem: HHS must have been telling advocacy groups for months
that they were going to·define this term in a way that would protect most
programs. The advocate Cecilia Munoz told me today that the field is
panicking because they "thought they were OK," but now they hear we may be
taking a tougher stance on this.  I told her that there are legal
questions that HHS is examining in order to arrive at a definition. Her
rhetoric was that she hoped the Administration "that fought with us on the
Gallegly amendment" wouldn't work against them.
