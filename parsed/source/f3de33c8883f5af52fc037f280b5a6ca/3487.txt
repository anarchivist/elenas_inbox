TEXT:
The press office would like us to brief the wires today (embargoed for
release after midnight) on the policy announcement in tomorrow's speech.
When will we have a fact sheet?

Do we know budget level and # of teachers yet?     That would be helpful for
the speech and the wires.

We also need a Q&A on where BC stands on busing.     I gather there's quite a
history on this in Little Rock.

Sylvia would like a copy of our briefing materials sometime today so she
can read it tonight.
