Honorable Frank Riggs
Chairman, Subcommittee on Early Childhood,
     Youth, and Families
Committee on Education and the Workforce
United States House of Representatives
Washington, DC 20515

Dear Mr. Chairman:

I am writing to express my strong objections to H.R. 3248, . the
"Dollars to the Classroom Act," which would convert a wide array
of Federal education programs to block grants. The President stated
last fail that such a step is unacceptable, and that he would use
his veto power to prevent this approach from becoming law.    If
H.R. 3248 were presented to the President, I would recommend that
he veto it.

Block grants would halt many of our most successful efforts to improve
education, including our efforts to raise educational standards,
make computers available in every classroom, and keep our schools
safe and free of drugs.    H.R. 3248 could also seriously harm the
ESEA, Title I program, which provides extra help to low-income
students so that they can master the basic skills of reading and
math, paving the way for them to reach high academic standards.

The American people rightly look to the Federal Government. to focus
its efforts not on general aid to school districts, but on national
priorities, such as improving educational opportunities for poor
children and other children with special needs, combating youth drug
abuse and school violence, and researching and disseminating
information on what works.    This Administration has worked
diligently to eliminate unnecessary regulations and take other steps
to promote State and local flexibility in carrying out these targeted
efforts, while supporting strong accountability mechanisms, such
as the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993, that ensure
program effectiveness and results and that justify continued support
by the taxpayers.   Block grants would replace these worthy efforts
with general aid, providing no focus, no accountability for results,
and no rationale for ongoing support.

The issue here is not about who controls public education -- we all
agree that that responsibility rests at the local and State levels.
 The question, rather, is whether the Federal Government will
maintain its long-standing, bipartisan commitment to helping local
communities strengthen accountability, raise standards, and improve
student achievement, by providing assistance that focuses on our
                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion

neediest children and schools and on activities in which national
leadership can playa critical role.

The Office of Management and Budget advises that there is no objection
to the submission of this report from the standpoint of the
Administration's program and that enactment of H.R. 3248 would not
be in accord'with the President's program.


                                  Yours sincerely,




                                  Richard W. Riley
