      The following is a brief summary of the key outstanding issues regarding potential
Administration support ofthe Workplace Religious Freedom Act.

1. Statutory Model. The Senate Bill is modeled after the Americans with Disabilities Act.
The Administration proposal is based upon Title VII. Both approaches would accomplish
essentially the same goal -- the ratcheting up of the protection currently afforded religious
exercise under Title VII. There is a significant dispute, however, as to which approach would
best accomplish that result. The religious groups' argument in favor of the ADA model is
political. Although the ADA approach initially raised concerns within the small business
community (because of compliance issues), the religious groups now represent that business
supports the ADA model because it offers a familiar regulatory scheme. Similarly, the groups
contend that business would oppose legislation that introduces a set of unfamiliar standards.

Administration objections to the ADA model are based upon a number of separate
considerations. First, there is concern that the use of ADA language would lead to the
watering down of ADA standards because courts would be reluctant to enforce religious
accommodations to the same degree that they enforce accommodations for the disabled.
Second, DOJ argues that ADA language may raise issues under the establishment clause because
its emphasis on special accommodation suggests that it would create a preference for religion
rather than merely redress discrimination against religion. Third, DO] believes that, because the
Administration's proposal is more clearly based on anti-discrimination concerns, it could more
easily be enacted pursuant to Congress' Section V powers which would allow plaintiffs to collect
damages from the states.

2. Premium Pay. Under the Senate Bill, private sector employers would be excused from their
obligation under the FLSA to pay overtime to an employee for work in excess of 40 hours when
that employee works those overtime hours to make up for time taken off for religious observance.
 The Department of Labor opposes this provision because it is inconsistent with the
Administration's opposition to current Congressional proposals that would allow employees to
opt for compensatory time in lieu of premium pay. The religious groups have countered that an
existing federal statute (5 U.S.C § 5550a) requires that federal employees who take time off for
religious observances are not entitled to overtime pay and that it would therefore not harm
Administration policy to allow a similar rule to apply to the private sector for the limited purpose
of accommodating religious observance. DOL argues, however, that the analogy is
inappropriate because the regulation of federal overtime and private sector overtime raise distinct
considerations. For example, other than that provided in section 5550a, the rights of federal
employees to overtime pay are far greater than that allowed employees in the private sector.

3. Effect on Seniority Rights. The Senate Bill would allow for the accommodation of religious
employees to supersede other employees' seniority rights in certain limited circumstances (i.e.
when an employee with seniority rights voluntarily agrees to exchange shifts or jobs with the
religious employee who would not otherwise be entitled to accede to the senior employees's shift
or job.) The religious groups strongly support this provision believing that employers have
consistently hidden behind collective bargaining agreements in denying religious.
accommodations. Labor objects on policy grounds and DO] is concerned that to accommodate
                                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion
only religious employees in this context would raise establishment concerns.
