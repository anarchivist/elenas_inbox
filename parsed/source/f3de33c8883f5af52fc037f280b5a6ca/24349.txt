     TEXT:
     Nancy Zurkin of the American Association of University Women recently
     commissioned a poll to be conducted by Celinda Lake on "The Attitude of
     Women toward the role of Federal Government in Education."  In discussing
     the poll results with Nancy, 78% of the women felt that the government
     should have a strong federal role in education.   The poll will cover such
     issues as block grants, school safety, standards, etc.
     On Tuesday, July 14, 1998 at 3:00 p.m. in the Roosevelt Room,   Celinda and
     Nancy have agreed to brief the White House staff on the results of the
     poll before they become pUblic.  They will hold their official press
     conference on July 16th.
      If you are interested in attending, please confirm your participation
     with TANYA LOPEZ in the Women's office at X67395.

     Thanks ...... MM
