the AG COB today.  They are still finalizing the legislative proposal.

victim information and notification system, additions to Federal victims'
bill of rights and stronger restitution provisions. Also includes
employment protections for victims attending proceedings on their case.

standard of compliance with victims' rights responsibilities.

and notification system.

participation for victims.  Plan to work with all Federal investigative
agencies to develop victim-assistance strategies; will work with Federal
judges to maximize victim participation in Federal criminal justice system.
