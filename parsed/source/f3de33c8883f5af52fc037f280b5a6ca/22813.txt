TEXT:
Jonathan Jones (Carper) told me last night that Gov O'Bannon at tomorrow's
roundtable, intends to ask the President for a letter on Ed-Flex.  I told
him that was bush-league and urged him in strong terms not to have
O'Bannon make that request to the President.  I'm trying to reach
O'Bannon's staff with the same message.

Mickey, on sequence, only Glendening (delete Schafer) will speak on
Livability. Then Engler on Federalism. Let's hope we run out of time.
