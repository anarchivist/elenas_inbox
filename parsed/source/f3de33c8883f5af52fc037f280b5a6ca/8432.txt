TEXT:
Attached is the bullet insert for the POTUS on Patients' Bill of Rights.
It may be a little longer than you would like, but I think it is all
fairly important for him to have.  Perhaps, however,you can address my
verbose nature.  Call with any questions.

Update on Republican Patients' Bill of Rights. The public response to the Republican House
Leadership's announcement oftheir intention (they provided no details) to introduce a Patients'
Bill of Rights has been almost universally negative. The base Democrats, the consumer
advocates and the providers have labeled it a "sham;" the insurers and big business community
are criticizing it as overly regulatory. Notwithstanding the positioning nature ofthese reactions,
it is remarkable how far the Republicans apparently have come toward your position. They
reportedly have included most of the major protections you have called for and have actually
acknowledged the need for some (although modest) remedies to enforce the protections.

We have taken the position that, while we welcome the fact that Republicans have finally
affirmed your position that Federal legislation is needed, their product comes up far short of what
is necessary. We have cited the fact that it does not include the access to specialists provision,
the continuity of care provision (that allows patients to continue to see their physician ifhe or she
is dropped from a plan in the middle of a treatment), and thc typc of strong remedy provisions
that are necessary to assure that the Patients' Bill of Rights are truly enforceable. We have also
been critical of the "poison pill" provisions (medical malpractice caps, a new Multi Employer
Welfare Association provision that could destabilize the small insurance market and would
pre-empt state-based patient protections, and a new Medical Savings Account provision), saying
that they will weigh down the bill, rather than assure its passage.

The Democratic Leadership, sensing that they have a great issue, want to keep the bar extremely
high and are clearly in the "issue not law" mode. Other Democrats and moderate Republicans
would probably be generally supportive IF the poison pill provisons were dropped and some
relatively modest consumer protections were added. We are now in the process of reviewing
policy and strategic positioning options for your consideration.
