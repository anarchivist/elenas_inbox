TEXT:
Jen wanted me to let you know that for the May after-school event for the
President that we have in mind, we'll also have a DOJ/ Ed report on
after-school programs and how they cut down on crime as well as improve
educational performance. This is in addition to the announcement of the
grants.   Thanks--
