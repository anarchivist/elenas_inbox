Subject:         Re: Initiatives

Laura/James:

Although the Children Exposed to Violence is a stand-alone, year long
initiative that will be spearheaded by Deputy AG Eric Holder, legislation
related to the initiative (e.g., increased penalties for committing a
violent crime in the presence of a child) will be rolled into the crime
bill.

As for our Zero Tolerance Drug Supervision initiatve (not drug-free
prisons), it will both be rolled into the crime bill and be a key
appropriations priority (whether or not the crime bill moves this year) '.
