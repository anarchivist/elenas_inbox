TEXT,
Due to some confusion I just wanted to clear up with everyone where we
stand right now for Monday's event. The speaking program would be as
follows:

Gov. Carnahan
Fleet Bank President & COO
Father tbd
POTUS

We would have the 5 Cabinet secretaries on stage, as well as 3 success
story employees from Fleet Bank.

Unfortunately there is not a "catchy" chart that we can use for the
cutaway.  So I think, we will stick with the Presidential Seal
recommendation from Communications in terms of backdrop.

Let me know if anyone has a questions.   Thanks!
