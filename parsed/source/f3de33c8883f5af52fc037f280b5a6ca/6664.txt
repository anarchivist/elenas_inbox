     Regulation of Controlled Substances and Impact on Terminally Ill. Last April, you signed
     the Assisted Suicide Funding Restriction Act (ASFRA), which prohibited federal funds or health
     facilities to be used to further assisted suicide. The DEA desires to formally declare that
     "delivering, dispensing or prescribing a controlled substance with the intent of assisting a suicide
     would not be under any current definition a legitimate medical purpose." Although this position
     may appear to be generally consistent with ASFRA and your historic policy on this issue, the
     Justice Department has concluded that the DEA's desired declaration cannot be sustained by
     current Federal statute. The Department apparently believes that the funding prohibitions do not
     extend to DEA's regulatory responsibility over the administration of controlled substances.
     Because Congressman Hyde and Senator Hatch are aware that the Justice Department appears to
     be about to release their formal position on the DEA position, they are preparing legislation to
     empowerDEA to make its declaration.

     While we might want to seriously consider supporting or advocating such legislation ourselves,
     we have concerns about how such legislation could be drafted and what type of negative impact
     it might have on the legitimate use of controlled substances by physicians. In fact, although the
     Catholic Health Association (CHA) strongly supports our historic position on assisted suicide
     and the DEA declaration (as long as it is implemented with great sensitivity), they are extremely
     nervous about a new statute because of their fear that new attention to this issue will further
     inhibit physicians from the appropriate use of pain killers for the terminally ill. (The Institute of
     Medicine has recently concluded that physicians fearing legal sanctions are increasingly
     apprehensive about prescribing these medications -- an outcome no one wants.) We will be
     meeting with CHA representatives next week to determine how best to proceed, but for the
     moment we urge caution in taking an immediate p.osition on legislation until this process is
     completed.

     Medicare Buy-in Event. On Tuesday, you are scheduled to attend an event on the Hill with the
     Democratic sponsors of your Medicare buy-in proposal as they unveil their legislation. There
     has been increasing interest in this legislation following the positive CBO analysis. The Kaiser
     Foundation is planning to release a report next week that underscores the difficulty many older
     Americans have accessing health insurance. Kaiser has agreed to let us discuss some of their
     key findings in this announcement.. Featured prominent in this event will be Senator Moynihan,
     the lead Democratic Senate sponsor of this legislation. It is important to note that three of the
     five Democratic members of the Medicare Commission are co-sponsors of this legislation
     (Rockefeller, Dingell, and McDermott), and we are still holding out some hope that Senator
     Kerrey will endorse the bill. Senator Breaux will clearly not endorse it as he believes that
     associating himself in any way with this legislation will only further confuse his position on this
     Issue.

     Missouri Update. This week, the Department of Health and Human Services met with
     Governor Carnahan's staff to discuss the status on the approval of their children's health
     insurance proposal. This discussion follows Governor Carnahan's request to you and the Vice
     President for a rapid response to their proposal and internal meetings held with HHS, DPC,
     OMB, and Intergovernmental Affairs on how best to move forward on this issue. Missouri has
     previously insisted on retaining a financing mechanism that HHS interpreted to be illegal. The




    state's more recent proposal is extremely encouraging in that it represents their implicit
    acknowledgment that its provider taxes are illegal. Of course, they would never explicitly say
    this and have made clear that this proposal should have no bearing on how the Federal
    government should enforce tht:ir past reliance on their provider taxes. The meeting with HCF A
    was a good first step. HCF A indicated that they need additional information to determine the
    legality of Missouri's current proposal. The state seemed appreciative that these discussions now
    seem to be moving at a quicker pace and agreed to provide the necessary information as soon as
    possible. However, these negotiations will continue to be quite delicate. We are advising all
    within the Administration to remain quiet until they have been resolved.

                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion
