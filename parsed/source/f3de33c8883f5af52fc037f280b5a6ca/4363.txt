TEXT:
We've received a faxed letter to the President from 19 Senators
(Feinstein, Moseley-Braun, Reid, Boxer, Abraham, DeWine, Bryan, Akaka,
Sarbanes, Mikulski, Bingaman, Santorum, Levin, Johnson, Glenn, Domenici,
Specter, Daschle, and one signature I'm still trying to decode) asking us
to support a six month moratorium on penalties for states not meeting the
October 1st deadline.   As you know,  Senator Feinstein raised this at her
meeting with the President on Monday and he was non-commital.   I was just
sent a copy of a note from him saying "can we help on this." I will write
an item for the weekly on it.
