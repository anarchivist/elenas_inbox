TEXT:
Here's what happened at the Bruce Lindsey meeting this afternoon with Gov.
Patton and Sen. Ford and a burley grower. Their basic interest is in (1)
a guaranteed purchase level by the companies and (2) continuing the price
support program. Ford's bill also has about a billion dollars a year of
development grants etc. They understood the Administration is supportive
generally-- the fund seems high.  Two potential hang-ups on a side
agreement on purchases were mentioned: GATT and anti-trust.  I'd asked USDA
 to take a look and they have said in the past there is probably not a
GATT problem as it is a private contract.
