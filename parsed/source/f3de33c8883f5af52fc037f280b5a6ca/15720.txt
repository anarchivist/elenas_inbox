    MONDAY: VICE PRESIDENT ANNOUNCES STEPS TO HELP SMALL BUSINESS

      Today at a White House ceremony to celebrate National Small Business Week, Vice
President Gore announced three new actions to help small business:

·      The Small Business Administration's new five-point program to help small
       businesses develop pension plans for their more than 32 million workers who now
       lack retirement benefits. The effort includes a new 800-number for small
       businesses: 1-800-998-7542.

·      SBA's new one-stop, on-line procurement service, called PRO-Net, to help small
       businesses - especially women-, minority-, and disadvantaged-owned small
       businesses - fmd procurement opportunities in the Federal Government and
       private sector.

·      The IRS will provide a six-month extension, until December 31, for small businesses
       to fIle payroll taxes through the Electronic Federal Tax Payment System. Without
       this action, many small businesses would have been subject to penalties for not using
       the new system by July 1.

·      The Vice President said: "The President and I have worked hard to ensure that our
       small businesses can continue to be the engines of economic growth. We hope the
       steps announced today will offer some common-sense help."

     SATURDAY: PRESIDENT RENEWS CALL FOR TAX CUTS FOR FAMILIES

        As Congress moves forward on the details of the balanced budget agreement and its
tax .cut, President Clinton used his weekly Radio Address to renew his call for tax cuts that
help families raise and educate their children and keep the economy growing:

·      The final tax cut must help open the doors of college to every American. The
       President's $1,500 HOPE Scholarship tax cuts will help pay for the first two years of
       college; he will recommend that students who receive Pell Grants still be eligible for
       HOPE Scholarships for additional education costs; and he favors a tax deduction for the
       cost of any education after high school for people of any age.

·      The final tax cut should give as many families as possible the chance to receive the
       dividends of economic growth. The President's plan includes a $500 child tax credit;
       Congress must make sure it is fair to working families -- especially those with lower
       mcomes.

·      The final tax cut must be consistent with a balanced budget -- and not written in such a
       way that it busts the budget in years to come.

·     This kind of tax package will continue the President's three-pronged economic strategy --
      reducing the budget deficit; investing in the education, training and security of our
much opportunity for the American people since 1993.
