TEXT:
As discussed, I suggest deleting what is written under rape and insert:

"Rape. There was a minor decrease in forcible rapes of less than one
percent between 1996 and 1997. "

One more thing should be added to the entry, probably somewhere up at the
top:  "While cities experienced a 3 percent decrease in crime overall,
rural areas saw a one percent increase in crime."
