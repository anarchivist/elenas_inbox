The Honorable Trent Lott
Majority Leader
United States Senate
Washington, D.C. 20510

Dear Mr. Leader:

       The purpose of this letter is to provide the Administration's views on H.R. 1259, the
"Social Security and Medicare Safe Deposit Box Act of 1999," which recently passed the House
of Representatives. As the Senate considers this legislation, your consideration of the
Administration's views would be appreciated.

        The President is fully committed to protecting Social Security and Medicare. He has
committed this Administration to saving Social Security first, and strengthening Medicare, before
budget surpluses are committed to any other purpose. The Administration supports a "lock-box"
that would protect Social Security and Medicare. Unfortunately, H.R. 1259 does nothing to
strengthen Social Security and Medicare and would establish a 60-vote point of order in the
Senate that could force harmful fiscal policies.

        H.R. 1259 seeks to reserve off-budget surpluses for future Social Security and Medicare
reforms by establishing points of order against Budget Resolutions that "set forth," and new
legislation "that would cause or increase," on-budget deficits. The bill sponsors' reasoning is
that the occurrence of on-budget deficits would deplete off-budget (i.e. Social Security)
surpluses. It is important to realize that current budget laws already provide more significant
protections for Social Security and Medicare, than H.R. 1259 proposes. The Budget Enforcement
Act's discretionary spending caps and pay-as-you-go requirements protect both off-budget and
on-budget surpluses from being spent. And as the President has said, none of the budget
surpluses -- on-budget or off-budget -- should be spent until the long-term solvency of Social
Security has been secured and Medicare has been strengthened.

       [While the bill does nothing to strengthen Social Security and Medicare, it would
promote bad fiscal policy. The Administration is deeply concerned that the bill fails to take into
account that a very modest economic slowdown could cause a temporary on-budget deficit. A
recurrence of on-budget deficits would be even more likely if projected on-budget surpluses are
spent on major tax cuts, as called for in the Congressional Budget Resolution.

        In the event of an on-budget deficit, whether due to an economic downturn or policies
which use projected surpluses that fail to materialize, under H.R. 1259, the Budget Resolution
would have to call for spending cuts or tax increases to eliminate the on-budget deficit. In the
Senate, any waiver of the new point of order would require a supermajority of 60 votes. This is
bad fiscal policy, since enactment of spending cuts or tax increases could accelerate a slowdown
or deepen a recession.]
                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion


        The President's budget framework would save the bulk of projected unified surpluses and
apply them to the critical tasks of strengthening Social Security and Medicare. The framework
would dedicate 62 percent of total budget surpluses (on- and off-budget) over the next 15 years
to extend the solvency of the Social Security Trust Funds. In addition, the President's plan
would lock away another 15 percent of total budget surpluses to extend the life of the Medicare
Trust Fund. These funds would be protected by investing them in Treasury securities -- while at
the same time, they would dramatically reduce the Nation's debt held by the public.

        The independent Social Security Administration actuaries have estimated that reserving
62 percent of unified budget surpluses for Social Security would extend the life of the Trust
Funds into the middle of the next century -- an essential first step towards achieving 75-year
solvency. Dedicating 15 percent of total surpluses to Medicare would extend the life of the
Hospital Insurance Trust Fund by at least a decade -- another important first step towards
strengthening Medicare.

        This is where the debate should be focused -- on concrete steps to secure the long-term
solvency of Social Security and to strengthen the financing of the Medicare Trust Fund.
Unfortunately, H.R. 1259 would do nothing to move the Nation towards that goal and risks bad
fiscal policies that would threaten the health of our economy. The Administration urges the
Congress to re-focus its efforts on the goal of saving Social Security first and strengthening
Medicare.


                                            Sincerely,



                                            Jacob 1. Lew
                                            Director
