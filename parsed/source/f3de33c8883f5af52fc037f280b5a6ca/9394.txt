TEXT:
Here's are some of the highlights:
Median household income up 2% ($700) from 96 to 97
Biggest income gains for blacks (4.3%) and Hispanics (4.5%),
Biggest income gain in the South, where incomes are still lowest.
poverty rate down 3% from 96 to 97 (13.7% to 13.3%)
While the number of poor people went down almost 1 M, Census doesn't
consider this statistically significant; looks like number of poor went
down almost 4 M from peak in 1993 (from 39.3 M to 35.6 M).
Biggest improvements in poverty rates for blacks (2%) and Hispanics (2.3%)
Both income and poverty now back at 1989 level.
Poverty rates went down for all age groups -- child poverty under 20% for
1st time since 1989, but barely ... it's 19.9% and I think Census is
characterizing it as unchanged (20.5% in 1996). At least it counters fear
that welfare reform would make it worse (though this only reflects 1997)
Income inequality unchanged or worse depending on which measures used.


orszag is now pouring through the numbers. He thinks they look great and
is working on putting them in glowing historical terms.

We don't yet have from Census the number of 1997 welfare recipients who
were employed in March 1998, but I'm trying to get it (these data are not
part of the official package released on Thursday -- they are available on
a 'special run' basis. Once we get these, we can update the trends on
increased work among welfare recipients and update the 1.7 M welfare
recipients are now working number.  However, we may want to hold this to
release with caseloads and participation rates in October (per October
event memo) .
