American Indian Education Foundation. Today the First Lady will announce the
Administration's support for legislation to create a nonprofit entity called the American Indian
Education Foundation, similar to the National Park Foundation, in order to help leverage
private resources for the education of Native American children. This Foundation will accept
and administer private gifts of real and personal property to support the goal of improving the
educational opportunities of American Indian and Alaska Native students from early childhood
through high school. This Foundation would be able to fund projects such as teacher training
and development programs; family literacy programs; the provision of materials and equipment;
model programs to advance the educational opportunities of Native American students; and the
development of American Indian cultural programs for use in schools.

                          American Indian Education Foundation Q&A
                                         May 4,1999

    Q:   What did the First Lady announce today?

    A:   Today the First Lady announced the Administration's support for legislation to create a
         nonprofit entity called the American Indian Education Foundation, similar to the National
         Park Foundation, in order to help leverage private resources for the education of Native
         American children. This Foundation will accept and administer private gifts of real and
         personal property to support the goal of improving the educational opportunities of
         American Indian and Alaska Native students from early childhood through high school.
         This Foundation would be able to fund projects such as teacher training and development
         programs; family literacy programs; the provision of materials and equipment; model
         programs to advance the educational opportunities of Native American students; and the
         development of American Indian cultural programs for use in schools.

    Q:   Why is such a Foundation needed?

    A:   Currently, the Bureau ofIndian Affairs (BIA) at the Department of the Interior provides
         for the advancement of Native American education. Specifically, the BlA funds 185
         elementary and secondary schools and provides operating grants to about 30 tribally
         controlled community colleges. While there is an American Indian College Fund, there is
         no national non-profit that focuses on the education of Native American children before
         they reach college age. Currently, the BIA cannot legally solicit private funds in order to
         leverage resources to improve the educational opportunities of Native American students.
          This Foundation will be able to solicit private funds.

    Q:   What types of projects would the Foundation fund?

    A:   The Foundation would support various education projects that benefit Native American
         children from early childhood through high school. This Foundation would be able to
         fund projects such as teacher training and development programs; family literacy
         programs; the provision of materials and equipment; model programs to advance the
         educational opportunities of Native American students; and the development of American
         Indian cultural programs for use in schools.

    Q:   Who are the sponsors of this legislation, and when will it be introduced?

    A:   will find out today

    Q:   Does the Foundation require any additional appropriations in order to operate?

    A:   No, the legislation does not provide for any additional funding. The Foundation will use
         a maximum of 10 percent ofthe funds that it receives to support its operation. In
         addition, the legislation provides that the Department of the Interior may supply existing
                                                                              Automated Records Managef!lent System
                                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion
         personnel, facilities, and other administrative services to assist the Foundation in its
         start-up activities for a period of up to five years following passage of the legislation.

    Q:   How much does the Foundation expect to receive in donations?

    A:   Since there has never been a Foundation to leverage private resources to support the goal
         of providing educational opportunities for Native American children before they reach
         college age, it is difficult to estimate any particular amount. The Administration,
         however, is encouraged by the response it has received from this legislation, and expects
         that the Foundation, after an initial start-up period, will contribute significantly to
         improving the educational opportunities of Native American children.

    Q:   Will the Foundation have a Board of Directors?

    A:   Yes, the Foundation will have 11 board members, including the Secretary of the Interior
                                                                          and the Assistant
