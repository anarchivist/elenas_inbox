               Fox to Wade Deeper Into Sex and Violence

               By   B ILL   CARTER

                       aking more changes than any other network and reaching for
                       programs deliberately aimed at breaking new ground in
terms of
                     sex, language and violence, Fox announced a fall television
               schedule Thursday with eight new series, including a: reshaped,
half-hour
               version of "Ally McBeal" that will play the night after the hour
version.

          The show (Tuesdays at 8) will consist essentially of old
episodes of the
          series edited down to a half-hour. It is part of a growing trend
in which
          networks reuse programs in the same week as a way of cutting
costs.

               Fox will also add a new comedy,      "Action"   (Thursday at 9:30),
that will
               overtly use many of the words that have not previously been used
on
               network television but will bleep the actual sound. The show is
about a
               producer of action movies who is an egomaniac. It stars Jay
{~       '1




Mohr.

              The pilot of "Harsh Realm"   (Friday at 9), a new drama from Chris
Carter,
          the creator of "The X-Files," includes as heavy a quotient of
violence as
          any show ever made, though Fox executives have promised the
series will
          tone the violence down.

              The show is about an elaborate government virtual-reality game
and a
              former American military officer's efforts to solve it and stay
alive.

              The network also has its own version of the high school shows
that are a
          dominant trend for the coming season, but with "Manchester Prep"
          (Thursday at 8), a spinoff of the film "Cruel Intentions," which
was itself a
          teen-age take on the film "Dangerous Liaisons," Fox is
emphasizing a
          much darker, sexually promiscuous side of teen-age
relationships.

           At the other end of the spectrum, Fox has a family show,
"Malcolm in the
           Middle" (Sunday at 7), which will aim more for sweetness than
spice as a
           family deals with the discovery that their 9-year-old son --
their middle
           child -- is a genius.

          The network has a spinoff of its successful drama "Party of
Five" in the
          show "Time of Your Life," (Monday at 8) in which the character
played by
          Jennifer Love Hewitt runs away to New York City to search for
her birth
          parents.

              Another family show,   "Get Real"   (Wednesday at 9), fits the new
trend
              toward hourlong shows more based in comedy than drama. The
family in
          the show experiences an unending series of crises, like car
accidents, a
          teen-ager's refusal to go to college, a child being beaten up by
bullies, but
          all are handled in comic fashion. It stars Debrah Farentino as a
decidedly
          young mother of this brood.

              The final Fox drama is another show that bucks the current trend
away
              from violence.   "Ryan Caulfield"   (Fridays at 8)   is about a young
man who
          stuns his friends by becoming a police officer instead of going
to college.
          He experiences the hard world of police work, including a first


case
            involving a gruesome murder scene.

            Fox is rebuilding every night of the week but Saturday. Among
the shows
          it is dropping are "Millennium," "World's Funniest" and "The
PJ's," though
          Fox promised the latter would be back later this season.

            The network resolved its dilemma about which animated show to
pair with
            "The Simpsons" by giving the 8: 30 Sunday slot to ·"Futurama" and
moving
          "Family Guy" to Thursday, where it will be paired with "Action"
in a direct
          attempt to pull male viewers away from NBC's long-time comedy
          stronghold. The Fox schedule:
