   WASHINGTON, April 9 /U.S. Newswire/ -- Republican National
Committee (RNC) Chairman Jim Nicholson today posed the following
questions in anticipation of President Clinton's statements on the
tobacco settlement today:

   1) Mr. President, how much of the money from the settlement
should be taken away from children's health and given to trial
lawyers?

   2) Would you agree to a $150 per hour cap for these lawyers',
plus disbursements?

   3) Mr. President, you said in your State of the Union address
that cigarette smoking is "the gravest health threat" facing
American teenagers. Did you mean to say that cigarettes pose a
greater health threat than drugs or alcohol?

   4) Will you acknowledge that the casual references you have made
in the past about marijuana use set a bad example?
