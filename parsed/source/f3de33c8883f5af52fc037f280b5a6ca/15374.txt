Scotus-Billboards, 550
Ban on cigarette, liquor billboards upheld

    WASHINGTON (AP)    The Supreme Court, in an apparent victory for
President Clinton's proposed crackdown on tobacco advertising,
today left intact Baltimore's bans on billboard ads for cigarettes
and alcoholic beverages.
    The justices, without comment, turned away arguments that the
city's twin bans on such ads violate free-speech rights.
    A federal judge in North Carolina left that constitutional
question unanswered last week v.,!herr he rl:12::.1 t1:<:lt e:-:isting fe:::;'cro.2.
law doesn't allow the Food and Drug Administration to restrict
ci~'rph~p ~d'le~tising and rrc~~~~~~.


ruling that the FDA can regul&L~ Lcbacco as a d~ug.
    President Clinton said that part of the judge's ruling on


adv~rti.sing at sports events, on '.l..-:.... ........ ~i...~ d11d L.:._~0C<..!..:.._~...) ldiL:.~:.
1,000 feet of schools and playground::;, and in magazines likcl:,' to


be read by teen-agers.
    Opponents of the proposal contend it runs afoul of a
c0::..stitutior;.3.1ity test created ::.:'   :l.   191]']   .sl':',:"~:;te   C:)urt :r"'..!li:-::.
     In it, the court said commercial speech t::a:: is truthful and not
misleading may be limited only if government has a substantial
interest, the limitation directly advances that interest and is no
more extensive than necessary.
    The Baltimore dispute dates back to a pair of 1994 ordinances
that forced the removal of cigarette 'and alcoholic beverage ads
from most city billboards.
    The ordinances were aimed at reducing illegal underage drinking
and smoking.
    The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the bans last year,
but was ordered by the Supreme Court to restudy its rulings in
light of the justices' decision last May giving advertisers
significantly greater protection from government regulation.
    The trend of rulings by the nation's highest court in recent
years is to give commercial speech enhanced protections from
government regulation.
    But after reconsidering each of Baltimore's bans, the 4th
Circuit court again upheld both in August.
    The appeals court said the bans withstood the scrutiny required
under the Supreme Court's 1980 ruling, and that the May ruling did
not apply to the billboard dispute.
    The lower court added that measures to protect children deserve
--special solicitude"   by courts.
     --Baltimore's interest is to protect children who are not yet
independently able to assess the value of the message presented, ' ,
the appeals court said. --This decision thus conforms to the
Supreme Court's repeated recognition that children deserve special
solicitude in the First Amendment balance. ' ,
    The amendment guarantees freedom of speech.
    The alcoholic-beverage ad ban was challenged by Anheuser-Busch,
brewer of such popular beers as Budweiser and Michelob, and Penn
Advertising of Baltimore, a billboard-leasing company.
    Penn Advertising challenged the city's cigarette ad ban.
    Alcoholic beverages still can be advertised in Baltimore      on
city buses, taxicabs, delivery trucks and stores licensed to sell
such drinks. The city's ban also did not affect television, radio,
newspaper and magazine advertisements.
    The city's cigarette-advertising ban also permits ads on buses
and taxis, stores licensed to sell cigarettes and at professional
sports stadiums.
    The cases are Anheuser-Busch vs. Schmoke, 96-1428, and
Penn-Advertising vs. Schmoke, 96-1429.
