TEXT:
I think Mike may have spoken to Bruce about this earlier, but the
Education Department is curently planning to announce the contract on the
national tests on Friday. Mike has asked me to check with ED on what
would be the impact of delaying this until early Sept., when we could
potentially couple it with an announcement on an advisory board.  I'll let
folks know what I hear back.

Also fyi -- Subcomittee Chairman Riggs has asked Mike Smith to come
testify at a hearing on the national tests to be held Sept. 4, the week
before the Labor H Bill is likely to come up.   Smith is supposed to be
giving a speech in CA that day, but ED is going to work with the committee
to find out if the speech or the hearing can be moved to accomodate
this.   Also expected are 1-2 govs, 1-2 superintendents, and possibly
Fairtest and the Christian Coalition -- it doesn't sound like there are
likely to be any supporters other than the Administration.  In addition,
ED is preparing a reply to Goodling's piece in today's Post on the tests;
this one would be for Riley's signature.

-- Bill
