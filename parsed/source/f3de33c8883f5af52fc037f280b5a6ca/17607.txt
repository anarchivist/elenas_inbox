     DRAFT




                                            (Date)


     Dear X:

             Earlier this year, I transmitted to Congress legislation designed to promote fair and
     equitable treatment for individuals with pending immigration cases, including those who fled
     persecution and civil war in Central America and received protection in the United States. My
     legislation also aimed to assist the fledgling democracies of Central America which cannot easily
     absorb their nationals at this time. I urge the Congress provide similar treatment to Haitians as it
     considers final legislation on this matter.

            In recent weeks, Members of Congress and representatives of the Haitian community
     have highlighted the compelling plight of thousands of Haitians in the United States. Their
     experiences parallel those of Central Americans in many ways. The Bush Administration
     brought most of these Haitians to the United States in 1991-92 after they were foimd to have a
     credible fear of persecution in Haiti. Many of these Haitians have made vital contributions to
     their communities and established deep roots in the United States. Providing them with an
     opportunity to gain permanent status in the U.S. is not only equitable, it is also critical to helping
     Haiti establish a strong and lasting democracy -- a goal which the United States continues to
     devote extensive energy and resources.

             Given these similarities, I strongly believe that Haitians deserve relief equivalent to that
     under consideration for Central Americans. I hope that you will move quickly to address the
     special circumstances of Haitians and enact this important legislation before the Congress
     adjourns for the year.
