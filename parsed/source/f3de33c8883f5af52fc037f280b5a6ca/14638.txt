Message Creation Date was at 19-FEB-1997 13:30:00

Sorry for the short notice but i'd like to get together tomorrow at 11:00 in
107 EW to discuss late-term abortion.  I am also asking HHS and DOJ legislative
affairs to attend.  Daschle's staff would like to meet tomorrow afternoon at
either 4 or 5 pm in room 509 hart so I thought we should get together
beforehand. You are all invited of course to the Daschle meeting. The Senator
has a decision memo and we will be discussion the staff's recommendations.   I
have also asked that they pull together their larger Senate working group next
week so we can begin to hear from other Member offices.  That meeting has been
set-up for 2pm next Friday 2/28 room TBD.

Please let me know if you can attend the 11 am tomorrow.
Do you prefer 4 or 5 pm with Daschle's staff?
will you be able to attend the 2/28 meeting with Senate working group?
