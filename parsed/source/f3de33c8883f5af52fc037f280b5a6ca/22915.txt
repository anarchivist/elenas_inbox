TEXT:
Here is a list of the kids safety things that NHTSA says is the best they
have.  It seems small. Tom is sending you a paragraph of general highway
safety steps that we could use.

1. The Consumer Product Safety Commission previously issued a regulation
that is effective March 1, that all bicycle helmets sold in the U.S. must
meet a uniform mandatory safety standard.
2.  To ensure school buses remain the safest vehicles on the road, a
mult-year research study is being conducted on passenger occupant
protection.
3. NTH SA developed a standardized four-day child passenger training
course that has trained thousands of child safety professionals in all
fifty states. This course demonstrates proper child safety seat
installation and use, and it is conducted by states and national
organizations, such as the National Safe Kids Campaign and USAA (insurance
company for retired military).  The culmination of the course is
checkpoint where the course participants put their new skills into
practice by teaching the people in the community how to properly install
child safety seats.
