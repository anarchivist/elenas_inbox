TEXT:
Per Ann and Melanne's conversation this morning about the seating for the
luncheon on Thursday - - we will only seat Mrs. Clinton's table and Mrs.
Gore's (if she attends).

 The rest of the luncheon seating will be by random drawing with one
assigned adminstration represenative at each table to be the table host.
We have used this format many times and it works very well.

Please let me know the suggestions for Mrs. Clinton's and Mrs. Gore's
tables.

Also please give me a call if you have any questions on this arrangement.

Thanks!
