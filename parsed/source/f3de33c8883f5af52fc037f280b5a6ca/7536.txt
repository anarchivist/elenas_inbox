                           EDUCATION OPPORTUNITY ZONES
                              QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
                             For internal use only -- May 7, 1998


What is the purpose of the Education Opportunity Zones?
This .initiative will help accelerate and expand progress in high-poverty urban and rural school
districts that are on the right track, and highlight models of success. Education Opportunity
Zones will demonstrate how a serious approach to high standards beriefits all students. Funds
will be targeted to improve low perfonning schools, expand opportunities for student
achievement, broaden choices for families, and hold schools, teachers, and students accountable
for results.

How do the Zones relate to the President's other new initiatives?
Education opportunity zones are part of a broader set of initiatives to help strengthen urban and
rural schools. President Clinton has also proposed new initiatives to reduce class size in the
primary grades, modernize school buildings, recruit and prepare teachers for underserved urban
and rural areas, and dramatically expand the availability and quality of child care and after-school
learning opportunities. These and other proposals will have a powerful impact on improving the
prospects of children in some of our poorest communities.

Are you proposing this initiative as an alternative to respond to Republican calls for
vouchers?
The President is committed to strengthening public schools, not abandoning them. Along with
other new initiatives that will help raise achievement for urban and rural students, like school
construction and teacher recruitment and preparation, we are proposing Education Opportunity
Zones in response to the clear need for sharp improvements in the nation's poorest school
districts and to encourage and expand promising school refonn efforts that are taking a
disciplined, effective approach centered on high standards. The fact is that 90% of our students
attend public schools, and our primary responsibility, especially with limited federal resources, is
to make sure that the public schools they attend are among the best in the world. This means
concentrating our time and money on raising academic standards, improving teaching, providing
schools with technology and other up-to-date learning tools, and creating charter schools and
other fonns of choice within the public school system. In contrast to vouchers, the Education
Opportunity Zones will support effective local efforts to improve education for all students in
participating districts, rather than just a few.

What kind of support do you expect to receive in Congress?
We were pleased to note that when introduced in Congress by Senator Kennedy and
Congressman Clay they were joined by TK co-sponsors in the House and TK co-spoonsors in the
Senate. Improving public schools in our most disadvantaged communities should be a
bipartisan national priority. Lawmakers in both parties are keen on finding tough, effective
ways to address low achievement in some of our largest cities, and we expect this proposal to
gain strong bipartisan support.

How many grants are expected to be awarded and what will be their size?
The Zone initiative would invest approximately $200 million in FY 99, and $l.5 billion over five
years. We expect to fund over 50 grants to urban and rural communities. The Zones will be
selected in two rounds, the first in FY 1999, and the second in FY 200l. Grants will be awarded
for 3 years. Districts may receive further support in years 4 and 5 only if they have
demonstrated success in reaching the agreed benchmarks.

 How do these new Zones differ from Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities?
 The Education Opportunity Zones initiative and the EZ/EC initiative support one another, but are
 distinct. Education Opportunity Zones will consist of entire school districts or consortia of
 school districts. Empowennent Zones and Enterprise Communities are specific neighborhoods
 or regions that mayor may not be contiguous with school districts. While both are in the spirit
 of bringing the community together behind focused efforts to address local challenges, Education
.Opportunity Zones are especially designed to address the educational needs of their communities
 and school districts, whereas the EZ/EC initiative is aimed at broader community revitalization
 strategies, which can include education but also extend to economic development, community
 development, and job training. Communities with a strong EZ/EC effort with a significant focus
 on education will be well-positioned to rally the community together behind the kinds of
 effective school refonns that will be supported by Education Opportunity Zones.

Do Zone districts have to participate in the national tests?
No. We are pleased that 16 major school districts have already made a commitment to take part
in the national tests of 4th grade reading and 8th grade math, but participation in these tests is
voluntary. However, successful Education Opportunity Zone applicants must show that they
have finnly integrated challenging standards and tests (which could include state, local, or
national assessments) into their strategies for raising student achievement.

Will Education Opportunity Zones receive a preference for other initiatives, such as school
construction funding?
At this time, there are no plans to provide additional incentives for participation beyond in the
Education Opportunity Zones initiative beyond the added funding and flexibility that all Zones
will receive. However, other new initiatives will include features targeting assistance on the
kinds of high poverty communities that the Zones are designed to assist.

                   STRENGTHENING URBAN AND RURAL SCHOOLS·
                                  May 7, 1998

       I challenge every school district to adopt high standards, to abolish social promotion, to
       move aggressively to help all students make the grade through tutoring, and summer
       schools, and to hold schools accountable for results, giving them the tools and the
       leadership and the parental involvement to do the job.
                                                          -- President Bill Clinton, October 28, 1997

HELPING RAISE ACHIEVEMENT FOR STUDENTS IN HIGH POVERTY
COMMUNITIES. President Clinton's Education Opportunity Zones initiative will strengthen
public schools and help students master the basics where the need is the greatest: in high poverty
urban and· rural communities where low expectations, too many poorly prepared teachers, and
overwhelmed school systems create significant barriers to high achievement. The Education
Department will select approximately 50 high poverty urban and rural school districts that agree
to: (1) end social promotion and tum around failing schools; (2) prevent students from falling
behind by ensuring quality teaching, challenging curricula, and extended learning time; and
(3)use high standards and tests of student achievement to identify and provide help to students,
teachers and schools who need it. Added investments in these communities will accelerate their
progress and provide successful models of system-wide, standards-based reform for the nation.
The President's initiative will invest $200.million in FY99, and $1.5 billion over 5 years, to raise
achievement and share lessons learned with school districts around the country.

ENDING SOCIAL PROMOTION, AND GIVING SCHOOLS THE TOOLS TO HELP
EVERY CHILD MEET HIGH EXPECTATIONS. To be selected as Education Opportunity
Zones, school districts will have to demonstrate that they are using their existing funds effectively
to raise student achievement by: · holding schools accountable for helping students reach high
academic standards, including rewarding schools that succeed and intervening in schools that fail
to make progress;          · holding teachers and principals accountable for quality, including
rewarding outstanding teachers, providing help to teachers who need it, and fairly and quickly
removing ineffective teachers;          · ensuring students don't fall behind, by providing a rich
curriculum, good teaching and extended learning opportunities; · ending social promotions and
requiring students to meet academic standards at key transition points in their academic careers;
and · providing students and parents with school report cards and expanded choice· within public
education.

EXTRA RESOURCES TO IMPROVE TEACHING, LEARNING, AND LEADERSHIP.
School districts will use Education Opportunity Zone funds to support standards-based,
district-wide reforms such as: · rewarding schools that make significant gains in student
achievement; · turning around low-performing schools by implementing proven reform models,
or closing them down and reconstituting them; · providing extra help to students who need it to
meet challenging standards, through after-school, Saturday, and/or summer school programs; ·
building stronger partnerships between schools and parents, businesses, and communities; ·
                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion

implementing sound management practices and accountability systems; · providing intensive
professional development to teachers and principals; · helping outstanding teachers earn master
teacher certification from the National Board for Professional Teacher Standards and rewarding
them when they do; and · implementing programs to identify low performing teachers, assist
them to improve, and fairly remove them if they fail to do so.

COMPETITIVE GRANTS TO SUPPORT PROMISING MODELS. Districts will be.
selected as Education. Opportunity Zones under a competitive, peer-review process. A mix of
large and smaller urban areas will be selected to participate, as well as rural school districts and
consortia.    Each urban Education Opportunity Zone will receive a 3-year grant of $10-25
million per year (depending upon size and proposed activities), and each rural Zone will receive
from $250,000 to $3 million (for consortia). Zones will be selected in two rounds, the first in
FY 1999, and the second in FY 2001. Successful applicants will have broad-based partnerships
to support their reforms -- including parents, teachers, local government, business and civic
groups, institutions of higher education and other key stakeholders. Successful applications will
show how the district will use all available resources -- federal, state, and local, as well as any
business or foundation funds -- to carry out its reform strategy and maintain it once these federal
funds are no longer available.

REWARDS FOR DEMONSTRATED STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT GAINS.                                       Each
Education Opportunity Zone will agree to specific, ambitious, benchmarks for improved student
achievement, lower dropout rates and other indicators of success, for districtwide performance
and specific student subgroups. Districts may receive further support in years 4 and 5 only if
they have demonstrated success in reaching those benchmarks.

GREATER FLEXIBILITY IN USING OTHER FEDERAL RESOURCES. All schools in
an Education Opportunity Zone school district receiving Title I funds will become eligible for
schoolwide flexibility in the use of federal education funds. Requirements pertaining to school
accountability, as well as special education, health, safety, and civil rights, will continue to be
met.

ASSISTANCE TO HELP DISTRICTS FIND AND SHARE WHAT WORKS. The
Department of Education will offer technical assistance, use technology to help districts consult
with each other, and disseminate lessons learned to communities nationwide. Special attention
will be given to helping school districts design and implement strategies for providing students
who need it with early intervention and extra help to enable them to meet promotion standards.
In addition, a national evaluation of the Education Opportunity Zones will be conducted, with the
results helping to inform the next reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education
Act.

BOLD ACTION TO HELP CHILDREN IN OUR CITIES AND RURAL AREAS.
Education Opportunity Zones are part of a broader set of initiatives to help strengthen
high-poverty urban and rural schools. President Clinton is also proposing new initiatives to
reduce class size in the primary grades, modernize school buildings, recruit and prepare teachers

for underserved urban and rural areas, and dramatically expand the availability and quality of
child care and after-school learning opportunities. These and other proposals will have a
