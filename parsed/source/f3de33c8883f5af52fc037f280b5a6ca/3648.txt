TEXT:
States to Mention
I propose to substitute some different states as examples to make the list
of states praised more bipartisan.

On page 3
         Instead of Florida giving tax credits, list Pennsylvania and
Massachusetts (this will also keep Florida from being mentioned twice) .
         Take out Washington (leave North Carolina) re: public/private
partnerships
On page 5 --
         Challenge every state to follow Maryland's lead to take the money
saved from case load reduction and use it for welfare reform (take out
Indiana and Oregon -- they aren't great examples anyway) .
With these changes, we will praise--
         Pennsylania                     North Carolina
        Wisconsin (twice)                Florida
        Michigan                         Kentucky
        Massachusetts                    Maryland
        Also, Governor Carper and Thompson will be mentioned name as
co-chairs of the Welfare to Work Partnership Advisory Council.

Child Care Question for Bruce and Elena
On page 4 -- do we want to mention the White House Child Care conference
here? We had originally thought no, because the conference will focus on
child care beyond the welfare realm.  However, I think the way it's done
here gives it a universal theme -- particularly after the President's call
for more universal, seamless systems.   So I'd be happy to leave it in.
Question: have we announced the date of the conference yet?

Question for Emily
Diana asked me last night if it's excessive on page 2 to say that
"Governors were central to this battle for fairness" in restoring legal
immigrant and food stamp cuts. It sounds like it is, although we could
say it anyway.  What do you think?
