TEXT:
As you know, on Wednesday (11/19) the President will sign into law the
D.C. Appropriations bill. A small signing ceremony is scheduled to
highlight the D.C. funding.  But it would be a shame not to highlight and
take credit for the important relief provided to Central American refugees
also included in this bill.   (The immigrants who will benefit most from
the bill's provisions are located in Florida, Illinois, Texas and
California). Does it make sense to try and schedule an event with the
VPOTUS for sometime in early December to celebrate these changes and also
the Section 245(i) relief provided to immigrants in the
Commerce-Just ice-State Appropriations bill once it has been signed?     I
believe there would be considerable interest for such an event from the
Congressional Hispanic Caucus,. Ambassadors from the relevant countries and
from the groups in the immigration community.   please advise.
