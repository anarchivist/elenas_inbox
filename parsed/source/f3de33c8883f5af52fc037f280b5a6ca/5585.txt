TEXT:
It turns out that Ken Apfel has decided to change the content of the
children's SSI report -- he wants to review ALL the children that have
been denied, not just the groups. targeted earlier (mental retardation,
low-performing states). We can talk about this if you like.      It will be
somewhat harder to argue in the media that SSA did a good job if we are
re-reviewing everything. Also, the Republicans will not like it, although
our response is that we are not changing the standard, which they view as
the most important thing.   OMB is wondering if this is necessary, and so
we are meeting with SSA tomorrow on it.   I am not inclined to'second guess
this decision -- it's their report, this decision is widely known within
SSA, and I certainly wouldn't want to be in the position of arguing from
here for fewer reviews.

So I'll have to rewrite the memo.  The report won't be released until late
next week or even the week of Christmas.  I'm keeping Sylvia's office
informed.
