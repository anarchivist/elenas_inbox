TEXT:
No, the first "correctly" is necessary for the point made in the footnote
and it does not appear to raise the same concerns that we are endorsing a
finding that the cutoff score violated Title VI. This is the point, i.e.,
that Title VII standards provide guidance on Title VI, that the NCAA does
not dispute.
