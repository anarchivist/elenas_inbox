TEXT:
I just talked to Anne Kennedy, and it appears that they won't be
ready to go tommorrow - the Secretary wants to discuss this with
the Chief tommorrow, and then he doesn't want it released when
he's out in the Pacific Northwest for the rest of the week (for
fear it will draw news away from the issues he wants to focus on
while he's there.)  So it looks like it will be put off next week.

Obviously, that does give people more time to get answers,
although as I mentioned to Ray tonight, the Forest Service is very
decentralized, and getting anything much more precise than a range
of 15-25% will be very difficult.   However, I'll see if they can
give a better sense of regional impacts.   California would clearly
be one of the major areas of impact, however.
USDA is working on a draft press release and Qs and As that they
will send around tommorrow.   I think those will be helpful in
flushing out how to explain the directive.   Jim will call the
labor contact tommorrow.
While this does give everyone more time to get answers, I have to
say that it also. means there will probably be more sales released
that people will be very unhappy about. Also, from a Pac NW point
of view, it's rather a shame that we've got both Glickman and
Babbit, as well as Katie out in the Pac. NW without a positive
timber message (other than the case we just won.)   However, unless
things change again in the am over at USDA (which is not
impossible) the track now seems to be for next Monday or Tuesday.
