the four HMOs in Massachusetts that participate in the Medicare program to unveil a one-week
opportunity to modify their benefit packages as an incentive to stay in the program. In the
absence of this action, at least one HMO -- which was providing the state's most comprehensive
drug benefit to thousands of Medicare beneficiaries -- had indicated it would have to withdraw
from the program. The HHS offer, which was coordinated with Senator Kennedy's office, was
extremely well received by both the Governors' office, the plans, beneficiaries, and the state
press. This was the case because it gave the political establishment the opportunity to pressure
the health plans to not only stay in the program, but to also lobby the HMOs to offer equally
substantial drug benefits. So far, three of the four plans have agreed to offer comprehensive
drug benefits, as long as the fourth HMO (Harvard Community Health Plan) does so as well.
(The plans believe that they will not be subjected to disproportionate adverse selection if all
HMOs offer the similar drug benefits.) We will know by next Tuesday if the Governor and
Senator Kennedy was successful in convincing Harvard Community to be responsive. If they
are not, the other plans will likely submit alternative plans that protect them against adverse
selection -- no doubt with much lesser drug benefits. If this occurs, Senator Kennedy's office
believes that we (and they) are well positioned to blame the plans, and not HHS, for this
situation.
