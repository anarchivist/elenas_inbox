TEXT:
I have a copy of NBAC's letter to the President. I think he should
probably see it and have it explained.

Therefore, might I suggest that you do a joint DPC/OSTP short cover note
to go on top of the letter. Could I get maybe get it by the end of the
day? Thanks.

If you think this is not the way to go, let me know.
