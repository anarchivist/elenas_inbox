TEXT:
Governors Carper and Chiles staff just called me.   Their bosses are in
town, asked them to call ASAP to ask the possibility of getting a limited
FICA exemption added to the Continuing Resolution.  I checked in with
Barry White, who said that the firm agreement with the leaderships is that
the CRs will only have those things necessary to keep the programs
running, and that we may have a series of one-day CRs this week as
negotiations continued.  I relayed this to Martha and Karen.

FYI -- they suggested a new way of doing a FICA exemption    a clause that
would say
"no FICA/FUTA liability until the IRS rules."  Kind of an interesting idea.
