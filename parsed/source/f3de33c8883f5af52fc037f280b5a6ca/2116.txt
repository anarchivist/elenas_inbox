TEXT:
This morning I said we'd no longer need the bucket: if the budget agreement
becomes law.
Not exactly so.  Even with the budget agreement, some legal immigrants --
the elderly non-disabled -- who were in the U.S. before the welfare law
was enacted will not get Medicaid coverage.  States who wish to cover them
without vastly expanding their Medicaid programs could do so if the bucket
were enacted.
