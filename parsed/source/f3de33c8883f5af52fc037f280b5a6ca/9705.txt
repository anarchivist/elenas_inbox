TEXT:
Here is the Goals 2000 language from OMB. It does exactly what the memo to
Erskine says it does.  I think its worth trading for another year of test
develoment/pilot testing, though at some point soon we may be better off
holding on to what we have in Goals 2000, losing on the test, and letting
the President make the case to the country that we are for higher
standards, tests and accountablity and they are not. Somedays it seems
that might be worth more than pilot tests.
