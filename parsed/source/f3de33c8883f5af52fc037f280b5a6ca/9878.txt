                            DRAFT PUBLIC STATEMENT ON PUBLIC CHARGE


           Today, the [Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of
           Agriculture] made public an Administration decision that past or current use of Medicaid,
           the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and/or Food Stamps will not be
           considered in determining whether a legal immigrant is a "public charge," except where an
           individual has received institutionalized care funded by Medicaid. Guidance will be
           issued by the Department of Justice and the State Department clarifying that health
           insurance and nutritional benefits are cost effective, important to public health, and do not
           provide any unique, additional information that would lead to a public charge
           determination.

           Determination as a "public charge" has significant consequences for an immigrant -- it can
           cause them to be denied admission to or permanent residency in the United States.
           Concern about public charge determinations has prevented legal immigrants from
           enrolling themselves or their children in the Medicaid. Law-abiding immigrants who are
           eligible for Medicaid often worry that receiving these benefits could result in INS action
           against them or their families. This fear has not only interfered with the goal of signing up
           eligible children for health insurance, but in some cases has caused sick or injured people
           to unnecessarily forego health care. This has created uncompensated health care costs for
           hospitals, other providers, and states. It also poses a risk to the public health since the
           lack of treatment of uninsured legal immigrants for communicable diseases could endanger
           citizens at large.

           Concern over the public charge rules has also discouraged legal immigrants who are
           working at low-wage jobs from applying for Food Stamps for themselves and their
           children. Food Stamps provides a nutritional safety net for both the working and
           non-working poor. This Spring, Congress enacted the Administration proposal to restore
           Food Stamp benefits to 240,000 legal immigrants beginning November 1, 1998. The policy
           being announced today will remove any concerns that the use of Food Stamps and other
           nutrition assistance programs, such as nutrition assistance to Women, Infants, and
           Children (WIC), by these immigrants would result in a public charge determination.

           The detailed DOJ and State Department guidance containing this clarification, which will
           be issued shortly, will comprehensively address policies on public charge determinations.
           We look forward to working with immigration officials, state health officials, and others to
           ensure that misunderstanding and fear do not stand in the way of legal immigrants
           receiving important benefits.

                                                                        Automated Records Management System
                                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion
