CONCEALED WEAPONS DEBATE
               2 Gun Bills Dropped
               A shooting spree that claimed at least 15 people
               at Littleton's Columbine High School prompted
               two legislative leaders to kill their major gun bills
               for the 1999 legislative session. "I'm pulling it,"
               said House Majority Leader Doug Dean,
               R-Colorado Springs. That means his measure,
               SB84, up for consideration before a major
               committee this week, won't be heard, and will
               die when the Legislature adjourns on May 5. He
               said he had reported his decision to Gov. Bill
               Owens, and Owens had a agreed with the
               decision. Rep. Gary McPherson, R-Aurora,
               sponsor of a bill to let a state law override local
               ordinances on gun control, said earlier he is
               asking his bill be set aside and a conference
               committee's recommendation not be acted upon.
               Dean was emotionally distraught as he explained
               his reasons for withdrawing his bill. He had
               gotten lots of calls at his Colorado Springs home,
               some of them with "veiled threats," he said. And
               others had blamed him for the incident at
               Columbine. Sen. Ken Chlouber, R-Leadville,
               original sponsor of the bill, also said he had
               gotten calls "from both sides." "Our first
               responsibility is to the families and friends of the
               innocent victims of the senseless and lawlews
               act at Columbine High School," Chlouber said.

                    "Any action taken by the General Assembly on
                    this emotionally charged issue would only add to
                    the griev and anxiety experrienced by all
                    Colorans today," he said. "All members of the
                    Colorado General Assembly join with us in
                    expressing our heartfeld sympathy to all those
                    affected by the events of April 20, 1999," Dean
                    said. Dean said he had not notified the National
                    Rifle Association, which had helped draft the bill
                    and lobbied for it, about his decision. (Copyright
