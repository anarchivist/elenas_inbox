Dear Senator xxxxx:

       Next week we have an historic opportunity to renew our democracy and strengthen our
country. For the first time in a generation, Members of the United States Senate will have the
opportunity to cast a vote for bipartisan campaign finance reform legislation that will make our
democracy work better for all Americans.

        Our democracy is the oldest and most successful in the world. But we know that there
is something deeply wrong with the way we pay for elections. Our campaign finance laws were
last rewritten 23 years ago. For quite a long while those laws worked well, but they have been
overwhelmed by a flood of money and the rising cost of campaigns.

       Spending in congressional campaigns has risen sixfold in the last two decades. That's
more than three times the rate of inflation. Now both political parties are locked into an
ever-escalating arms race, as they compete to raise more and more money. There's simply too
much money required for campaigns, it takes too much time to raise, and it raises too many
questions.

        Our system of campaign finance has placed too much power in the hands special interests
who promote own concerns at the expense of the public interest. Too often they operate in
secret. Too often they have special privileges ordinary Americans don't even know exist. And
elections, where ordinary voters should have the loudest voice, have become so expensive that
big money can sometimes drown those voices out.

        Yet we have made progress. In 1993, we repealed the tax loophole that lets lobbyists
deduct the cost of their activities. In early 1994, Congress passed a law that applies to Congress
the laws they impose on the private sector. And in 1995, Congress answered my call to stop
taking gifts, meals, and trips from lobbyists, and sent to my desk the bipartisan Lobbying
Disclosure Act which is bringing lobbyists out from the darkrooms and into the bright light of
public scrutiny.

        Now we have the chance to make the way we finance campaigns work better. The
Senate is about to consider campaign finance reform legislation that puts an end to the soft
money system, expands disclosure requirements, increases penalties for election law violations,
and strengthens the rules for so-called independent expenditure campaigns.

      For these reasons, I have supported in the past and continue to support the
McCain- Feingold Senate Campaign Finance Reform Act and I urge the Senate to pass it.

       As we work to reform campaign finance, we must do everything we can to ensure that we
open, not limit, the political process. Our goal is to take the reins of our democracy away from
big special interests, from big money, and to put them back into the hands of ordinary Americans
where they belong. Our bottom line test should be: Will our efforts make our government
                                                                          Hex-Oump Conversion

more representative, not less representative? Will refonn make our elected representatives more
likely to promote the public interest, even when it conflicts with powerful special interests. On
all these counts, the McCain-Feingold bill meets the test.

       A critical mass has been reached for campaign finance refonn. Citizen groups, spurred by
business executives and civic leaders, have gathered one million signatures on a petition to
Congress calling for refonn. Presidents Ford, Carter, and Bush have been joined by dozens of
former lawmakers in calling for refonn.

      If you want to restore the American peoples faith in our democracy vote for
McCain-F eingo ld.


                                           Sincerely,


                                   William Jefferson Clinton
