TEXT:
Just a heads up that Eli Segal is likely to put in a call to Bruce and
maybe others to express concerns about the focus of the event.  There is
some brewing tension between DOL and the Partnership about whether this is
primarily a business-focused event for the Partnership or an event to
highlight Welfare-to-Work grants.  So far, this is coming out in terms of
a struggle over invites -- it may also play out as we focus in on
message.  Eli feels the President clearly sees this as a celebration of
the Partnership. However, because we are also announcing Wtw grants, DOL
also feels a big stake.
