TEXT:
Unfortunately, in addition to our mtg w. the CHC at 11:30am on Mon, Jan
26th, the Women's Caucus is also doing their monthly meeting on Monday.·
Can anyone cover the women's mtg from 2-3pm on Monday in 1640 Longworth.
I understand that it is an extremely inconvenient time, but I am forced to
work within their schedules.  I guess we will try to do the best that we
can to cover.  Thanks.
