I agree, but I need to know -- did you put this item in last week? If so,
do you think there's more he should know about the bonuses (maybe that
we're leaking)--

Welfare Reform -- Performance.Bonuses: We are now nearly ready to
announce two new nationwide competitions to promote work and personal
responsibility.  The first competition will award $1 billion in bonuses
$200 million a year over the next five years -- to states that do the best
job of placing welfare recipients into jobs and helping them succeed in
the work place.  Sixty percent of the funds will be distributed based on
statesO, success in placing people in jobs (40 percent to states with the
highest job entry rate and 20 percent for those with the most improved
rate).  Forty percent of the funds will be distributed based on how well
former recipients succeed in the work place, a measure based on job
retention and earnings gains (with 25 percent for absolute achievement and
15 percent for improvement). The second bonus will distribute $100
million a year to states that reduce their O&illegitimacy ratio08 i.e.,
the percentage of children born out of wedlock (by statute, states must
also have an abortion rate lower than their 1995 rate to win the bonus) .
We would issue these policies through proposed regulations, which would
interpret the statutory provisions.
