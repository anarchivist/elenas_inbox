President Holds Town Meeting to Promote His Plan for National Standards and Tests
Today President Clinton held an Education Town Meeting at Robert C. Byrd High School in
Clarksburg, West Virginia. West Virginia has been a leader in the use of technology in schools,
in increasing math achievement of their students, and today has signed onto the President's
national standards and testing proposal. The President met with 160 parents, students, teachers,
business and community leaders and others interested in education, to discuss his plans for
national standards and tests and how we can prepare young people for the future. Participants in
the meeting were selected by Robert Skittle, Superintendent of the local Harrison County school
system.

West Virginia has been a national leader in the use of technology in classrooms. The state's 11
-to- 1 student-computer ratio in elementary schools is one ofthe lowest in the nation. To date,
14,000 educators have been trained to use computers for basic skills instruction. Forty percent of
West Virginia's schools are now connected to the Internet, and state officials plan to reach 85%
in 1997.

West Virginia has demonstrated substantial improvement in 4th grade and 8th grade math
during the 1990s. Between 1992 and 1996, West Virginia's average 4th grade math score
increased by 8 points, together with a 6 point increase for 8th grade math, on the National
Assessment of Education Progress (NAEP), which tests a sample of students in each
participating state. Among all of the states, West Virginia tied for the third highest
improvement at both grade levels on NAEP.

In his State of the Union Address, President Clinton called on every state to adopt high national
standards and tests in 4th grade reading and 8th grade math, in order to make sure that every
student masters these basic skills. The new tests will be based on the widely used National
Assessment of Education Progress, and will measure individual student performance against
widely accepted content standards used by NAEP. The tests will be available for use in the
Spring of 1999.


Growing Bipartisan Support for National Tests in 4th Grade Reading and 8th Grade
Math: Leaders in West Virginia and Massachusetts pledge their support. President
Clinton's call for national standards and tests in 4th grade reading and 8th grade math received
additional bipartisan support today, as Governor Underwood and state education officials in West
Virginia, and Governor Weld and state education officials in Massachusetts, announced plans to
participate in the testing initiative. They join officials in Maryland, Michigan, North Carolina,
California, and the Department of Defense schools, who have already endorsed this testing
initiative in 1999.

                                                      Automated Records Management System
                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion
of the Board of the National Alliance of Business, announced NAB's endorsement of the
President's testing initiative. NAB represents small, medium and large size businesses.
Following a survey of its members which revealed strong overall support for the President's
testing initiative, NAB announced its full support for President Clinton's testing initiative, and
promised to bring this message to other business organizations. NAB now joins the Business
Roundtable and more than 240 high-tech CEO's who have already endorsed these tests. The
strong support of the business community underscores the fact that in order for individuals to
compete in a global economy and a geographically mobile society, our nation must set and our
students must bee challenging national standards.


President Explains Standards
Using an example of the kind of questions students will be expected to answer on the 4th grade
reading test, President Clinton helped town meeting participants understand clearly the kinds of
knowledge and skills students must master in order to meet national standards. The President
called on 4th grade student Hannah Galey to read a passage from Charlotte's Web as he worked
through the sample reading question for the audience.
