         I talked with Laura Nichols this afternoon. They want to do a drug event
         before the 30th ( when Newt does his big drug announcement ) and then go
         to tobacco on the 30th. For example:
                  an event with McCaffery on Tuesday or Wednesday (they hear he is
         talking to the VP about doing something about the media ads. ) This could
         be on teh Hill or here .They recognize a possible problem with the CBC
         calling for McCaffery's resignation this afternoon but still want to go
         ahead.
              -- then on the 30th do something big with tobacco , maybe with outside
         groups (Koop, Kessler, etc) drawing distinction with the skinny bill.
               Laura says he has checked with Senate and they like this plan.   They
         don't necessairly need WH participaiton but would like it and in any case
         want us to know what they're thinking.
                My calendar shows a bipartisan leadership meeting the morning of the
         29th with likely tobacco statement, plus the Olympics reception that
         afternoon which ONDCP has suggested could be place to talk abotu drugs.
               I will talk to Laura and to Senate side on Monday ; we should discuss
         Monday morning.
