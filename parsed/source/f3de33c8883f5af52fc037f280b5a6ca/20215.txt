The Honorable William F. Goodling
Chairman
Committee on Education and the Workforce
U.S. House of Representatives
Washington, D. C.   20515

Dear Chairman Goodling:

Your Committee is scheduled to consider H.R. 2869, 2661 and 2873, bills
which would amend the Occupational Safety and Health Act.  The Department
of Labor opposes these three bills, each of which is unnecessary and would
undermine OSHAO,s ability to protect workers.

H.R. 2869 -- Non-Disclosure of Audits

The Department is deeply concerned with the extraordinarily broad
evidentiary privilege this bill would accord to employer self-audit
documents.  The bill, as introduced, would provide that records, reports,
safety and health assessments, audits, and reviews conducted by or for the
employer, would not be required to be disclosed in any OSHA inspection,
investigation, or enforcement proceeding.  Thus, this bill would immunize
from discovery an enormous amount of information critical to protecting
workerD,s safety and health. This provision would vastly complicate OSHA
enforcement, forcing the agency to arrive at conclusions about workplace
hazards and accidents without input from safety professionals and
consultants with firsthand knowledge.  In cases like Tewksbury Metals
(where the employer ignored insurance company advice and state consultant
recommendations and an employee was severely injured as a result), access
to consultantsD, reports is essential to establishing responsibility.   In
many other cases, particularly in fatality and catastrophe investigations,
self-audit records and reports are the most reliable, and often the only,
means of establishing the facts.

In practice, an employerD,s self-audit records are often used to benefit
employers who have made good faith efforts to protect their workers.   OSHA
typically provides substantial penalty reductions to those employers who
can show they have acted in good faith.  Self-audit reports are often the
best way for a conscientious employer to demonstrate its good faith.· As a
result this provision would protect only employers who have identified
hazards and consciously failed to correct them.

The fact that the bill contains an exception for "safety and health
assessments prescribed under section 6(b) (7)" of the OSH Act does little
to ameliorate the billD,s harmful effects on enforcement of OSHA


requirements.  That section of the Act specifically addresses only a
limited class of requirements dealing with medical surveillance and
exposure monitoring, so the bill would leave the vast majority of
workplace safety and health assessments required by OSHA rules off-limits
to scrutiny by OSHA, the Review Commission and the courts.   Furthermore,
many of OSHAD,s audit requirements are expressed in general,
performance-oriented terms, making it difficult if not impossible to
discern the line between mandatory and voluntary audit activity.

Contrary to some claims, this bill bears no resemblance to the
Environmental Protection AgencyU,s (EPA) audit-related policies.   In order
to gain the audit privilege under the EPAO,s program, a business must (1)
discover a shortcoming through an environmental audit or due diligence;
(2) disclose the violation, in writing, to the EPA within 10 days: and (3)
remedy the violation within 60 days.

H.R. 2661 :-- Duplicative "Peer" Review

The "Sound Scientific Practices Act" would require the Secretary to create
an advisory panel to review scientific and economic data every time OSHA
proposes a new standard.   This additional committee is unnecessary,
duplicative and would create serious delays in our rulemaking process -- a
process that many already criticize as taking too long.

Today, major rules can take as many as eight years for OSHA to publish,
leaving workers exposed to hazards every day. During that time OSHA (1)
engages in notice and comment rulemaking; (2) conducts economic and risk
analyses; (3) assesses impact on small business and, depending upon that
impact, convenes a small business panel under the Small Business
Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act; (4) surveys industries; (5) conducts
reviews of research on selected topics; and (6) engages in a rigorous
hearing process. OSHAn,s hearing process allows any scientist or
interested lay person the opportunity to cross-examine on the record OSHA
officials or the agencyC}, s expert witnesses 'on any portion of a proposed
rule. This process generally affords more rigorous review than typically
occurs when a closed panel is convened.

In addition, OSHA already conducts traditional peer review when it is
appropriate. When OSHA ventures into new areas, the agency frequently has
elements of its proposals peer reviewed.  For example, OSHA held peer
reviews for its risk assessment in the tuberculosis proposal. While peer
review can be helpful in some circumstances, requiring it in every
situation would lead to absurd and costly results.  For example, there
would appear to be little need to "peer review" a requirement that
flammable or combustible liquids be kept away from heat sources.
Unfortunately, under this bill, OSHA would be required to conduct
countless peer reviews that would otherwise be considered completely
unnecessary.

Proponents of this bill have argued that peer review will reduce criticism
and shorten the rulemaking process. We believe that this argument is
inaccurate. Opponents of particular standards have demonstrated that they
will continue to oppose certain initiatives regardless of peer review.
For example, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health
provided an unprecedented opportunity for 26 peer reviewers to analyze and
comment on its extensive review of ergonomics literature. Despite that p
eer review, opponents of a protective standard argued against the peer
reviewed report and subsequently requested yet another peer review by
another entity. As this instance demonstrates, it is entirely possible
that the peer review itself will create an additional source of


contention, rather than foster agreement.  Opponents of a regulation are
likely to dispute the make-up of any peer review panel or challenge a
panelD,s findings that are contrary to their own positions.

H.R. 2873 -- Risk Analysis

H.R. 2873 would require OSHA to conduct an individual risk assessment and
cost-benefit analysis for each industry affected by a proposed standard.
The Supreme Court has determined that, under the OSH Act, OSHA cannot use
cost-benefit analyses to set health standards for the Nation's
workplaces. OSHA agrees, however, that comprehensive and accurate risk
assessments and economic analyses are valuable informational tools. The
agency devotes considerable effort to making these documents clear and
methodologically sound.  For each rule, OSHA'conducts detailed risk
assessments, develops extensive significance-of-risk analysis,
demonstrates technological and economic feasibility (including an
assessment of costs), evaluates benefits, and assesses impacts.   Cost e
stimates and feasibility analyses are commonly conducted at the industry
level because data on the technological and financial status of each
industry that reflect real conditions in that industry are usually
publicly available.  However, it is rarely the case that industry-specific
data on risk are available; even when such data exist they generally
cannot be used to produce statistically meaningful results. While the
subcommittee amended the bill to allow OSHA to use proxy information from
similar "industries, operations, or processes" in cases "to the extent
that information is not available on the specific risks to workers," this
change does little to allay the DepartmentD,s concerns.

OSHA opposes H.R. 2873 for several reasons.  First, the agency believes
that workers should receive the same protection regardless of the industry
in which they are employed. A paint stripper exposed to lead faces the
same risk whether in the construction industry or the maritime industry.
The industry is irrelevant.  Second, the bill would have the deleterious
result of providing less protection for workers in industries that have
made few safety and health improvements.  Since laggard industries would h
ave higher costs to catch-up in protecting their workforce, a strict
cost-benefit analysis may prevent OSHA from regulating in industries least
concerned with safety and health. Third, H.R. 2873 would require detailed
risk assessments for minor changes in a regulation, impeding the agency
from simplifying standards and eliminating unnecessary rules.  Minor
adjustments to basic standards on ladder safety, for example, would
require that OSHA estimate risk, cost, and benefits for the impact on
thousands of industries. OSHA would be required to examine cost data,
ladder use statistics and other data for all sectors.  The magnitude of
this task would slow down significantly the agencyD,s simplification
efforts, delaying worker protections without any analytical benefit.
Finally, the bill would inevitably require OSHA to place a value on human
life, a highly speculative and controversial exercise.



The Office of Management and Budget advises that there is no objection to
the presentation of this report from the standpoint of the
AdministrationD,s program.

                                                Sincerely,



                                                Alexis M. Herman
