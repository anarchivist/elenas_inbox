TEXT:
I'm reviewing the draft class size legislation.  Following standard
Education Department practice and Congressional practice, ED's draft has
set aside funds for the following purposes "off the top" of the annual
funding amount:

1. $2 million per year.for a program evaluation(out of at least $1.1
billion per year.) administered by the Education Department.   I think a
program evaluation is very important, and the price is certainly cheap
enough.  However, this would be money that stays at the federal level
rather than going to states.  Is this a serious problem in the tobacco
context, or is the amount so miniscule as to not cause a problem?

2. Up to 1% of the total funds for payments to the Outlying Areas (e.g.,
American Samoa, Guam, the Virgin Islands, and Northern Mariana Islands)
and the Bureau of Indian Affairs, to reduce class size in schools operated
by those jurisdictions. This is standard practice in all formula-driven
federal education programs to states.  I can't think of a good
justification for not following this practice in the class size bill;
unless the states would think that the territories and BIA shouldn't get a
piece of their action.  Please advise.
