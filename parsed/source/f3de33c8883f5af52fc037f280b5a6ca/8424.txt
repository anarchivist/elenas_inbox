TEXT:
The Senate Full Committee is scheduled to markup the C/J/S Appropriations
bill today at 2pm. Therefore', we need comments/clearance on the attached
committee letter no later than Noon.  Thanks.

The Honorable Ted Stevens
Chairman


committee of Appropriations
united States Senate
Washington, D.C. 20510

Dear Mr. Chairman:

        The purpose of this letter is to provide the Administration's
views on the Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and Related
Agencies Appropriations Bill, FY 1999, as approved by the Senate
Subcommittee. As the Committee develops its version of the bill, your
consideration of the Administration's views would be appreciated.  These
views are based on incomplete information and are, therefore, necessarily
preliminary.

        The Administration appreciates efforts by the Subcommittee to
accommodate certain of the PresidentD,s priorities within the 302(b)
allocation.  However, the allocation is simply insufficient to make the
necessary investments in programs funded by this bill. As a result,
critical programs are not funded or are underfunded.

        The only way to achieve the appropriate investment level is to
offset discretionary spending by using savings in other areas.  The
President's FY 1999 Budget proposes levels of discretionary spending for
FY 1999 that conform to the Bipartisan Budget Agreement by making savings
in mandatory and other programs available to help finance this spending.
In the recently enacted Transportation Equity Act, Congress -- on a broad,
bipartisan basis -- took similar action in approving funding for surface
transportation programs paid for with mandatory offsets. We want to work
with the Congress on mutually agreeable mandatory and other offsets that
would be used to increase high-priority discretionary programs, including
those funded by this bill.   In addition, we hope that the Committee will
reduce funding for lower priority and unrequested discretionary programs.,
such as the Local Law Enforcement Block Grant, and redirect funding to
programs of higher priority.

        Within the limited resources available, the Administration
believes that the Subcommittee has produced a balanced, responsible bill.
For example, we appreciate the Subcommittee's funding of law enforcement
programs in general and the COPS program in particular.  Funding COPS at
the requested level of $1.4 billion is consistent with the Balanced Budget
Agreement and would enable us to achieve the goal of hiring 100,000
additional police officers by the year 2000.  However, as the bill moves
through the process, we urge the Congress to consider additional sources
of mandatory savings that could be used to provide resources for other
priority discretionary programs.

        Below is a discussion of our specific concerns with the
Subcommittee bill. We look forward to working with you to resolve these
concerns as the bill moves forward.

Department of Commerce

        Statistics.  It is vitally important that Congress provide required
funding to upgrade the Nation's core statistical infrastructure.    The
Administration appreciates the Subcommittee's full funding of the
President's request for the Decennial Census, the NationD,s single largest
statistical operation and notes that the Subcommittee bill also includes
funding for a non-sampling plan through March 1,' 1999. We urge the
Committee to provide additional funds to improve our current measurements
of the Gross Domestic Product and Poverty Rate, fundamental economic


indicators crucial to sound private and public sector decision-making.
Increased funding also is vitally important to maintain the full
development of the Continuous Measurement program. This program will
provide critical demographic data about the Nations's communities every
year, rather than once every 10 years, and enable the Census Bureau to
eliminate the long form from the 2010 Decennial Census.

        National Institute of Standards and Technology. The Administration is
disappointed that the Subcommittee has provided a flat funding level --
$193 million -- for the Advanced Technology Program. This would result in
a 40-percent cut below the requested new award grant level, thus reducing
support for cutting-edge research proposals to only $55 million.  Finally,
the Administration is concerned that the Subcommittee bill may allocate
funds to non-competitive, unevaluated projects and that full funding for
the new Advanced Measurement Laboratory is not provided. Absent full
funding, NIST will not have sufficient funds to build this facility.

        National Information Infrastructure Grants Program.  The Administration
urges the Committee to provide the full request for the National
Information Infrastructure program (NIl), and to exclude language limiting
award eligibility. The NIl program is meritorious, providing seed money
for innovative projects that deploy, use, and evaluate advanced
information technology.  The program has generated over $200 million in
matching funds and continues to be in demand, as is evidenced by its 18 to
1 application-to-award ratio.

        National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. While the
Administration appreciates the Subcommittee's support for the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), we are concerned about
reductions to the Clean Water and Polar Convergence initiatives and the
substantial amount of funding for unrequested items. The Clean Water
initiative will provide coastal States with technical support to address
the critical environmental challenge of non-point source pollution and
implement on-the-ground management measures to control polluted runoff in
coastal areas. Convergence of the Departments of Commerce and Defense
polar orbiting satellites will generate significant taxpayer savings,
while improving weather warnings and forecasts.   The Subcommittee's
reduction would lead to contract delays and cutbacks in risk reduction
activities, and may necessitate a restructuring of a complex and carefully
negotiated mUlti-agency system.   In total, the Subcommittee has provided a
$159 million more for NOAA than requested by the President, much of it
earmarked for unrequested programs. We urge the Committee to reallocate
these funds. to priority programs within NOAA and elsewhere in the
Department.

        Economic Development Administration. We urge the Committee to restore
funding for the Economic Development Administration (EDA) to a level
closer to the Administration's request of $398 million. A recent study of
EDA's Public Works program indicates that EDA has achieved impressive
results in creating jobs, leveraging private sector dollars, and
increasing local tax bases. A reduction to EDA's Title IX (emergency
relief) and defense conversion programs would adversely affect EDA's
ability to help distressed communities deal with the burdens imposed by
industry downsizing and international trade agreements.

Department of Justice

        Drug Courts and Drug Testing and. Intervention. While the Administration
appreciates the $40 million provided for drug courts, $10 million over the
request, we are disappointed by the Subcommittee's failure to provide any


of the $85 million requested for the drug testing and intervention
program. Systematic-drug testing is a proven, cost-effective means of
using the coercive power of the criminal justice system to move
non-violent offenders into drug treatment programs.

         Immigration and Naturalization Service. The Administration's ~ipartisan
border management and enforcement strategy is built upon incremental
growth in the Immigration and Naturalization Service's (INS') enforcement
and support personnel and infrastructure.   The Subcommittee mark of $2.4
billion -- $350 million below the Administration's request -- is
insufficient to support the managed growth of INS and may jeopardize the'
Administration's five-year border enforcement strategy.   This level would
not fund the annualization costs for the 1,000 Border Patrol agents and
detention and investigative personnel that INS has hired in FY 1998 and
would not allow INS to add the requested 1,000 new Border Patrol agents in
FY 1999.   In addition, the Subcommittee's funding level would prevent INS
from increasing detention bed space to house apprehended illegal aliens
pending deportation and from enhancing physical barriers and inspection
technology along our borders.

        The Administration is very concerned that the Subcommittee bill
underfunds certain authorized discretionary programs -- such as the
Executive Office of Immigration Review -- and uses mandatory funds from
the immigration examination fee to support these discretionary programs.
The Subcommittee's action commits mandatory receipts and unobligated
balances that are essential to the processing and adjudication of
benefits.  The result would be insufficient resources to process pending
naturalization applications, which would have a direct impact on INS'
ability to reduce the citizenship application backlog.

        Juvenile Justice Block Grant.   The Administration appreciates the
Subcommittee's desire to provide additional support for juvenile justice
programs.  However, we are concerned that the $100 million block grant
program may authorize a broad and unfocused range of spending.   Rather tha
n funding the block grant, we urge the Committee to provide funding:   to
establish a community prosecutors program, which is designed to increase
the number of prosecutors who interact directly with the community; for
prosecutorial initiatives, which will reduce backlogs and enable
prosecutors' to prosecute youth drug, gang, and violence problems more
effectively; and, for youth violence courts, which will also improve the
effectiveness and expediency of the juvenile justice system.

Protection Against Chemical and Biological Weapons

        We appreciate the Subcommittee's support of the Administration's
request to increase funding to combat terrorism involving the use of
chemical and biological weapons.   However, we note that the Subcommittee
mark provides more than the requested level for first responder equipment,
and less than the requested level for bomb squad equipment and for funding
the development of Metropolitan Medical Strike Teams (MMSTs) by the
Department of Health and Human Services.  We continue to believe that the
levels proposed in the budget amendment reflect the appropriate balance
between all aspects of antiterrorism activities.

International Affairs Programs

        The Administration appreciates the Subcommittee's support for the
Department of State accounts that fund diplomatic and consular activities
and, in particular, funding the request for the State Department's
information technology modernization effort, including year 2000 (Y2K)


activities.  However, the Subcommittee's cuts and unrequested earmarks in
the Diplomatic and Consular Programs and Salaries and Expenses accounts,
totaling over $30 million, would prevent the Department from meeting
expected wage and price increases, covering critical overseas staffing
gaps, and addressing other infrastructure shortfalls.

        While the Administration is encouraged by the Subcommittee's
recognition of the Department's overseas facility requirements, we urge
the Committee to restore the $90 million reduction to the Security and
Maintenance of United States Missions account and to provide full funding
of the President's request for urgently needed embassy facilities in
Beijing and Berlin. The Administration appreciates the Subcommittee's
support for funding the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency's activities,
particularly in light of recent events in South Asia.

        Over the past several years, the Administration has worked with
Congress to address a variety of issues relating to U.S. participation in
the United Nations, U.N. peacekeeping, and other international
organizations. Although these efforts have not yet resulted in solutions,
there is considerable agreement on the direction of U.S. policy.  In that
light, the Administration appreciates the steps the Subcommittee has taken
to fund the request for arrearage payments this year.  The Administration
wants to work with the Congress to ensure that these funds are available
in a timely fashion to retain our influence in these organizations.



        Unfortunately, the Subcommittee bill significantly underfunds, by about
$75 million, the annual assessed contributions to these organizations.
This would increase arrears again, further inhibit chances for reforms we
are all seeking, and seriously constrain the ability bf the United States
to address foreign policy interests through the mechanism of U.N.
peacekeeping.  In addition, we understand that the Subcommittee has
imposed a number of certification requirements and conditions before
payments by the United States to these organizations' can be made.  The
consequence of these provisions would likely be the loss of vote of the
United States in the United Nations and other international organizations.

        The Administration is very concerned that funding for the United
States Information Agency's overseas information and broadcasting programs
has been reduced by $80 million below the President's request.   The
funding level of $427 million for International Information Programs is
$34 million below the President's request and $24 million below the FY
1998 enacted level.   However, due to a technical error, the level provided
excludes $24 mil'lion needed for administrative costs overseas under the
new ICASS cost-sharing system.   For broadcasting programs, the
Subcommittee mark is $46 million below the President's request. A
reduction of this magnitude would require a personnel reduction-in-force,
eliminate broadcast language services, and defer necessary capital and
technical radio modernization improvements. We urge the Committee to
provide funding for core information and broadcasting programs at the
President's requested level.   Finally, we request that the Committee
remove earmarks placed on the Educational and Cultural Exchanges program.

        The Administration is also concerned about the elimination of
funding for the Asia Foundation; the low funding levels for International
Commissions, which would limit the operations of the San Diego-Tijuana
treatment plant and endanger other important bi-national environment
objectives; and, cuts to the American Institute in Taiwan, which would
result in staffing reductions and jeopardize critical Y2K upgrades.



    Legal Services Corporation

            The Administration commends the Subcommittee for increasing the
    funding level for the Legal Services Corporation (LSC) to $300 million,
    $13 million above the FY 1998 enacted level. However, we strongly urge
    the Committee to provide the full request of $340 million.  This level is
    needed to carry out LSC's mission to provide the Nation's poor with access
    to the judicial system.  The Supreme Court recently ruled that interest on
    lawyer trust accounts (ILTAs) are the private property of clients, and
    cannot be used to generate resources for civil legal services.  This
    eliminates a funding source that provided LSC programs with more than $57
    million last year and underscores the importance of Committee action to
    fully fund the President's request.



    Small Business Administration

            The Administration strongly objects to the Subcommittee mark of
    $94 million to administer the Small Business Administration's (SBA's)
    Disaster Loan Program, a 43-percent cut from the President's request.
    Such a drastic reduction in funding to originate and service disaster
    loans would severely curtail SBA's ability to respond to the needs of the
    victims of natural disasters.

            In addition, the Administration has serious concerns about the
    Subcommittee mark of $265 million for SBA's Salaries and Expenses
    account. A cut of this magnitude could require SBA to reduce its staffing
    by up to 300 staff years and would require furloughs and/or
    reductions-in-force,  jeopardizing SBA's ability to accomplish its mission.

    Equal Employment Opportunity Commission

            The Administration strongly urges the Committee to fully fund the
    President's request of $279 million for the Equal Employment Opportunity
    Commission (EEOC), $25 million above the Subcommittee mark.  The
    additional resources are essential, and would allow EEOC to reduce the
    backlog of pending complaints and implement much-needed reforms in the way
    all complaints are managed, including an enhanced alternative dispute
    resolution program.  We look forward to working with Congress to provide
    funding for EEOC and other programs included in the President's civil
    rights enforcement initiative.

            We look forward to working with the Committee to address our
    mutual concerns.

                                                    Sincerely,



                                                    Jacob J. Lew
                                                    Acting Director



    Identical Letter Sent to The Honorable Ted Stevens,
    The Honorable Robert C. Byrd, The Honorable Judd Gregg,
    and The Honorable Ernest F. Hollings
