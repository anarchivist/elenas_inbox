TEXT:
According to OMB, the restrictions on smoking under the 1994 Pro-Children
Act apply only during the school day.   So presumably, teachers can smoke
in the lounge after the school day. As drafted, the Tobacco-Free Schools
Act would go further prohibit smoking at all times-- in or around the
school, or at a school-sponsored event.

How do you want to proceed? I've let OMB know that we are reviewing this,
but they are trying to get the bill in fnal form asap.

The 1994 Pro-Children Act allowed the Secretary to grant waivers if
collective bargaining agreements included smoking privileges clauses, but
these special waivers were to expire one year after the law's enactment.

The guidance the Dept of Education released in May 1995 made clear that
the smoking ban applies to the entire school building. The law "requires
the prohibition of smoking within any [federally -funded] indoor facility
owned, or leased, or contracted for the provision of these children's
services. This means, therefore, that smoking lounges or other separate
locations for smoking within the enclosed facility (even if separately
ventilated) must be prohibited."

I should note that this policy is much stronger than the EO we did for
federal buildings in 1997 which allowed smoking in "designated smoking
areas that are enclosed and exhausted directly to the outside and away
   "     '"

from air intake ducts, and are maintained under negative pressure (with
respect to surrounding spaces) sufficient to contain tobacco smoke within
the designated areas."

Is it really already the law that teachers can't smoke in the teachers
lounge of a school that takes federal funds?
