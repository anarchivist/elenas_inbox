 We wanted to see if we could get a budget savings figure from the
 increased use of mediation. Here's OMB's first try.

 Subject:         Private sector compliance activity funding and potential adr
 savings

 You asked me to prepare a "back of the envelope" calculation of potential
 savings through increased use of mediation versus full investigation.

 EEOC's budget allocates $140 million to private sector compliance
 activity. This is the full cost of salaries and rent and computers and
 travel that the Commission spends on processing individual complaints of
 discrimination from private sector employees. EEOC spends an average
 $1,750 on each of an estimated 80,000 cases annually.

 Using ADR contracts of $500 per case results in "savings" of $1,250 per
 case processed.  If 10 percent of the 80,000 cases were resolved using
 ADR, this would result in a "savings" of $10 million for FY 1999. This
 funding could support 200 additional positions for private sector
 enforcement of more complex cases as well as help to reduce the time it
 takes the Commission to resolve cases from 1 year to 6 months by 2002.
