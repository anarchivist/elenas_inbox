 TEXT:
 As the attached indicates, Governor Patton is planning on asking the
 President to come do a tobacco farmer summit in Kentucky when he sees him
 on 2/21 but OPL/Intergovernmental will head him off in a different
 direction if we'd like.  I think we should steer him in a different
 direction, yes? ,

As you know, the Governorts arrive for their annual meeting Feb 21. Each
Gov will have a minute or two with the President . Gov Patton (D-Kty) will
bring up a proposal he made in writing a few months ago to the President.
He wants the President to call and host a Farming Summit in Kentucky (to
include small and family farmers from around the region.).   I passed along
his materials but if you need them let me know.  He is pressing me to know
what we think of the issue - and he plans to promte it with the Pr
esident.  I would like to get to a yes and for the President to tell him
when he sees him, or get to a no and me tell him beforehand.

What do you think?
