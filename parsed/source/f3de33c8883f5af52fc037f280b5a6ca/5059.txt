TEXT:
FYI. Today's Greenwire has an interesting lead item that 9 major chicken
producers have gotten together and are getting ready to announce industry
intitiatives nationwide to curb the amount of chicken waste polluting
waterways-- seeking to avoid regulation stemming from pfiesteria crisis.
They evidently have met with EPA who said it sounds innovative.  If this
is significant enough, it might be a good VP or POTUS deal.  I've calls in
to USDA.
