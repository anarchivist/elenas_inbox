TEXT:
We have scheduled two ESEA Reauthorization meetings for next week:

1.         Monday, March 22 at 5:00PM
2.         Tuesday, March 23 at 2:30PM

Please hold these times on your schedule.   I have confirmed these times
with Mike Smith and Bruce Reed's schedules.    I will get back to you with
a room number and a complete list of attendees when I have them.

Tanya: Please let me know if there is anyone else I need to include from
EOP.  FYI -- Ann O'Leary is taking care getting the word out to the
appropriate Ed folks.  Thank you.
