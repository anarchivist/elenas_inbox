  PRESIDENT WILLIAM j. CLINTON
  TALKING POINTS ON TOBACCO
  CABINET ROOM
  July 19, 1998

         I am about to meet with my economic team to discuss the ways we
 can keep our economy growing steady and strong.  Today, AmericaD,s economy
 is the strongest in a generation, and is the driving force behind world
 economic growth. We will be discussing ways to continue this growth:
 promoting international economic stability, by supporting the IMF and
 economic reform in Asia D(maintaining our fiscal discipline by setting
 aside the surplus until we save Social Security first D( investing in our
 people through education and training. We cannot afford to risk our
 prosperity through gimmicks such as repealing the tax code· with nothing in
 its place. We must seize the opportunity of this moment to build for our
 long-term prosperity.

          I want to briefly comment on another obligation we face at this.
  moment of national progress: the duty to protect our children from tobacco.
    This remains a rare moment for progress in a comprehensive effort to
  change the way the tobacco industry works. After decades of deception by
  the tobacco industry, there is now undeniable evidence that they have
  targeted children. We have a chance to save one million lives a year.
  For six months, we worked hard and in good faith to meet all legitimate
  objections to this legislation, and to join together 'the priorities of
  both parties.

         Let me be clear: every Senator who voted to kill the tobacco bill
 voted against a tax cut for middle income families; against new measures
 to crack down on drugs; against life-saving research into cancer and other
,
      diseases.  Every Senator who voted to kill the tobacco bill voted not to
      save one million American lives.  It was a vote against our children and
      for the tobacco lobby. And that vote will be very difficult to explain to
      the American people.

              Now, some have suggested that the Congress will follow the tobacco
      lobbyO,s lead and seek to send to me an ineffective D&narrowD8 bill that
      does not effectively address youth smoking.    We know what is needed to
      fight youth smoking: a comprehensive approach.    A D&narrowD8 bill
      reflects narrow interests-- not the national interest and the health of
      our children.
