GOP leaders looking for middle ground on workfare debate


    WASHINGTON (AP)    Republicans on Capitol Hill have backed away
from a veto dare and now say they want to compromise with the
Clinton administration over which labor laws should apply to
welfare recipients on work assignments.
     --We don't want to fight with the administration on this," Rep.
Clay Shaw, R-Fla., chairman of the House subcommittee that handles
welfare, said Tuesday. --We don't want to face a veto and try to
override the veto. ' ,
    But that may not be easy, as the GOP's most conservative leaders
argue that people collecting welfare benefits should be exempted
from all labor laws    a position untenable to the administration.
    Congressional Republicans, along with many governors, have
argued that people in --workfare"    slots are essentially still
training for work, not actually working, and should not enjoy the
full protection of federal labor laws.
    President Clinton, with strong backing from labor unions, has
said the government should do all it can to make the world of
welfare resemble the world of work.
    There's no question that a welfare recipient who gets hired for
a regular private sector job is entitled to all labor protections.
    At issue is work either created by the government for those who
cannot find work on their own or special --workfare" slots offered
by community service groups and private employers for people still
collecting welfare. It's not clear which of these workers would
retain the labor protections under a compromise plan.
    In budget negotiations over the summer, House Republicans tried
to exempt most welfare recipients from labor laws, saying they are
not employees. But the administration threatened to veto the
balanced budget bill unless the provision was removed, and the GOP
backed down.
    Still, leaders vowed to continue the fight, and House Speaker
Newt Gingrich charged that Clinton was --trying to undermine and
destroy welfare reform."   He and others threatened to pass a bill
on that issue alone and dare him to veto it.
    But Shaw said Tuesday that Republicans are now focusing on
finding a solution the administration can support.
    There is room for compromise, according to congressional and
administration officials. For instance, states might be satisfied
if they didn't have to pay Social Security and unemployment
compensation taxes on behalf of workfare participants.
    The minimum wage, which is where the fight began, is not much of
an issue anymore. Congress and the administration agree that people
on work assignments should be paid the equivalent of the minimum
wage, including the value of cash welfare payments and food stamps.
    But the administration will insist there is no broad statement
that welfare recipients are not real employees. But that could be a
stumbling block for conservative House Republicans who won't be
satisfied unless the law makes it explicitly clear that workfare
workers are not employees, said a senior Republican House aide who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
    Some state officials and their GOP allies fear community service
groups and private employers will not hire welfare recipients if
they fear being sued under any of two dozen labor laws.
    --Everything we work out that attracts Democrats loses
Republicans,"   the House aide said.
    Legislation will not be introduced until next week at the
earliest, as negotiators see if there is a compromise. But for the
moment, the rhetoric on all sides is quieter.
    --We obviously want people to spend time in training, " Donna
Shalala, the secretary of Health and Human Services, said Tuesday


at a news conference with Shaw on an unrelated matter. --We also
believe they should have a fair and living wage. ' ,
