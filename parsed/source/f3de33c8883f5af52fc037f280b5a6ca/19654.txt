            STATEMENT BY PRESIDENT WILLIAM J_ CLINTON
  ON HOUSE REPUBLICANS SIGNING ONTO THE PATIENTS' BILL OF RIGHTS
                           April 29, 1998


       I am extremely pleased that today at least nine Republican House Members added their
names as cosponsors to H.R. 3605, the Patients' Bill of Rights Act of 1998. In announcing their
support for this legislation, they are sending a strong signal that it is unacceptable for this
Congress to adjourn this year without passing a strong patients' rights bill.

        I commend Representatives Ganske (IA), Bass (NH), Forbes (NY), Fox (PA), Gilchrest
(MD), Graham (SC), Horn (CA), LaTourette (OH), and Leach (IA) for their leadership, and I
look forward to working with them. We have learned again and again that when we reach
across party lines we can pass important legislation that improves our nation's health care.
Making the Patients' Bill of Rights Act of 1998 bipartisan provides new momentum towards
assuring that a patients' bill of rights will become the law of the land.

        The Patients' Bill of Rights Act of 1998, recently introduced by Congressman Dingell,
provides long overdue protections that Americans need to renew their confidence in the nation's
rapidly changing health care system. It allows patients to' see the specialists they need; to get
emergency care wherever and whenever a medical emergency arises; to talk freely with doctors
and nurses about all the medical options available -- not only the cheapest; and gives patients a
place to go to present grievances about their health care.                         .

        I urge Congress to send me legislation that gives Americans the health care protections
they need and deserve. I look forward to working with members on both sides of the aisle to
ensure that we pass a strong patients' bill of rights this year.
