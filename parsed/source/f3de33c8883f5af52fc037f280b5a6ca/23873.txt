TEXT:
I am sending you by fax     INS's internal Qs and As on the NACARA reg.

Fyi - the INS briefed a small group on these regs and they were very
pleased and look forward to discussions about legislation.

Maria - in follow up to your question - INS clarified that the NACARA regs
are interim rule because they are slight departure from the proposed rule
particularly on the presumption issue and therefore, they are requesting
comments and the rule would be effective 30 days after publication.
