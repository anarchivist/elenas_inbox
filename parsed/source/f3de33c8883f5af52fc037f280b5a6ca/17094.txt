    Rahm/Bruce/Elena:

    Met w/OMB today to go over General McCaffrey's proposed letter to Gingrich
    and "Blueprint" report to Hill.  OMB, the agencies and I are very
    concerned about the lofty promises being made in the proposed document and
    letter (i.e., reducing drug use by 50%, cutting drug crime rates by 30%,
    etc.) .

    OMB is especially concerned about McCaffrey's report and letter forcing
    the Administration's hand on budget issues and conceivably violating the
    Balance Budget Agreement. They want McCaffrey's letter to Gingrich
    amended and the report held and coordinated withe overall budget process.
    Raines intends to send a brief memo late tonight/early tomorrow (draft
    attached) to Erskine and Rahm suggesting as much.

                 MEMORANDUM TO THE CHIEF OF STAFF

                 FROM: Frank Raines

                 SUBJECT: ONDCP Document Entitled "Blueprint for a Drug Free America"

                 Last week ONDCP circulated a draft document entitled "Blueprint for a Drug Free America."
                 The document lays out "performance targets" for the conduct of the anti-drug abuse program in
                 the next five - ten years. The targets and dates are aggressive. For example, among the targets
                 are the following: 1) 50 percent reduction in the overall rate of illicit drug use in the U.S. by
                 2007; and 2) 50 percent reduction in the available supply of drugs in the U.S. by 2007. The
                 document indicates that the proposed performance targets must be supported by funding if they
                 are to be realized.

                 We have no evidence that would suggest that the draft goals can be achieved without substantial
                 increases in Federal drug budgets in 1999 and beyond. Several agencies have made similar
                 complaints to ONDCP (e.g., Justice and Treasury). As such, release of the document would be
                 problematic and would imply FY 1999 budgetary trade-offs not yet made in favor of anti-drug
                 spending and against other domestic discretionary spending. We suggest that the document
                 be withheld until after submission of the 1999 President's Budget, when aU agencies must
                 submit their performance plans and targets to Congress. Those plans must be directly
                 linked to multi-year Presidential budget request levels.

                 General McCaffrey is likely to be upset if the document is not released. His likely arguments for
                 release, beyond his desire to pursue a vigorous fight against drug abuse, will be:

                        -- The 1997 President's Drug Strategy released by ONDCP this spring indicates that
                        performance measures will be provided to Congress this fiscal year (FY 1997).

                        -- General McCaffrey is supposed to meet with the Speaker tomorrow afternoon
                        (Thursday), and would like to provide the Speaker with this document. (Apparently, the
                        Speaker wants even more aggressive performance measures than those outlined by
                        ONDCP).

                        -- Without release of the document, the Speaker may decide to delay reauthorization of
                        ONDCP. (Because ONDCP is due to receive 1998 appropriations anyway, the threat of
                        a lack of reauthorization is not terribly significant.)
