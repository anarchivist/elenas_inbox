TEXT:
The Administration leg proposal that is being circulated represents our
proposals that specifically support the President's Balanced Budget Plan
-- the FY98 Budget -- so it fleshes out, in leg language, only the $
issues, i.e., for adoption, the bonus.  Nothing is circulating through the
Administration yet on Reasonable Efforts, although I understand that
Chafee/Rockefeller have a bill in draft, and there was a House Ways and
Means hearing today on "Encouraging Adoption." Unfortunately, neither Lyn
nor I could go to it, but I'm trying to find out about it from HHS, and
get the testimony.

I just talked with Dan Lewis, Carol williams' deputy, about the two policy
issues outstanding.  Call me when you have a chance so we can make a
decision about if we want to push either or both.

And 4:30 is fine for the WH meeting on Monday.

Nicole
