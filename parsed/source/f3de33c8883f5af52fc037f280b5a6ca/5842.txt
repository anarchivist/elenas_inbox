TEXT:
The tobacco farmer proposal Robb gave the President has a couple of
elements that are causing differences with Senator Ford. According to
Ford's AA, they are having a good dialogue with Robb and could be able to
work stuff out.  The basic issue is how to handle a buy-out. Among the
other differences: Ford thinks the upfront costs of Robb are too high-- he
estimates Robb costs $3-4 billion for each of the first five years, Ford
comes in around $2.1 billion for each of the first ten years; Robb has a
40 cent cut in price supports which some large farmers are okay with
because it improves international competitiveness; Ford has some concerns
about using licenses instead of quotas.  In the House, there are a number
of members playing around with their own bills too (Baesler, Boucher,
Lewis). Robb has still not dropped in a finished bill.
