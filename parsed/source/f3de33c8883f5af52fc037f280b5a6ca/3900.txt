        Welfare: Child Support Enforcement -- In light ofthe recent GAO study criticizing
states for not putting in place automated child support enforcement systems, you asked how we
have increased collections by 50 percent since 1992 and what more we could do. While as many
as eight states have told HHS that their computer systems won't be ready for certification by
October 1st, some of those states are using computers in some parts of their states already. Even
the GAO report acknowledges that the systems in place have helped those states improve
collections. The real problem is that this October 1st deadline is only for the computer systems
needed to implement the provisions of the 1988 Family Support Act -- all of these computer
systems will need to be updated and revised to enforce the new hire reporting, license revocation,
centralized state collections, and paternity establishment rules enacted as part of welfare reform.
And, as you noted in your July 28th speech to the National Govemors' Association, not all states
have even put in place the required state child support laws necessary to begin implementation of
the new provisions.

        Of course, increased federal and state efforts made even before the new law have paid off.
As you know, we increased child support collections from $8 billion in 1992 to $12 billion in
1996. But during the same time the percentage of cases in which \\Ie collected support remained
nearly constant at 20 percent, because both the number of overall cases and the number of cases
with collections both increased. And despite our increased collections, we still collect only a
fraction of what's owed. For example, in fiscal year 1995, states collected $8.2 billion of the
$15.5 billion of current support owed and $2.4 billion ofthe $34.5 billion of past support owed, a
collection rate of 54 percent for current support and 7 percent for past support.

        We believe that post-Balanced Budget Act, we should devote more attention to ensuring
states are implementing the tough new rules enacted last year. This is one reason why we
suggested that in your speech to the National Governors' Association you take states to task over
child support enforcement and were pleased that you urged "all the states to put in place these
tough, state-wide child support collections mechanisms as fully and quickly as possible."

        Now that you've issued the challenge, we need to help make it happen. We propose to
establish a child support enforcement oversight working group with DPC, NEC,
Intergovernmental Affairs and key HHS, Treasury, and Dept. of Justice staff to track state efforts
and devise ways to ensure they do all they can to build a stronger child support enforcement
system.

        Welfare Reform: Tuesday's Event in St. Louis with the Welfare to Work
Partnership - On Tuesday you will travel to St. Louis to underscore the critical role of the
private sector in welfare reform, praising approximately 200 St. Louis companies that will
commit to hire and retain welfare recipients. We suggest you use the opportunity to hail the
success of welfare reform nearly one year after making reform the law of the land. We will
have new caseload numbers for you to announce (the rolls have declined by almost 3.4 million or
24% since you took office). We would also suggest you highlight your successes in the
                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion

Balanced Budget Act, which fixes the problems you promised to fix when you signed the law
and includes a welfare-to-work tax credit and a $3 billion fund to help move a million more
people from welfare to work. You could also announce that the Welfare to Work Partnership
stands ready to help companies all across the nation hire people off welfare, with their "Blueprint
for Business" guide and other information which will be available starting Tuesday through
their toll free hotline and their web page.
