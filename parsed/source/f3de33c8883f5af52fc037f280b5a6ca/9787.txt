MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

SUBJECT:                  DPC Weekly Report

       Education -- Budget Deal: While your victory on class size reduction and your
other education initiatives was remarkable, a number of key pieces of your education
agenda remains unfinished. In addition to school modernization, there are two key areas
we will focus on in the near term. First, the final provision on national standards allows
some test development work to continue (while banning pilot testing or implementation),
and calls on NAGB and NAS to conduct additional studies in anticipation of possible
Congressional consideration of this issue when NAEP is reauthorized in the next Congress.
 Because the likelihood of ever getting full Congressional support is so slim, we will develop
a number of additional options for how to best continue to press for national standards.
Second, as we work with the Education Department on a proposal for the reauthorization
of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, we will ensure that the concepts in the
Education Opportunity Zones are fully reflected in that proposal and remain a central part
of our education agenda.

         Health Care -- Kennedy-Jeffords Legislation: Despite our efforts, the Work Incentives
Improvement Act (Kennedy-Jeffords) did not make into the final Omnibus budget appropriations
bill. This bipartisan legislation, that you endorsed at the commemoration of the Americans with
Disabilities Act (ADA) last July, enables people with disabilities to go back to work by providing
an option to buy into Medicaid and Medicare, as well as other pro-work initiatives. The
disability community believes this is the most significant legislation since the ADA. Although
this bill was on the list of top Administration priorities throughout the final budget negotiations
and received broad-based bipartisan support, it was rejected by Republicans because they did not
want to have significant health expansions and because they thought it was too late in the process
to approve such a significant piece of legislation. However, the disability community as well as
the AIDS community and others are extremely appreciative that the Administration fought so
hard to pass this legislation.

       Health Care -- AIDS Issues in the Budget: The Omnibus bill included significant new
funding for HIV/AIDS. In particular, itincluded $110 million for funding to address the critical
AIDS problem in the minority community. This increase, plus an additional $20 million that
HHS has agreed to allocate from existing funds, meets the Congressional BlackCaucuses' full
funding request for this problem. In addition to this important victory, the Ryan White Program
$250 million -- or nearly 30 percent increase. The AIDS community and the CBC are quite
pleased with this remarkable outcome. However, there is disappointment regarding the
inclusion in the final bill of a needle exchange provision that prevents the District of Columbia
from using their own funds for needle exchange programs. We strongly opposed this
provision because it strips federal funds from community-based agencies trying to stop the
spread of HIV through needle exchange programs.

         Health Care -- Race and Health in the Budget: The Congress has taken a critical
first step in in'vesting in your multi-year proposal to eliminate racial health disparities in
six health areas, including HIV/AlDS, cancer, diabetes, and immunizations. As you know
some of these disparities are startling. For example, African Americans under the age of
65 have twice the rate of heart disease as whites, and Native Americans suffer from
diabetes at nearly three times the average rate. The budget gives sufficient funding to
finance the $80 million you included in your budget request, including new grants for
communities to develop new strategies to address these disparities.

       Health Care -- Historic Increases in Biomedical Research. The Congress agreed to
fund your proposal to increase biomedical research at the NIH with a $2 billion expansion
of NIH research funding --a 14-percent increase. This increase will enable scientists to
pursue a wide range of important new breakthroughs in critical diseases, from Alzheimers
to AIDS to genetic discoveries. In addition, the Centers for Disease Control also received
your requested increases for new research to improve prevention efforts, including fighting
emerging infectious diseases and combating new resistance to anti-biotics, and the Agency for
Health Care Policy Research (AHCPR) received your requested increases to improve quality
outcomes. For example, overuse of antibiotics has been shown to lead to resistance and cost as
much as $7.5 billion a year. AHCPR's development and dissemination of guidelines for the
appropriate use of antibiotics will result in better patient care and significant health care savings.

 Health Care --Pennsylvania DSH Payments. The entire Pennsylvania Congressional delegation is
aggressively lobbying the Administration to waive administratively potentially hundreds of
millions of dollars that HCFA's fiscal intermediaries have concluded that the state's hospitals owe
as a result of inappropriate Medicare DSH payments. The Congressional delegation, the state,
and the hospitals have taken the position that they were unaware that billing for these DSH
payments was problematic. Some even argue that their interpretation of the law is that the
payments are legal. The delegation decided not to pursue a legislative fix in this area because
CBO scores such an intervention as costing the Treasury and the Medicare Trust Fund over $300
million. They are, instead, advocating for HCFA to step in administratively and place a
moratorium on their Frs collections of past (and future) liabilities for a long enough period to
fight HCFA in court or for Congress to intervene legislatively next year. Particularly because of
the strong Democratic interest in this area and because it appears that HCFA has been
inconsistently been applying the reimbursement rules, we are urging HCFA to be responsive as

                                                                 Automated Records Management System

    possible. We have' been informed that HCFA will probably be able to announce a temporary
    moratorium late next week. We will make sure the roll-out is done to reflect the interest of the
    Members.

             Tobacco -- Medicaid Recoupment: During negotiations over the omnibus
    appropriations bill, the Republican Leadership proposed including language which would have
    waived our right to the federal share of state tobacco recoveries. They would not, however,
    agree to conditions requiring states to spend a portion ofthe funds on a menu of items and the
    language was therefore not included in the bill. We plan to tell the states and others that we are
    willing to consider this issue next year, but only if the federal share of settlement funds to a
    list of specified activities along the lines of the menu negotiated in the McCain bill and
    preferably including tobacco control activities.

             Crime -- Prison Drug Testing/Treatment: In the budget agreement we succeeded in
    including legislative language to allow states to use up to 10% of federal prison funds to
    implement drug testing and treatment plans for prisoners and parolees. As you know, you called
    for this change in law in a directive on coerced abstinence that you signed last year.

            Crime -- Brady Implementation: The final budget agreement ensures that the Brady
    National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) will go on-line as planned at the
    end of next month. While the final compromise does not allow the FBI to charge a user fee, it
    appropriates 42 million dollars to pay for these checks and, more importantly it doe snot require
    the immediate destruction of records. This latter provision would have delayed implementation
    of the NICS by 6-8 months.

             Community Empowerment -- Final Budget Agreement: The final budget agreement
    included almost all of the major initiatives proposed in your State of the Union and FY99
    Budget. Some of the highlights include: 1) 50,000 new Welfare-to-Work Housing Vouchers; 2)
    the first year funding for the Round II Empowerment Zones; 3) a 19 percent increase in the
    Community Development Financial Institution Fund budget; 4) enactment of the landmark public
    housing reform legislation; 5) extension of the Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) and the
    Welfare-to-Work Tax Credit (WTWTC); 6) an 18 percent increase in homeless assistance; 7) a
    33 percent expansion ofHUD's Fair Housing programs that are part of your One America
    Initiative; 8) full funding for EPA's Brownfield's program; 9) and the creation of a new program
    to provide Individual Development Accounts (IDA) to empower individuals to save for a first
    home, post secondary education, or to start a new business. The enactment ofthe IDA
    legislation means that you have fulfilled, at some level, all of the promises made in Putting
    People First in the area of community empowerment.

            The one initiative which Congress was unwilling to consider as part ofthe tax extenders
    legislation was your proposal to expand the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC).
    However, we believe that the ground work has been laid to secure Congressional approval next
    year for the LIHTC and a longer extension of the WOTC and the WTWTC. Over the next

                                                    3                  Automated Records Management System

               several week, DPC, NEC, and the Office of the Vice President will be finalizing a set of new
               proposals for your FY2000 budget and State of the Union that will build on the victories we
               achieved in this year's budget.

                       Welfare Reform -- Teen Birth and Pregnancy Rates: Two recent reports show
               continued good news regarding teen birth and pregnancy rates. CDC announced preliminary data
               showing a 3 percent drop in the teen birth rate from 1996 to 1997, the sixth annual decline in a
               row and a drop of 15 percent since 1991. The latest rate, for 1997, is 52.9 births per 1,000 girls
               between 15 and 19 years old. Teen birth rates declined for all racial groups, though the rate of
               decline for blacks was slightly less than for other groups. A new report from the Alan
               Guttmacher Institute shows the teen pregnancy rate dropped nearly 13 percent from 1991 to 1995
               and now stands at the lowest level since 1975, at 101 pregnancies per 1,000 15- to 19-year-old
               girls. Researchers attribute the drop in pregnancy rates to a decline in sexual activity among
               teens and improved use of contraceptives. The teen pregnancy data lag several years behind the
               teen birth data because the pregnancy data depend on abortion data which take longer to collect.
               In several months, CDC will produce its own estimate of the teen pregnancy rate which will
               show a similar trend but will be estimated using a slightly different methodology. CDC's report
                will also contain teen pregnancy rates by race and ethnicity.
