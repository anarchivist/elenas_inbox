TEXT:
Secretary Shalala has gotten a letter from Gov. Chiles saying the worst
thing about appying FLSA will be the state having to pay FICA taxes.   It
reminded HHS that we should engage Treasury, as well as Labor, HHS, and
Ag, in the rollout if possible. HHS has had no luck in moving Treasury
along and thought we might be able to.
