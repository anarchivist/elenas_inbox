TEXT:
FYI. USDA called the AP/Reuters reporters reo the coverage of the
Council's response to NAS report.  The Reuters reporter in particular was
"defiant."   Reuters said since we did not endorse a single agency, we
were effectively rejecting it. A ridiculous standard. Anyway, she asked
USDA to interview their point person (Cathy Wotecki) on the pros and cons
of a single food agency.  What do you think? The reporter may skew that
interview too and we are in the middle of a process where we don't need
O'hara and Wotecki going on the record.  The reporter would be pissed off
(they've put her off previously saying the Council report was coming
out. )
