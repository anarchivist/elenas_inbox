      Tobacco Company Considered Lacing Cigarettes With Marijuana [02123-3]

      It Even Registered Brand Names like "Acapulco Gold" and "Red Leb"

      Internal documents show that the British American Tobacco Company, the
      parent of Brown and
      Williamson (B&W) in the U.S., considered lacing its cigarettes with
      "near-subliminal" levels of
      marijuana, and even went so far as to register as brand names "Acapulco
      Gold" and "Red Leb" (Red
      Lebanese) .

      One company document "considers the main threats to the smoking habit ...
      and draws attention to
      the undoubted opportunities which exist in the development of future
      products".

      It went on: "in the illicit use of marijuana, relatively large doses of
      the active principal are involved. If
      the use of such drugs was legalized, one avenue for exploitation would be
      the augmentation of
      cigarettes with near subliminal levels of the drug."

      This new revelation comes at a time when other internal documents show
      that the major U.S.
      tobacco companies -- including B&W -- deliberately tried to attract
      children to begin smoking
      cigarettes, a practice they knew was likely to lead to a life-long addi
      ction for many.

      Some even show that one company "studied third graders to determine if
      hyperactive children are a
      potential market for cigarettes."

      "It is outrageous that a company selling an addictive product used by
      millions of children should even


consider adding marlJuana, and adopting the street names used by kids for
drugs as its brand
names," says law professor John Banzhaf, Executive Director of Action on
Smoking and Health
(ASH) .

This is one more reason why Congress should not grant the industry any
immunity from law suits,
and why no deal should even be considered until all secret documents and
the misdeeds they reveal
are released, he said.

ASH is the national legal-action organization largely responsible for the
persuading the FDA to
regulate nicotine in cigarettes.
