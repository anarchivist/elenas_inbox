 MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT                                      Hex-Dump Conversion

 FROM:                 Bruce Reed
                       Mike Cohen

 SUBJECT:              Congressional Fight over national testing initiative


  The National Test initiative faces an extremely serious challenge when Congress resumes and
  takes up the Labor-HHS-ED appropriations bills, possibly as early as September 2 in the Senate
  and September 4 in the House. The situation in the House is particularly serious. Our chief
  supporters on the appropriations subcommittee, Dave Obey and John Porter, are very concerned,
  and staff to Obey, Goodling and Riggs all believe that Goodling can prevail on the House floor.
. No one has a firm vote count, and the timing of votes in both the House and Senate is subject to
  change. At present we are proceeding on the basis of a worst-case scenario, while we continue
  to gather information that will further shape our strategy and enable us to best calibrate our
  actions to the magnitude of the situation we face.

Where We Stand
Bill Goodling will offer his amendment to prohibit the use of funds for the development of the
test; the amendment has the potential of passing by a large margin. As a result of growing
activity from far right groups and home schoolers, mounting criticism from Lynn Cheney and
others, and a significant effort on Goodling's part, there is a strong chance that he will carry
almost all Republicans. Moderate Republicans who support the testing initiative, including
Mike Castle and Frank Riggs, are unlikely to oppose the committee chairman. Republican
opposition has apparently been fueled somewhat by the Education Department's award (on
Monday) of the contract to develop the tests to a consortium of test publishers. To some, this
was seen as another unilateral action by the Administration that demonstrated our unwillingness
to recognize a Congressional role in the tests.

In addition, support for the tests is weak in the Black and Hispanic Caucuses. In particular, the
Hispanic Caucus has indicated that it is very likely to vote with Goodling unless we agree to their
request to test LEP students in reading in Spanish. In addition, some in the Black Caucus are
concerned because they believe that the tests will be used primarily to highlight the low
performance of Black students without also providing them with needed assistance.

Over the next several days we will work to get a better reading on the level of support .for
Goodling's amendment, and on the blocks of members on whom we must focus.

While no similar challenge has surfaced in the Senate, we believe it is likely that one will arise
once the appropriations bill reaches the floor, and that the same political forces can lead to a
defeat for our initiative there as well. We are monitoring the situation in the Senate and will
develop specific strategies as appropriate.
Next Steps                                                          Hex-Dump Conversion

Legislative Strategy
While we gather additional information, we are preparing a 2-pronged strategy to strengthen our
base of support among Democrats, and to peel off Republican votes. We are focused primarily
on the House, as we get a better handle on what we might face in the Senate, a Senate strategy
will take shape as well.

Getting Republican Support
We know their are a number of Republicans, including Castle, Riggs and Porter, who support our
idea of national tests, and we believe the idea has broader appeal to Republicans. Our basic
strategy is to find a compromise that will enable us to keep moving on the development and
piloting of the test in the coming year, while giving Congress a larger role in shaping the future
of the testing initiative. Our objective will be to separate those Republicans from Goodling and
his allies on the far right, since we do not believe it is possible to turn either Goodling or the far
right around.

Our first step is to explore with Porter possible options for compromise that will strengthen his
hand on the floor. We will also work with him to secure Livingston's support for the floor.

 We anticipate several options, including offering legislation to seek specific authorization for the
 tests, and/or to establish NAGB as an independent governing board -- so long as we can continue
.to develop the tests over the coming year. Our assumption is that this approach will enable
 those who support the idea of tests but believe Congress should have a role, to split from
 Goodling. There are potential down sides to these options. We may fail to enact legislation, or
 we may delay the initial implementation of the tests for a year while NAGB assumes its role.
 We think these dangers are worth the gamble-- pushing Congress for an up or ·down vote on the
 tests will give you a good vehicle for using the bully pulpit, and for splitting more moderate
 republicans from the far right.

We will be meeting with Porter's staff on Thursday morning. This may yield a different set of
options for us to consider. If appropriate will ask Secretary Riley to follow up with Porter and
Livingston. Depending upon where we wind up with them, we may approach Riggs as well.

Securing the Democratic Base [Elena--I want to run this whole section by Andy this morning. He
should be able to fill in some details, and he ought to be able to improve on the overall
approach.]

There are three basic steps we must take to strengthen and mobilize our support among
Democrats.

First, we must make clear to the House Democratic leadership that the standards and testing
agenda is your top priority, and that together we must work to keep the support of the Democratic
Caucus. [Do we say that Hilley will develop a strategy to address this when he returns next
week?]
                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion
Second, we must activate and support the allies we know we have, including Obey and others on
the appropriations committee, George Miller, Dale Kildee and others on the Education and
Economic Opportunities Committee; Tim Romer, Bob Etheridge and others on the Education
Task Force, etc.

Third, we must win as much support as possible from the Hispanic and Black caucuses, by
addressing their concerns where possible or by persuading them to support us on other grounds.


Hispanic Caucus: As you know, the principal concern of the Hispanic Caucus is that LEP
students who are not sufficiently proficient in English be given the opportunity to take a Spanish
version of the 4th grade reading test, rather than either being unfairly forced to take a test they are
unprepared for, or being excluded from the test altogether. Caucus members believe that unless
these students were provided with a Spanish language version of the test, they would be
stigmatized by virtue of being treated differently, and the schools would not be held accountable
for their perfonnance. In many states and local school districts with large enrollments of LEP
students, LEP students are generally excluded from taking tests in English if they have fewer
than 3 years of schooling. Title 1 now requires that LEP students who are excluded from tests in
English be given the opportunity to take tests in their primary language in order to best
demonstrate that they have mastered the subject matter.

We see the 4th grade reading test as measuring the ability of students to read in English (rather
than solely measuring reading comprehension skills which may ultimately transfer from one
language to another). Under our current policy, LEP students, with less than three full years of
schooling would be excluded from the 4th grade reading test (unless their parents requested that
they take it). In addition, because of the Title 1 requirements as well as similar local and state
requirements, LEP students excluded from our test will have the opportunity at some point in the
early grades to take a reading comprehension test in their native language.

Over the past several weeks DPC and the Education Department, with the support of the urban
school systems participating in the tests, have explored a number of options for addressing the
concerns of the Hispanic Caucus without altering our fundamental position on the purpose of the
reading test. In addition to simply reiterating our current policy, these options include (1)
providing LEP students with reading tests in their native language (either by developing versions
of the national test in Spanish or other languages, or by helping local districts select high quality
commercially produced Spanish reading tests); (2) testing students in English and in their native
language (so that a 4th grade LEP student would take the English test, and could also take a
Spanish version of the test to demonstrate reading comprehension skills regardless of language
proficiency); and (3) providing LEP students an opportunity to take a reading test in English after
the 4th grade, once they have been in school for a full three years.

Secretary Riley had a lengthy and difficult conversation with Rep. Becerra on this issue on
Tuesday. Becerra reiterated the views of the Caucus, while Secretary Riley indicated his belief
that we should provide the test in English only because we must send students and parents an
                                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion

unambiguous signal about the importance of learning to read in English. The Secretary favors
an option that would enable LEP students who are not tested in 4th grade reading to take the
reading test at a later time, when they have been in school for a full three years. While there is
room for continued discussion with Becerra on this issue, it appears very unlikely that we will be
able to keep the support ofthe Caucus if we hold our current position.

Nonetheless, Secretary Riley believes that we should send an unambiguous signal to LEP
students and their parents that students should be expected to learn to read in English, and that
we should provide the reading test only in English. We agree.

We also believe we should explore appealing to the Caucus on a broader basis than simply the
language of the test, including but not limited to other aspects of our education agenda. In
addition, we will explore whether appeals to the Caucus from Secretary Pena and former
Secretary Cisneros could be productive.

Black Caucus: [to be filled in after meeting with Andy -- he thinks we can get 16-18 votes from
CBC.]

Communications Strategy
There are several events already planned that will provide us with good opportunities to make
our case to the public. These are:

·      Secretary Riley and Bill Goodling will discuss this issue on Face the Nation this Sunday

·      An event for the Vice President the week of Aug 25, including possibly a meeting with
       some of the high-tech business leaders who endorsed the tests in April.

·      August 30th Radio Address, in which you will announce the findings from a report on
       NAEP long-term trends. The report shows that we have made some progress but not
       nearly enough, and you will be able to use these findings to make the case that national
       standards and tests are critical for continued improvement.

·      We have held Sept. 8 for a test-related event. As we get closer we will be better able to
       determine the most appropriate event for the day.

It may be helpful for you to take additional steps while on vacation that would reinforce our
message. For example, it might be a good idea for you to make a brief statement to the press on
Sunday, after the Riley/Goodling appearance on Face the Nation, to demonstrate your personal
commitment to the success of the testing initiative, and to take on any of Goodling's points that
may warrant additional response.

Outreach Strategy
                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion
DPC and the Education Department have been working with our core supporters in the education
and business community.       The Council of Great City Schools, AFT, NEA, and CCSSO,
together with BRT and NAB, have already been contacting moderate Republicans (business
groups), urban Democrats, and the House leadership. In addition, they are working on a joint
statement of support from others in education community, including local school boards and
elementary school principals.

We are planning a number of additional steps, including:

·      Mobilizing the High-Tech Business Leaders who have endorsed the test. John Doerr has
       contacted us, offering to help. We will explore with him a number of possible steps,
       including asking them to (1) place a full page add in support of the tests in the Post,
       Times or Wall Street Journal; (2) have prominent Republicans among the CEO's to
       privately approach the Speaker (3) have all of the business leaders contact key meinbers.

·      Mobilizing CEO's in the main business groups in support of our agenda. While the
       national organizations have been working with us, it is important for a number of well
       respected CEO's to personally take on a more active role. It may be helpful for you to
       personally call a number of them (e.g., Lou Gerstner, John Pepper, Joe Gorman, Frank
       Schrantz [Elena--this list of names may change somewhat in the final version]) in order to
       secure their active support.

·      Mobilize Mayors and Governors, especially where we can productively connect
       supportive mayors and governors with key members of Congress

·      Meet with Black and Hispanic Groups, such as the NAACP and Urban League to discuss
       the tests. These meetings will be an opportunity to continue to respond to concerns in
       the minority community. While we may not be able to win any converts through this
       process, we may at least be able to diminish the intensity of their opposition.
