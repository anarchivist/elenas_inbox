TEXT:
I spoke to Jon Schnur regarding edits that Barbara Chow had for the POTUS
memo on Bilingual Education. Most of Barbara's edits have already been
incorporated, but Jon suggested that I forward to you the following that
have not:

Page 2, Section II Congressional Dynamic, paragraph 2:

line 1
The House Labor-HHS-Education Appropriations Subcommittee will mark up
marked up a bill this week and probably that included provisions from
Riggs in it.

Page 3, Section III Legislative option 1, paragraph 1:

last line
The reference to the "Bilingual Act" should read the "Elementary and
Secondary Education Act."
