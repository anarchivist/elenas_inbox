TEXT:
        Some have raised the concern that the memorandum to the President
does not discuss the downnside to our proposed action.  I have therefore
added the following paragraph to the end of the memorandum.  (The full
memo is attached for your reference.)  Please send me comments by 2:30
today .



. . . . . .. This strategy is not without its difficulties.  First,
anything short of complete opposition to the bill is likely to raise
objections from our allies.       Second, the billD,s sponsors might accept our
objections and submit a bill that you would be obligated to sign.       Third,


and most troublesome, the sponsors might accept some of our objections and
refuse others.   This would place you in the position of either signing a
bill with seriously objectionable provisions or continuing to oppose a
bill that has had some of its more egregious provisions excised, an action
that would engender the likely criticism that you are being overly rigid
and that would weaken the possibility of sustaining a veto. We believe,
however, that unless you would be willing to take the position that you
oppose legislation that would make it illegal for adult males to transport
minors they impregnate across state lines for abortions without parental
consent, the best available course is that outlined in this memorandum.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:                  Charles F. C. Ruff, Counsel to the President
                       William Marshall, Associate Counsel to the President


SUBJECT:               The Child Custody Protection Act



I. THE CHILD CUSTODY PROTECTION ACT

         Congress is currently considering S. 1645, the Child Custody Protection Act -- a bill
which would impose civil and criminal liability on any person who knowingly transports a minor
across a state line to obtain an abortion in cases in which the minor has not satisfied her home
state's laws regarding "parental involvement" (i.e. laws requiring parental consent or parental
notification).

        The bill constitutes a novel form of federal legislation in that it prohibits persons from
traveling across state lines to engage in conduct that is legal in the second state. I    It also
uniquely conditions liability upon the law of the state where the person comes from rather than
the law of the state in which the conduct occurs.




        I The only possible exception to this is the Mann Act which may arguably be read as
prohibiting transporting women across state lines for prostitution to a state where prostitution is
legal.
                                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion
        As described by its sponsors, the bill is designed to protect the rights of parents to
participate in their minor child's abortion decision against those who would encourage her to
have a "secret" abortion -- a category which, according to the sponsors, includes out-of-state
abortion clinics who advertise the availability of abortions without parental involvement2 and
adult males who impregnate minors and then attempt to erase the consequences of their actions
by transporting the minors out of state for the abortion procedures.

        Politically, however, the bill is more easily characterized as an attempt to provoke
controversy on a sensitive and divisive issue than as an effort to address a legitimate area of
federal interest. Substantively, the bill raises troublesome policy, constitutional, and practical
law enforcement concerns and is counterproductive to its asserted goals.

II. BACKGROUND -- PARENTAL INVOLVEMENT REQUIREMENTS

        Currently twenty-two states require parental consent for a minor to terminate her
pregnancy while seventeen states have opted for the lesser requirement of parental notification.
Six of these states require notice to or consent from both parents, while four states would allow
the notification or consent requirements to be satisfied by persons other than the minor's parents
(such as a grandparent or an adult sibling.) Eleven states have no parental involvement
requirements.

        The constitutionality of parental involvement requirements has generally been upheld by
the Supreme Court. Although holding that pregnant minors have a constitutional right to choose
whether to terminate a pregnancy, the Court has determined that a state may require parental
notice or consent in the interest of ensuring that the minor's decision to terminate her pregnancy
is "knowing, intelligent, and deliberate." The parental involvement-requirements, however,
may not impose an "undue burden" upon a minor who is capable of giving an informed consent
to the abortion procedure. States must also provide a judicial "bypass" mechanism which allows
the minor to avoid the parental involvement requirements if she establishes either 1) that she is
sufficiently mature and well-informed to make the abortion decision independently or 2) that an
abortion without parental involvement would be in her best interests. 3

III. ANALYSIS

       2 The law does not explicitly prohibit advertising. The sponsors might, however,
envision extending liability to advertisers through some application of accomplice liability.
See Part III, below.

       3  The Supreme Court has ruled that bypass procedures are constitutionally mandated in
states that require the consent or notification of both parents; but the Court has not had occasion
to rule on whether bypass procedures are required in a one parent state.




                                                 2
                                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion

         S. 1645 represents a dramatic incursion into the traditional understanding of federalism.
Federalism presumes that a citizen is free to take advantage offavorable laws in other states and
that states have the right to regulate matters within their own boundaries (unless the matter is
directly regulated by the federal government.) S. 1645, however, is unique in that it attempts, by
force of federal law, to enforce one state's laws in the territory of another. As such, it sets a
dangerous precedent for federal interference with such matters as gaming, alcohol, tobacco, guns
and other items whose regulation varies significantly from state to state.

         Despite the seriousness of the federalism concerns, however, S. 1645 is not clearly
unconstitutional on those grounds. Because the approach taken by the sponsors is so novel,
there is virtually no Supreme Court precedent, on either side, from which to take direction.
Accordingly, while constitutional arguments against the legislation can be made based upon
general federalism principles (or upon right to travel or privilege and immunities grounds), a
definitive constitutional assessment cannot be offered with any degree of certainty. The
federalism objection, therefore, is best characterized as a policy, and not as a constitutional,
concern.

         There is also no constitutional abortion rights argument that would support invalidating
the bill as whole. DOJ has indicated that the bill would be unconstitutional as applied in certain
circumstances (for example when the law would require the minor to satisfy the parental
involvement laws of two separate states) but the constitutional concerns noted by DOJ, although
serious, can be remedied by re-drafting the legislation.

        The strongest objections to the legislation are based on policy, rather than on
constitutional, grounds. The bill's first and most glaring weakness is that it subjects family
members to criminal and civil liability. Under the terms of the legislation, grandmothers, aunts,
and adult siblings may be prosecuted for coming to the aid of a minor relative in distress. Even
a mother or father may be criminally sanctioned if she or he resides in a state that requires the
involvement of both parents. Obviously, subjecting family members to criminal and civil
sanctions for helping their relatives does not further the interest of healthy family
communication. Exposing family members to the possibility of criminal or civil sanction is also
counterproductive in that it would further isolate the minor by discouraging her from seeking
advice and counsel from those closest to her. Firally, creating a civil action which allows family
members to sue each other when a minor within that family has an abortion does not serve the
goal of fostering strong families.

       Second, the bill could inappropriately impose liability on persons who merely provide
information, advertising, counseling, referrals, or medical services to the minor. Through rules of
accomplice liability, the bill could subject a telephone receptionist to criminal liability, for
example, merely for informing an unnamed caller about the availability of abortion services.
The bill's creation ofa private cause of action is, from this perspective, even more problematic.



                                                 3
                                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion

A civil action would be a ready tool for those who wish to harass, intimidate, or bankrupt service
providers.
        Third, the bill imposes criminal liability on persons who may not realize they are
violating the law (as when the minor falsely informs the transporter that she has parental
consent.) This is because the bill predicates liability on the intent to help the minor obtain an
abortion rather than on the intent to help the minor avoid the application of a state's parental
notification requirements.

         Finally, the bill raises numerous practical law enforcement concerns. These include
the use of scarce FBI resources to prosecute violations, the need for federal law enforcement
authorities to interrogate family members and close teenage friends in order to pursue violations,
and the fact that the defendants in some cases are likely to be minors.

IV. RECOMMENDATION

        There would be little advantage in opposing this bill in its entirety. The sponsors'
example of the adult male impregnating the female minor and taking her across state lines for an
abortion without parental involvement is likely to be politically compelling and, as noted above,
there is no definitive case to be made that imposing federal civil and criminal sanctions for this
activity is unconstitutional. At the same time, the bill, as written, significantly overreaches and
affirmatively hamis important policy and constitutional interests.

        At this point, it is unclear whether the sponsors are interested in fixing the legislation to
meet legitimate objections or whether they are merely interested in provoking confrontation. In
either case, we believe that our best action is to announce that the Administration would support
!1arrowly tailored legislation but, for policy and constitutional reasons, is opposed to the bill as
currently drafted. The first step in this process would be to submit a letter from the EOP
highlighting two specific issues -- the need to exempt family members and the need to exclude
from potential liability those persons whose only connection to the abortion is the provisiori of
information, advertising, or a medical, referral, or counseling service. This letter would also
indicate that a letter containing constitutional issues would be subsequently forwarded by DOJ
and that you have instructed the Department to work with the sponsors in crafting final
legislation that meets Administration concerns.

        This strategy is not without its difficulties. First, anything short of complete opposition
to the bill is likely to raise objections from our allies. Second, the bill's sponsors might accept
our objections and submit a bill that you would be obligated to sign. Third, and most
troublesome, the sponsors might accept some of our objections and refuse others. This would
place you in the position of either signing a bill with seriously objectionable provisions or
continuing to oppose a bill that has had some of its more egregious provisions excised, an action
that would engender the likely criticism that you are being overly rigid and that would weaken
the possibility of sustaining a veto. We believe, however, that unless you would be willing to
take the position that you oppose legislation that would make it illegal for adult males to

    best available course is that outlined in this memorandum.
