TEXT:
HHS/WH Counsel concur that Shapiro has to make the revised draft report
available to the pubic at the Commission's Saturday, 7:30-11:30 am June 7
mtg.    Shapiro does not think the report will have any surprises so we'll
know it's basic content in advance. The Commission will vote at the
meeting on whether to recommend legislation -- Shapiro expects a yes.
Given that, shouldn't we revisit 6/10 date for POTUS remarks? Any lessons
from the mammography announcement on how to coordinate commission
findings/POTUS response?
