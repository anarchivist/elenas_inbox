     TEXT:
     On Sunday morning, a joint statement by Gen. McCaffrey and Sandy Thurman
     entitled "Drug Czar and AIDS Czar Agree That Public Health policy Must Be
     Based on Sound Science" was issued on White House letterhead.  The
.
    contacts listed were at ONDCP and the AIDS office.

    While this looked, walked, and talked like a White House press release,
    the press office didn't find out about it until this morning.  I was on
    duty over the weekend and never heard about it.  We had other duty
    officers in the press office much of the weekend as well.  They never
    heard about it.  I don't know if Mike or Joe heard about it when they left
    yesterday, but I doubt it.

    Press releases cannot be issued by the White House without the press
    office knowing about it.  It's bad from a process point of view -- we
    should never be caught not knowing about such a statement and should be in
    on decisions about how it's issued and to whom -- and it's totally not
    necessary.  Even if this was just given to one reporter, we should still
    be aware of a statement on White House letterhead.

    Thanks for your cooperation.

    (I'm not getting into the issue of the statement itself.   I'm assuming
    that somebody at an appropriate level signed off on it.)
