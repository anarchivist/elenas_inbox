TEXT:
I checked with Mike Friedman about FDA actions to support its April
cloning jurisdiction statement. He is already exploring possible FDA next
steps. He has a group looking at actions, such as writing to IRBs,
professional societies, and individuals like Seed, to make certain FDA's
requirements will be followed.  He will let us know what he finds.  Mike
was also very confident in FDA's analysis of its cloning jurisdiction. He
thought the Post's story questioning FDA's authority was flawed and easy
to poke holes through.

One step we might take while we continue to monitor the Hill and while we
see what Mike delivers, is to encourage our allies in the patient and
biotech communities to remind Congressional leaders of their concerns with
cloning legislation favored by many Rs . .
