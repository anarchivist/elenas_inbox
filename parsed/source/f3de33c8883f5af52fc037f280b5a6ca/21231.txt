TEXT:
Two things for tomorrow's senior staff meeting:

1.   possible COPS announcement. As I discussed w/Bruce tonight, it looks
like we will be able to make a major COPS announcement next week -- either
on Thursday as the message event or as Friday's taped radio address.
Specifically, we will be able to announce about $370 million for some
11,500 police and police equivalents -- including 700 new cops ($100
million) for Los Angeles and another 800 for the rest of California.
However, we will need to get time on the schedule ASAP.

2.  Juvie Crime Bill. As of about 6:45 pm tonight, it looked like House
R's were going to succeed in attaching their juvie crime bills -- H.R. 3,
which we oppose, and HR 1818, which we generally support
(prevention/OJJDP) -- to a bill on the suspension calendar authorizing fun
ds for the Center for Missing and Exploited Children.  If they succeed,
these juvie bills could be a conferenable item.  It seems unlikely that
the House and Senate Dems will agree to appoint conferees to such a
conference, but it does mean that we will have to be vigilant.

In a related note, the Senate Dems may move forward w/their Crime Bill
tomorrow.
