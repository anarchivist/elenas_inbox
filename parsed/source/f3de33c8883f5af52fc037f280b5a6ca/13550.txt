TEXT:
I've sent you a new draft of the whole letter, with just the
doctor paragraph changed.  I actually took out the part saying
"there are doctors who believe", because it seemed awkward to say
that first, and then follow it by saying that there is broad
support in medical community that procedure should be available.
That construction underlines how narrow the support for the first
statement appears to be.
It's not ideal the way I have it either, because the answer we
give isn't on all fours with the question we pose in the first
sentence of the paragraph. But it's better than the alternative.
Actually -- maybe we should tinker with the way we pose the
question, so our answer will seem like more of an answer.
We could say, e.g., "Some have raised the qeustion whether the use
of this procedure is ever justifiable as a matter of medical
practice." Then answer as I have suggested. Think I'll make that
change and send you a new draft. tds
