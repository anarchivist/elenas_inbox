TEXT:
Riley and Harkin finally talked last evening.  Scott Fleming reports that
Harkin told Riley that "he would be cooperative if he were the only
obstacle to moving the bill" but if others proposed amendments to the UC,
he would propose his as well.

 Scott was a little tentative with this report--he was not with Riley when
the conversation occured, and got this report from Riley's assistant.
Scott will nail this down with Riley later this morning, and I'll let you
know when Scott gets back to me.

Assuming this is accurate, I think its decent news.  I don't believe we
need a POTUS call to Harkin.  I'll work with Scott and Broderick to
explore how and when it would be best to get Kennedy and Coats to hotline
this for a UC.
