TEXT:
I've ~ade two copies of the material from DOT.  (The only agency I've
heard from.)  One copy for us, one for you, and one to be handed over to
Cabinet Affairs at the 3:00 meeting today.

If you have received any other material, we should get an intern to make
the copies. Let me know if I can help.   Thanks.
