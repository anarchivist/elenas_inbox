    Post-Election Status of Patients' Bill of Rights. This week's election has virtually assured us
    a working majority in the House for a strong enforceable patients' bill of rights. Last summer,
    the Dingell-Ganske legislation lost by a 212-217 vote. Of the 210 Democrats who supported
    this legislation, 189 are returning to the House as are nine of the ten Republicans and the one
    Independent. In addition, almost every one of the 22 newly-elected Democrats campaigned on
    this issue and we expect most if not all of them to support a strong bill. As a result, before even
    counting any Republicans who might alter their position as a result of how strong this issue
    played in the campaign (we believe there may be five or more), that at least 220 Members would
    be likely supporters of legislation very similar to the Dingell-Ganske bill. On the Senate side,
    we believe that it may be possible to get as many as 50 votes on a bill that is a slightly
    strengthened version of the Graham-Chafee legislation, that includes virtually all of the
    protections advocated by your Quality Commission and is viewed by Congressman Dingell's
    staff as a very strong bill. In addition to the 45 Democrats who would support the final
    legislation, we would expect Senators Chafee and Spector and possibly Snowe, Collins, Jeffords,
    Voinivich and Bunning to support it. Although there are a number of outstanding issues, the
    primary roadblock to a compromise is likely to be related to the Dingell-Ganske state court
    enforcement. There is even relatively good news there because some of the trade unions are
    strongly insisting on a less controversial enforcement approach that has the dual benefit of being
    more attractive to moderate Republicans.
