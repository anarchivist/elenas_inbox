TEXT:
In the process of developing   the joint guidance from HHS, DOL and DOT on
using TANF and WtW funds for   transportation, an issue has been raised
about whether either funding   source can be used to buy a car for a welfare
recipient. We're interested    in your reachtion.

HHS' lawyers believe TANF funds can be used this way, but there is
concern--particularly on OMB's part--about whether we should specifically
mention this in the guidance. In the current version, HHS mentions using
TANF funds for loans to help someone lease or purchase a car. Even if not
mentioned, we need to be prepared with a response when some state or
community asks if this is allowable.
DOL strongly opposes using WtW funds to purchase cars for individuals.
They have several arguments including the time-limited nature of WtW
funds, the more limited amount of funding compared to TANF, the fact that
if TANF can be used for this purpose than we fail the 'if not otherwise
available' test on WtW supportive services. More generally, they're
concerned about appearances and potential IG issues. Also, under JTPA,
capital items over a certain dollar amount ($5,000?) belong to the federal
government. We're exploring whether DOL might entertain allowing car
purchases for individuals if they were under this limit.

A few states/counties have car purchase initiatives, but on an extremely
limited scale and usually in partnership with banks or non-profits who are
involved in financing.   We do not think anyone is inclined to do this on a
large scale, but it does seem to be an option we should consider if it
helps someone succeed on· the job.
