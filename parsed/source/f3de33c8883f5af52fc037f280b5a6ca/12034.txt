TEXT:
The memo talks about the need to make a compelling case for our ESEA
proposal. Do you have some (hopefully short) handy paper that lays out
the key elements of our ESEA proposal? Also, the memo notes many
off-the-cuff speeches the P. has given making his argument for equal
opportunity in education. Do you know of any in particular that I might
look at? If they're off-the-cuff, I assume they're of the fundraising
variety, but I don't really know.  tds
