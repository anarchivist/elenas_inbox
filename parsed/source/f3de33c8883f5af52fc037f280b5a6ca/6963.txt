TEXT:
with John Sweeney of the AFL on steel, and apparently Sweeney cornered
Rubin after the meeting on FICA/workfare.  I don't know how Rubin
responded, but Karl Scholz had given Rubin talking points on this based on
my alert to him.   I will follow up and get a better sense of what
happened.

I doubt DOL will give this a green light unless they get the word that
people here want it to go, so I think it still rests with Podesta.
