TEXT:
Probably the most accessible site for keeping up with the latest news
stories on tobacco is a WWW site maintained by Gene Borio, a tobacco
control activist. His site provides links to the actual news stories.
His address is: www.tobacco.org

If anyone would like more stories than can be found at this site,
particularly stories about what is going on internationally, I receive by
e-mail a clipping service from another activist, Jack Cannon, that 'I would
be glad to remail.
