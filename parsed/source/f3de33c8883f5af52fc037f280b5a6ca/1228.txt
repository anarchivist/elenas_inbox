                         STATE FLEXIBILITY TO PRIVATIZE
                       WELFARE, FOOD STAMPS, AND MEDICAID

        The new welfare law explicitly allows states to administer and provide Temporary
Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) through contracts with private entities. Now, two states
(Texas and Wisconsin) are seeking federal approval to contract out certain functions of the Food
Stamp and Medicaid programs as well. These states believe that a competitive contracting
process will result in greater program efficiencies while protecting recipients. Organized labor
is concerned that privatizing these government functions will displace state and local government
workers (with a resulting loss of union membership) and will undermine beneficiary rights to due
process and confidentiality.

        Since June of 1995, the State of Texas has been developing a plan to streamline the
application process for public assistance. Since May of 1996, federal agencies and the State of
Texas have been negotiating over the conditions of a Request for Offers Texas wants to release
regarding TANF, Medicaid, Food Stamps, and certain other federally-funded nutrition programs.
 Under the Texas plan, private contractors would conduct the application and eligibility
determination process, and the state would certify the determinations. Texas sought approval to
release the Request for Offers by January 1997, but instead received a letter from HHS saying
"We cannot provide a final decision on your request at this time." Rep. Charles Stenholm, one
of the Administration's strongest welfare reform allies, complained about the delay to Frank
Raines in a February 24th letter, saying the state of Texas is "willing to make accomodations to
address administration concerns." According to March 7th Washington Post, the state has
decided to move ahead without the Administration's approval.

       A preliminary interagency analysis of the Texas proposal (involving the DPC, OMB,
Agriculture, HHS, Labor, and OPM) found that:

   ·   Current law explicitly allows T ANF to be administered by private organizations;
       · Current law Food Stamps and Medicaid, as well as the Administration's Medicaid
          budget proposal, could probably be interpreted to allow privatizing the eligibility
          determination process, as Texas wants. The Administration needs to decide what
          policy it wants to pursue.

         Private contractors determining eligibility for Medicaid and Food Stamps would have to
follow federal eligibility rules, since those programs remain federally guaranteed individual
entitlements (unlike TANF). If the Administration does not allow private contracting for Food
Stamps and Medicaid, then states will be discouraged from contracting in the TANF program
because having separate eligibility systems would create administrative difficulties (requiring, for
example, some individuals to go to one location to apply for TANF and another to apply for Food
Stamps and Medicaid, unlike now, when nearly all states have one-stop, government-run
eligibility centers). The challenge for the Administration will be to determine how to allow
privatization while protecting beneficiary's rights and not undermining the federal guarantee of
Medicaid and Food Stamps which the Administration fought so hard to protect.
