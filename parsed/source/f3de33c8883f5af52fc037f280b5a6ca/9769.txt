TEXT:
As you may know from the papers, the Supreme Court has accepted for
expedited review Anderson v. Roe, a case challenging California's policy
of providing lower welfare benefits to new state residents.

HHS and DOJ are currently reviewing the case and plan to make a
recommendation to us and counsel's office as to whether we should file a
brief in the case. The U.S. is not a party to the suit (only the state of
California was sued), so we are not required to do anything.  As you may
recall, the welfare law made such two-tiered benefits an explicit state
option.

Briefs would need to be filed by Nov. 7th. Harriet Rabb is currently
leaning towards staying out of the case altogether (we did so on a
previous case, Green v. Anderson).  Other options include filing on behalf
of one side (California or plaintiff) or filing a brief explaining our
understanding of the statute.

Harriet sent a note to Chuck Ruff saying they are looking into this.   She
and Marcy Wilder of her office are working with Ed Needler at Justice.

In a week or so when Justice and HHS have gathered their thoughts, I
assume we'd want to have them over here to discuss and Elena, I assume you
would want to be there.

 Attached is a slightly revised version of the signing statement on
 S. 53 - Baseball Antitrust (the only difference is that we added a
 paragraph on Curt Flood). Since the clock on the bill has started we will
 need to finalize this signing statement ASAP. Therefore please provide
 your sign-off or any comments by 2pm, Friday, October 16th. Thanks

 Draft Signing Statement for S. 53

         I am pleased today to sign into law S. 53, the O&Curt Flood Act of
 1998.08 This legislation is the successful culmination of bipartisan
 efforts to treat employment matters with respect to Major League Baseball
 players under the antitrust laws in the same way such matters are treated
 for athletes in other professional sports.  I particularly want to thank
 Chairman Hatch, Senator Leahy, Chairman Hyde and Representative Conyers
 for their efforts in guiding this legislation through Congress.


         It is especially fitting that this legislation will forever honor
 a courageous baseball player and human being, the late Curt Flood.
 FloodO,s enormous talents on the baseball diamond were matched by his
 courage off the field.  It was 29 years ago this month that Curt Flood
 refused a trade from the St. Louis Cardinals to the Philadelphia
 Phillies. His bold stand set in motion the events which culminate in the
 law I am signing today.  The personal and professional sacrifices made by
 Curt Flood have benefitted all players since then and played a major role
 in the current enormous popularity of our national pastime.
         The Act appropriately limits baseballO,s special
 judicially-created antitrust exemption by expressly applying the antitrust
 laws to certain conduct of Major League Baseball.  The legislation would
 not affect the applicability of those laws to certain matters that, it has
 been argued, the exemption would legitimately protect (including franchise
 relocation rules and the minor leagues). The Act provides that certain
 conduct of Major League Baseball is subject to the antitrust laws; the
 applicability of the antitrust laws with respect to all other conduct is
 unchanged.  The Act in no way codifies or extends the baseball exemption.
         The Act does not in any way limit the standing of the United
 States to bring an antitrust action. The antitrust laws protect the
 publicO,s interest in the efficient operation of the free market system,
 thereby protecting consumers, and the United States has standing to sue to
 enjoin all violations.
         Treating employment matters with respect to Major League Baseball
 players under the antitrust laws in the same way such matters are treated
 for athletes in other professional sports is sound policy.   I know I am
 joined by millions of baseball fans in hoping that the Curt Flood Act of
 1998 helps baseball avoid stoppages of play it has too often experienced
 as a result of player/owner disagreements.
