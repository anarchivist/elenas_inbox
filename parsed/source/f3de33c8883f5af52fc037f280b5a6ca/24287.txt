 The Honorable Henry J. Hyde
 Chairman
 Committee on the Judiciary
 U.S. House of Representatives
 Washington, D.C.  20515


 Dear Chairman Hyde:

         Today, your Committee will mark-up H.R. 3736, the O&Workforce
 Improvement and Protection Act of 199808 which is intended to address the
 growing demand for skilled workers in the information technology (IT)
 industry by enacting a temporary increase in the annual cap on the number
 of visas for temporary foreign 0&specialty08 workers under the H-1B
 program, while also effecting reforms to the H-1B program that would help
 target their usage to industries and employers that are actually
 experiencing skill shortages.

         The Administration believes that the first step in increasing the
 availability of skilled workers must be raising the skills of U.S. workers
 and helping the labor market work better to match employers with U.S.
 workers. Therefore, substantial additional efforts to increase the skill
 level of U.S. workers and needed improvements in the H-1B visa'program are
 necessary prerequisites for the Administration to support any short-term
 increase in the number of visas for temporary foreign workers.

         We are pleased that H.R. 3736 as reported from the Immigration and
 Claims Subcommittee is consistent with one of our primary objectives,
 insofar as it links a temporary increase in the H-1B cap to the enactment
 of meaningful reforms to the H-1B visa program. H.R. 3736 would help
 ensure that U.S. workers do not lose their jobs to temporary foreign
 workers and that qualified U.S. workers have the opportunity to fill a job
 before a temporary foreign worker is hired. Moreover, H.R. 3736 modestly
 expands enforcement authority to help prevent employer abuses of the H-1B
 program. These reforms will effectively target H-1B visas to industries
 experiencing skill shortages. The Administration strongly opposes
 amendments that would weaken these reforms.

         Unfortunately, H.R. 3736 does not contain any provision to
 encourage additional training of U.S. workers.  Training is a vital
 component of our strategy to address the long-term demand for highly
 skilled U.S. workers and to enhance the international competitiveness of
 important U.S. industries. An effective training strategy would also work
 to reduce the demand for H-1B visas. The Administration strongly supports
 amending H.R. 3736 to provide for additional training opportunities for
 U.S. workers and believes that this training should be funded, in part,
 through a modest H-1B application fee paid by employers. The
 Administration is also concerned that the increase in the annual number of
 H-1B visas reflected in this bill is too large, although we agree that the
 increase should last for only three years.



         The Administration believes that H.R. 3736 would substantially
 improve the current H-IB program and, with the addition of a meaningful
 training provision and a modest reduction in the level of increase in the
 annual H-IB visa cap, would garner the AdministrationO,s support. We look
 forward to working with the Congress on these and other specific
 provisions in the bill.

         The Office of Management and Budget advises that there is no
 objection to the submission of this report from the standpoint of the
 AdministrationO,s program.



 Sincerely,


 Labor                  Justice
