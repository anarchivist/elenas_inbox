                 PRESIDENT CLINTON: BUILDING ON WHAT WORKS
                           TO IMPROVE EDUCATION

Today in his radio address, President Clinton reiterated his call for education accountability
measures that build on the success of state reforms and asked Congress to pass his broad
education agenda to give states the tools they need to give all children a world class education.

Education Accountability Measures That Build on What Works. In his State of the Union
Address, President Clinton announced a package of accountability measures designed to
hold students, teachers, and schools to high standards, and to ensure that school districts
and states provide students with a high quality education. Today, the President again called
for ending social promotion; making sure teachers are qualified; getting states to tum around low
performing schools; providing parents with school report cards; and instituting effective
discipline policies as requirements of receiving funds under the Elementary and Secondary
Education Act. The President applauded efforts that states and school districts are making,
under the leadership of committed governors, in places like North Carolina, Michigan,
Delaware, Pennsylvania, and California to implement these common-sense principles. In
those states, and others, these accountability measures are producing results. President Clinton .
wants to build on those efforts and ensure that all children reap the rewards of these
accountability measures. He called on Congress to enact these tough accountability measures
and ensure that the federal dollars support what works and not what doesn't.

Strengthened Investments in Education for the 21st Century. The President's efforts to
support high academic standards for all children includes an unprecedented commitment of
national resources to help states and local districts improve education. The President's balanced
budget focuses on real improvements in student achievement by accelerating change and
increasing accountability based on high standards. President Clinton's budget calls for
continued strengthened investments in education to hire 100,000 teachers and reduce class size in
the early grades, modernize up to 6,000 schools, triple funding to expand after-school activities
and provide intensive help to students to meet high standards, raise the quality of teaching,
improve literacy, enhance technology in the schools, recruit outstanding teachers to underserved
high-poverty rural areas and inner cities, and provide new pathways to college for disadvantaged
students. The President challenged Congress fund his education agenda and help states and
districts provide all children with a first-class education in the 21st century.

Release of State-By-State Class Size Funding. The Education Department released data that
shows how much each state would receive under President Clinton's FY 2000 budget request to
reduce class size. The class size reduction initiative was launched last fall to help local schools
hire 100,000 well-prepared teachers over seven years to reduce class sizes in grades 1-3 to a
nationwide average of 18 students. The FY 2000 budget includes $1.4 billion to hire 38,000 new
teachers by the end of the second year of the program.
