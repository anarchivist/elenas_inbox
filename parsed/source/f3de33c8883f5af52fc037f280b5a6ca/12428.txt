     Teen Birth Rates Down In U.S., Report Finds

     WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Births among American teen-agers, already at a
     record low in recent
     years, were down even more in 1997, a government report said Thursday.

     The teen birth rate fell by four percent in 1997, the sixth year in a row
     that it has declined, said the
     report by the U.S. Health and Human services department. The teen birth
     rate fell 16 percent
     between 1991 and 1997.

     "We should take some encouragement from the fact that we're clearly
     making progress, and we're
     clearly moving in the right direction and we're clearly doing some things
     right, " Vice President Al
     Gore said at a White House meeting with young people and adults working to
     combat teen
     pregnancies.

     However, he said, the teen birth rate remained the highest of any
     developed country.

     "We shouldn't get carried away with good news ... We still have an awful
     lot of hard work to do, ' ,
     Gore added.

     The report said U.S. teen-age girls between 15 and 19 had a birth rate of
     52.3 births per 1,000.
     That made for nearly 500,000 births to teen-agers in 1997, the latest year


  for which data were
  available, it said.

  The number of women having babies out of wedlock also declined, to 44
  births per 1,000 women
  aged 15 to 44, two percent lower than in 1996, the report said. A total of
  1.26 million babies were
  born to unmarried mothers in 1997.

  The highest teen-age birth rate was in 1957, but most of the teens who
  gave birth were married at
  that time.

  Gore criticized the media for frequent portrayals of sex.

  " I think it's fair to conclude that maybe one factor in the u.s. having
  the highest rate of teen
  pregnancy in the developed world is also the prevalence of sexualized
  messages, particularly in so
  much of the media, " he said.

  But he also said some media outlets have cooperated in promoting messages
  of responsibility and
  hailed other efforts to educate teens about the consequences of teen
  pregnancy.

  "The message is beginning to get through"       he said.

  At the White House event, Brandi Chapple, a Laurel, Maryland, high school
  senior and co-host of
  Black Entertainment Television's Teen Summit program, offered tips she had
  picked up through the
  program and essay contests she has judged for avoiding unwanted
  pregnancies.

  Chapple said she practiced sexual abstinence,     and said it was important to
  keep busy and involved.

  "You    c~n't   control your hormones, but you can control your time, "   she
  said.

  Overall the U.S. birth rate is at a record low of 14.5 births per 1,000
  people, or 3.9 million births in
  1997.

  The report also said fewer mothers were smoking, with 13.2 percent of
  women saying they smoked
  while pregnant. Smoking can lead to low birth weights and has been
  associated with sudden infant
  death syndrome (SIDS or crib death) .

  Teen Birth Rates Down In U.S.

  WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Births among American teen-agers, already at a
  record low in recent
  years, were down even more in 1997, the Health and Human Services (HHS)


  department said
  Thursday.

  The teen birth rate fell by 4 percent in 1997, the sixth year in a row
  that it has declined, the report
  said. The teen birth rate fell 16 percent between 1991 and 1997.

  births per 1,000. That
  made for nearly 500,000 births to teen-agers in 1997, the latest year for
  which data were available, it
  said.

  "Communities and parents all across America have joined with us to help
  our young people
  understand that they should delay parenthood until they are truly ready to
  nurture and support a child
  of their own, " HHS Secretary Donna Shalala said in a statement.

  The number of women having babies out of wedlock also declined, to 44
  births per 1,000 women
  aged 15 to 44, 2 percent lower than in 1996, the report said. A total of
