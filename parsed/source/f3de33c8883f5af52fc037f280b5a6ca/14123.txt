TEXT:
According to Transportation, staffers of the conferees met with
the interest groups yesterday. After the meeting, they "went to
the legislative clerk with language." Presumably, this includes
some compromise on the liability caps issue, but no one knows for
sure. We will circulate language as soon as it becomes available.
