                           The Clinton Administration:      Fighting Hate in Our Communities

  ~           In Richland, Mississippi, four members of a neo-Nazi skinhead organization pled guilty to
              conspiracy and interfering with the housing rights of an interracial couple by throwing a
              molotov cocktail at their trailer home.

              Three defendants, one of whom is a racist skinhead and a member of the white supremacist
              group "South Bay Nazi Youth," were convioed of a civil rights conspiracy after they drove
              through the streets of Lubbock, Texas, hunting African-American men, luring them to the
              conspirators' car, and shooting the men at close range with a short-barreled shotgun. One
              victim died, one was seriously wounded in the face, and another had a finger blown off.

              In Livingston, Texas, six defendants pled guilty to civil rights charges for beating randomly
              selected African-American men with a rifle and a rodeo belt buckle, and punching them
              repeatedly as they tried to escape. The defendants had been angered at seeing other black men
              in the presence of white women.

              In Livermore Falls, Maine, two defendants pled guilty to civil right charges charges after firing
              shots at the Latino vioims' fleeing car, wounding one victim in the arm.

 Fighting Hate Crimes Through Tough Law Enforcement:

 Vigorously Prosecuting Hate Crimes Under the Civil Rights Statutes. Several federal statutes
 provide jurisdiction to prosecute hate crimes -- crimes where the perpetrator selects his victim on
 the basis of certain characteristics such as race, color, religion, and national origin. Since 1989,
 over 500 defendants in more than half of the 50 states have been convicted on federal criminal
 civil rights charges for interfering with various federally protected rights of minority victims.
 Virtually all defendants charged in these cases have been convicted. President Clinton's Justice
 Department has vigorously prosecuted hate crime incidents, including where the defendants were
 members of organized hate groups, such as the Ku Klux Klan and various skinhead gangs .

. Enhanced Penalties For Hate Crimes. As part of the historic 1994 Crime Act, the President
 signed the Hate Crimes Sentencing Enhancement Act which provides for longer sentences where
 the offense is determined to be a hate crime. In 1996 alone, 27 cases received enhanced
 sentences.

 The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) Provides Expertise in Arson and Explosives
                                                                         Hex-Dump Conversion

Investigations to Help Fight Hate Crimes Throughout America. While enforcing explosives and
arson laws over which it has jurisdiction, ATF has participated in the investigations of bombing
and arson incidents triggered by animus against characteristics such as race and sexual orientation.
 The ATF, for example, has investigated the bombing of predominantly gay bars and
nightclubs.

Sensible Gun Regulation Helps Stem the Flow Of Firearms that Can Fuel Hate Group Activity.
Many organized hate groups use guns to carry out violent offenses covered by hate crime
statutes. Treasury bureaus work to intercept gun shipments into the U.S. and to regulate the
illegal sale and possession of firearms by potential perpetrators of hate crimes and other offenses.

Prosecuting Hate Crimes Aimed At Our Houses of Worship:

Fighting Hate Crimes Aimed at Houses of Worship. The President fought for and signed the
Church Arson Prevention Act of 1996, which facilitates prosecutions of racially motivated arsons
and other acts of desecration against houses of worship .

.Creating the National Church Arson Task Force. President Clinton established the National
Church Arson Task Force (NCATF) in June 1996 to oversee the investigation and prosecution
of arsons at houses of worship around the country. The NCATF has brought together the FBI,
ATF, and Justice Department prosecutors in partnership with state and local law enf<;>rcement
officers and prosecutors. Well over 200 ATF and FBI investigators have been deployed in these
investigations. In addition, the NCATF has coordinated with other agencies, such as the
Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Department of Housing and Urban
Development, in the federal government's efforts to promote arson prevention and provide
resources for church rebuilding.

»      Many of the 508 incidents investigated by NCATF have been solved, mainly by a
       combination of federal and state arrests and prosecutions. Since January 1995, there
       have been 240 arrests and over 100 convictions, including the first convictions under the
       Church Arson Prevention Act. . This rate of arrest (35 ) for crimes that may have been
       motivated by hate or bias is more than double the 16 rate of arrest for arsons in general.

Working with Communities Against Hate:

Bringing Communities Together to Fight Hate. The Department of Justice's Community Relations
Service often becomes involved when a hate crime incident threatens harmonious racial and
ethnic relations in a community. The Service uses mediation to provide representatives of
community groups and local governments with an impartial forum to restore stability through
dialogue and discussion. It conducts training conferences on how to prevent and respond to
hate crimes for state and local law enforcement and agencies, academic institutions, and civic,
business, and community organizations.
                                                                     Automated Records Management SYstem
                                                                             Hex-Dump Conversion ·

Focusing on Youth Attitudes that Create Hate Crimes. The Department of Education is
supporting efforts at the local level to develop and implement innovative and effective strategies
for preventing hate crimes, including by funding programs aimed at reducing violent,
hate-motivated behavior among youth.
Understanding the Problem of Hate Crimes:

Gathering Information on the National Scope of the Problem. The FBI Uniform Crime Report
collects the only national data on hate crimes through the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR)
Program. In 1996, 11,355 law enforcement agencies, representing 84 of the nation's
population, participated in the FBI's data collection efforts. These departments reported 8,759
incidents of hate cimes in 1996.

Studying Hate Crimes: The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) has funded the first
large-scale study of the mental health consequences of hate crimes, focusing on anti-gay hate
crimes. The preliminary findings of this research are that hate crimes have more serious
psychological effects on victims than do non-bias motivated, but otherwise similar crimes. The
study also provides information about the prevalence of anti-gay hate crimes and the rate at
which these crimes are reported to the police.
