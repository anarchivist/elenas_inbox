                                   JUNE 11, 1997


Q:   What is the directive that the President signed today?

A:   Today, the President signed a directive to ensure that the Treasury
     Department do everything possible to enforce the Youth Handgun Safety
     Act -- including requiring that federal gun dealers post signs and issue
     written warnings that:

           (1) Make clear that it is generally illegal for any adult to transfer a
           handgun to a minor (under 18), or for that minor to possess that
           handgun, period;

           (2) Make clear that transferring a handgun to a minor may be
           punishable by up to 10 years imprisonment;

           (3) Warn that handguns are a leading contributor to juvenile
           violence and fatalities; and

           (4) State that safely storing and locking handguns will help ensure
           compliance with this law.

Q:   What is the impact of this directive?    How is it any different -- or how does
     it augment -. current law?

A:   This directive will require, for the first time ever, that federal firearms
     dealers (FFLs) post signs and issue written warnings about the responsibility
     that gun purchasers have under current law to not transfer a handgun to
     juveniles -- as well as about the dangers that handguns pose to kids
     generally. That's an important change for two reasons.

     First, for almost every gun that gets into a juvenile's hands, an adult had
     the opportunity -- in fact, the legal responsibility -- to stop that transfer from
     taking place. Today's directive puts adult gun purchasers on notice
     about this responsibility -- and warns them about the legal sanctions that
     may apply if this responsibility is ignored.

     Second, the mix of kids and guns is at the heart of the nation's youth
     violence epidemic. Since the mid 1980s, the number of kids killing with a
     gun has quadrupled; the number of kids killed by guns has nearly tripled;
     and teenage boys today are more likely to die of gunshot wounds than all
     natural causes combined. Still, we do more to warn Americans about

                                               Automated Records Management System
                                               Hex.J)ump Conversion
     that guns pose to our children. Today's directive represents an effort to
     correct this imbalance.

Q:   Can you please clarify under what authority you're taking this action?

A:   The authority for this directive is two-fold:

           (1) 18 U.S.C. Sec. 926(a) generally provides that the Secretary of the
           Treasury may proscribe certain rules and regulations to carry out the
           provisions of the 1968 Gun Control Act as amended; and

           (2) 18 U.S.C. Sec. 922(x)(1) -- or the Youth Handgun Safety Act,
           which was included by Senator Kohl as an amendment to the 1994
           crime bill -- prohibits, in most circumstances, juveniles from
           possessing handguns, and adults from transferring handguns to
           juveniles.

     Our directive finds that additional warnings are necessary to fully carry out
     the prohibitions of the Youth Handgun Safety Act, and calls for signs to be
     posted and written warnings issued to help ensure compliance with the
     law.

Q:   What punishments are provided for in the Youth Handgun Safety Act?

A:   Juveniles who violate the ban on handgun possession are subject to
     mandatory probation. Adults who violate the prohibition on transferring
     handguns to juveniles are punishable by a prison term of 1 to 10 years,
     depending on the circumstances. Additionally, the Administration has
     called for increasing both of these penalties in its juvenile crime legislation.

Q:   Have you successfully prosecuted anyone under the Youth Handgun
     Safety Act? Do you know how many persons have been prosecuted
     overall?

A:   No, I don't have a number on the total prosecutions. But I do have an
     example. I know that the U.S. Attorney's Office in Tennessee successfully
     prosecuted an illegal gun dealer who -- among other illegal firearms
     activities -- sold a pistol to a 13-year old. He's been sentenced to 33
     months in prison.

Q:   Do you think that this directive will really help keep handguns from
     juveniles? Shouldn't your directive do more than simply call for signs and
     warnings?
     impact. And it certainly makes as much sense to warn gun purchasers
     about their legal responsibilities and the dangers of handguns as it does
     for the many other products that are sold with similar warnings.

     At the same time, there is only so much we can do under existing law to
     keep guns out of the hands of juveniles. That's why our juvenile crime bill
     includes 3 key gun provisions: it increases penalties for transferring guns to
     juveniles; it prohibits violent juveniles from ever owning guns; and it
     requires that federal gun dealers provide child safety locks with every gun
     sold. With these additional changes in law, we will be able to do even
     more to keep guns away from our kids.

Q:   If you're going to issue warnings about guns, why don't you just regulate
     them like other products through the Consumer Products Safety
     Commission?

A:   First of aiL today's directive does more than simply warn gun purchasers
     about the dangers of handguns; It makes clear to gun purchasers that
     they have responsibilities -- and that transferring a handgun to a juvenile is
     a crime punishable by as much as 10 years imprisonment.

     Second, the mandate of the Consumer Products Safety Commission does
     not include firearms. The Commission is expressly prohibited from getting
     into matters concerning the manufacture and sale of firearms and
     firearms ammunition. So we simply don't have this authority.

Q.   What is the Administration's position on the various Republican proposals
     to combat juvenile crime?

A.   First of all, we are opposed to H.R. 3, the bill that passed the House. It
     does not come close to representing a comprehensive attack on gangs
     and guns. It doesn't guarantee that Boston's successful juvenile crime
     initiative -- Operations Cease-fire and Nite Lite -- can be replicated. It
     doesn't include any provisions relating to kids and guns. And it does not
     specifically address the high number of crimes committed by juveniles
     when school goes out.

     We're hopeful that the Senate will work with us to address these issues.
     The Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to consider legislation this
     Thursday, and we are communicating our concerns to them now. We
     will have to wait and see how the mark-up in that committee goes before
     we know whether or not we'll be able to support a Senate bill.

A.   The legislation proposed by the President in February is part of an overall
     Anti-Gang and Youth Violence Strategy that seeks to crack down on
     violent gangs, reduce youth violence, and provide our kids with positive
     alternatives to steer them away from gangs, guns, and drugs.

     The strategy provides critical resources for state and local prosecutors to
     target, prosecute and convict violent youth gangs. It permits Federal
     prosecutors to prosecute juveniles in adult court when they commit violent
     crimes. It requires child safety locks for guns to prevent accidents and
     thefts, and extends the Brady Law so that violent juveniles can never own
     a gun. Finally, the Strategy also calls for at least 1,000 after school
     initiatives to keep kids off the streets and give them positiv~ alternatives.

     The Administration calls on Congress to pass juvenile crime legislation
     addressing these key issues.
