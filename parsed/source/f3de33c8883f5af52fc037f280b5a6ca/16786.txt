TEXT:
I reviewed my notes from the meeting with the Black Leadership Forum and
the follow-up notes that were sent to me by Yvonne Scruggs.  Here is the
statement and question Elaine raised reo  test:

"The U.S. Department of Education is launching a testing initiative for
4th and 8th graders which is felt to be so dangerously inequitable that
half of the states have refused to administer this test, and individual
cities are being solicited to pilot the tests instead.  How can we stop
the implementation of this test which is unvalidated, language-biased,
unstandardized, non verifiable and unregulated reo the use of its'
results?"

I would imagine whoever speaks to Elaine, we should be prepared to address
the above question and statement.   Hope this helps!
