TEXT:
        Bill Lee is coming over this Friday to meet with   Chuck Ruff, Chris
Edley and me on civil rights issues. Chris is interested   in school
desegregation as well as other education issues, such as   testing, and no
doubt we will spend significant time on these topics. We   meet at 11:00 in
Chuck's office. You are both welcome.
