Subject:         Outsourcing in Wisconsin

The Wisconsin Secretary of HHS, Jean Rodgers, called USDA today to say
that they expect an answer on their waiver request this week. Their
privatization effort includes Food Stamps and Medicaid. HCFA apparently
has not raised concerns about outsourcing, but has raised other issues.
Ms. Rodgers plans to call Kevin Thurm or John Monahan with the same
message.

If Wisconsin does not get an answer they plan to raise the issue to a
"higher level".  I assume this means the White House. Just wanted to give
you a heads up.
