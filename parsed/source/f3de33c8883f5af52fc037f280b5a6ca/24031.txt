      TEXT:
      Treasury wasn't able to run the 55 cent option in time, so I sent it to
      Peter Reineke yesterday without it. Am sharing final version with OMB,
      Leg Affairs, and Treasury.



      I did just get the 55 cents numbers ... essentially its $2,150 per child,
      with a net revenue effect of $6.3 billion (Peter was looking for $4 to $5
      billion range) .

      I made very clear this is technical assistance, etc.

                                           Tobacco Technical Assistance
                                                  June 8,1999


          Below are several approaches that would reduce youth smoking and raise revenue for health-
          related programs in FY 2000. All estimates are preliminary.


          Payments Per Child Smoker

          Tobacco companies would pay per-child payments based on the number of children smoking
          nationwide. Alternatives include:

          ·   A one-time payment of $1 ,200 per child raises about $4.4 billion in FY 2000, less about $600
              million in lost excise tax revenues, for a net revenue effect of$3.8 billion. This payment
              amounts to 22 cents per pack; because such payments would .be nondeductible for the
              companies, retail prices would go up by 33 cents per pack.

          ·   A one-time payment of $900 per child raises about $3.4 billion in FY 2000, less about $500
              million in lost excise tax revenues, for a net effect of $2.9 billion. This translates into 17
              cents per pack in payment, and a 26-cent increase in retail prices.


          Acceleration of Excise Tax Increase

          The 1997 Balanced Budget Act raised the tobacco excise tax 10 cents per pack effective January
          1,2000 and another 5 cents effective January 1,2002. Accelerating the scheduled 15 cent
          tobacco tax increase, so that it takes effect in FY 2000, would add about $1.1 billion in FY 2000.
          (The revenue would be slightly less if coupled with the industry payment because the payment
          would increase cigarette prices, reducing cigarette consumption as well as the revenue raised by
          the accelerated excise tax.) This proposal was included in the Administration's FY 2000 budget.

                                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion
