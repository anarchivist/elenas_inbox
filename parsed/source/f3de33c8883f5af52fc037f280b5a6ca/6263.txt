Here's what I'm planning to send them.     Any thoughts?

What the President could say at the prayer breakfast reo welfare reform

        We have begun to put an end to the culture of dependency, and to
elevate our values of family, work and responsibility.  After decades of
finger-pointing and failure, we ended the old welfare system, and now
weD,re replacing welfare checks with paychecks.  I am proud that there are
4.3 million fewer people on welfare' now than the day I took office.

         To help people leave welfare for work, weD,ve created more than 14
million jobs since I took office.   I fought for, and won, a $3 billion
welfare-to-work fund in the Balanced Budget Act targeted specifically to
areas of the country where jobs may be scarce.    I also challenged
companies all across the nation to hire welfare recipients -- nearly 3,000
have agreed so far -- and have committed the federal government to hire
,its fair share of workers from the welfare rolls'.

         We must make sure that those on welfare not only get jobs but have
the support they need to succeed in the work place. Throughout history,
the faith community has played a critical role in helping families in
need.  Today, I urge every congregation in every community to mentor
families making the transition from welfare to work.   To support these
efforts, the Vice President has launched the Coalition to Sustain
Success.   Some of you are already members of this coalition, but I urge
each and everyone of you to join.
