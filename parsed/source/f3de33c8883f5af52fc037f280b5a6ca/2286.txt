TEXT:
The NY Times (Sara Wyatt) is working on a story for tomorrow.      So, we
really need to get sign-off on the talking points today.

Here's another copy of the draft:

DRAFT -- revised as of 5-14-97 12:30pm

Talking Points: DNC/Domestic Partner (Health Care)
Benefits for Same Sex Partners


Background: Starting July 1, 1997, the DNC will make available to domestic
partners of its gay and lesbian employees its health care benefits
program.  The proposed definition of domestic partners is: D&two unmarried
adult individuals of the same sex who have cohabitated for at least twelve
consecutive months in an exclusive, intimate relationship to be of
indefinite duration.DB

Q:      What is the PresidentD,s view of the DNCD,s decision to provide
same sex domestic partner benefits for its employees?

A:      He believes that businesses and not-for-profit organizations
have that option.  It is up to them to determine what is in their best
interest and in the best interests of their employees.  It is noteworthy
that some of AmericaD,s largest and most prominent corporations such as
American Express, Bank of America, Eastman Kodak, IBM, Microsoft, Time
Warner and Xerox now provide domestic partner benefits. The DNC appears
to have made a similar business decision.

Q:      Did the President approve the DNC policy before it was
announced? Was he aware of it?

A:         No.   Decisions relating to employee benefits are made by the


Chairman and senior DNC management.   The White House was made aware of the
policy change at a staff level.

Q:      What is the White House policy on this -- are White House
employees eligible for domestic partner benefits?

A:      No. White House employees are governed by the same rules as all
other federal employees and these benefits are not currently available to
federal employees.

Q:      Would the President support an effort to make domestic partner
benefits available to federal employees?

A:      As there are millions of federal employees, this issue - which
is relatively new - would at a minimum first have to be studied by
Congress and the Executive Branch and examined under a cost/benefit
analysis.

Q:      Is such a study currently underway?

A:     Not to my knowledge.

Q:      The PresidentO,s supporters in the gay community, many of whom
are still angry with him for signing the Defense of Marriage Act last
year, argue that if he is not going to let them get married, then domestic
partner benefits are an important way to give recognition to their
relationships.  Does the President agree?

A:      The President is aware that many communities and institutions
are considering whether basic benefits can be provided outside the context
of traditional marriage. The challenge in addressing these issues is to
remain sensitive to the values of our communities while preserving the
fundamental right to live free from unjustified discrimiriation.  In our
countryO,s history we have, for good reason, looked first to state and
local governments, as well as the private sector, to consider evolving
issues like these.  I think that the President supports the efforts of
business and communities to find solutions that work for them and their
employees in an age when many Americans are in non-traditional
relationships.
