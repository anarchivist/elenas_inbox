TEXT:
Here is my latest version of the class size memo.

It incorporates the higher budget figures for years 6 and 7.

It tries to incorporate ED's and Bruce's comments on the basic skills
testing issue. Bruce and Elena, you may want to pay particular attention
to how this is laid out for the President, and whether we need to present
this as a formal decision.

I'm sending a copy of this to Mike Smith as well.
