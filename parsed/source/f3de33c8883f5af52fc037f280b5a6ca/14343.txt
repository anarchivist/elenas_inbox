TEXT:
I never know who gets what from HHS -- so I am sending the
following two items to Keith for OMB, Elena, and Emily.  Bruce,
let me know if you need them. Diana, I assume you have them.
They are:
HHS proposed answers to the 10/23 state questions.  HHS needs our
clearance on these which are mostly technical. Please review and
let me know by Friday morning if you have any problems.
A summary of the NY welfare proposal from Pataki.

 Let me know if there's any confusion.     Thanks.
