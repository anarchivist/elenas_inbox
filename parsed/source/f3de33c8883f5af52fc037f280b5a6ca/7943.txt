    PLEASE REVIEW THE ED DRAFT LETTER BELOW FOR HOUSE COMMITTEE MARKUP
    TOMORROW, THURSDAY, MORNING, AND PROVIDE ANY COMMENTS BY 5:30 P.M. TODAY,
    WED., JUNE 3RD.


    The Committee on Education and the Workforce
    House of Representatives
    Washington, DC 20515-0501

                                            DRAFT                   June 3, 1998

    Dear Mr. Chairman,

    I am writing to express my strong opposition to H.R. 3892.   It is
    essential that we help limited English proficient students become
    proficient as rapidly as possible so that they are provided a realistic
    opportunity to succeed academically. As I have said before, I believe that
    efforts to do this by strengthening the federal bilingual education
    program should be based on the following principles: (1) a goal for
    students to learn English within 3 years; (2) accountability for results;
    (3) local flexibility for determining how best to achieve results; and (4)
    investments in providing qualified teachers.   The President plans to send
    legislation to Congress fully consistent with these principles next year,
    when Congress takes up all federal elementary and secondary education
    programs as a part of the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary
    Education Act of 1965. Because H.R. 3892 is not consistent with these
    principles, I am strongly opposed to the bill.

    In addition, while I have a variety of concerns with the specific
    provisions of H.R. 3892, the most serious of which include the fOllowing:



Educational Issues

The bill is not administratively or programmatically sound.   The bill
would. require States to withdraw funding from local programs and
activities under the Act if students in those programs or activities are
not mastering English within two years and would also limit any studentD,s
participation in programs or activities under the Act to three years.
These provisions are vague and seemingly inconsistent, would set
artificial and arbitrary deadlines that would prevent classroom teachers
and local administrators from doing what is best for each child, are
contrary to research on the time needed for children with limited English
proficiency to achieve the mastery of English needed to be academically
successful, and could require the termination of funding under the Act for
many school districts.

Also, the bill would replace the current competitive bilingual education
program with a formula-based, State block grant.  This block grant
approach is problematic because funds would not be targeted, as is now the
case, on the school districts with the greatest need for funds and the
highest quality programs, reliable data for an equitable allocation
formula do not currently exist, and there are no provisions (such as
maintenance of effort or supplanting provisions) to prevent States and
school districts from simply reducing their financial support for these
students because of the availability of Federal funds.

The bill would also eliminate professional development programs from the
Act. By eliminating programs that focus on the preparation of teachers,
the bill could exacerbate the current shortage of qualified bilingual and
English-as-a-second language teachers nationwide.

Civil Rights Issues

H.R. 3892 appears to be based on the misconception that the DepartmentD,s
Office for Civil Rights (OCR) requires that school districts must use the
bilingual education technique as the only means to comply with title VI of
the Civil Rights Act of 1964's requirement that alternative language
services to teach English be provided to limited English proficient
students. Furthermore, while the bill suffers from inexact terminology,
and refers to "consent decrees", it apparently seeks to void all existing
compliance agreements between OCR,on the one hand, and States and school
districts, on the other, if those agreements require those States and
school districts D&to develop, implement, provide, or maintain any form of
bilingual education.D8 Similarly, the bill appears to require OCR to
publish in the Federal Register all D&enforcement guidelines and
compliance standardsD8 that relate to the provision of English language
instruction to students with limited English proficiency and to prohibit
OCR from entering into any new compliance agreements based on those
guidelines or standards until those guidelines and standards, themselves,
are approved by a subsequent statute.

Plainly, the purpose of these provisions is to stop OCRD,s enforcement of
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as it applies to the education
of language minority children, through the use of voluntary compliance
agreements. This is very troubling because the use of compliance
agreements is one of OeRD,s most important (and, by far, the most commonly
used) enforcement tools regarding the provision of appropriate educational
programs for such children.   Title VI, itself, requires OCR to attempt to
resolve all compliance problems under it, including those relating to the
education of language minority children, through voluntary means before


employing other, more adversarial, means, such as funding
terminations--preceded by administrative litigation--and referral to the
Department of Justice for court litigation.   Thus, these provisions of the
bill are fundamentally inconsistent with the statutory enforcement
philosophy of Title VI.  The bill would also significantly diminish OeRO,s
flexibility in resolving certain Title VI violations, and States and
school districts that voluntarily choose to meet their civil rights
obligations to students with limited English proficiency would also be
denied the ability to demonstrate their compliance through an agreement
with OCR. As a consequence, if H.R. 3892 were enacted, OCR enforcement of
Title VI as it applies to the education of language minority children
would necessarily have to rely far more on litigation than it currently
does, and States and school districts would necessarily endure far more
costly and time-consuming litigation, not only with the Department of
Education and the Department of Justice, but with private parties, because
States and school districts would no longer be able to rely on voluntary a
greements with OCR as evidence of their compliance with Title VI.

For these reasons, I urge you to postpone making changes in the Bilingual
Education Act until the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary
Education Act next year, when the Congress and the Administration can work
together on constructive improvements to this legislation based on
evaluations of the current program.

The Office of Management and Budget advises that there is no objection to
the submission of this report from the standpoint of the Administration's
program.

                                             Yours sincerely,


                                             Richard W. Riley
