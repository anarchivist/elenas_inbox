Subject:         DOJ Letter Citing Constitutional Issue

You will shortly receive, via fax or delivery to your mailbox, a DOJ
letter on S. 536. The letter describes an Establishment Clause issue
with S. 536. The Department would like to have the letter cleared ASAP
since an identical bill (HR 956) is scheduled for a vote tomorrow in the
House under suspension of the rules.   The Senate has indicated they will
act on the House-passed bill ASAP.
