TEXT:
I've been asked by Cal. School Boards Association if I want to come out at
the end of this week (at their expense if necessary) to speak to 200-300
school board members about the President's testing initiative. It could
be a good opportunity to build support in California, and to stimulate
local boards to sign up and/or to press the state to sign up. It's also a
long way and a lot of $ for what I expect will be about an hour-long
session.

I'm going to call them later today, to clarify the opportunity and their
expectations. Do either of you have a problem if I can work it into my
schedule -- because of travel budget limitations or other reasons?
