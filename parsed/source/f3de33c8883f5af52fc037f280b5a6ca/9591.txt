TEXT:
I spoke to Iowa AG Tom Miller and Az AG Grant Woods - two of the
"hard-liners" on the tobacco talks.  They report that the current terms
are not much different from those I described to you a few weeks ago -
although the counter-marketing money has been increased to $300 mil.   The
hard liners want some additional restrictions on marketing (such as
restrictions on "human forms" e.g. Marlboro Man) .

From here, the AG negotiating team is meeting with the other AGs in small
groups this week. The 8 "hard-liners" for example are meeting tomorrow
with Greggiore etc. Then the negotiating team will be meeting with AGs by
region later this week.  Their goal, of course, is to get unanimity on the
deal.
