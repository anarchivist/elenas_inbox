TEXT:
FYI--POTUS is in fact consistent on this issue; I checked the statement
that Riley put out after the '96 debate (after he said something t9 the
effect of " ... if people in Milwaukee or Cleveland want to have vouchers, I
say 'let 'er rip').

According to this statement that was carefully negotiated with his
Secretary of Education, the President:
1. opposes the use of federal funds for vouchers
2. believes the use of state or local funds for vouchers are state or
local decisions
3. as he said about the 1995 Cal. voucher. ballot initiative, the
President would personally oppose state or local voucher plans if he were
a voter in a state or locality.
