Options for Announcement for President's Visit to Tobacco Farmers in Kentucky

        The idea is to involve the states and the tobacco-growing communities in the process
surrounding the farmers' piece of tobacco legislation. The President could announce a working
group consisting of the agencies and representatives from the states to listen to farmers' concerns
about the legislation. Here are four ideas for how the working group could be set up:

1.       Special Unit in USDA Outreach Office. USDA already has an outreach office whose
purpose is to reach out to the various farmers' groups and communities. A special unit within
this office could be devoted solely to the tobacco legislation. However, USDA could not
formally create an advisory panel with state representatives selected by the various governors
because they have already reached their limit on advisory panels under the Federal Advisory
Committee Act (FACA). Nonetheless, if the governors set up meetings in their states, USDA
could attend those meetings. There are funding issues with this option.

2.       Partnership with the National Governors' Association (NGA). The President could
announce a working group comprised of the Secretaries of USDA, Labor, and Education. In
order to avoid the constraints ofFACA, the Secretaries, and not the advisory panel selected by
NGA, would report to the President. However, the President could direct the Secretaries to meet
with the NGA representatives in order to listen to their concerns. The advantages of this
approach are that we are not handpicking certain governors, thereby giving the impression that
certain states are receiving special treatment. In addition, NGA could probably set this working
group up fairly quickly, although we would need to check with them. This working group
would hold meetings around the country to talk with farmers about their concerns on the tobacco
legislation. The NGA also might be able to provide staff assistance and be able to produce a
summary report from all the meetings with the farmers.

3.      Working Group Directly between States and the Agencies. This option is similar to the
previous' option, except that it eliminates the middleman of the NGA. Under this option, the
Administration could deal directly with the governors who would select a representative to be
meet with the Secretaries of Labor, Education, and USDA. The President could announce a
series oftownhall meetings with farmers. These meetings would be attended by representatives
from the agencies and representatives selected by the governors.

4.     Executive Order or Memo to Create a Working Group. Under this option, an executive
order or memo would create the working group consisting of the various agencies (USDA,
Labor, and Education) who would be directed to meeting with the governors' representatives.
The disadvantage is that this is the most formalized method of creating this working group, and
there might be some legal considerations to this option. DOJ advises against creating this
working group through executive order; DOJ would prefer that this be done through a
Presidential memorandum. In the past, working groups created pursuant to executive orders
have often not been set up very quickly.
