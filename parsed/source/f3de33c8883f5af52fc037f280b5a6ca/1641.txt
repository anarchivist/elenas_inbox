Elena,

Just FYI, Bob Stone's conversation with Bruce resulted in Bob challenging
all of the agencies to collectively directly hire 11,000 welfare
recipients.  Bob apparently told the agency group that the Federal
government represents 1.5% of the workforce so should hire 1.5% of the
welfare recipients that must be in work by the year 2000. Therefore, all
of the agencies went back today and put numbers in their plans.  It looks
like we will now have public numbers (I'm not sure this is what Bruce
wanted from the conversation but it's what Bob did.)
