TEXT:
As we discussed Monday morning, I think it makes sense to combine a
100-hour rule announcement with the welfare two year anniversary.   We
could:

Release the report to Congress showing that two years into the new law,
more recipients are working and states are investing more per person in
welfare reform.

Announce that we're taking steps to ensure those leaving welfare for work
have health coverage, accumlate assets, and are better off than they were
on welfare by:

Announcing we are waiving old welfare regulations preventing some states
from providing Medicaid to two parent families (100 hour rule)
Endorsing efforts to help former welfare recipients save and build assets,
by endorsing the Coats-Harkin Individual Development Accounts proposal.
Announcing grants to states for follow up surveys on recipients leaving
the welfare rolls as part of our effort to monitor welfare reform (I'm
pushing to have these ready in time -- ASPE's reviewing the grant
proposals now, will grant 8 to 10)
