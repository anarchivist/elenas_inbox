TEXT:
I put copies of the materials from the meeting on your chair.  There was
no mention of the lawyers welfare-to-work or 0-3 event in April.

One thing to note:  Services for Pamela Harriman may be next week on the
13th-- the day we originally scheduled to unveil the National Drug Control
Strategy.   A possible scenario is that the radio address for Feb. 16th on
child safety seats could.be switched to a radio address on the drug
control strategy.  I've passed this info along to Dennis.
