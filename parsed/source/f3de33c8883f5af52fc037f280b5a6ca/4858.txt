Q: What Makes the Charter Schools Bill Such a Good Example of Bipartisan Cooperation?

A: The bill, which amends the ESEA Public Charter Schools Program, was initially sponsored by
Rep. Riggs, chairman of the Early Childhood, Youth and Families Subcommittee. Among other
provisions the bill incorporates the President's goal of increasing the number of charter schools
to 3,000 by the year 2000. Prior to committee action the bill was substantially improved in
response to concerns raised by the Department of Education, and Rep. Roemer joined Rep. Riggs
as a co-sponsor. The bill was approved last week by the House Education Committee on 24-8
bipartisan vote, including ten Democrats and fourteen Republicans. We think this is a great
example of the kind of progress we can make when Democrats and Republicans come together
across party lines to help our kids. Administration staff will continue to work with the sponsors
to strengthen the legislation.
                                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion
        Q: What About the Obey-Porter Comprehensive School Reform Provisions - Why Do they
        Represent a Good Example of Bipartisan Cooperation?

        A: These provisions represent strong leadership of Rep. Obey, ranking member ofthe House
        Appropriations Committee, working together with Rep. Porter, the subcomittee chairman. They
        feel strongly that schools across the country have been missing a great opportunity to benefit
        from research-proven approaches to reforming entire schools that have been developed in recent
        years. Many of these models have been developed with support from the New American
        Schools, a non-profit established under the Bush Administration but heavily supported by
        President Clinton, as well as from the generous gift by Mr. Annenberg. After a strong debate on
        the House floor, the provisions were amended to address the concerns of some convervative
        members and the provision was approved as a part of the House Education Appropriations bill.
        Again, members put aside partisan differences to support an initiative that will make a concrete
        difference in hundreds, and perhaps thousands of schools across the country.
