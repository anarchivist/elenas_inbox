TEXT:
Please review the draft SAP for S. 544, the Senate Supplemental
Appropriations bill.   The position is "senior advisors veto
recommendation."  It is possible that the Senate will take up the bill
Wednesday evening or Thursday morning.   We aim to release the SAP tomorrow
(Wed. 3/17) afternoon.   please provide comments/clearance by noon
tomorrow.  Thank you.

 S. 544 -- EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS ACT, FY 1999     (Sponsor:
 Stevens (R), Alaska)

        This Statement of Administration Policy provides the
AdministrationD,s views on S. 544, a bill making FY 1999 emergency
supplemental appropriations for recovery from natural disasters and for
foreign assistance, as reported by the Senate Appropriations Committee.
The bill as reported by the Committee provides $1.89 billion in urgently
needed funding to assist in Central AmericaD,s recovery from recent
natural disasters, to provide resources to promote stability in Jordan,
and to fund the emergency needs of farmers and ranchers in the United
States.

        The Administration appreciates the Senate CommitteeD,s prompt
action to ensure that urgently needed funding is provided quickly.
providing essential assistance to victims of natural disasters and helping
our farmers at home with vital financing clearly fall in the category of
needs that are urgent, unanticipated, and essential -- that is, emergency
requirements. Therefore, they clearly deserve to be funded quickly,
fully, and without requiring offsets that could force unacceptable
reductions in important programs.  In addition, it is essential that this
bill remain free of extraneous provisions that could slow its progress.
Unfortunately, the Committee bill includes a number of such provisions.

        Were the bill to be presented to the President with the Senate
CommitteeD,s proposed offsets and several objectionable riders discussed
below, the PresidentD,s senior advisers would recommend that he veto the
bill. We urge you not to take actions that could result in gridlock and
delay, and that would be detrimental both to our allies abroad and our
citizens at home in their time of need.

Emergency Relief for Central America



         The bill provides $977 million for central America, $21 million
 more than the presidentO,s request.  The PresidentO,s request for
 International Assistance Programs, the Department of Defense, and the
 Department of Justice would provide essential emergency disaster
 assistance in the wake of Hurricane Mitch, which inflicted severe damage
 on several Central American nations.  The package also provides aid to the
 Caribbean nations struck by Hurricane Georges, including Haiti and the
 Dominican Republic.  The Administration commends the Committee for its
 prompt action in approving the PresidentO,s request.

         Regrettably, the Majority Leadership of the Senate has decided
 that these funds must be offset. Hurricane Mitch, the worst natural
 disaster in the history of the Western hemisphere, left more than 9,000
 dead and drove millions from their homes.   Serious economic dislocation
 has resulted from the destruction of schools, hospitals, businesses,
 farms, and roads.   Together, Hurricanes Mitch and Georges have caused $10
 billion in damages.   The presidentO,s Central America package is urgent,
 unanticipated, and essential and should be funded as an emergency request.

         Funds must be provided swiftly to prevent the spread of disease
 and to buy seed and plant crops in the fast-approaching Spring planting
 season, thereby providing food and jobs to many communities, and to
 demonstrate to Central Americans that they can find jobs and security in
 their own recovering economies. Much of the rural road system farmers and
 small merchants depend on for their livelihoods was destroyed.  Water and
 sanitation systems have been disrupted, which can result in disease.
 Economic destruction and dislocation threaten to undermine the regionO,s
 achievements of the past decade, as these nations have made tremendous
 strides toward settling conflicts, strengthening democracy, promoting
 human rights, opening economies and alleviating poverty.  Emergency
 assistance for reconstruction aid will ensure that their transformation
 continues and will deter illegal migration by assuring that Central
 Americans have cause to view their own futures in the region with hope.

 Jordan

        The Administration appreciates the Committee!], s providing the full
$100 million for Jordan, fully funding the FY 1999 request.    These funds
will provide financial support to help promote stability in Jordan and the
region during the period of transition subsequent to King HusseinO,s
death. While the Administration appreciates the full funding of the FY
1999 request, we are disappointed that the $200 million requested in
advance appropriations for FYs 2000 and 2001 has not been provided.    In
the context of promoting peace in the Middle East, the Administration will
continue to press for these advance appropriations.

Department of Agriculture

         The Committee bill provides $308 million in emergency funds for
the Department of Agriculture (USDA), $156 million above the PresidentD,s
request.   The Administration appreciates the CommitteeO,s support for the
PresidentO,s request for emergency farm loans and administrative costs.
This additional loan authority would provide vitally needed financing for
the NationO,s farmers in light of the significant increase in demand for
USDA loans, due to projected continuing low commodity and livestock
prices. The Administration is reviewing the other farm-sector funds
included in the Committee bill.

Offsets



         The President has proposed that this package of essential
 emergency disaster assistance be funded consistent with the budget rules
 that apply to emergency spending. Regrettably, the Majority Leadership
 has decided that the funds for Central American disaster aid must be
 offset. The proposed offsets would result in unacceptable reductions in
 funding in areas of crucial importance to Americans, including: disaster
 relief funds in response to Hurricane Georges and other domestic
 disasters; funds for anti-terrorism to protect U.S. citizens at our
 embassies overseas; funds to fight the war on drugs; and, with less than
 300 days before December 31, 1999, funds to solve the Y2K problem.

         Some examples of the reductions that would result from the
 CommitteeO,s action include the following:

         C       $75 million from anti-terrorism programs to protect our citizens
 at our embassies and facilities abroad;

         C       $65 million in disaster relief, which would deprive FEMA, SBA,
 and other agencies of resources they need to continue their work in
 response to domestic disasters in Florida, Alabama, Mississippi,
 Louisiana, Georgia, North and South Carolina, North and South Dakota, West
 Virginia, Texas, California, Maryland, Virginia, Tennessee, Pennsylvania,
 Alaska and most other States ;

         C       $33 million in drug war programs of the Drug Enforcement Agency,
 the Coast Guard, the Customs Service, and other agencies;

         C       $113 million in Y2K funding for domestic Federal Government
 agencies, which could harm systems needing further computer conversion
 adjustments;

         C       $25 million in INS citizenship and immigration programs and $40
 million in enforcement and border affairs, which would have negative
 consequences on INSO, immigration benefit programs, ongoing
 investigations, and land border inspection operations;

        C       $16 million from the Department of Energy to execute crucial
nonproliferation activities with the Russian Federation and private
Western companies to reduce the availability of weapons-grade uranium;

         C       $43 million for International Organizations and peacekeeping
 that would increase U.N. arrears and would jeopardize the ability of the
 united States to respond to increased or new requirements for
 international peacekeeping operations;

         C       $100 million from revised inflation assumptions for domestic,
 non-defense programs, which could result in cuts in inflation-sensitive
 programs such as WIC and other essential programs;

        C       $60 million from the Global Environmental Facility and $10
million from the EPA climate change program that develops the technology
needed for a fuel efficient, less polluting vehicle;

        C       $350 million of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)
funds deferred until FY 2002, which could force States to reduce their own
investments in their critical programs and reduce services and benefits to
poor families who are trying to make the transition from welfare to work.

Objectionable riders



         Unfortunately, the Committee bill includes a number of strongly
 objectionable provisions, including the following:

          C      A provision that would completely relinquish the Federal
 taxpayersD, share of the Medicaid-related claims in the comprehensive
 State tobacco settlement without any commitment whatsoever by the States
 to use these funds to stop youth smoking.  Federal taxpayers paid a
 significant share -- the majority in most cases -- of Medicaid
 smoking-related expenditures. The Administration believes that the States
 should retain these funds and make a commitment that the Federal share of
 the settlementD,s proceeds will be spent on shared national and State
 priorities:  to reduce youth smoking, promote public health and
 childrenD,s programs, and assist affected rural communities.

         C       A provision that would extend the current moratorium on
 publishing a final Interior Department rule revising the method by which
 crude oil from Federal leases is valued for purposes of calculating
 Federal royalties. The existing FY 1999.rider imposed an eight-month
 moratorium (until June 1, 1999) and was the outcome of negotiations with
 the Congress at the end of the last session. This provision would cost
 the Treasury about $15 million in FY 1999.

         C        A provision that would extend the current moratorium on
 publishing a final Interior Department rule concerning surface management
 and reclamation requirements at hardrock mine sites on Federal lands. The
 existing FY 1999 rider imposed a moratorium on publishing the final rule
 until September 30, 1999, and requires a National Academy of Sciences
 (NAS) study by July 31, 1999, examining the need for the new rule. The
 provision in this bill would prohibit publishing the final rule until
 after a minimum 120-day comment period following the completion of the NAS
 study. Therefore, the earliest the rule could be published would be
 December 1999. The new rule is needed to update the existing 1980
 regulation to take into account changes in mining practices and technology
 since then.  Interior issued for comment and review a proposed hardrock
 mining rule in February 1999. This rule-making process should not be
 delayed further.

         C       A provision that would prevent the Secretary of the Interior
 from implementing a recent reorganization of Interior's Office of Special
 Trustee for American Indians (OST) for the remainder of FY 1999. The
 Secretary took the step of reorganizing this office to address
 deficiencies in day-to-day management of OSTD,s field
                 operations.  In order for the Administration's efforts to
 reform management of tribal and individual Indian trust funds to succeed,
 this reorganization needs to remain in effect.

 Other Issues


         C       On March 10, 1999,  the President transmitted a request for $15
 million in additional supplemental funding for the Department of the
 Interior to support the requirements of the Cobell v. Babbitt class-action
 lawsuit alleging mismanagement of individual Indian money accounts.  These
 additional funds would allow the Department to conduct critical
 activities, including court-ordered document production and statistical
 sampling needed this year in defense of the suit. This request is fully
 offset from other Interior appropriation accounts.

 C       The Administration objects to a provision that would transfer


 $100 million from the Department of AgricultureO,s Wildfire Management
 Operations -- primarily firefighting funding -- to its Knutson-Vandenberg
 Fund (K-V Fund), which funds reforestation and timber stand management and
 improvement on national forest lands.  A transfer of this magnitude is
 unnecessary and inappropriate.   Transferring the funds from the
 appropriated fire operations account would likely require that available
 Forest Service emergency contingency funds be used to fight fires in FY
 1999, even if FY 1999 is a normal fire year.  Should a significant fire
 season occur and the contingency funds be exhausted, the Forest Service
 would have to transfer funds back from the K-V Fund.

 C      The Administration would like to work with the Committee to respond
        to their concerns about the implementation of the Community
                Development Block Grant disaster relief program.
