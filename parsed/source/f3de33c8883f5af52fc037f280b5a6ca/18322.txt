TEXT:
    The first document are paragraphs for Andrew Mayock on DPC
establishing a working group to come up with a public agenda for the
President on farmer issues.  It also notes Bruce will do a tobacco farmers
meeting (including Ralph Paige) that Bruce says he'll do (and COS office
asked for).  It notes that Carl Whillock is still the Special Assistant
for ago issues and on-going issues still go through him.

The second document is a draft acknowledgement to Senator Robb in response
to his one page proposal on tobacco farmers.  I ran it by Charlie Rawls at
USDA.   We don't want to agree with Robb's proposal because it is still in
competition with Ford's so Charlie suggested saying we are looking for
consensus and leaving it at that.     ==================== ATTACHMENT   1 ==========

Working Group on Highlighting Issues in Farm Policy
       The DPC is establishing a working group to research and promote issues of interest to
farmers. The group will emphasize finding issues of importance to rural communities that
deserve to be a greater part of the President's public agenda. Tom Freedman ofDPC will
coordinate the working group, which will include representatives from USDA, NEC, CEA,
Treasury and OPL.

Meetings With Tobacco Farmers
       Bruce Reed will hold meetings with interested tobacco farm representatives, including
Ralph Paige, to explain Administration positions on tobacco and coordinate with the needs of
farmers. USDA is compiling a list of leading farmer representatives who should be included in
the meeting.

Carl Whillock continues to serve as the primary Administration contact at the DPC for on-going
agricultural issues.

Dear Senator Robb,

       Thank you very much for your thoughtful proposal regarding tobacco legislation and
support for the American farmer. I appreciate your efforts in this area and look forward to
working closely with you on this project.

         As you may know, I have consistently stated that the protection of tobacco farmers and
their communities is one of the five key elements essential to effective tobacco legislation.
Tobacco farmers are honest, hard-working people, many of whom work on small farms, some
in communities that rely primarily on income from the tobacco crop. The tobacco legislation
that ultimately becomes law must safeguard these farmers. Your proposal is one valuable
approach to protecting farmers, their families and their communities. I know that there are
several proposals currently under discussion in this area, and I am certain we will work together
to build a consensus.

        I believe we have a historic opportunity to create legislation that can help protect teens
from the dangers of smoking, and secure a promising future for farmers and their communities.

I look forward to working with you in this effort.
