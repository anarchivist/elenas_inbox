TEXT:
As you may remember Bruce, the President mispoke on Thursday and said that
welfare caseloads declined as much in the last four years and they
increased in the previous 25 -- when he was supposed to say first 25
years.

Is there a way to correct this in his written statement after the fact?

Could I get a copy of your data source in case I get questions?
