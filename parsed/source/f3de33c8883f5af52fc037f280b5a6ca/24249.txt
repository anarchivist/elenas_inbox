     TEXT:
     On Tuesday, March 31 - from 9:15-11:15 a cast of several will offer a
     briefing to all comers on Climate Change in the Indian Treaty Room.

     As you know - this is an issue of interest to the President and Vice
     President and we are offering some of the finest briefers we have in house
     to inform you (and yours - all interested permanent staff are invited)
     about the science of climate change, the history of the issue, our
     economic analysis, domestic and diplomatic actions following Kyoto and
     information about the White House's role.

     Come hear Todd Stern, Katie McGinty, Dirk Forrister, Rosina Bierbaum and
     more.  You'll be glad you did.

     please note - the invitation can be extended to others in your shop.
     Cabinet agency Chiefs of Staff and those who cover the issue in their
     agency are also invited (through Cabinet Affairs) .

     people not in the complex who need clearance can call the White House
     Climate Change Task Force to give their information (ask for Mary or Lisa
     343-1060) .

     If you have questions - call Kris Balderston (or me) .
