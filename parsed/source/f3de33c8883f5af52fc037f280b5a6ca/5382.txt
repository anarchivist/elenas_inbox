DRAFT: to be incorporated into NECIDPC memo to the President on
new policy initiatives (still needs Sperling review)

[ADD TO EDUCATION SECTION]

6th Grade Mentoring Initiative. The NEC has undertaken a lengthy policy process, and
recently held a principals meeting, on an initiative to reach out to low-income children by the
seventh grade in order to (1) make them aware of financial aid for college, and (2) provide
intensive and sustained mentoring and academic support through high school graduation. At the
principals meeting, there was general support for the concept of pursuing these goals through
strong partnerships between colleges and high-poverty schools.

Hispanic Education Action Plan. At the PresidenCs request, the NEC has developed an action
plan to improve educational opportunities for Hispanic Americans (or limited-English proficient
students generally). The current draft plan, based on input from the Hispanic Caucus and
constituency groups, includes a number of administrative actions that agencies will take, as well
as possible targeted investments (roughly $100 million). The plan would be released along with
a report from a panel of researchers that were named by Secretary Riley last year to look into the
Hispanic dropout problem.

School Construction. NEC is working with Education, Treasury, DPC, and OMB to develop
several design options. The basic issues are the size and duration of the proposal and whether .
we should stick with a spending approach or move to a tax-side options.

One-Year Campaign on Higher Education Access. NEC is working with Education,
Treasury, DPC, and OMB to develop a one-year campaign to inform every family in America·
about the new higher education tax and grant incentives. The goal of this campaign would be to
heighten public awareness of new tax and grant incentives to pursue higher education, to drive
home the message that higher education is now truly accessible to everyone who wants to pursue
it, to reiterate that higher education is the key to higher earnings over a lifetime, and to have
middle school students, parents, and faculty thinking about college opportunities early.

[ADD TO CHILD CARE SECTION]

Expanding Family Leave. The NEC and DPC are working with several agencies to develop
paid family leave options as well as other possible expansions of the Family and Medical Leave
Act. A paid proposal would provide financial support to help parents stay home with their
newborn babies and get them off to a good start. The initiative is designed to strengthen our 0-3
agenda and complement our child care initiative. As initially conceived, paid family leave
would be administered through the UI system, which is well-positioned to accept applications
and send out checks. However, at this point, detailed costs are not yet known. In expanding the
FMLA, we are also considering options to lower the threshold, increase the duration or make
better use of the UI system.
                                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion

    Early Childhood Education. To build on last year's education successes (Head Start, HOPE,
    and Pell Grants) and the early learning and child care conferences, the NEC has developed a
    proposal to expand early leaming opportunities. The proposal would include expanding early
    Head Start and creating a new 0-5 Early Education Fund to invest in Success Challenge Grants.
    Both working and stay-at-home parents would benefit and activities would include child
    development courses for parents and improving education aspects of center-based child care.


    CLIMATE CHANGE

    The President has committed to a $5 billion package over five years for tax incentives and R&D
    to promote low-carbon technologies. The Treasury Department is already working on a possible
    package oftax incentives to be included in the FY 1999 budget, and DOE has a proposal on the
    expenditure side. We are working with DOE, Treasury, OMB, EPA, CEA and others to develop
    several final options.


    EDUCATION AND TECHNOLOGY

    Teacher Training for Technology. The overwhelming conclusion of press and expert analysis
    of the President's Educational Technology Initiative is that teacher training is critical to the
    successful use of educational technology, and that more needs to be done in this area. We are
    currently weighing several options, including (1) making sure that all new teachers are ready to
    te.ach using technology in four years; and (2) training at least one teacher in every elementary and
    secondary school who could then, in turn, train other teachers.

    Option 1 might include a $100 million expansion of innovation grants targeted to professional
    development, schools of education, and curriculum integration. Option 2 could be achieved by
    increasing the Technology Literacy Challenge Fund, and directing states to invest at least 1/4 of
    their TLCF allocation ($120 million) to teacher training.

     "Learning on Demand." The Clinton Administration has an ambitious national strategy for
     integrating technology in to the K -12 classroom, with computers, educational software,
     technology training for teachers, and connectivity to the classroom. We have no similar strategy
     for promoting the use of technology (the Intemet, intranets, CD-ROM, satellite, interactive TV,
     etc.) for life-long learning. As a component of a broader Administration "learning on demand"
)    initiative, we are working on a proposal which includes a $75 million challenge grant program
     that would create new partnerships to deliver "anytime, anywhere" access to affordable,
     high-quality learning opportunities. The program would be administered by the Department of
    .Education.

    The potential advantages associated with the use of technology for life-long learning (both higher
    education and training) include reduced costs, expanded access, and increased quality.

                                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion



OveraU R&D Funding. One option we are considering is that, if we are unable to protect the
entire R&D budget, we should be certain to protect university-based R&D. University-based
R&D has a high return on investment for several reasons: it is focused on the long-term R&D
that industry will not do; tech transfer occurs through people (graduates leave and start new
companies); and results are widely diffused because they are published.

One idea we are considering is to create a "wedge" in the year 2000 R&D budget and
encourage agencies to spend calendar 1998 developing proposals for it. There are all sorts of
exciting new areas where additional R&D could be done, such as functional genomics (using the
results of the Human Genome Project to solve specific diseases). However, agencies are
reluctant to propose new ideas in the current budget environment because they perceive the
budget to be a "zero-sum" game. A pot of money for FY2000 would create incentives for
agencies to be bold and imaginative.


HOUSING INITIATIVE

April 10, 1998 is the 30th anniversary of the Fair Housing Act. This might be an excellent
opportunity for you to announce a new "Housing Freedom Initiative," which could include both
housing portability/choice as well as fair housing/fair lending components -- two policy options
that we are currently assessing. These would have little or no budgetary impact. A potentially
more expensive option that we are working on is an initiative to help low- and moderate-income
families pay the downpayment for a new home.

Housing Portability/Choice. Among other elements, this package could include: providing
$20 million in the FY 1999 budget to increase the number of Regional Opportunity Counseling
(ROC) sites; encouraging the use of exception rents (i.e., up to 120 percent of the "fair market
rent") as a tool for opening up more expensive suburban housing markets; and eliminating
obstacles to portability of Section 8 vouchers.

Fair Lending/Fair Housing Proposal. This proposal could include: an examination of the
impact of credit scoring and risk-based pricing on the availability of credit/capital to    .
lower-income and minority individuals; issuance of guidance by banking regulators on certain
key credit scoring issues and, possibly, on risk-based pricing; a Presidential call to the FDIC and
the Federal Reserve to obtain more data on reasons for home mortgage loan denials (OCC and
OTS already collect such information); collection of race and income data as part of the Equal
Credit Opportunity Act/CRA small business and small farm lending reporting requirement; and
more.

Downpayment Reduction Initiative. NEC is working with HUD, Treasury, and OMB to
develop a proposal to increase homeownership, by reducing the barriers to buying a new home.


                                                 3
                                                                             Hex-Dump Conversion


Many low- and moderate-income families find a downpayment the largest hurdle to buying a new
home; this initiative would work to lower this cost and help more families become homeowners.
In 1992, Congress authorized the National Homeownership Trust, but never appropriated any
money. We are investigating whether we should request money for this program or whether it is
better policy to expand the existing HOME program (which serves a similar purpose).



LABOR/WORKFORCE INITIATIVES

$100 Million To Support IPEC. The President could adopt a comprehensive Child Labor
Action Plan comprised of budget items, policies and exhortatory actions. The intitiative would
address the problem domestically and internationally, and would be anchored by a $100 million
committment to the International Program on the Elimination of Child Labor (lPEC). IPEC is a
voluntary program of the International Labour Organization which is dedicated to the progressive
elimination of child labor. The funds, which would be managed by the Department of Labor,
would be used for programs targeting the most intolerable forms of child labor and would be
spent in accordance with criteria we would develop. Another action item with budget
implications, albeit very small, would be a stepped up Customs program to enforce u.s. law
banning the import of goods made with forced or bonded child labor. On the domestic front, the
biggest budget item would be increased suppport for the Migrant Education Program to support
elementary and secondary education to the hardest-to-serve migrant children. Other elements of
the action plan would be purely voluntary, for example, the President would call on prominent
organizations, such as the Boy Scouts and Girls Scouts to adopt a "No Sweat" code of conduct
for procurement of uniforms and develop an accompanying label.

Pension Initiative. The NEC's pension working group --which includes Treasury, Labor,
PBGC, OMB, and others -- has spent several months developing an expanded pension coverage
initiative which focuses on a simplified defined benefit plan for small businesses, based on the
SAFE plan proposed by the American Society of Pension Actuaries (ASPA). We are also
looking at a payroll deduction IRA proposal, a three-year vesting requirement for employer
matching contributions in 401(k) plans, a women's pension initiative, and a pension
right-to-know proposal.

Community Adjustment. As part of the Fast Track debate, we proposed the creation of the
Office of Community and Economic Adjustment (OCEA). As you know, this office will be
modeled after the Defense Department's Office of Economic Adjustment (OEA) -the
Administration's first point of contact with communities experiencing a military base
closure or defense plant closing. The OCEA would coordinate the Administration's
response to regions impacted by a major plant closing or trade, by working with Labor,
Commerce, SBA, HUD, Treasury, and other government entities. This group would
provide planning grants and expertise to help communities develop comprehensive
economic adjustment strategies. Since this program will be part of the Economic

Development Administration (EDA), we are investigating whether we could initiate this
proposal by executive memorandum, while awaiting Congressional appropriations_

MEDICARE

[Need to add from Jennings and Lambrew]


AUTO INSURANCE

Many states have some sort of "no-fault" auto insurance, which is aimed at reducing costly legal
battles -- costs which are often passed through into premiums. This April, a bipartisan group in
the U.S. Senate introduced a bill to create a national system of auto insurance -- called "Auto
Choice" -- with two tracks: no-fault coverage for economic damages only, or coverage with full
tort law rights. Congress' Joint Economic Committee estimates suggest the bill would save
consumers $45 billion per year -- $243 per driver. The NEC and DPC are currently examining
the potential costs and benefits of supporting this policy, and are working to refine other policy
options that help lower auto insurance premiums.
