TEXT:
Testimony:

        "We want to work with you and the States to include an additional
change in this package to ensure that each state's overall work effort
meets the statutue's work participation requirements. Specifically, we
want to make it clear that the calculation of whether a state has met the
applicable participation rate shall take into account the state's success
in placing in work activities participants both in TANF and in state
maintenance of effort programs.  This clarification will protect the
welfare law's tough work requirements."

January 31st Guidance:

        "We intend to work with Congress and the Governors in a bipartisan
fashion to ensure that each State's overall work effort meets the
statute's work participation requirements.  Specifically, we will seek
language making clear that calculation of whether a State has met the
applicable participation rate shall take into account the State's success
in placing participants in both TANF and MOE programs in work
activities."
