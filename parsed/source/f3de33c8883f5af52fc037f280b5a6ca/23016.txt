TEXT:
I understand from Tanya that Gordon Ambach, Exec. Dir. of the Council of
Chief State School Officers, will be at your 9:30am class size meeting
tomorrow morning.  I wanted to give you a heads-up about a scheduling
issue that he may raise with you at some point tomorrow morning.  CCSSO is
having their Legislative Conference in DC March 14-16, and have requested
that Riley address the conference AND that they have a meeting with POTUS
and VPOTUS at the White House. Riley has agreed to speak at their conferen
ceo

However, our requests to both the President's and Vice President's
scheduling offices have been regretted.  CCSSO is lobbying hard for a
meeting, and Education supports the request.  The group was scheduled to
meet with POTUS in 1997, but VPOTUS filled in when the President hurt his
knee. They also tried to get a meeting last year, but it was not
scheduled.  Although they have not requested a meeting with the First
Lady, Patti Solis-Doyle has told me that the First Lady could "drop-by"
someone else's meeting with them.

It doesn't seem that we have any positive answer for Ambach if he does
raise this, but I wanted you to at least be aware of the situation.  Let
me know if you have any questions. Thanks.
