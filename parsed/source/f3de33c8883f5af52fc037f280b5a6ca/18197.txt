TEXT:
Gen. Powell will press the President and the other principals to
participate in something called "Groundhog Job Shadow Day" on February 2.
This is a partnership between our very own School to Work Office,
America's Promise, Junior Achievement, and others.   The idea is to get as
many people as possible across the country to agree to have a youth shadow
them at work that day, to learn about the world of work.   Powell is doing
it; he talked Tom Brokaw into doing it; some federal agencies have climbed
on board to some extent (Transportation, Justice, and Education to date) .
I don't know how big it will be and I'm checking with Jen Palmieri to see
if it's out of the question schedule-wise.   (I think the budget is
released that day .... ) It's a cute idea, maybe too cute, but it might
catch on. Ray Chambers asked me today if the President will participate,
so I think they will press hard on it.   Any reaction one way or the other?
