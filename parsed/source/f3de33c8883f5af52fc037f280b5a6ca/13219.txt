TEXT:
I'd like to add a couple of things to Elena's memo (as well as
thanking her for picking up a rapidly moving ball on a frantic
afternoon!) :
1. On the policy front, I think that Kevin's second point raises
an issue that's worth having people think about to determine if
we're satisfied with our approach. This relates to his suggestion
for language suspending sales upon passage of the legislation
until they come into compliance with env. laws.
        Kevin envisions a tremendous rush to harvest if legislation
passages. While his particular suggestion for how to treat this
period does goes beyond what we have drafted, it raises - at least
in my mind - the question of how all of you would want to treat
the sales (particularly the non-318 sales) immediately after
passage. Would you anticipate immediate termination or suspension
of the contracts? If so, is the $50 mill. adequate to cover costs
of those actions? Recall, too, that Hogan has at least 3 more
opinions to issue - all of which are hihgly likely to result in
orders to release yet more sales. Depending upon timing, appeals,
etc., the numbers could top 1 bill. board feet.

2. Kevin called in at the end of the day with one other
additional technical concern, regarding whether the sentence in
2001(1) (k) dealing with the return of the high bid bond could
somehow trump some of our new language.   I'll talk to DOJ about that.
