TEXT:
Thanks.  I'll talk to him.   I've talked to him once or twice before. He
occasionally writes for The American Prospect, so he's another big-spender
we've revived from the dead.

We did a little prep for the President's interviews with Brownstein and
with TIME.   In the pre-brief, he gave a marvelous defense of the child
care initiative and why it wasn't big govt.   Begala has a good line we
should use:   the child care initiative doesn't add a dime to the deficit
or a bureaucrat to the payroll.
