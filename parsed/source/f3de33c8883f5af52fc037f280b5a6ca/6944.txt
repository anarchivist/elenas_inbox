Subject: SENATE PANEL OKS BILL RAISING VISA NUMBER FOR SKILLED

Date: 04/02/98 Time: 17:58
SSenate panel OKs bill raising visa number for skilled foreigners

    WASHINGTON (AP)   A Silicon Valley-backed measure that would
significantly boost the number of visas available for high-skilled
foreign workers is moving swiftly through the Senate.
    On a 12-6 vote Thursday, the Senate Judiciary Committee approved
legislation introduced just weeks ago in response to computer and
technology industry complaints that the current visa quota will be
hit as early as May, four months before the end of the fiscal year.
    The bill, sponsored by Sen. Spencer Abraham, R-Mich., chqirman
of Judiciary's immigration subcommittee, would raise the visa
ceiling from the current 65,000 annual limit to a maximum 115,000
for each of the next five years.
    Last year, for the first time, the demand for "H-1B" visas
which entitle high-skilled workers to remain in the United States
for up to six years   outpaced availability. Computer companies
contend the shortage of available talent will dampen their
industry's explosive growth.
    Abraham warned that some companies may relocate overseas if they
can't find the necessary talent in this country.
    Seeking to address Democratic complaints, Abraham abandoned his
earlier push for a permanent increase in the visa category and
added some teeth to language designed to ensure that U.S. workers
aren't replaced by foreign workers willing to work for lower wages.
    But Sen. Ted Kennedy, D-Mass., said Abraham's bill falls short
of addressing the shortage of domestic computer programmers,
engineers and other information technology specialists. A rival
bill he and Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., wrote would dedicate
$100 million for worker training and education-programs by
instituting a $250 visa application fee. Abraham's bill authorizes
.
.,.   .'"
       a $50 million scholarship fund, but Congress would have to
       appropriate the money.
           --These are good jobs with good wages, good benefits and good
       opportunities, and they ought to be American, " said Kennedy, the
       top Democrat on the immigration subcommittee. --I just feel that
       our program is more effective."
           The Kennedy-Feinstein proposal, which would raise the visa
       ceiling for only three years, failed on a party-line vote, 8-10.
       Feinstein and Democratic Sen. Herb Kohl of Wisconsin then voted
       with their GOP colleagues in favor of the Abraham bill, which is
       opposed by organized labor.
           Earlier, however, Feinstein called the legislation --a massive
       indictment of our educational system."
           While agreeing that U.S. schools must be improved to turn out
       more high-tech talent, Abraham said: --In the short term, part of
       the solution obviously has to be immigration."
