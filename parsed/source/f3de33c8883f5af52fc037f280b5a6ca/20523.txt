     Q:     What is the Administration's response to the patients' bill of rights proposal
            unveiled by the House Republicans yesterday?

     A:     President Clinton has repeatedly called on this Congress to pass a patients' bill of rights --
            so crucial medical decisions are made by doctors, not accountants. We welcome the fact
            that the House Republicans have finally entered this debate by announcing their intention
            to introduce long-overdue legislation on this issue. Their announcement explicitly
            affirms the President's longstanding position that Federal legislation is needed.

            However, the Republican proposal clearly does not provide all the protections that
            Americans need and deserve. For example, it does not guarantee patients access to th~
            specialists they need, such as heart specialists or oncologists. It does not ensure
            continuity of care -- so that vulnerable patients do not have their care changed abruptly if
            their provider is dropped from a health plan. It does not include strong remedies for
            people who are seriously injured or who die because a health care plan wrongly denied
            them care.

            In addition, the Republican proposal includes poison pill provisions, such as multiple
            employer welfare arrangements (MEW As) and arbitrary caps on medical malpractice
            awards that supersede state laws. These provisions are apparently designed to stall the
            progress on a patients' bill of rights.

            Without important protections and with added poison pills, the Republicans' patients' bill
            of rights is nothing more than a bill of goods. However, we remain committed to
            working together to pass a strong, bipartisan bill before this Congress adjourns.


     Background: Important patient protections that are not included in the Republicans' patients'
     bill of rights and poison pill provisions, include:

            Access to specialists. Again and again we have heard about cancer patients who
            are denied access to an oncologist or patients who have died prematurely because
            they never saw a heart specialist until it was too late. Assuring access to needed
            specialists is absolutely essential to providing millions of Americans essential care
            and much-needed peace of mind.

            Continuity of care protections. This assures some of the most vulnerable patients --
            such as pregnant women or the chronically ill -- that their care will not change
            abruptly if their provider is unexpectedly dropped from a health plan.

            A strong, workable enforcement provision that is essential to ensure that these
            protections are real. A right is simply not aright without a remedy.

            Poison pill provisions, including malpractice caps and multiple employer welfare
            associations, that appear to be designed to stall this important legislation.
