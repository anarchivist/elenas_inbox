TEXT:
Elena,

Peter talked to Alan (Leg. INS), but has not yet gotten in touch with
Karen (Leg. DOJ). According to Peter, Alan is persuaded of Peter's
assessment of the legislative chances of a bill to provide some kind of
relief for Guantanamo + Haitians.

Scott and I then spoke with John Morton (DAG) and let him know of Peter's
legislative assessment, and that our judgment was that prosecutorial
discretion was the appropriate strategy for us to pursue at this time. We
also told him of Peter's judgment that we could possibly move this on the
must-pass Bosnia legislation in the Spring, and the statement by Smith's
staffer that this leg. could be a possible off-set (indication of at least
some willingness to deal) .  Morton said that he sent an options memo to
the AG recommending DED, but that he would share this new information with
her. He also indicated that if the WH wants to pursue prosecutorial
discretion, they would likely go along. We will know their definitive
view on Monday.

Julie
