          Subject:         DOJ letter on juvenile crime bill for clearance ASAP

          The attached letter raises Constitutional questions about a provision of
          HR 2037 which is expected to be offered as an amendment to the juvenile
          crime bill that is on the floor today.

          Justice has asked for comments by 1:00 PM.    If I receive a read receipt
          and do not hear otherwise, I will assume you have no objection to the
          proposed letter.

                                                     Washington. D.C. 20530




The Honorable Henry J. Hyde
Chainnan
Committee on the Judiciary
U.S. House of Representatives
Washington, D.C. 20515

Dear Mr. Chainnan:

        We are writing to provide an important comment concerning Title I of H.R. 2037, the
Child Safety and Youth Violence Prevention Act of 1999. Although we have other
observations concerning these juvenile justice provisions, the comments in this letter are
confined to certain constitutional concerns relating to this bill.

         Section 101 of the bill would amend 18 U.s.c. § 5032 to establish, in § 5032(a)(2),
expanded authority for juveniles to be "proceeded against as a juvenile in a court of the United
States" in many circumstances, including where the Attorney General certifies to the court that
"there is a substantial Federal interest in the case or the offense to warrant the exercise of
Federal jurisdiction" (proposed § 5032(a)(2)(B)(ii)). Section 106 of the bill in turn WOUld,
inter alia, amend 18 U.S.C. § 5037(c) to provide that:

                  [t]he term for which official detention may be ordered for a juvenile found to
be a                             juvenile delinquent [under § 5032] may not extend beyond the
lesser of-

                  (1) the maximum term of imprisonment that would be authorized if the juvenile
had                          been tried and convicted as an adult;

                  (2) ten years; or

                  (3) the date when the juvenile becomes twenty-six years old.

        While these proposed provisions may not, standing alone, raise constitutional
concerns, their inclusion in the bill might make it more likely that other important aspects of
the juvenile justice system - such as the fact that juvenile delinquency is subject to nonjury
                                             Hex-Dump Conversion

adjudication - would be held unconstitutional. In McKeiver v. Pennsylvania, 403 U.S. 528
(1971), the Supreme Court indicated that the more closely the consequences of an adjudication
of delinquency resemble the consequences of a criminal conviction, the more likely it is that
the Constitution would require certain procedural protections in that adjudication, such as a
jury trial. In McKeiver itself, the Court held that a juvenile was not entitled to a jury trial
under the State's juvenile justice system. The McKeiver plurality made clear, however, that it
would have reached a different result had it been convinced that the juvenile system ultimately
did not differ in purpose and effect from the adult criminal system, explaining that those who
equated the juvenile and adult systems had chosen "to ignore, it seems to us, every aspect of
fairness, of concern, of sympathy, and of paternal attention that the juvenile courts system
contemplates." Id. at 545.

          The state system at issue in McKeiver did not permit adjudicated delinquents to be
incarcerated with adult convicts. That would not, however, necessarily be true of adjudicated
delinquents in the federal system with respect to terms of detention between their twenty-first
and twenty-sixth birthdays. 18 U.S.c. § 5039 provides that "[n]o juvenile committed,
whether pursuant to an adjudication of delinquency or conviction for an offense, to the custody
of the Attorney General may be placed or retained in an adult jail or correctional institution in
which he has regular contact with adults incarcerated because they have been convicted of a
crime or are awaiting trial on criminal charges," and further provides that "[ w]henever
possible, the Attorney General shall commit a juvenile to a foster home or community-based
facility located in or near his home community. " These directives only apply, however, to a
person while he remains a "juvenile," which is defined in 18 U.S.c. § 5031 (for the purpose
of proceedings and disposition for an alleged act of juvenile delinquency) as a person who has
not attained his twenty-first birthday. Title I of H .R. 2037 would provide that persons who,
having been adjudged delinquent as a juvenile in a nonjury proceeding, could be detained
beyond their twenty-first birthday; and § 5039 apparently would not prohibit the transfer of
such a person, after his twenty-first birthday, to "an adult jailor correctional institution in
which he has regular contact with adults incarcerated because they have been convicted of a
crime or are awaiting trial on criminal charges."

         There is a split in authority regarding whether juveniles may be adjudicated delinquent
without a right to a jury trial if such adjudication may result in their being incarcerated with,
and on the same terms as, adults. Shortly after McKeiver was decided, the United States
Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held that committing a fifteen-year-old delinquent to
an adult facility on the basis of a family court adjudication rather than a jury trial did not
violate the juvenile's right to due process. United States ex reI. Murray v. Owens, 465 F.2d
289 (2d Cir. 1972). However, more recently, as the States have begun reviSing their own
juvenile justice systems to allow delinquents to be held longer and in adult facilities, some state
courts have questioned whether the revised statutes are consistent with McKeiver and whether
it remains permissible to deny jury trials to juveniles who potentially face incarceration with
adults. Just last year, the highest courts of Wisconsin and Louisiana held that non-jury
adjudications under revised state laws that resulted in delinquents being subject to incarceration

                                                 2

             with adults amounted to criminal prosecutions, and therefore violated the juveniles'
             constitutional right to a jury trial. See In re Hezzie R., 580 N.W.2d 660,673-74 (Wis. 1998),
             cert. denied, 119 S. Ct. 1051 (1999); In re C.B., 708So.2d 391, 397-400 (La. 1998) (ruling
             as a matter of state law, but "adopt[ing]" the Supreme Court's analysis in McKeiver); st:±...
             also Matter ofO.H., 504 S.W.2d 269,271-73 (Mo. App. 1973) (surveying cases; expressing
             constitutional concern with the holding in Murray; and granting relief to a juvenile on statutory
             grounds); Monroe v. Soliz, 939 P.2d 205, 208-09 (Wash. 1997) Uuvenile had no right to jury
             trial where statute required juveniles transferred to adult facility to be segregated from adult
             convicts and "[t]he nature of incarceration remain[ed] juvenile regardless of the custody
             venue"). Indeed, the Wisconsin court held in Hezzie R. that, even if (as in the Federal
             system) there was no certainty that an adjudicated delinquent might eventually be transferred to
             an adult facility, the mere risk of such eventual treatment sufficiently transformed the
             delinquency adjudication into a criminal prosecution, so as to require a trial by jury.

                      Thus, Title I raises serious constitutional concerns to the extent that it would, in
             conjunction with existing law, permit a person to be adjudicated delinquent in a nonjury
             proceeding, while there is some chance that such person would, after the age of twenty-one, be
             incarcerated on the same terms as adult convicts in an adult prison. In order to avoid this
             constitutional problem, the bill could, for instance, amend § 5039 to provide that the
             protections prescribed in that section shall apply to any person committed to the custody of the
             Attorney General pursuant to an adjudication of delinquency, during the entire term of such.
             person's detention (including any part of such detention that extends beyond the person's
             twenty-first birthday).

                     We thank you for the opportunity to express our concerns about this important issue.
             We stand ready to work with you on this and the other important issues the House will be
             considering this week. The Office of Management and Budget has advised that there is no
             objection from the standpoint of the Administration's program to the presentation of this report.
Sincerely,
