TEXT:
Just want- to let you know that everyone should be warned that the TIMSS
roundtable is going to have 28 people participating. That is b/c we had
invited 22 people (including POTUS) to the Cabinet Room and now that it
was moved to Maryland we had to add: Governor Glendening (doesn't take an
extra spot), State Superintendent of Education Nancy Grasmick, Teacher
from the school, Student from the school, 1 Congressman, 2 Senators. By
adding 6 people we've lost our diversity and made the whole thing
unbearably long.   I just want to make sure everyone understands the reason
for this.
