TEXT:
Bruce, you sent us a note saying that they looked iffy as an announcement
for us, and I agree.  Melissa would like to go ahead and have the
Secretary put out the grants.  She would also like to get the Secretary
and Olivia Golden in a room with reporters who are likely to write
anniversary stories on August 22nd (DeParle, Havemann) and walk them
through the report to Congress and maybe release the CASA grants at the
same time.  I think such a background briefing on the report could be
helpful. What do you think?

We'obviously may want to do new caseload numbers as an Aug. 22nd radio
address -- if we don't do that, we could do a leak.  I assume we would not
want the Shalala to release them to DeParle and Havemann?
