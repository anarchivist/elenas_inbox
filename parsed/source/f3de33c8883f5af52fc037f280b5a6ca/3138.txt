         TEXT:
         I guess that you're being asked for comments on the Family First document
         as to what's objectionable and what's not.   I would put the proposals
         into categories: objectionable; wrong tone; good; maybe good but unvetted;
         probably bad but unvetted. Also, at the end,  I put a list of themes that
         deserve more attention.

         Sorry this grew so much, tell me if you want a full memo.

         Here's my take as to how the various proposals break out:

         1. Objectionable ideas.   There are some ideas that we likely have vetted
         and decided against doing, mostly in the area of regulating employers:
         penalties for companies where executive compensation exceeds 50 times the
         average employee salary; requiring companies that use "mass downsizing" to
         pay 6 months severance or training before they pay divide~ds or bonuses.


         2. Wrong tone on taxes.   There are some ideas where the tone of the
         attack has a heavy emphasis on "distribution tests" on the tax bill,
         including: requiring the bulk of the tax bill go to taxpayers making less
         than $80,000; releasing a treasury distributional analysis; requesting a
         CBO distributional analysis of Roth-Archer; disputing JTC methodology
         about tax bill winners and losers. The document lacks an emphasis on the
         benefits of a tax cut, and doesn't stress the positive effects of the
         Clinton Clinton tax cuts for education etc. Simply put, our tax cuts are
         more popular than theirs, that is the debate we should have.


         3.   Good Ideas.  The agenda is strong on some proposals the
         Administration is! or will likely support (although not necessarily in the
         form mentioned in the proposal) including:  encouraging on-site child
         care, expanding unpaid leave for school or medical appointments; de
         veloping technology to block non-child safe internet sites; more school
         construction funds; expanding school nutrition programs; expand licensing
         standards for child care; child safety locks on guns; keeping schools open
         later; incentives for states that lower legal blood alcohol levels.


         3B.   Possibly Good ideas that haven't been vetted fully (that I know of).
           Uninsured kids get coverage by cig tax;   head start paid for by tax on
         tv kid ads;     prescription drug coverage for Medicare beneficiaries;
         anti-sweatshop bills! ban child labor products IRA payroll deduction for
         employers who don't give pension benefits; consumer protection for
         financial services; pension proections.

       4.  Ideas I don't know have been vetted, but probably wouldn't make it.
       Moratorium on cable tv rate increases;  "force deadbeat oil companies to
       pay $440 million they owe government"; increase burden sharing of defense
       costs; limit fees on credit cards; internet protection for consumers.

        FYI. There are 57 or so ideas in here, many cryptically described
        "aviation safety issues"; "corporate tax loopholes $69 billion").


        5.     Could Add Themes.   The proposal is deficient in the following themes:

        *     Measures to improve education, emphasizing quality/standards

        *     Measures to control crime further

        *     Campaign reform

        *     Fiscal discipline

        * Opening up markets

        *     Making government work

        *    America    as a leader for peace

        *     Environmental (clean air)

        * Welfare to work

        * Preserve Medicare

        * Restore benefits to legal immigrants

        *    Tobacco

        * Empowerment zones

        *     Science and technology investments (diseases)

        *     Health (HMO regs)
