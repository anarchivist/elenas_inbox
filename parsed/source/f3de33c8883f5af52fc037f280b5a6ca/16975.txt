TEXT:
Shaw and some other House Republicans are having a press conference today
to say that SSA is doing a good job on the children's SSI
redeterminations. Apparently there is a new GAO report saying this.   SSA
will keep saying what it has been saying, which is that they are committed
to doing this well, they are aware of problems in some areas, and that the
nominee for Commissioner has committed to a top-to-bottom review of the
process after he takes office -- i.e., they won't simply bask in Shaw's
praise of them.
