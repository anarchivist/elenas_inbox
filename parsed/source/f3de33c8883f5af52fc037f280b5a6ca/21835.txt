Commission Won't Seek Toxic To y Ban

WASHINGTON CAP) - Government safety regulators are asking toymakers to quit using a
suspected carcinogen as a plastic-softening compound in baby ratt lers and teething toys, but
have decided against trying to ban all toys made wi th the substance.

The Washington Post quoted Consumer Product Safety Commission officials in today's
editions as saying studies show that the amount of the chemical - diisononyl phthalate -
ingested by small children "does not even come clo se to a harmful level. "

The agency was scheduled to announce its actions today, along with advice t 0 parents to
discard soft vinyl toys that their children chew or hold in their mouths for long periods of
times.

, 'Few children, if any, are at risk," Ronald Medford, the commission's ass istant executive
director for hazard identification and reduction, told the Pos t. "But given the number of
uncertainties, we are - as a precaution - ; asking the toy industry to take certain steps to
reformulate their products intended to go into children's mouths."

The newspaper said phthalates have been linked in laboratory studies to can cer in mice and
rats. They also are a suspected source of liver and kidney dama ge in laboratory animals.

The commission identified only one line of pacifiers and nipples - Cle ar and Soft made by
Gerber Products Co. - that parents should immediately discard, the Post said.

Some major retailers, including Kmart and Toys R Us, have already begun pulling plastic
teething toys made with pthalate from their shelves.

, 'We've just been looking at the research and reading up on it," Kmart spo keswoman Michele
Jasukaitis said in an interview with The Associated Press. "Weare going forward in the
interest of our customer safety."

Jasukaitis said Kmart would continue to monitor other products containing p thalate,
including those that might not be explicitly for teething but could en d up in the mouths of
young children anyway.

Toys R Us, the world's largest retailer of children's products, promised la st month to have the
teething toys off its shelf by NOV.IS.

The commission said Sears, Roebuck and Co., Wal-Mart Stores and Target Stor es also have
announced plans to remove phthalate teethers and rattlers from the ir shelves.

Several toy manufacturers, including MatteI Inc., Walt Disney Co. and Littl e Tikes Co., have
said they plan to phase out use of the additive.

Environmental groups had asked the commission to ban the chemical ingredien t and issue an
advisory to parents on its dangers.

At least seven European governments have banned the use of phthalates in ce rtain toys that
commonly are put in children's mouths.

 B ILS i I"!.!i!J~Jl.         For products already in the home, the CPSC is
                              advising concerned parents to dis card any
                              soft plastic teethers, rattles or toys that
                              their children may chew or hold in their
                              mouths for long periods of time.

                              "Few children, if any, are at       risk," said
                              Ronald L. Medford, the CPSC's       assista nt
                              executive director for hazard       identification
                              and reduction. "But given the       n umber of


                  uncertainties, we are -- as a precaution --
                  asking the toy industry to take certain steps
                  to reformulate their products intended to go
                  into children's mouths," such as teethers and
                  rattles.

                  The agency says about 90 percent of the
                  nation's toymakers have indicated that they
                  will stop making phthalate teethers and
                  rattles by early next year.

                  Many of these companies, including Mattel
o   Free
    real-time
                  Inc., Walt Disney Co. and Little Tike s Co.,
                  have already announced plans to discontinue
    quotes        using phthalates in some toy s, including
    for
    E*Trade(      rattles and teethers, after an aggressive
    customel      publicity campaign by th e international
                  environmental group Greenpeace questioned the
                  safety of childre n's toys made with
                  phthalates.

                  In early November, Toys R Us Inc., the
                  nation's largest toy retailer, also anno unced
                  it would pull all phthalate teethers and
                  rattles from its shelves -- a mo ve that was
o   Crown Books   more critical to toy manufacturers' decisions
                  to reformulate their products than the CPSC
                  request, according to an industry official who
                  declined to be named.

                  The CPSC also is asking toymakers to
                  reconfigure other soft vinyl toys containi ng
                  phthalates -- such as bath toys and squeeze
                  toys -- intended for children un der age 3
                  that could end up in a child's mouth.

                  But the Toy Manufacturers Association
                  indicated yesterday it is doubtful that many
                  companies will comply with that request.

                  "We believe vinyl toys are safe for children
                  of all ages," said association Pre sident
                  David Miller. Individual companies have agreed
                  to reformulate their teet hers and rattles
                  "not because they're being precautionary but
                  because Greenpeac e has managed to frighten
                  parents. We as an industry are proud to make
                  safe pro ducts and this [soft vinyl toys] is a
                  safe product. We will not sit idly by and let
                  them do us in over a safe product."


                In addition to Toys R Us and Kmart Corp., CPSC
                said Sears, Roebuck and Co., Wal -Mart Stores
                Inc. and Target Stores Inc. also have
                announced plans to remove ph thalate teethers
                and rattles from their shelves.

                The CPSC found that almost all baby-bottle
                nipples and pacifiers are made with latex or
                silicone and therefore do not pose health
                concerns. There was, however, one exception:
                the Clear and Soft line of pacifiers and
                nipples, made by Gerb er Products Co., which
                contain phthalates. The CPSC said parents
                should immedia tely discard these products,
                which Gerber has stopped making and had
                retailers pull from their shelves.

                Gerber also has decided to eliminate any
                phthalate products designed for childr en's
                mouths -- less than 10 percent of its entire
                line -- "not because they are harmful but
                because there are some doubts and we build our
                business on trust a nd we're doing what's
                right for babies," said Alfred A. Piergallini,
                Gerber's CEO.

                In recent weeks, the CPSC has come under
                mounting criticism from environmental and
                consumer groups for failing to take action on
                toys made with polyvinyl chlo ride (PVC). Two
                weeks ago, Canada issued a health advisory,
                urging parents to dispose of PVC toys and
                rattles. Meanwhile, several European countries
                have anno unced plans to ban PVC toys.

                PVC toys often contain high levels of
                phthalates to make them soft and pliable. But
                laboratory studies have shown that phthalates
                may damage the liver, kidney s and other
                organs and cause cancer in mice and rats.

               Rick Hind, legislative director for
               Greenpeace's toxics campaign, called CPSC's
               action "only a baby step because the agency
               fails to definitively require any action by
               toymakers." He said "we'll have to pursue
               litigation for any companie s that are not
               responding," under California's Proposition 65
               product-labeling law. That law requires health
               warnings on all products sold in California


                conta ining ingredients that can cause cancer
                or birth defects.

                Twelve years ago, the toy industry decided to
                limit the use of one particular phthalate,
                diethylhexyl-phthalate (DEHP), in vinyl toys
                because it was found to be carcinogenic.

                The industry replaced DEHP with diisononyl
                phthalate (DINP) and other phthalate s, which
                more recent studies have linked to cancer and
                other health concerns.

                Laboratory animal studies show phthalates to
                be "clearly toxic," Medford said. But even so,
                he said, that finding, doesn't permit the
                CPSC, under its legal au thority, to ban the
                product.

                "The agency also needs to prove that there is
                significant exposure to the chemi cal to ban
                the product," he said. "And so far, our data
                shows that exposure is not at a significant
                health risk to justify a mandatory ban."

               CPSC said it relied on its own tests and two
               Dutch studies to come to its concl usions.

               In one CPSC laboratory test, 35 PVC toys were
               placed in stainless-steel beakers with
               artificial saliva and then pounded by a piston
               for six hours. Only a mode rate amount of
               phthalates were released.

               But another study, in which 10 human
               volunteers chewed a PVC toy and then spit out
               the accumulated saliva, showed that the amount
               of phthalates released was nearly 40 times
               higher than the beaker test. Even then, the
               commission found tha t the level released was
               far less than what it considered the
               acceptable daily intake. Even so, the
               commission's scientists were concerned because
               they found that the amount of DINP released
               from a product varied widely -- and could not
               be predicted with any consistency.

               "We had expected we would be able to predict
               how much DINP would come out, base d on how


                   much DINP was in a product or how a product
                   was made but there was abs olutely no
                   correlation," Medford said.

                 Meanwhile, a Dutch study that closely observed
                 42 children showed that babies, 3 to 12 months
                 old, mouthed toys (excluding pacifiers) an
                 average of 12 minutes a day. Children 13 to 26
                 months old chewed toys (excluding pacifiers)
                 an avera ge of 2.1 minutes a day.

                   Based on that study, the CPSC calculated that
                   daily exposure to phthalates was far less than
                   it had expected -- and consequently few if any
                   children were at risk from DINP.

                 Because the study was so small, however, the
                 commission wants to run a larger human
                 observation test, using about 200 children.

                      Commission Report on Phthalates in Toys
                                December 2, 1998


Q.   What is the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) releasing today?

A.   The CPSC is releasing a report examining the potential exposure and health risks to
     children from teethers, pacifiers, rattles and toys containing chemicals called phthalates
     (pronounced fal-ates) that are used to soften plastic. The report includes new data on the
     release or migration of DINP -- the most widely used phthalate -- when children bite,
     chew or suck on products containing the chemical, as well as a review of existing science
     on migration of phthalates. The report also evaluates all existing data on the health
     effects of ingesting phthalates. The report concludes that the plastic does of concern do
     not release the phthalutes, and so children arc not exposed to phthalates, at levels even
     that might bc considered potentially ha1111ful. The repOli. also provides information to
     consumers about the issue, and outlines the CPSC's plans for further study.

     The CPSC also announced the plans of [names of manufacturers and retailers] to
     discontinue selling products containing DINP that are designed for children to put in their
     mouths in order to allay any fears that their customers may have about buying these
     products.

Q.   What is the Administration going to do in response to this report, which seems to
     indicate that we don't really know whether products containing phthalates are
     harmful to children?

A.   The report shows that, based on all available evidence, DINP used in toys, teethers and
     pacifiers is not rclcased at levels from the plastic at levels that could evcr be considered
     potcntiallv harmful to children. That said, the report also commits the CPSC to do
     additional research on this issue. The Administration will support in every way possible
     the CSPC's efforts to continue to look at DINP and to study alternative methods to soften
     plastic for use in children's toys.

Q.   If this report shows that there is no risk to children, why are toy manufacturers
     agreeing to phase out the use of the chemical and why are retailers removing
     products containing it from store shelves?

A.   Although there has been no definitive scientific evidence to support removal of these
     products, toy manufacturers and retailers are acting with an abundance of caution. which
     we believe is commendable. While this question is better directed to them, I assume that
     thesc companies want to make clear to their customers that they take special pn.:cautions
     to protect children. even whcre there appears to be no risk.

Q.   Environmental groups and others claim that the Commerce and State Departments
     decision not to ban phthlates. Is this true?

A.   The report released today states that the Consumer Product Safety Commission does not
     believe that there is need for a ban on phthalates in children's toys and other products.
     While the Commcrce and State Departments initially expressed concerns about whether
     the product bans considered (but rejected) by the European Union were scientifically
     justified. the Admininistration recognizes that each country has the right to take whatever
     precautionarY measures they deem appropriate to protect public health. The President
     has made it clear to the Commerce and State Departments that they should be supportive
     of anv prccautionary steps that foreign countries believe to be appropriatc under their
     domestic laws.
                        Commission Report on Phthalates in Toys
                                     December 2, 1998


       I congratulate Chainmm Ann Brown and the Consumer Product Safety Commission on
the release of a comprehensive and thoughtful report examining the potential exposure and health
risks to children from teethers, pacifiers, rattles and toys containing chemicals called phthalates
that are used to soften plastic. The report makcs clear that children are not at risk of hannful
exposure to these chemicals, provides information to consumers about the safety of these
products that may contan phthalates, and outlines the Commission's plans to tor further study.
also commend the manv manufacturers and retailers who arc taking the additional, preeautionalY
measure of discontinuing the sale of products containing thc phthalate D1NP that are designed for
children to put in their mouths. This should allay any remaining fears that Inmilies have about
these products.

         The CPSC report and suppoliing measures bv manufacturers will go a long way toward
calming concerns about the safety of products used everyday by our nation's youngest children.
It also commits the Consumer Product Safety Commission to pursue additional rigorous work in
this area. Ihe Administration will support both the Commission's continued efforts to
investigate health issues related to phthalates. as well as governmental and private efforts both
here and abroad to take appropriate precautionary measures.
