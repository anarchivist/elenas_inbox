TEXT:
Maria -- I'm really glad you've put together a civil rights coordinating
group, which should be extremely helpful in steering the Administration's
enforcement efforts, and figuring out what the agencies are (and should
be) doing.  We'd like to help in whatever way we can -- thanks for making
our people co-leads on all the subgroups.

My understanding from our brief discussions is that this group will focus
primarily on enforcement, as opposed to policy development.  I know that
enforcement decisions inevitably raise policy questions, and this can be a
good forum for those.   But I hope you will be clear with people from the
outset that the actual development of new policies in a particular area,
such as hate crimes or community reinvestment, should still run through
NEC or DPC in a regular policy council process. We already had working
groups in some of these areas, and it will get confusing for everybody if
we have parallel efforts and no clear lines.

Let me know if there's more our folks can do.
