TEXT:
     WASHINGTON (AP)   After a sharp-elbowed debate, the House today
rebuffed a Republican attempt to prevent restoration of food stamp
benefits to legal immigrants who were dropped from the rolls in the
1996 welfare reform law.
     In a 289-120 vote, the House rejected an effort by Rep. Gerald
Solomon, R-N.Y., to strip the food stamp provisions out of a
wide-ranging $1.9 billion measure that also guarantees crop
insurance to thousands of farmers and pays for agriculture
research.
     Solomon, chairman of the Rules Committee, and other House GOP
leaders contended that restoring benefits to 250,000 legal
immigrants amounted to a rollback of the welfare reform law.
     --You vote yes on this bill, you are just repealing everything
we did two years ago, " Solomon said.
     But farm-state lawmakers of both parties, concerned about chaos
in the crop insurance program just as policies are being renewed,
were joined by minority members and advocates for the poor in
rejecting any move to divide the bill into pieces.
     --There is no excuse for this nastiness,"  said Rep. Tony Hall,
D-Ohio. --These are the neediest of immigrants. Why on Earth do we
want to take away their food stamps?"
    Added Rep. Earl Pomeroy, D-N.D.: --This is a slap in the face to
rural America.' ,
     Nearly 100 Republicans split with their leadership, which has
                                                                        1
been- actively courting Hispanics, Asian-Americans, blacks and othe~
minorities in an effort to cement themselves as a majority party.
     --We need to show that we care, " said Rep. James Walsh, R-N.Y.
--Welfare reform has worked. But there were certain aspects of it,
including food stamps, that went too far.' ,
    Cecilia Munoz, spokeswoman for the National Council of La Raza,
a Hispanic group, said GOP outreach efforts fall flat when
Republicans take actions such as attempting to block immigrant food
stamps.
     --This makes people very, very angry,"  she said. --Actions-
speak louder than words. ' ,
     The key vote came on a House rule that could have permitted the


food stamp provisions to be separated from the rest of the measure.
After the rule was rejected, Solomon said the measure would not be
considered again until after a weeklong Memorial Day recess.
    President Clinton and immigrant advocacy groups had sought to
restore benefits to far more of the estimated 935,000 who lost them
in 1996, but have agreed to accept the compromise as a down
payment. The president had vowed to veto the bill without the food
stamps and it passed the Senate 92-8 in April.
    Targeted are the elderly, those under 18, the disabled and
people who came to the United States to flee political or religious
persecution. To qualify, those immigrants had to be living in the
United States as of Aug. 22, 1996, the day the welfare reform bill
became law.
    In crop insurance, the measure would guarantee $470 million over
five years to pay agents and companies for expenses and
commissions. The money also would be placed in mandatory spending
categories, meaning it would not have to compete with other
priorities year after year.
    The bill would add $600 million over five years for agricultural
research, stressing such areas as food safety and biotechnology,
and increase five-year spending for rural development programs by
$100 million.
