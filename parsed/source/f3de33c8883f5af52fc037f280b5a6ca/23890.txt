TEXT:
I just talked to Nancy Zirkin about last evening's civil rights groups
meeting on Title 1 and Title XI.  Here's the basic update:

1.  They are   "fine"   (not happy, but willing to live with) with our
responses
to the three   issues they raised earlier this week, and will pursue a fix
with Clay on   the two social promotion issues. Nancy and I are discussing
language and   she will share with me what they are going to ask Clay to do.
There are no   surprises in this for us.

2. As a result of their collective review of our language, they have a
whole
new bunch of issues. Nancy, Bill (who probably has the longest list) and
Wade have basically convinced the group not to ask us or Clay to address
those issues before introduction.

3. The one outstanding issue in this regard is MALDEF's opposition to the
Title 1 requirement to test LEP kids in English after 3 years. They want 4
years. Nancy reports that Bill Taylor is reasonably confident that he can
get that back in the box by tonight.

I hope so--because I'm afraid that if he can't the pressure to have Clay
make all of the language changes they want will grow between now and
Tuesday.
