TEXT:
I spoke to Sarah Lichtman in Mike Smith office about ED's follow-up to
yesterday's meeting with LCCR.  ED is planning to hold an internal meeting
next Monday at 10 to discuss a range of potential actions the Dept can
take with regard to concerns raised by LCCR,  (The Dept actually had a few
potential items to discuss at yesterday's meeting -- but didn't get to
raise them before the meeting ended.)

A follow-up meeting with LCCR members will take place either Tues or Wed
of next week.
