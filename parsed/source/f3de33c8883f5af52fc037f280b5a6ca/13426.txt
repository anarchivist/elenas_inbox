TEXT:
I just wanted to drop off a package, which I ended up putting
face-down on your desk because (by coincidence) it's a package
that Kitty Kolbert sent to me last month.  The package is
self-explanatory but I have a comment or two to add so give me a
call sometime today and I'll fill you in. Thanks.
