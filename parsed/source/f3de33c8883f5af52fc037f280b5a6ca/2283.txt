TEXT:
yes, thanks.  I'll just forward to Diana the note that I sent to you and
tell her that she's invited too.  I know that Ken will have to do some
prep work for the Director on this and we'll be sure to get you copies of
anything we give to Director.

I'm doubting that this meeting would be cancelled -- it's a must do on
Mathews part.

I'll tell Ken that you're confirmed.   thanks.
