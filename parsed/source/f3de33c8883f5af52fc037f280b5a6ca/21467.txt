TEXT:
There are still two issues on the table (the other three have been dropped
or resolved).  The two remaining issues, at this point, are the Bureau of
Indian Affairs and Indian Health Service Tribal Contract moratorium and
the Enzi/Sessions Amendment on Indian Gaming.   The contract moratorium
would interfere with tribal self-determination by prohibiting tribes that
want to contract for their own health services or other services. The
gaming provision prevents Interior from promulgating gaming provisions for
the tribes.
