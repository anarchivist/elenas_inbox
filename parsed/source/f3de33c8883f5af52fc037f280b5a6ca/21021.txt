                 FOOD SAFETY COUNCIL

                 We expect the National Academy of Sciences to release next week a highly anticipated report
                 recommending that the government's food safety structure be much better coordinated and that
                 resources be more evenly allocated between FDA and USDA. DPC staffwill attend a briefing
                 by the NAS on Tuesday regarding the contents of the report. We have been working with the
                 agencies and NPR to prepare an appropriate response. All of the agencies agree that we should
                 welcome the report, study it, and use the opportunity to push for continued progress on food
                 issues. We are preparing an executive order setting up a Food Safety Council which will
                 review the NAS study and report back to you with recommendations for longer-range strategies.
                 The Council would consist of the relevant agencies, HHS, USDA, EPA, OSTP, DPC, NPR, and
                 Commerce. In addition to preparing a long-tenn report, the Council would serve as a
                 coordinating body, charged with setting food safety priorities and helping to produce a
                 coordinated food safety budget each year. The agencies are anxious about this approach, fearing
                 it may lead to a single food agency or a diminution of their ability to act unilaterally on budget
                 issues. However, in light of on-going appropriate criticism that the government's food safety
                 efforts are too fragmented, we view the Council as a useful coordinating mechanism that could
                 also set the stage for preparing a thoughtfullong-tenn solution. We plan that you could
                 announce this Council in early September at an event with the relevant agencies.
