TEXT:
OK, I'm a latecomer and probably not welcome. But I do have a
concern on the Murray bill that I want to raise.
I am worried about setting up a new "salvage" program that will
run parallel to the existing "salvage" program. More
particularly, it seems problematic to create a new program under
law if we don't somehow try to show how it is intended to differ
from, match, or otherwise relate to the existing programs under
NFMA and FLPMA.   I may be overreacting here, but I foresee chaos
in the agencies as they try to figure out which authority governs
which sales when.
Yes, I understand that the Murray approach is, well, "true
salvage." But we've basically maintained that our current
programs are also "pretty much true salvage." How do we explain
what it is we won't do in terms of salvage once we enter the new
world of Murray salvage. How do we avoid drawing unfortunate and
unflattering comparisons to our current program?
I'm sorry to raise this without a proposed remedy.   I'm thinking
about this and will have more to say later, of course, but I did
want to share the concern. There must be an answer.
