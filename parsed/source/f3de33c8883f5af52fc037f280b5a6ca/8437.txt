Elena,
The group (us, NEC, Commerce, Labor, OMB) decided to offer to Smith:

If the company has hired fewer than 20 HIB employees over the prior 3
years OR if the position pays < $60K, the company is exempt from the
recruit-and retain attestation.

If no bites, will offer:

If <3% of the company's total domestic workforce is HIB, it is exempt from
the recruit and retain attestation.

We'll see (the Reps. are meeting again at 5pm today).
