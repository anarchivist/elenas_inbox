TEXT:
Hogan neither endorses the "physical evidence" standard set forth
by plaintiffs, nor the Pacific Seabird Protocol defended by us.
He ends up - heaven help us - formulating his own "Hogan protocl"
for finding murrelet nests, and practically calling for a sale by
sale determination in courtrooms.
My own sense is that many - but not all - of the sales at issue
meet his standard. Justice and the Fish and wildlife Service
wants to spend some time today looking at our actual survey
determinations to get a sense of how many sales at really at
issue. We will have our usual interagency timber meeting
tommorrow afternoon in the CEQ conf. room, 2 - 4, and get a sense
of their assessment at that time. However, at least some sales
don't meet his standard and I have already discussed with Justice
that regardless of whether it's one sale or lots of them, we need
to appeal this. As soon as sales are identified that don't meet
Hogan's criteria, Justice will move for a stay and appeal. They
expect that to happen later this week.
Hogan is expected to rule against a stay, of course, and DOJ
already knows they'll be on the way to the 9th Cir. I have said
repeatedly (and will repeat tommorrow) that if the 9th Cir. denies
a stay, this time we want to have a SERIOUS discussion about going
to the Supreme Ct. immediately. Actually, I think we should have
that prior to argument in front of the 9th Cir.
