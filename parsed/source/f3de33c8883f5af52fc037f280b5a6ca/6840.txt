Subject:         Welfare to Work Housing Voucher and Transportation Event

As most of you know, this interagency welfare reform event has now evolved
to rally support for the two budget initiatives that will strengthen the
next phase of welfare reform by helping people get and keep jobs by
assisting them "move to where the jobs are". The tentative date is 4/23
(4/21 didn't work for HUD).   ISTEA may be in conference, and HUD
appropriations hearings are scheduled for mid-May. We're looking at doing
it in OEOB, Room 450, possibly with a press conference in the press
briefing room.  Our goal is to have, at a minimum, Secretaries Cuomo,
Slater and Shalala. Secretaries Herman and Administrator Alvarez have
also expressed interest. Other participants could include several
families who would benefit from this assistance, as well as supportive
state/local officials or practicioners and some of the national
organizations who support these proposals.

We've scheduled a meeting/conference call for Tuesday 3/31 3-4 p.m. in
Room 211 to refine the details of the event with the help of public
affairs/intergovernmental folks in t~e agencies.
