TEXT:
Hi all,
Thank you for the useful discussion on Saturday.  I am in the throes of
writing a draft of the work plan for the Race Initiative and thought I
would turn to you for help.  Rose Ochi sent over some of her ideas for our
work plan, and I found them very helpful.  I'd like to invite (ok, beg)
you to send your thoughts as well. Don't worry about being structured or
taking a lot of time.  If I can use an ugly metaphor, feel free to vomit
ideas onto a page and send them off.  If you prefer a little structure,   I
am (for the moment) organizing the plan around three themes which capture
the President's five goals:

1.   Articulate the PresidentD,s vision of a just, unified America; Educate


all Americans about the facts of race; Promote a national conversation on
race (in short, Public Outreach)
2. Engage leadership and sustain change
3.  Identify policy recommendationa and disseminate best practices

I would welcome strategies, tasks, outcome measures, names of partner
organizations, and absolutely anything else you can think of. Email is
fine or you can send a fax to 395-1020. The sooner I could receive your
responses, the easier you would make my job,

Thanks very, very much!

Michele cavataio
President' Initiative on Race
