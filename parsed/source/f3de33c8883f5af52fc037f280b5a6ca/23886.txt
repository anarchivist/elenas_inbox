TEXT:
As you know, last week Josh Gotbaum met with Labor in order to resolve the
issue of OFCCP's request to collect wage data from the 4000 or so federal
contractors tnat are scheduled for compliance reviews.  The main issue is
whether this request is covered under the Paperwork Reduction Act, and,
accordingly, whetherburdert to the contractors in answering this request
must be considered.   OMB and Sally Katzen firmly believe that this
request is covered by the Paperwork Reduction Act as it always has been in
the past.

On the· merits, OMB agrees that Labor can ask for wage data at this early
stage of the compliance process.    OMB would simply suggest that Labor
either ask for the data in a summary format or target the request in some
way.

Since Josh's meeting last week, Sally Paxton came here today and met with
Chuck Ruff.  Chuck now wants to have a meeting with you, Sally Katzen, and
Josh to discuss where you all are at on this issue.   Chuck has scheduled
this meeting for 1:15 p.m. on Friday in his office.
