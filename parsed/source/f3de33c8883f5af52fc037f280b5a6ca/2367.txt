    WASHINGTON, Nov. 7 /U.S. Newswire/ -- The following is a

statement by Matthew Myers, executive vice president and general

counsel of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, regarding

introduction of the Healthy and Smokefree Children Act:

    The Campaign for Tobbaco-Free Kids applauds today's introduction

of the Healthy and Smokefree Children Act by Sens. Kennedy,

Lautenberg and Durbin. We welcome the introduction of this bill. It

moves us an important step closer to the enactment of legislation

that will reduce youth tobacco use, save lives and end our nation's

tobacco epidemic. We thank these three members for their

introduction of this bill and their longstanding commitment to

protect children from tobacco.

          The Campaign is committed to working with the entire Congress to

develop bipartisan legislation that will have widespread support in

the public health community. A comprehensive, well-funded and

sustainable tobacco control policy is essential to truly protect

the lives of America's kids.       -o-/u.s.   Newswire 202-347-2770/
