TEXT:
There's a Reuters story (that I can't seem to find in a form that I can
e-mail to you) that says Hyde announced hearings today into the ocmplex
roots of youth violence and said some of President Clinton's gun control
proposals could be useful.

he said some of the proposals have "some utility to them."

One "useful" idea is proposal for tightening regulation of sales at gun
shows, but did not explicitly endorse such a measure.

May 13, committee wil hear from experts on issues including "violence as
glamorous entertainment," "corrupting and dangerous" information on the
Internet, video games, guns and school security and social factors such as
divorce (the Chairman presiding, I presume), and one-parent households.

He says he's not promoting specific new legislation.
