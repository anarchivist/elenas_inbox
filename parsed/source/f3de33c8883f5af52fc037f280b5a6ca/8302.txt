   6/19/98·9:30am
  PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
  TALKING POINTS ON TOBACCO
  CABINET ROOM
  July 19, 1998

          I am about to meet with my economic team to discuss the ways we
 can .keep our economy growing steady and strong.  Today, AmericaD,s economy
 is the strongest in a generation, and is the driving force behind world
 economic growth. We will be discussing ways to continue this growth:
 promoting international economic stability, by supporting the IMF and
 economic reform in Asia D(maintaining our fiscal discipline by setting
 aside the surplus until we save Social Security first D( investing in our
 people through education and training. We cannot afford to risk our
 prosperity through gimmicks such as repealing the tax code w~th nothing in
 its place. We must seize the opportunity ·of this moment to build for our
 long-term prosperity.

         I want to briefly comment on another obligation we face at this
 moment of national progress: the duty to protect our children from tdbacco.
   This remains a rare moment for progress in a comprehensive effort to
 change the way the tobacco industry works. After decades of deception by
 the tobacco industry, there is now. undeniable evidence that they have
 targeted children. We have a chance to save one million lives a year.
 For six months, we worked hard and in good faith to meet all. legitimate
 objections to this legislation, and to join together the priorities of
 both parties.

         Let me be clear: every Senator who voted to kill the tobacco bill
 voted against a tax cut for middle income families; against new measures
 to crack down on drugs; against life-saving research into cancer and other


    diseases. Every Senator who voted to kill the tobacco bill voted not to
    save one million American lives. It was a vote against our children and
    for the tobacco lobby. And that vote will be very difficult to explain to
    the American people.

            Now, some have suggested that the Congress will follow the tobacco
    lobbyO,s lead and seek to send to me an ineffective O&narrow08 bill that
    does not effectively address youth smoking.    We know what is needed to
    fight youth smoking: a comprehensive approach.    A O&narrow08 bill
    reflects narrow interests--.not the national interest and the health of
    our children.
