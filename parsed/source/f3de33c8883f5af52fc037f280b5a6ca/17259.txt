Dear Representative XXXX:

      The House of Representatives will soon vote on
accepting the Senate Amendment to H.R. 1122,
legislation that will ban all late-term abortions.
 As you know, I have long opposed late-term abortions,
and I continue to do so except in those instances
necessary to save the life of a woman or prevent
serious harm to her health.    Unfortunately, neither
H.R. 1122, nor the Senate Amendment which will be
pending before the House, contains an exception to
the measure's ban on late-term abortions that will
adequately protect the lives and health of the small
group of women in tragic circumstances who need an
abortion performed at a late stage of pregnancy.
Consequently, I urge you to vote against H.R. 1122
when it comes before the House. Moreoever, should
the House agree to the Senate Amendment and send H. R.
1122 to me for signature, I will veto the legislation.

      Let me be clear.    I have asked Congress
repeatedly, for almost two years, to send me
legislation that includes a limited exemption for
the small number of compelling cases where use of
this procedure is necessary to avoid serious health
consequences. When Governor of Arkansas, I signed
just such a bill into law that barred third-trimester
abortions, with an appropriate exception for life
or health.    I believe that Congress should work in
a bipartisan manner to fashion legislation that
recognizes that there are cases where this procedure
should be allowed when the health risks facing a woman
are deadly serious and real.    To abandon the women
in these circumstances would, in my judgment - - and,
I believe in the judgement of most Americans,-- be
truly inhumane.
The Honorable xxxxx

     Although I continue to hope that this painful
issue can be resolved, enactment of H.R. 1122 is not
the answer.  I urge you to vote against this measure.

                           Sincerely,




The Honorable xxxxx
House of Representatives
Washington, D.C. 20515
