MEMORANDUM

To:      Sylvia Mathews
cc:      Angus King
From:     Leanne Shimabukuro, Bruce Reed
Subject: American Indian Proposals
Date:     March 19, 1997


You requested comment on two proposals submitted by representatives of American Indian
tribes: an Executive Order on Government-to-Government relations with tribes and a Presidential
meeting with tribal leaders.

PROPOSED EXECUTIVE ORDER ON GOVERNMENT-TO-GOVERNMENT RELATIONS

President Clinton signed a Presidential Memorandum on Government-to-Government relations
with tribes on April 29, 1994. This historic Memorandum acknowledged the special
relationship the United States has with American Indian tribes and directed the heads of
Executive Departments and Agencies to consult with Federally-recognized Tribal nations on a
Government-to-Government basis in formulating policies and programs affecting tribes.

In letters to the President, two tribes now have requested the issuance of an Executive Order on
Indian sovereignty and the Government-to-Government relationship. This order would be quite
similar in substance to the current Memorandum. It is likely that the tribes want an Executive
Order because they believe it will produce greater agency responsiveness than has the
Presidential Memorandum.

Federal agencies vary in their compliance with the Memorandum. The Interior Department and
the EPA have been particularly responsive in developing and carrying out policies pursuant to the
Memorandum. Other agencies have been much slower to develop and implement policies on
this front.

An Executive Order is probably not the appropriate response to this problem at this juncture.
Issuing an Executive Order similar to the Presidential Memorandum may suggest a failure of the
Federal government to act on the President's initial request. This suggesti9n would be unfair
(some agencies have responded well), and could undermine successes achieved by this
Administration on Government-to-Government relations. At any rate, issuing essentially the
same directive in another form is unlikely to change agencies' behavior.

Instead, we should consider prodding agencies on their compliance with the initial
Memorandum. For example, a memorandum to Federal agencies issued by the Chief of Staff or
other appropriate White House official-- or, if more high-profile action is desired, even the
President himself-- could ask for the status of their policies pursuant to the 1994 Presidential
Memorandum. Such a memo could well spur as yet unresponsive agencies to take positive
action. In the event such a memorandum fails to produce results, we should then consider what
                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion

further steps are necessary to further promote Government-to-Government relations and tribal
sovereignty (e.g., Executive Order or other Executive action).

MEETING WITH TRIBAL LEADERS

In April 1994, the President met with over 300 tribal leaders in a large ceremonial event on the
White House lawn. The Cabinet was present at the meeting, and the event lasted several hours.
During the meeting, the President released his Memorandum on Government-to-Government
relations and. a Memorandum on the use of eagle feathers for religious purposes.

Leaders of approximately 11 tribes now have asked to have another meeting with the President.
Many other tribes would agree that it is time for another Presidential meeting.

We believe that the President should hold another meeting with tribal leaders. This meeting
would be an important gesture of goodwill to tribes. It also would allow the President to have
direct contact with a constituency that does not often receive such high-level attention.

Such a meeting, however, should include a much wider group of tribal leaders than the 11 who
have made the pending request. It would also require significant planning and sufficient lead
time-- at least three months for preparation.

Alternatively, the President could speak at a large inter-tribal conference, such as the National
Conference of American Indians (NCAI), which meets a few times a year. Secretary Babbitt
speaks at one NCAI conference annually, and the Vice President spoke to NCAI in November
1995. A NCAI conference is scheduled for November 1997 in Santa Fe.

A speaking role at an NCAI conference would be easier to coordinate than a Presidential meeting
with tribal leaders at the White House. But such an event would not carry quite the same
symbolic significance. In addition, the Navajo Nation usually does not attend the NCAI
Conference, and the absence of this very large tribe could count as a serious problem.

Either event will place the President at some risk of criticism. The tribes may well complain of
a lack of responsiveness to Native American issues at the Department ofInterior. The
scheduling of either event should take into account the timing of significant Administration
decisions affecting tribes that are expected in the near future-- for example, on Indian gaming,
and the BIA/lnterior budget.
