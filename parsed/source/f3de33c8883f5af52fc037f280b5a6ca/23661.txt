I called you to talk about education chapter.  It ·would be helpful for
someone in your shop to try a minimalist approach to fixing the chapter to
your satisfaction.

For starters, this would mean making sure that ESEA is discussed and
highlighted in a way that you guys are comfortable with rather than in the
fairly cursory way it's dealt with now.

To the extent you could edit the Compact so that it was consistent with
our ESEA approach that would be useful as well.

Can you call me to discuss?    tds

This new report from the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids underscores why I strongly oppose
any legislation waiving the federal government's claim to tobacco settlement funds without a
commitment from the states to fund youth tobacco prevention efforts. Without such a
commitment, states won't have to spend a single penny of the $246 billion to reduce youth
smoking. We must act now: Every day, 3,000 children become regular smokers and 1000 will
have their lives cut short as result.

                                      Tobacco Q&A
                                  April 28, 1998 -- DRAFT


Q:   What do you think about the new report from the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids
     showing states are not spending tobacco settlement funds to reduce youth smoking?

A:   This new report underscores why the President strongly opposes any legislation waiving
     the federal government's claim to tobacco settlement funds without a commitment from
     the states to fund youth tobacco prevention efforts. Without such a commitment, states
     won't have to spend a single penny of the $246 billion to reduce youth smoking. Every
     day, 3,000 children become regular smokers and 1000 will have their lives cut short as
     result.

     The report done by the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids, to be released on Thursday, is
     compelling:

     ·      There are 25 states in which there is no proposal being seriously considered to
            guarantee the use of a substantial portion of the settlement funds for programs to
            reduce tobacco use among children.

     ·      In recent months, only 4 states have decided to use settlement funds to reduce
            youth smoking, and unless Congress and the states act, only 9 states will have
            comprehensive efforts to reduce youth smoking.

     An average of 57 percent of the state recoveries is reimbursement for costs borne to the
     federal government, and the President believes that there should be a commitment by the
     states to use a portion of the monies from the settlement to prevent youth smoking,
     protect farmers, improve public health, and assist children. The Administration will
     work with the states and Congress to enact tobacco legislation that resolves the federal
     claim to tobacco settlement funds in exchange for a commitment by the States to use the
     federal share to support these shared state and national priorities.

Q:   Would the President veto the Supplemental Appropriations bill if it allows states to
     keep the entire $246 billion tobacco settlement?

A:   The President's senior advisors have recommended that he veto the Senate Supplemental
     bill, if it is sent to him with the current objectionable riders like this tobacco provision.
