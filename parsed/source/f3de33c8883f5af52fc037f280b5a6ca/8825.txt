MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:          Bruce Reed
               Elena Kagan

RE:            DPC Weekly Report


         Health Care -- Patients' BiII of Rights Update: The Senate adjourned this week
without bringing up the patients' bill of rights for a vote or debate. Your radio address and the
event the Vice President participated in with Senate Democrats on Friday, focused on the Senate
Republicans' lack of action and emphasized the key weaknesses in their bill. Earlier this week,
Senators. Chafee, Lieberman, and Graham introduced their own patients' bill of rights proposal.
With the exception of Sen. Spector, this legislation is not likely to receive any additional
Republican support, since the bill is much closer to Daschle-Kennedy than the Senate Leadership
proposal and because Sen. Lott is placing extraordinary pressure on Republicans not to cosponsor
the bill. It is important to note that, in some ways, the new bill goes even further than your
Quality Commission's recommenda.tions. Yet, we have not yet embraced this legislation because
early Administration support would not be helpful to Sen. Chafee or improve the likelihood of
eventually getting a strong bill out of the Senate. Moreover, Senate Democrats do not yet want to
compromise until it becomes clear that it is necessary to do so.

        The most contentious issue on the patients' rights legislation continues to be the
enforcement mechanism. As you know, the Dingell-GanskelDaschle-Kennedy bill provides for .
state-court enforced remedies for patients who have been harmed by wrongful actions taken by
health plans. The Republican Leadership's approach utilizes civil monetary penalties, which are
completely inadequate because their penalties are largely based on the degree to which health
plans are in compliance, rather than providing damages to patients whose health plans' actions
harm or kill them. Chafee-Lieberman attempts to split the difference between these two bills
with federally-enforced remedies that would provide for economic/compensatory damages but
not punitive awards. Senators. Daschle and Kennedy have already stated this approach is
inadequate. But this is probably more for positioning reasons than for serious policy objections.
 To underscore how serious we are about passing a strong patients' bill of rights this year, we
need to continue our push for such legislation throughout the summer. We need to spend
additional time in defining the differences between the Republican and Democratic bills, so that
the media recognizes that the distinctions are much more than just the right to sue an HMO. We
can achieve this through additional events and outside validation by groups and policy experts.

      Health Care -- DeSario Case: Earlier this year, the second circuit of U.S. Court of
Appeals ruled in favor ofthe state of Connecticut Medicaid policy that was used to deny
                                                                       Hex-Dump Conversion

beneficiaries of needed medical equipment. This ruling infuriated the disability community and
moved them to appeal the decision. Because HHS concluded that Connecticut's coverage policy
is excessively restrictive and discriminatory to people with disabilities, it believes the ruling is
incorrect. Although states can apply restrictions to coverage of medical equipment by basing the
coverage decision on the health care needs of the entire Medicaid population, they cannot make
decisions on the entire needs ofthe population without taking note oft1~e special needs of the
disability population. In addition, states must have a publicly known and timely appeals
process. HHS is planning on sending a clarifying guidance letter next week to all states. We
decided to hold this letter until after this weekend's NGA conference because the Department's
interpretation will likely not be well received by many Governors. While the Governors will be
relieved that the guidance does not limit their authority to restrict coverage, it will likely broaden
many states coverage rules and potentially increase Medicaid expenditures. While disability
advocates will welcome this letter, they will wish that it went further by requiring coverage of all
medically necessary devices.

        Tobacco -- House Legislative Update: House Republicans may unveil their tobacco
legislation as soon next week. Although we have not yet seen legislative language, the seven
bullet points they released before the July 4th recess indicate that it will be a watered-down bill,
with no price increase, weak advertising provisions, and limited FDA authority. House
Democrats expect to have a Rules Committee fight over whether they will be allowed to offer a
substitute. We have been helping Representative Waxman prepare for the possible
contingencies. While the Hansen-Meehan bill is an option, Waxman is also drafting a bill that
does not include an up-front price increase but contains very large lookback penalties which will
effectively function as a price increase.

        Tobacco -- New CDC Data: The CDC released a study on Thursday which indicates
that lower income, minority, and younger populations would be more likely to quit smoking and
reduce their cigarette consumption in response to a price increase. Controlling for income and
education, blacks are twice as responsive as whites to price increases and Hispanics are even
more price responsive. These differences indicate that cigarette price increases would lower
smoking rates and enhance public health outcomes especially for minorities. Specifically, the
study found that about one quarter of 18-24 year old Hispanic smokers and approximately 10
percent of 18-24 year old black smokers are estimated to quit smoking altogether in response to a
lO-percent price increase in comparison with about 1 percent of white smokers ofthe same age.
With the exception of whites, the effect of price on smoking rates declines with age. The study
examined data on adults only.

        Service -- Using Work-Study Funds for Community Service: Some time ago, you
and Harris Wofford discussed how to encourage schools to use work-study funds for community
service by college students. For the past three years, colleges and universities have been
required to report how much oftheir federal work-study funds are spent on community service.
According to the data, the average college/university spent 10% of its work-study funds on
community service in 1996-97, which is up slightly from 7% in 1994-95. Out of a total of3,250


                                                  2
                                                                         Hex-Dump Conversion

schools, only 12% use more than 20% of their funds for service, and only 2% of schools use
more than half their allocation for service.

         Under a 1992 law, schools must spend at least 5% of work-study funds on community
service. In 1996-97, 9% of all schools (290) failed to meet this requirement. This is down
significantly from 24% two years earlier, but still high. The law defines community service
broadly for the purposes of the 5% minimum. Any job that is designed to improve the quality of
life for local residents or solve a local problem qualifies. For example, jobs in a college library
may qualifY depending on whether there are other libraries in the community. The Education
Department does not penalize schools that fail to meet this requirement.

        We will not know the impact of America Reads on these numbers until October, when
data from 1997-98, the first year of that program, is complete.

        Welfare Reform -- Minorities on Welfare Reform Caseload: The New York Times
report on the increasing share of minorities on the welfare caseloads highlights some important
trends and issues that we will explore further. In the meantime, it's helpful to put the
information in context.

         First, the raciaVethnic composition of welfare caseloads has been changing gradually
over the last 25 years: whites rose from 38 percent in 1973 to a peak of 42 percent in 1983
and have dropped steadily to 35 percent in 1997. The proportion of blacks has generally
declined, from 46 p~rcent in 1973 to 37 percent in 1997. As the New York Times points
out, the most significant trend is the increase in the Hispanic portion of the caseload, from
13 percent in 1973 to 23 percent in 1997. However, this is not too surprising given the
rapid increase in the Hispanic population overall. The question is how welfare reform
may be affecting these historic trends. National data on the raciaVethnic characteristics of
welfare recipients are only available through June 1997, so it is hard to gauge the impact of
the past year when welfare reform efforts accelerated so rapidly. Some states have more
recent data which they shared with the Times, and which may reveal more significant
trends. It is also worth noting that the caseload data only tells who is currently on the
rolls; it does not tell the rate at which different groups are entering and exiting.

       Second, the number of white, black and Hispanic families receiving welfare have all
dropped since 1994 (when caseloads peaked), but the rate of decrease has been greater for
whites than blacks, with an even slower decline for Hispanics.

               94             97             % Change
Whites         1.9M           1.4M           -26%
Blacks         1.8M           1.5M           -18%
Hispanics      1.0M             .9M               -9%




                                                3
                                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion

       Third, the changes are more dramatic than the actual mix of who is left on the
caseloads, at least on a national basis. While the story pointed out important trends, the
conclusion that the composition of the caseload has changed dramatically seems
unwarranted.

               94             97
Whites         37%            35%
Blacks         36%            37%
Hispanics      20%            23%

       Fourth, there is some encouraging evidence from Census data that the employment
rates of former welfare recipients are increasing even faster for minorities than for whites
(although the actual rates and the disparity between groups remains disturbing). Between
1996 and 1997, the percentage of all prior year welfare recipients who were employed in
the next year increased by 28%. The increase was highest for blacks (33%), followed by
Hispanics (22%) and whites (21 %).

        Finally, there is longstanding evidence that minorities on welfare disproportionately
share characteristics that may make it harder to leave the rolls: lower education levels,
lower marriage rates, larger families, employment and housing discrimination, and
isolation from areas with jobs.

        Welfare Reform -- Welfare Reform Anniversary Event, including Medicaid
100-hour rule: On August 5th, you will participate in a Welfare Refonn Anniversary Event to
mark the progress we've made over the past two years and announce steps we're taking to ensure
ev.en more families make a successful transition from welfare to self-sufficiency by ensuring that
those leaving welfare for work have health coverage and accumulate assets. We will release
HHS' first Report to Congress on TANF and announce regulations waiving old welfare rules that
prevented some states from providing Medicaid to two parent families who go to work (100
hour rule). In addition, you will endorse the House and Senate Individual Development
Accounts proposals to help low income families save and build assets (CoatslHarkin in Senate,
SouderlHalllKasich in House). Since August 5th is also the one-year anniversary of enacting the
$3 billion Welfare-to-Work grants, the Department of Labor will release Welfare-to-Work
fonnula grants to 5 more states (MD, VA, WV, NM, NH). Finally, we can release the latest
numbers showing that federal agencies have now hired 5,714 new workers off the welfare rolls.

        CrimelDrugs -- Treasury-Postal Appropriations: (1) Fireanns Clips. A Feinstein
amendment to ban the importation of large capacity ammunition clips was tabled by a vote of
54-44. The amendment would have banned the import of clips which were grandfathered under
the 1994 assault weapons ban. (2) Drugs. Legislation sponsored by Senators. Biden and Hatch
to reauthorize ONDCP was added to the bill by voice vote. The Administration supports the
Hatch-Biden version of the reauthorization bill.

       Crime -- Prison Population: On Sunday, the Justice Department will release a report
showing that in 1997, the nation's adult prison population grew by 61,186 men and women -- a
5.2% increase from 1996. Last year, the total number of federal and state inmates reached over
1.24 million adults -- a 60% increase over the inmate population in 1990. However, last year's
increase (5.2%) is lower than the average annual growth of7% since 1990. Between 1990 and
1996 (the last year this particular data was available), violent offenders were responsible for
much of the growth among state prisoners, accounting for 50% of the increase during the 6-year
period. In addition, the number of female prisoners increased by 6.2% in 1997 to a total of
79,624; women now comprise 6.4% of all prisoners -- up from 5.7% in 1990.

         Of the total 1997 prison population, state prisons held 1.13 million inmates and federal
prisons held 112,900 inmates. California and Texas together held more than a quarter of all
state prisoners. Nine states reported prison population increases of at least 10 percent, with HI
(23%), WV (15%), AK (14%) and ME (14%) reporting the largest increases. States reporting
decreases include: OR, MT, NM, and D.C.

        Education -- Charter Schools: The Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee
reported out the charter schools bill unanimously, and without amendment. Before the bill
comes to the floor, there is one remaining issue to be worked out with Senator Coats, regarding
a requirement in existing law that charter schools use a lottery to select students if the school is
oversubscribed. Senator Coats wants the Education Department to provide guidance that
interprets that requirement flexibly, enabling charter schools to guarantee places for the children
of founders and siblings of students already enrolled. Coats may also push for guidance that
would make it easy for charter schools to have selective admission requirements, rather than
being open to all interested applicants. We are working with the Education Department to find
reasonable accommodations to these issues, without opening the door to abuses that could
increase the number of racially identifiable schools. Our preference is to craft Education
Department guidance that is satisfactory to Senator Coats.

        Education -- National Board for Professional Teaching Standards: In preparation
for the conference on the Higher Education Act, we are working on a strategy for eliminating the
Goodling provision that prohibits continued funding for the NBPTS. This will be a difficult
fight. Goodling appears as dug in on this issue as he has been on national tests. There is little
interest in the Board among House Democrats on the conference committee, and though there is
bipartisan support for the Board in the Senate, the prospects for sustaining a veto are weak in
light of the overwhelming majorities that supported the bill in both Houses. While few
members on either side of the aisle share Goodling's antipathy toward the Board, some of his
attacks (M, the high salary ofthe Board's President and the high financial cost to teachers for
seeking board certification) appear to resonate even with supportive Democrats. Our overall
strategy is to work with the Board to find compromise language that responds to the criticisms
that are being made while preserving the federal funding stream. We are also working closely
with NEA and AFT to shore up support among key House Democrats, and will work with

                                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion

Governor Hunt at the NGA meeting this weekend to mobilize Republican Governors and
business leaders who support the Board.

         Education -- Ed-Flex: The Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee reported
out an Ed-Flex bill which makes all states eligible to receive the authority to waive federal
education requirements ifthey have academic standards, tests and school-by-school
accountability measures in place. The bill reflects the principles in the Administration's
proposal you announced at the NGA meeting last winter, and we have indicated our support for
the bill. Senate Democrats tried to stall the bill with a range of amendments, but ultimately, and
unhappily, let it pass. The prospects for floor action are not clear at present.

        Education -- DC charter schools: The Administration and congressional staff have been
exploring ways to address a potential shortfall of funding for DC charter schools this academic
year. The budget developed earlier this year by the Control Board and the DC Government
significantly underestimated the number of students likely to attend charter schools, providing
only $12 million of the approximately $30 million needed for full per-pupil allocations to support
the 4,000 students projected to attend charter schools this year. While the original DC
appropriations bills introduced in the House and Senate included only the $12 million
recommended for charter schools, the House version of the bill has added $20 million from the
federal payment, a move supported by the Administration. Meanwhile, a manager's amendment
offered to the bill on the Senate floor may include a provision either to fully fund charter schools
out ofthe DC surplus or direct the Control Board to determine an offset within the DC budget to
fully fund charter schools. The Administration will continue to work with Congress and the
Control Board in the coming days to make sure there is full funding available to the schools.
