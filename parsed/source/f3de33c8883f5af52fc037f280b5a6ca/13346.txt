TEXT:
As I understand it, the draft timber language has been revised to
reflect the current policy of repealing the 318 and Option 9
provisions, while retaining the buy-back authority.
DOJ is providing us with the revised language on disk, which I
will get to TJ this evening.  I assume that you have seen this
language and have no other changes to make.  Ted Boling has
recommended that we allow the agencies to review the language;
however, no one has instructed us to send it out for inter-agency
clearance.
