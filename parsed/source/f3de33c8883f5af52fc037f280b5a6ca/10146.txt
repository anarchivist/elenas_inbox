            Tobacco -- State Tobacco Settlement: Christine Gregoire has reported to us that all
    46 states agreed to the proposed tobacco settlement by today's noon deadline. Several
    states apparently waivered until the end, under pressure from some health advocates.
    Drs. Koop and Kessler have come out strongly against the settlement, saying the public
    health would be better served if the states took their cases to trial. Other groups are being
    more pragmatic -- the American Cancer Society, for example, is now focusing its attention
    on working with each state to make the best use of these funds (the deal sets aside $1.45
    billion for counteradvertising and public education and $250 million for a research
    foundation, but states will chose how to spend most of the remaining funds).

           Crime -- Final 1997 FBI Crime Statistics: On Sunday, the FBI will release the final
    1997 Uniform Crime Report (UCR), which will show crime down for the sixth year in a row.

       the lowest point in 30 years. Between 1996 and 1997, the number of murders fell by an
       additional 7 percent -- 26 percent fewer murders than in 1993. About 77 percent of murder
       victims, and 90 percent of murder offenders were male. Whites were 48 percent of murder
       victims and 45 percent of murder offenders. Blacks were 49 percent of murder victims and
