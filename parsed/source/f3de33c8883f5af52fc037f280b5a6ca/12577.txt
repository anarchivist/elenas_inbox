Subject:         Heads up: ED letter on Ashcroft (IDEA) amendment to S. 254
Juvenile Crime for quick clearance

We expect to receive shortly for clearance from ED.a draft letter strongly
opposing a possible Ashcroft amendment to S. 254, the Juvenile Crime bill
that is now on the Senate floor. Accordingly, ED's letter must be sent to
the Senate today. A copy will be faxed to you shortly for your quick
review.

The Ashcroft amendment was also introduced as S. 969.   It would permit
school personnel to unilaterally suspend or expell from school children
with disabilities for unlimited periods of time, without any educational
services, for carrying or possessing a weapon, or threatening to carry or
possess a weapon, to or at a school or school function.   We expect the ED
letter to oppose the amendment as contrary to the IDEA, which currently
provides schools with effective tools to discipline students with
disabilities involved in gun related incidents.
