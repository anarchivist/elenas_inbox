Subject: Draft Housing Vouchers Directive for possible signing on Monday

Due to the President's tight schedule next week, Bruce Reed doesn't think
we can do a major bill signing event on the HUD/VA--Housing Reform Bill.
Therefore, he would like to have the President sign the bill in the Oval
Office early next week (it has to be signed before COB on the 21st) and
have some still photos taken.  In addition, the President would sign the
attached directive on housing vouchers.  We would do a press release, and
then have Secretary Cuomo and Bruce do a briefing in the White House Press
Briefing Room.

What is the Secretary's schedule like on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday?

Also, please review the attached memorandum and get comments back to me by
5:00 today.

Bob, can you also please review.

Thanks.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT

SUBJECT:               Competition for 50,000 New Welfare-to-Work Housing Vouchers


We now have a critical new tool to help families moving from welfare to work. This year, for
the first time, 50,000 families who need to move closer to a new job or obtain more stable
housing in order to move from welfare to work will be able to obtain housing vouchers to help
them. This is the first time that housing vouchers have been targeted for families moving from
welfare to work and this is the largest increase in housing vouchers in XX years. I am pleased
that the Congress has joined me in recognizing the critical connection between housing and
welfare reform and has fully funded my $283 million request.

For some families, having decent, affordable housing located near employment is essential to
getting a job in the first place; for other families, such housing is critical to keeping that job and
succeeding in the workforce. In many places jobs are being created far from where most
welfare recipients live. Currently, about two-thirds of new jobs are being created in the suburbs,
but three of four welfare recipients live in rural areas or central cities. Some families on welfare
live in overcrowded, unstable, or unsafe conditions that make it difficult to get to work each day
on time and perform their best. One of the first things many parents who move from welfare to
work do is relocate to a neighborhood that is better for their family and more convenient to their
job. These housing vouchers complement the new Access to Jobs transportation funds we
obtained in the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21), which will assist states
and localities to develop flexible transportation alternatives for welfare recipients and other low
income workers.

These vouchers will be made available to communities on a competitive basis, in order to foster
local innovation and partnership. It is critical that all sectors of society join together to help
families move from welfare to work, and this competitive process will require housing agencies
to consult with welfare and workforce development agencies in developing their plans. Several
communities around the nation -- in California, Connecticut, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, and
New Jersey -- have already shown that this can be done.

We must put in place this important new effort as soon as possible.     Thereby, I direct you to:

(1) Immediately disseminate information about this new competition, as well as promising
models and best practices, through the World Wide Web and other methods.

(2) Develop and publish guidelines for this grant competition within 60 days.

and employment officials and their national organizations, as well as key policy and research
organizations, private and community-based organizations, and families who would benefit from
these welfare-to-work housing vouchers as well as other federal agencies involved in
implementing welfare to work initiatives, including the Departments of Health and Human
Services, Labor, and Transportation.

(4) Ensure that the guidelines provide maximum flexibility to allow local areas to align their
housing, welfare and employment policies to promote the successful movement of families
toward self-sufficiency, require strong local coordination among key welfare to work partners,
and reward well-designed, collaborative and innovative approaches.

Through this effort, we will continue to provide those willing to work hard and play by the rules
the tools they need to succeed.
