TO:                       Stephanie Streett
                          Assistant to the President
                          Director of Presidential Scheduling

FROM:                     Bruce Reed
                          Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy and
                          Director ofthe Domestic Policy Council

REQUEST:                  Equal Pay Day Event and Roundtable

PURPOSE:                  To highlight the President's support for equal pay;
                          to hold a roundtable illuminating the issues, and to
                          announce a new data collection provision in Senator
                          Daschle's "The Paycheck Fairness Act."

BACKGROUND:               According to the Council of Economic Advisors,
                          in 1997, the gap between men's and women's
                          wages is approximately 75 percent. Accounting
                          for differences such as education and skill levels
                          raised the female/male pay ratio in the late 1980s
                          from about 72 percent to about 88 percent,
                          leaving around 12 percent as an "unexplained"
                          difference_       In the last few years, the
                          Administration has gained strong public support by
                          taking steps to further equal pay. Among the
                          actions the Administration has announced in the last
                          two years: endorsement of the Daschle bill; a $14
                          million equal pay initiative in the FY 2000 budget
                          for the Equal Employment Opportunity
                          Commission (EEOC) and the DOL's Office of
                          Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP);
                          publication of a CEA report that shows a significant
                          wage gap between male and female workers;
                          commitments by federal agencies to conduct
                          self-audits; and the creation of an annual report on
                          pay differences to be published by DOL.
                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion
