TEXT:
As you know the Service Event has problems. As a backup, I thought would
suggest another idea that could be easier and broader. I thought we could
literally hold a roundtable discussion in the Roosevelt Room with kids who
have done community service in the past, AmeriCorps graduates, Kathleen
Kennedy Townsend, a parent, the President of the Elks, Lions and others
who have agreed to sponsor a kid, a school principal that has already
selected one -- (so far there are ten commitments AmeriCorps has gotten fro
m the local area) -- and have the students talk to the President about how
they have done community service and how more kids should be encouraged to
serve. The President would make remarks at the top of the discussion and
announce that he has a new program that just started this week ... The
point is that if we put a more human face on this, and have more of a
dialogue with kids, parents,  and civic groups who say this is a great
idea it would broaden the announcement to focus on the concept as much as
the specifics of the program.

In either case the Megan's Law guidelines are ready to be announced and
Dennis and I thought that if anything goes wrong with next week we could
announce them on any day.  They have to go out next week and can be ready
as early as Tuesday. There are other issues with the health care
comission that I would like to talk to Elena about.  Basically, Counsel's
office hasn't cleared the last two people yet.  We could announce 30 and
announce 2 later (but Chris was worried about doing that because they are
two of the three business commmunity representatives, and b/c of the
problems the came with the AIDS commission when they did that.
