MEMORANDUM FOR WHITE HOUSE REGULATORY ADVISORS

FROM: Sally Katzen

SUBJECT:     October 1997 Regulatory Plans

         Executive Order No. 12866 requires each agency to prepare a
Regulatory Plan each year.   The Plan is published in the Federal Register
with the October edition of the D&Unified Agenda of Federal Regulatory and
Deregulatory Actions,DB and consists of descriptions of the D&most
important significant regulatory actions that the agency reasonably
expects to issue in proposed or final form in that fiscal year or
thereafter.DB In late September, the Vice President will be convening a
meeting with you and agency heads to discuss the forthcoming Regulatory
Plan.

        Drafts of almost all agency Regulatory Plans have been submitted
to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. (Of the major
agencies, we have not yet received draft Plans from HHS and Labor.)

        If you would like to review any agencyD,s Plan, please call Joe
Lackey (x54741) and he will provide you with a copy.  If you should have
any comments or edits on the content of the draft, please forward them to
Joe by Friday, September 12th, or--if you would like to chat about any of
the Plans--give me a call.

           Thanks.
