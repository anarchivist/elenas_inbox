TEXT:
The Republican leadership pulled the bill from floor consideration this
evening.  There was excellent cooperation from our Democratic whip
operation and lots of lobbying by the Hispanic Caucus against the bill.
In fact, Democratic Committee staff believe the Republicans were worried
about the vote.   I think there was some truth to that but believe that it
was the desire by Members to not stay late and to adjourn for the August
recess that really prompted the bill to be pulled. JM
