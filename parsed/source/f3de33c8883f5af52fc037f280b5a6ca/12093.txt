      TEXT:
      Attached is a memo discussing the concerns that IGA raised about changing
      the funding formual for Puerto Rico in ESEA. Among staff at ED, OMB and
      DPC there is general agreement that the formula for Puerto Rico should not
      be changed. However, IGA's concerns have not yet been explicitly
      discussed with Barbara Chow or Mike Smith.   ==================== ATTACHMENT       1

Issue:
IGA (Fred Duval and Jeff Farrow) are raising concerns about the allocation that Puerto Rico receives
for programs under ESEA. Jeffhas argued that PR does not get its "fair share" of ESEA formula
funding and proposed changing the allocation formula to treat PR like the other states.  IGA
reports that Reps George Miller and Romero are concerned about this and that Hispanic members of
Congress have written the President asking him to propose phasing in equal treatment ofPR in the
ESEA programs.

PR Allocation:
PR is treated differently than the other states. PR has an extraordinarily high number of children
living in poverty. In Title I, the formula is adjusted for this high poverty factor and the amount of
funds PR can receive is capped. When the Title I allocation is examined on a per-child basis,
children in PR receive less funding per child than in other states with comparable numbers of
children living in poverty. By extension (because Title I shares are used in computing allocations
for other programs) the disparities in funding for PR are carried over to other programs. This
funding allocation scheme for PR has been in existence for a long time -- Education thinks this has
been the case since the enactment of ESE A in 1965 (they are checking on this).

Change in PR allocation:
OMB asked ED to produce simulations of how ESEA program funding would change ifPR w~re
funded like other states. PR would gain approximately $49.7 million -- including $44 million in
Title I funding and $1.4 million for class size reduction. All other states would lose resources,
particularly some states with large populations of children -- including Hispanic children -- in
poverty, including California (-$11.4 million), New York (-$8.1 million), Texas (-$6.5 million) and
Florida (-$5.2 million).

Agency Views:

·Education Dept
The Education Department's ESEA reauthorization proposals would continue to treat PR as it has
been historically treated in Title I. ED believes that an administration proposal to change the
treatment ofPR would cause major funding dislocations and is not therefore proposing to cause (or
to fight for) such a change. ED staff (Ann O'Leary/Tom Corwin) have not discussed this with Mike
Smith but do not believe that their position will change.

OMB
OMB staff that have been looking at this issue are similarly disinclined to advocate a change in the
funding formula for PR. They point out that the end result would be to take funds from several
states serving large numbers of Hispanic Title I students to send it to one territory serving a similar
Title I population. OMB staff have not yet discussed this issue with Barbara Chow.

Recommendation:
IGA is continuing to advocate strongly for a change -- or at least an updated rationale-- for this
policy. I would recommend that we briefly discuss this issue at an upcoming ESEA meetings to
ensure that ED, OMB, and DPC are in agreement that the allocation formula for PR remain
unchanged. We should invite IGA to participate in this meeting in order to fully understand their
