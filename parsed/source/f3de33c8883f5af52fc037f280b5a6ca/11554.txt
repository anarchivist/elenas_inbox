TEXT:
In anticipation of tomorrow's COS Scheduling Meeting, I wanted to give
everyone an update from this afternoon's scheduling meeting.  The
following event proposals came up that may be of interest to you:

Unveiling of the Crime Bill
        There was support, and it seemed likely that we can secure a date for the
week of March 29. will be raised at the COS Scheduling meeting.

Bipartisan Patients' Bill of Rights Event
        Raised as a possiblity for March 19 or 23; will be raised at COS
scheduling meeting. Ann Lewis mentioned that Dems wanted to do a PBOR
event during recess, so it would be good to get this done before.

Bipartisan Hate Crimes Prevention Act Event
        Raised possibility of doing this at a radio address and inviting


     Members to attend; will be raised at COS Scheduling meeting.

     Release Dept. of Education's Guide to Ending Social Promotion
             I let people know we wanted to wait until ESEA reauthorization on
     this.  Minyon, Ann Lewis, and others wanted to make sure the guide was
     vetted around the building before being released.

     Address the National Association for Equal Opportunity in Higher
     Education's Annual Conference (submitted by OPL)
             People thought an address to this HBCU umbrella organization might
     be a good venue to do a One America speech or talk about some education
     budget initiatives like GEAR UP.

     National Teacher of the Year Ceremony (week of April 19, but prefer April
     21, 22, or 23)
             POTUS has busy week so far, but this will be raised at COS
     Scheduling meeting.

     That's it.   Let me know if anyone has any questions.   Thanks!
