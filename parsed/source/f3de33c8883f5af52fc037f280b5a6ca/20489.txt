Elena/Maria:
FYI. Tomorrow morning, Steve Mertens and I are going to meet with budget
folks from INS and DOJ to begin to get more specific budget information
from them reo naturalization (how much money is generated for the
exams-fees account; how is it spent; etc). We will also renew our request
for them to develop the kind of outline for moving forward that Michael
suggested   (including performance measures, concrete steps, and a
timeline) .
