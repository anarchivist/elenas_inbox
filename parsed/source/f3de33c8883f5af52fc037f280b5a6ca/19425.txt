                                          April 9, 1998

The purpose of this meeting it to identify the key components of legislative proposals and decide
our priorities.

I.     H-IB reforms previously endorsed by the Administration

       a.      "Recrui t and retain"
               What, precisely, would we be requiring an employer to do?

       b.     No lay-off provision
              How do we respond to the argument from industry that hiring/firing is too
              decentralized to allow for fair use of a no lay-off provision?

       c.      Reduced maximum stay from six to three years
               Given that we are proposing a temporary increase in the cap, do we want to
               continue to advocate for limiting the maximum stay to three years?

       d.      Other issues related to these reforms

               (i)       Occupational classification
                         How would we recommend defining who is laid-off or who must be
                         recruited? Based on "occupation" or skill attainment?

               (ii)      Job contractors
                         Do we want to include a provision that ensures that both end-employers
                         and contractors make the requisite attestations?

              (iii)      Prevailing wage
                         Abraham uses the current definition of "wage" but allows employers to
                         use outdated wage data. Kennedy defines "wage" to include benefits and
                         other compensation, which Labor says they do not have reliable data on.
                         What do we recommend?

II.    Enhanced enforcement
       The DOL has proposed that they be given greater authority to ensure that employers
       comply with the standards of hiring H-1 B workers.
             Which are the most important?
                     A.     Independent authority to investigate
                     B.     subpoena authority
                     C.     ability to conduct audits
                     D.     increase penalties (from $5000 to $10,000)

III.   Application fee



          Should there be an application fee? How much?

    IV.   Training
          a.    Regional skills alliances
          b.    NSF's Advanced Technological Education program.
          c.    Scholarships or Loans?

    V.    Other concerns
          a.    Concerns of the Academic community
                Many in the academic community are concerned about the "recruit and retain" and
                "no lay-off' provisions because of the temporary nature of many research grants.

          b.     Increased enforcment authority by the Office of Special Counsel
                 OSC wants the legislation to provide for a cause of action to a U.S. worker who is
                 replaced by an H-lB worker OR who is denied employment in favor of an H-IB
                 worker.

    VI.   Overall priorities
          How do we rank reforms vs. training vs. enforcement?
