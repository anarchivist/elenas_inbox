TEXT:
Yesterday I met with Ann Lewis who has asked for DPC help in putting
together a packet in support of coordinated Dem efforts to push the
education agenda in September.   Here are the topics of one-pagers that
she proposes to include:

1. Access to college (includes HOPE, etc.)
 -- fact sheet plus examples

2. Supporting public schools (including teaching, charter schools, school
construction, and opposition to vouchers)

3. Reading
-- America Reads plus early education/Head Start/community service/family
literacy

4. Standards

I wanted you to be aware of the project and also of the content/emphasis.
In particular, I wanted to get your read on #2 -- this is a different
focus than we have been discussing for the agenda internally, and doesn't
include some of the more tough-minded stuff that we have been discussing;
rather, it's intended to focus on those themes that unify the Dems.
Please let me know if you have any reactions to this.

I have started to work on this along with Bob Shireman in NEC.

Thanks.
