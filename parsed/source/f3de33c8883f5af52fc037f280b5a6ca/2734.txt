TEXT:
McCurry got questions this morning for which he needs some quick answers.
Here's the tentave plan on how to handle.

1) will we do EO prohibiting smoking in federal buildings?    We'll say we
are currently looking at it (HHS is o.k. with that).

2) cap on punitive damages in liability legislation/relationship to
settlement talks.  Elena -- April Mellody will call you about this.

3) Status of OSHA rule -- we'll say OSHA is reviewing the 115,000 comments
we received and will move forward as quickly as possible.

4) Implication of Shalala's remarks in AP story: [ "There is going to be a
full-scale, strict scrutiny, a public health review, of anything they come
up with.    . we didn't ask for this" potential settlement ]--' April is
checking with Lindsey on our response -- do we simply reiterate POTUS
committment to ask public health community to review any settlement?

Are you ok. with response on EO?
