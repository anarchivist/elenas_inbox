     I'm sending the following to Carol as the agenda for Wednesday.
     John will be bringing five written Qs and As to the listed
     questions (John - the NGA list did have six questions -- see
     below). The fourth issue is one that Evelyn asked me to put on
     the agenda.   There will be someone there from HCFA though John is
     not sure who. The state plan/45 day/completeness question I made
     a separate item because. it is so important to be clear on this
     given last week. We may want to spend time discussing it as
     opposed to the other Q/AS which are pretty straightforward.
