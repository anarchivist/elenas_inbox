Question:     Why do you want to cut State administrative costs to run Food Stamps
              and Medicaid? Doesn't that place more burden on States?

Answer:       The Administration does not propose to cut needed State administrative
              funding for Food Stamps and Medicaid. The budget only proposes to
              ensure that States do not get reimbursed twice for certain administrative
              costs: once from the amounts they receive in their TANF block grant, a
              second time by claiming reimbursement through matching funds in
              Medicaid and Food Stamps.

              The Budget adjusts the match rate on administrative costs in Food
              Stamps and Medicaid from 50 percent to 47 percent to account for the
              cost shift from TANF. The total savings from the match rate change
              equals the total cost increases resulting from new State "cost allocation"
              practices. In the aggregate, this means that States will receive an
              equivalent amount of funding to what they would have received prior to
              welfare reform. We are therefore not placing more burden on States.

Additional:   Some States may view the Budget policy as unfair because it applies
              the same match rate reduction to all States regardless of individual
              State differences in pre-welfare reform cost allocation policies.
              However, HHS and USDA do not currently have specific State-by-State
              cost data on cost allocation policies. Negotiating the administrative
              costs on a State-by-State basis would result in a long and protracted
              process that could not support scoring the savings from this policy for
              the Budget. States may also view the growing dollar cuts in Food
              Stamps and Medicaid as unfair because they say they can shift only a
              fixed amount from TANF. Once States shift costs to Food Stamps and
              Medicaid, however, the costs are projected to increase at the rate of
              growth in those programs. The match rate change removes the costs as
              they grow over time.

Background: As an unintended consequence of welfare reform, States have an
            incentive to shift administrative costs from the capped TANF block grant
            to the open-ended Food Stamp and Medicaid programs as a way to
            generate more revenue for States. If States pursued this course,
            Federal costs would increase by $3 billion or more in FYs 99-03 with no
            commensurate benefit for poor people. Effective in FY99, States will be
            required to adopt the cost allocation approach which requires them to
            shift costs from TANF to Food Stamps and Medicaid. The match rate
            reduction will become effective in FY99. Up to and including FY98,
            HHS will not approve State plans to shift costs.

REP. STENHOLM CONCERNS

Question:     Why does your cost allocation proposal save less in Food Stamps than
              the Senate agriculture research bill? Does that mean your immigrant
              and crop insurance proposals are not fully offset in the Ag Committee?
              Why do you want to cut farm programs to pay for increases in Food
              Stamps?

Answer:       The Budget achieves less savings from Food Stamps ($0.9 billion) than
              the Senate agriculture research bill ($1.2 billion) because the
              Administration uses a different methodology to harmonize Food Stamps
              and Medicaid policy while the ag research bill addresses Food Stamps
              only.

              In total, the Administration's spending proposals -- which include Food
              Stamp benefit restorations for legal immigrants, crop insurance delivery
              expenses funded through mandatory spending, and other farm items --
              are fully offset in the context of the Budget. Within the Agriculture
              Committee, the Administration's proposals are not fully offset --
              spending increases in Food Stamps, crop insurance, and other
              programs outweigh the savings from cost allocation, commodity exports,
              and other proposals.

              In addition, total spending changes in Food Stamps (+$1.5 billion)
              outweigh total spending changes in farm programs (-$0.6 billion).
              Restoring Food Stamps to legal immigrants who were made ineligible for
              benefits by the 1996 welfare law remains a top priority for the
              Administration and fulfills the President's pledge to reverse the most
              excessive cuts included by Congress in welfare reform.

Additional:    In line with Rep. Stenholm's concerns about cost allocation, the Budget
               does not change TANF grant levels, TANF State maintenance of effort
               requirements, or TANF transfer provisions.

Background: The Budget addresses the cost shift from TANF to Food Stamps and
            Medicaid in a unified manner by changing the match rate on
            administrative expenses in both Food Stamps and Medicaid from 50%
            to 47%. Because Medicaid costs are much higher than Food Stamp
            costs, a larger share of the savings from the match rate adjustment
            come from Medicaid rather than Food Stamps. In comparison, the
            Senate agriculture research bill did not seek to address the cost shift to
            both Food Stamps and Medicaid; it sought to prevent cost increases
            only in Food Stamps, and sought to prevent all of the cost increases in
            the program. As a result, its savings in Food Stamps are higher.
