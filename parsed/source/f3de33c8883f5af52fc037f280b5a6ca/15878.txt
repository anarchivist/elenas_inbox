TEXT:
Other countries have softened the cloning paragraph so that it no longer
calls for legislation or an international ban.  That gives us room, I
think, to back off of our strict adherance to "somatic cell nuclear
transfer." Here's what we've put together trying to use other countries'
words where possible at NEC's request; I've sent this to HHS for
clearance. Any thoughts?

We have taken note of the recent successful cloning of an adult sheep,
which could open the way to the use of cloning for the replication of
human individuals. While recognizing the considerable benefits for basic
research, agriculture, and human health from cloning technology, we regard
the deliberate cloning of human beings as ethically unacceptable. We are
encouraged by the serious attention being given to the ethical
implications of this technology by both national and international bodies.
This will enable a measured approach to the debate on which uses of this
technique are, and which are not, unacceptable. We support international
cooperation to enforce common aspects of national policies on the use of
cloning to create human beings.
