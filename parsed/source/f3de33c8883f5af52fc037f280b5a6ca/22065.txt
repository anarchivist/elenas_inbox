                                     Pay Equity Initiative         Hex-Dump Conversion

On April 2, 1998, the President issued a proclamation designating National Equal Pay Day in
which he urged all employers to review their wage practices and to ensure that all their
employees, including women, are paid equitably for their work. The typical woman who works
full-time earns just 74 cents for each dollar that the typical man earns. This gap is in part
attributable to differing levels of experience, education, and skill. However, even after accounting
for these factors a Significant pay gap still remains between men and women in similar jobs.

To address this problem, the President's FY 2000 budget proposes a $14 million pay equity
initiative to focus additional resources on providing employers with the necessary tools to assess
and improve their pay policies, and educating the public (including employers, employees, unions,
and advocacy groups) on the importance of this issue as well as their rights and responsibilities.
Specifically the budget requests:

·     $10 million (4 FTE) for the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's (EEOC) wage
      discrimination initiative which will:

      -- provide necessary training of enforcement staff in identifying wage discrimination cases;

      -- increase outreach, education, and technical assistance including funding public service
      announcements to educate the public on the importance of this issue as well as their rights
      and responsibilities, and developing training programs for employers, employees, unions
      and advocacy groups on pay issues; and,

      -- fund research on how pay disparities arise and where they are most prevalent in order to
      better target resources in the future.

·     $4 million (20 FTE) for the Labor Department's Office of Federal Contract Compliance
      Programs' (OFCCP) pay equity initiative, which is part of its overall initiative to increase
      compliance through enhanced compliance assistance. The pay equity initiative will:

      -- continue monitoring of pay equity to reduce occupational segregation and to assure that
      appropriate criteria are used for setting salaries for women, minorities, and persons with
      disabilities;

      -- provide enhanced technical assistance through technology, specifically by developing and
      providing guidelines via the Internet that address pay issues, including industry best
      practices;

      -- increase outreach and education efforts, such as research and public education grants on
      corporate management reviews (glass ceiling reviews), as well as technical and educational
      brochures that will keep the public informed about the various OFCCP requirements; and,

      -- provide a focused effort on women in non-traditional jobs which will challenge
      discrimination by identifying best practices and assisting contractors in identifying
      resources for recruiting and developing qualified individuals in non-traditional occupations
      thereby improving women's access to and experiences in non-traditional occupations.
