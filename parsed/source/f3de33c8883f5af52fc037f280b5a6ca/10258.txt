TEXT:
FYI, the Medicare Fraud event is scheduled for 12:30pm on Monday. We
have told the press office that the President will be reintroducing' his
Medicare Fraud and Abuse legislative package and will ask HCFA to send to
him a strategic plan for cracking down on fraud within a certain number of
days. This is just to say that Chris is working on the details now, so
people may want more information but this is as much as we have -- and
that should be fine.

The speaking program will be: Nancy Ann,  a senior advocate (probably
someone from the Older Women's League who can talk about the importance of
Medicare to people and the importance ridding the system of fraud so that
all seniors don't pay the price), and the President. We do not yet know
about the VP. The IG and Members of Congress will be invited and will be
seated in the audience. Shalala is out of town.

The Press Office does not want the President to have to take questions
from the pool so the event will either be in the Rose Garden or Rm 450.
We're opening it to hill staff, HHS staff, and seniors groups, but we'll
still probably end up a little short.  Please let me know if you have any
suggestions of appropriate people we could reach out to. Also, if you
have any friends or family that happen to be in town we can certainly get
them in!
