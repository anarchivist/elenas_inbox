      ADDRESS TO THE SERVICE EMPLOYEES INTERNATIONAL UNION (SEIU)

                             DATE:                 September 12, 1997
                             LOCATION:             Grand Hyatt Hotel
                             BRIEFING TIME:        10:35 am - 10:50 am
                             EVENT TIME:           11:00 am -12:00 pm
                             FROM:                 Bruce Reed

I.      PURPOSE

        To demonstrate your commitment to improving health care quality and eliminating
        fraud and abuse before the SEIU Legislative Conference.

II.     BACKGROUND

        You will be addressing approximately 800 members of SEIU at their annual
        Political and Legislative Conference. SEIU is the third largest union in the
        AFL-CIO, and the largest union of health care workers. The majority of SEIU's
        members work in the fields of health care, public service, or janitorial service. This
        conference will focus on two of the SEIU's top political priorities: extending the Fair
        Labor Standards Act to Workfare participants and gaining strong legislation to
        combat health care fraud.

       Vice President Gore is attending the SEIU Council of President's Reception the
       weekend prior to your speech. Dr. Julian Malveaux will be addressing the
       conference the morning of your speech. Rep. Gephardt will be addressing the
       Conference later in the week.

       Andrew Stem has been President since April 1996. You have met with him twice at
       the White House, most recently in a meeting with other union leaders on the issues
       surrounding granting a welfare waiver to Texas. Secretary Treasurer Betty
       Bednarczyk also serves on the Health Care Quality Commission.

       In your speech you will be making the following announcements:

       ·       Home Health Care. To respond to the extreme growth of home health
               agencies participating in the Medicare program (nearly 100 new agencies a
                                                                           Hex-Dump ConversIon
              month), you will be announcing three new initiatives to ensure accountability
              and combat waste, fraud, and abuse in home health care:
              (1) the first-ever moratorium on the entry of new home health agencies into
              Medicare until new safeguards are in place (about six months);
              (2) a new re-certification requirement for home health agencies every three
              years. Currently, there is no re-certification process and the only way a
              home health agency would be kicked out of Medicare is if convicted of fraud;
              and
              (3) nearly double the number of audits HCFA will perform on home health
              agencies, and an increase in claims reviewed by 25 %.

       ·      QUALITY. You will call on Congress to act immediately to pass legislation
              currently pending on the Hill which will improve the quality of our health
              care system. Specifically, you will reiterate your support for three pieces of
              pending legislation that would achieve the following. objectives:
                     (1) Bans gag rules for Americans enrolled in private sector health
                     plans. (You already took this action with Medicare and Medicaid);
                     (2) Ends drive-through mastectomies to ensure health plans cover
                     women to stay in the hospital for at least 48 hours after their surgery;
                     and
                     (3) Prevents health plans from discriminating based on genetic
                     information. (You will also state that the Administration will be
                     releasing recommendations later this year to prevent employers from
                     discriminating based on genetic information.)

       ·      PRIVACY. You will also announce a new challenge to Congress to enact
              strong privacy protections recommended by HHS last week to protect the
              privacy of health care information. These protections should include
              increasing consumers' rights about how their health information will be
              used, and provide for punishment for those who misuse personal information
              and redress for people harmed by its misuse.
