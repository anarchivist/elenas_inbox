TEXT:
OMB is ready to clear HHS' Final Rule implementing the "Illegitimacy
Bonus" provision of PRWORA.  The Rule provides up to $25 million each to
up to five states and territories with the largest percentage decrease in
their out-of-wedlock birth rates.  These states must also have a lower
rate of abortions than they did in 1995.   The total amount of the bonus
will not exceed $100 million annually in FY99-02.

Most of the provisions of the rule were required by statute. The final
rule has not changed significantly from the NPRM, which was published last
March.   There were not a lot of comments on the NPRM and those received
were generally supportive of the approach HHS took given statutory
constraints. Since funds must be awarded before the end of the fiscal
year, HHS is anxious to get this published so states have time to submit
required data. Unless you have concerns or questions, we'd like to give
OMS the green light to get this out today or tomorrow.  It would likely
get published the week of April 5th. HHS is not planning any splashy
release    they will alert states and other interested parties and will
provide us Q&As.  AP did run a story when the NPRM was released.
