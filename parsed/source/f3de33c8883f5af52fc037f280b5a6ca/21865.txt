     fyi- the lower Press Office says they no longer need any guidance from us,
     but let me know if you want Jon or Tanya to still work on some Q&A's.

     The Education Dept  (Julie Green) has already fowarded to Nanda Chitre a
     statement that the Asst Sec for Elementary and Secondarty Education made
     on this report.  I'm getting a copy as well.

     Julie, who used to work in the press office here, has recommended that the
     WH press office refer any calls to the Education dept. This is a local
     study and not one that is likely to receive any national attention.
