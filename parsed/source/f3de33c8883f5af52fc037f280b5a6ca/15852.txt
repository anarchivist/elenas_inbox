    Yesterday, you should have received a draft HHS letter on H.R. 1818, the
    Juvenile Crime Control and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1997. The letter
    voiced HHS' support for Title II of the bill. Title II would re-authorize
    and amend the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act (see LRM MDH90) .

    Collin
