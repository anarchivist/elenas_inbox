TEXT:
couple of thoughts after reading 1/14 draft:
1) Fair Pay Can follow up on your suggestion after women's conference call
that we include a reference to fair pay by inserting line about our new
EEOC enforcement initiatives after minimum wage sentence on page 4.
2) Dom Violence A brief reference in the crime section would resonant
strongly among women's groups, say after Brady Bill mention on page 11:
"And we need to work with Congress· to strengthen laws against domestic
violence."   We will probably endorse one of the "VAWA II" bills at some
point although we should try to hold off right now on endorsing the Biden
bill being introduced Tuesday because the women's groups aren't on board
yet. I'd like to talk with you and Jose about this further.
3) Choice Ann has worked out a line on family planning and clinic safety
to include after community health center sentence.

thanks.
JL
