Subject:         Cancer March

At a meeting in Erskine's office today, we discussed the possibility of
doing the September 26 radio address on the Cancer March.  Erskine, Ann,
Paul, and Maria were all very interested in pursuing this and asked me to
check in with DPC on possible policy announcments.

So I am passing this info on to you guys.    Jen and Sarah -- what do you
think?
