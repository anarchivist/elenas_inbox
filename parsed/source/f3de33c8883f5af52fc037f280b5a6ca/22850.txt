           Attached is the draft class size language Tanya and I said we would do in
           this evening's mtg.
           If you make edits/changes, we think we can print one of these out for each
           state, with that state's budget figure and # of teachers hired under our
           FY2000 budget request.  I am at a breakfast mtg from 8-9am and will be
           back about 9:15am. Tanya will be here about 9.

                       A NATIONAL EFFORT TO REDUCE CLASS SIZE:
                    SMALLER CLASSES WITH WELL-PREPARED TEACHERS
                                          February 23, 1999


 AN OPPORTUNITY FOR BIPARTISAN PROGRESS IN EDUCATION Last year, President
 Clinton proposed a historic initiative to reduce class size in the early grades when children learn
 to read and get a solid foundation in the basics by hiring 100,000 well-prepared teachers over
 seven years. Congress enacted a down payment on this request last year with bipartisan
 support, providing a one-time $1.2 billion appropriation to help communities hire approximately
 30,000 teachers nationwide. This week, Congress has the opportunity to build on its bipartisan
 efforts to reduce class size. and finish the job by passing legislation authorizing this initiative for
 the next six years.

 SUPPORTING EFFECTIVE LOCAL PLANNING Under the initiative enacted into law last
 year, school districts will begin to receive funding this July 1 in order to hire teachers to begin
 reducing class sizes this fall. While last year's one-year appropriation provided an important
 start on President Clinton's seven-year initiative, Congress has the chance to support effective
 local planning by giving school districts the confidence they need that funding will be available
 under this initiative for years to come. Rejecting this legislation this week will send a dangerous
 message to school districts about the prospects for continued funding just at the moment when
 they are beginning to make decisions about how to implement this new initiative.

 INCREASED FUNDING FOR COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE NATION In this year's budget,
 President Clinton and Vice President Gore proposed $1.4 billion to hire a total 38,000 teachers.

 ·              This initiative would provide [STATE] with [STATE ALLOCATION] to
                support [NUMBER OF TEACHERS] to reduce class size in early grades across
                the state.


 SMALL CLASSES MAKE A DIFFERENCE. Studies show that smaller classes help teachers
. provide more personal attention to students and spend less time on discipline; as a result
  students learn more and get a stronger foundation in the basic skills. Research shows that
  smaller class size increases student achievement, reduces discipline problems and increases
  instruction time for teachers,and make the greatest difference for students in the early grades and
  for minority and disadvantaged students. According to studies, students from smaller classes in
  North Carolina, Wisconsin, Indiana, Tennessee, and from across the nation outperformed their
  peers in larger classes.   A national study of 10,000 4th graders and 10,000 8th graders found
  the greatest impact of smaller classes on inner-city youth.
