TEXT:
The supplemental approps bill is apparently going to be on the Senate
floor very soon. Given today's meeting at HHS, Hutchison will likely
offer her amendment to grant Texas whatever it wants.   We should decide:

        1) What will our Statement of Administration position be on the
supplemental?

        2) What materials do we want to give our allies in the Congress to
help them defeat the Texas proposal?

        3) Are we willing to negotiate to avoid getting stuck with the
complete Texas privatization?
