TEXT:
George will has a column in today's Newsweek saying the equal pay figures
are "lies" and quoting Furchtgott-Roth and Stolba.    It is an argument we
have had in the past, but will now be raised more prominently and with
academic support.   Could you at CEA take a look at the column and propose
a fact-based rebuttal to Will's assertion: the wage gap is small,
voluntary and doesn't require government involvement.   Thanks.
