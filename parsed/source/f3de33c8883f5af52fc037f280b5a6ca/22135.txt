Food Safety - Food Additives. The Food and Drug Administration announced this week that it
will expedite review of petitions for food additives that could cut the risk offoodbome illness
caused by dangerous contaminants such as Salmonella and Cyclospora. Currently, the food
additive petitions are considered in the order in which they are received and can take years to be
approved. The FDA estimates that of the hundreds offood-additive applications now pending,
only a few are designed to improve food safety. Foodborne illnesses cause an estimated 9,000
deaths and 33 million illnesses in the United States each year. The announcement was described
in a short article in Wednesday's Wall Street Journal.
