TEXT:
DOJ is working on the analysis, but I just had a conversation with
the attorney who's in charge of the research, and the early answer
is we can suspend - and in fact, perhaps even suspend the
contracts that have already been issued.   (We probably won't get
the later analysis until the am because of the need to review both
BLM and FS contracts; we should get general analysis within the
hour. )
As to the # of days, if there's an overall decision to be specific
(I don't know that we need to be that specific in tlk. pts. as
opposed to the actual mechanism of suspension), I would suggest at
least exploring 45 instead of 30 days, just based on the logistics
of getting anything done.  I don't get the sense that 15 days
would make a legal difference, but if the suspension is supposed
to occur asap it will take a little time for both the Forest
Service and BLM (or whoever) to develop the mechanism for doing


whatever is going to be done ..
