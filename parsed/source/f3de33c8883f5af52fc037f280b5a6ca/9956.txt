TEXT:
Chris spoke to Ganske and he will not come to a Patient's Bill of Rights
event here on Thursday -- but he is willing to participate after the
Leadership elections.    Chris thinks that Forbes will have the same
reaction.    Begala, however, is still trying to push Forbes and wants Chris
to continue to push for Morella or another R -- but Chris has expressed
his concern that doing this event without Ganske is detrimental to the
passage of the legislation and we should not do the event now.
SO ..... if this Patient's Bill of Rights event falls through we would
probably want to pursue the Afterschool event, which means that, Bruce,
you may want to call Riley tonight to see if it would be possible.     I'll
let you know whether Begala still wants to fight for the Patients BOR
event as soon as he gets off a conference call (around 6pm).
