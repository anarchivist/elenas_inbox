                             REMARKS FOR ADOPTION EVENT
                                   THE WHITE HOUSE
                                   FEBRUARY 14, 1997

      Acknowledgments: Sec. Shalala (not present); Olivia Golden, Acting Ass't Sec. for the
Admin. for Children & Families; Sen. Rockefeller, Sen. Chaffee, Sen. DeWine, Rep. Kennelly,
& Rep.Camp for their leadership and bipartisan effort.

         I want to start by wishing all of you a Happy Valentine's Day -- I can think of no more
fitting occasion to talk about the efforts we are making to give America's neediest children the
gift of a loving, safe and permanent home.

         Both the First Lady and I have said many times that our country is only as strong as our
children are safe and healthy. The First Lady has worked harder than anyone I know to ensure
all of our children's welfare, and she has devoted her career to making their concerns our first
priority. She deeply believes that every child deserves a loving home, and we would not be here
today without her dedication and commitment.

         We know that our children's well being depends on two fundamental elements: safety and
stability -- for without these, children cannot thrive. But we also know that far too many of our
children are endangered 'in their own homes. The public child welfare system was created to
provide a temporary haven for those children ... not to let them languish in foster care.

        Nearly half a million of our children are currently in foster care; of those children, nearly
100,000 will never return to their original homes, and many of those children will never know
what it is like to live in a real home until they grow up and start their own families. But it
doesn't have to be that way. We can find adoptive and other permanent families for waiting
children like the ones who have joined us today, and the children whose valentines you see
hanging here.

        In December I called on the Department of Health and Human Services to devise an
aggressive legislative and administrative strategy to double the number of children we move
from foster care to permanent homes annually by the year 2002, and to move them there more
quickly. I am proud to say that you went to work immediately to produce this blueprint for
achieving our national goal.

        Today, I am pleased to accept this report. Now, we must move quickly to put our plan
into action so that no child is deprived of a safe and permanent home for even one day
longer than necessary.

        First, every state agency, family court and case worker in the country must understand
that our children's health and safety are the paramount concerns of the public child welfare
system, especially when determining whether to remove a child from her home or to return her to
                                                         Hex-Dump Conversion
it. We will work with Congress to make sure that the law explicitly reflects this priority, and we
will issue guidelines to the states so there will be no question as to the law's meaning.

        Second, to meet our goal of moving 54,000 children into permanent homes in 2002, we
will work with states to set yearly targets. To help them reach these targets, my balanced budget
includes $10 million annually for the next three years to give technical assistance to state
agencies, courts and communities. And it also includes $10 million to establish competitive
grants to develop model strategies for moving children from foster care to permanent families
more quickly.

         Third, we will propose legislation to give states bonuses for every child that is adopted
over the prior year:s target, with even larger bonuses when the child has special needs. My
balanced budget will start paying for these bonuses, but we expect them to pay for themselves,
since it costs far more to keep children in foster care than to secure adoptive homes for them.

       Fourth, to achieve our goal of moving children out offoster care more quickly, we will
work with Congress to shorten from 18 to 12 months the time a child waits for his first hearing.
And we are going to call it a permanency planning hearing so that there is no mistake as to its
purpose.

        Fifth, to give credit for model strategies that are working -- and to spread the word of
their success -- we will give national awards for excellence every year in November, National
Adoption Month.

        Finally, we must redouble our efforts to make sure that no child of one race is deprived of
a loving home with a family of another race -- it is illegal, it is wrong, and it hurts our neediest
children. The HHS will continue to ensure that states are meeting their obligations under the law,
and penalize states that are not.

        By putting this plan into action today, we are ensuring that no child will languish in
foster care when loving families are out there, ready, willing and able to open their hearts
and their homes.

       Adoption 2002 is just one part of our strategy to guarantee the well being of our most
vulnerable children. By giving states flexibility to develop their own strategies, we are moving
even closer to achieving our goal. That is why I am pleased to announce that I have approved
Ohio's child welfare waiver. This waiver gives Ohio the authority to design and test a
"managed care" approach to improve child welfare services and move children out of foster care
more quickly.

        By working together -- across party lines, at every level of government, in our businesses,
religious groups, communities, and in our homes -- we will help to make sure that every child in
America can grow up in a safe and nurturing home. That is a goal we can all be proud to
support. Thank you, God bless you, and Happy Valentine's Day.
