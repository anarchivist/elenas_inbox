Subject:         Welfare-to-Work

After talking to John Podesta this morning about the White House's
Welfare-to-Work opportunities, I think this is where we are currently:

We want this to work in the White House. We surveyed all offices for
interest. Many didn't think they had appropriate positions. OPL and
Correspondence were enthusiastic and that's the best type of offices for
such placements. DPC needs to make this opportunity available in it's
shop because they obviously are strong proponents of the program.

Therefore, John and I agree that your offices will be allowed to have a 6
month increase in "bodies on board" to accomodate a welfare hire. At the
end of the six month period you would need to absorb the person into your
overall authorized slot level.

We expect that other offices will also be interested as some vacancies
occur.  For instance, filling the next telephone operator vacancy in my
office will be targeted toward a welfare recipient and I know there are
other offices looking at this as well.

Overall for the complex we have a commitment for 2 hires in OMB and 1 in
OA. Those plus these three in the WH bring our total to 6 for the complex
and that's what we're reporting to the NPR.

Please let me know if you three are okay with being the pilot offices for
the White House. There is a package of material being sent around this
afternoon which will more fully explain the step-by-step of hiring,
supervising and mentoring these hires.  Please take the time to look at
the material and make sure you are comfortable that you can fulfill the
commitment you would be making.


My staff will contact you to help write position descriptions that will be
used by the Social Service agencies to match qualified persons with the
jobs available.

Thanks.
