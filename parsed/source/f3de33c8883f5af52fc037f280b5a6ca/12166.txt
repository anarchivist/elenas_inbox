   Clinton Pushes Equal Pay for Women

                                By SONYA ROSS Associated Press Writer

                                WASHINGTON (AP)   -- President Clinton renewed his
   call
                                Wednesday for equal pay for working women,
   saying the
                                country has "the opportunity of a generation' ,
   to correct the
                                inequity during good economic times.

                                The president, along with first lady Hillary
   Rodham Clinton and
                                Labor Secretary Alexis Herman, played host to a
   roundtable
                                discussion with four women who related their
   battles to address
                                salary disputes with lawsuits as well as
   on-the-job diplomacy.
                                The event was held to commemorate Equal Pay Day
   on
                                Thursday.

                                "There are still those who claim that this is a
   made-up problem,
                                that any wage gap between men and women can be


 explained
                          away by the choices women make, "   Mrs. Clinton
 said.

                          "There is still a sizeable gap between men's
 and women's
                          salaries that can best be explained by one
 phenomenon: the
                          continuing presence and the persistent effect of
 discrimination,
                          sometimes in very subtle ways, "    said the first
 lady, who
                          practiced law in Arkansas while her husband
 pursued his public
                          service career.

                          Clinton -- who counted himself among "a small
 but vocal
                          radical caucus"   of husbands whose wives have
 out earned them
                          -- said Congress should take advantage of the
 nation's low
                          unemployment and booming economy and pass the
 Paycheck
                          Fairness Act introduced last month.

                          The legislation would allow women to sue their
 employers for
                          unlimited compensatory and punitive damages,     in
 addition to
                          the limited damages and back-pay awards now
 available under
                          federal law to remedy pay violations. That would
bring women
                          on par with other minorities in wage
discrimination matters.

                          The president's Council of Economic Advisers
 reported last
                          year that women earn about 75 cents for every
dollar a man
                          earns, a narrower gap than in 1963, when
 President Kennedy
                          signed the original Equal Pay Act. Then, women
workers
                          earned 58 cents for every dollar paid to male
workers.

                          As part of his fiscal 2000 budget, Clinton has
 requested $14
                          million for efforts to close the wage gap
between men and
                          women.

                          He wants $10 million for training Equal
Employment
                          Opportunity commission employees to identify and
respond to
                          wage discrimination, and $4 million for a
Department of Labor


                        program to help contractors hire and promote
 women in
                        non-traditional jobs.

                        Sonya Tyler, women's basketball coach at Howard
 University,
                        said the greatest degrees of bias often are
 found in
                        nontraditional fields.

                        She filed a Title IX complaint against the
 school in 1991 when
                        she learned that the newly hired men's
 basketball coach was
                        being paid four times more than she, based on
 professional
                        basketball experience.

                        " I didn't really look at the comparison between
 he and I ... " until
                        I was told that I had not played in the NBA, ' ,
 Tyler said. "I'm
                        not building NBA players, and neither are our
 men. What was
                        happening wasn't fair. Once fair was not going
 to be addressed,
                            I took them to the institution I thought
 they respected most,
                        and that was the court.' ,

                        A jury awarded Tyler $2.39 million. She is still
 coaching at
                        Howard. She said her case has improved
 conditions for women
                        coaches elsewhere, in terms of contracts,
practice hours and
                        lower coach-to-athlete ratios.
