Subject:         Op ed

As some of you know, Ann Lewis asked if the CEA could produce an op ed by
Janet Yellen, presenting the Administration's concerns with the gender pay
gap (and at least indirectly responding to the recent AEI book.)  Attached
is a copy.  I've sent this to Ann's office for their suggestions and
input, but also want you to have a chance to look at it as well.  Can you
get comments back to Cordelia Reimers by COB today?

Thanks much.

                                Shrinking the Gender Pay Gap

                                           Janet Yellen




       Since the Equal Pay Act was signed into law by President Kennedy in 1963 women

workers have made enormous strides. For example, in the Clinton Administration, women hold

seven cabinet-level positions, including Secretary of State, Attorney General, and chair of the

Council of Economic Advisers. Does this mean that all the barriers have been removed and

women now have equal access to the good jobs and higher wages long available only to men?

Unfortunately, no.



       Before the Equal Pay Act, employers regularly paid women less than men doing the very

same job.   Since then, new cohorts of women have overtaken men in educational attainment

over the last 35 years, and women are entering many high-paying formerly "male" occupations,

such as law, medicine, and accounting, in large numbers. Moreover, women are taking fewer

years out of the labor force for child-rearing, which means they are accumulating greater work

experience. As a result, by 1998 women's wages had risen to 76 percent of men's.



       While 76 cents on the dollar represents progress, the earnings gap remains much too high.

Research on the causes of the remaining gender pay gap were summarized in a recent report by

the Council of Economic Advisers. The evidence suggests that about 60 percent can be

explained by continuing differences in accumulated years of full-time work experience between


                                                1

men and women, in the broad occupations and industries in which women and men are

concentrated, and in union status. After adjusting for these differences -- some of which may

themselves be due to differential treatment of women versus men -- the pay ratio rises to about

90 percent, leaving an ongoing 10 percent unexplained gap between men and women's pay.



       Interestingly, the evidence suggests that most of the unexplained pay gap is currently

concentrated among women with children. Younger childless women receive pay almost at par

with younger men. But mothers' wages are an estimated 10 percent lower than those of

childless women with the same levels of education and workforce experience.



       Some have argued that the prevalence of lower pay for mothers results from the inherent

difficulty women face in combining careers with childrearing and is not a problem requiring a

public policy response. After all, if women choose to have children, they must bear the

consequences. But the impact of family and children on women's careers and earnings is not an

unalterable consequence of biology. Rather, it results from current social arrangements and

workplace practices that make it difficult to combine career and family.



       These behaviors can change, and indeed are changing: fathers can spend more time in

household and child-rearing tasks, and employers can offer family-friendly scheduling and

benefits policies. Policies to reduce the gender gap further must focus on making it easier for

parents -- both women and men -- to combine work and family. For instance, government can

help assure that family and medical leave is available to workers, and can increase the

availability of safe and affordable child care.

       Gender discrimination in the labor market has not disappeared, as the 24,500

gender-discrimination complaints filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in

1998 attest And research consistently finds evidence of ongoing discrimination in the labor

market and differential treatment of women on the job.



       In many workplaces discrimination may take more subtle forms today than in the past. A

recent report on female faculty at MIT indicated that even this group of highly skilled,

high-achieving women faced discrimination, which the report defined as "a pattern of powerful

but unrecognized assumptions and attitudes that work systematically against women faculty even

in the light of obvious good will." This is a familiar story for women who regularly feel that

they are treated less seriously, excluded from key decision-making, or passed over for a project

assignment without even being asked ("we know she won't want to do this given her family

demands").



       Working toward gender pay equity means fighting workplace discrimination of all types,

and strongly enforcing the Equal Pay Act. But it also means promoting policies that allow

workers to be both good parents and effective employees. Raising our children to be

well-functioning adults may be the most important thing many of us will do in our lives, and this

task is vitally important to the future of our nation. We must find ways to support rather than

penalize workers who are also active and involved parents.
