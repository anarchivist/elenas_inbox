 TEXT:
 Below is the conferees letter on Military Construction FY99
 Appropriations. House & Senate action is possible next week.   Please
 review the draft and provide comments/clearance by 2:30pm tomorrow.   We


 aim to send the letter Friday afternoon.   Thanks.

 The Honorable Bob Livingston
 Chairman
 Committee on Appropriations
 U.S. House of Representatives
 Washington, D.C.   20515

 Dear Mr. Chairman:

         The purpose of this letter is to provide the Administrationo,s
 views on H.R. 4059, the Military Construction Appropriations Bill, FY
 1999, as passed by the House and by the Senate. As you develop the
 conference version of the bill, your consideration of the
 Administrationo,s views would be appreciated.

         The Administration is disappointed that the House and Senate have
 chosen to increase funding above the level requested for the Military
 Construction Appropriations Bill, while reducing the Presidento,s request
 for national defense programs funded by the Department of Defense
 Appropriations Bill and the Energy and Water Development Appropriations
 Bill.

 Unrequested Projects

         The House has added $575 million to the President's request for 89
 unrequested projects and unrequested increases in funding for several
 programs,  partially offset by $130 million in reductions to requested
 items. The Senate has added $846 million to the Presidento,s request for
 104 unrequested projects, partially offset by $150 million in reductions
 to requested items. Though much of the unrequested funding is for items
 that are funded in DoDO,s Future Years Defense Program (FYDP), $203
 million for 32 projects in the House bill and $99 million for 14 projects
 in the Senate bill would be used for items that are not in DoDO,s FYDP.
 Although many of these projects may have some military utility, they are
 of much lower priority than the projects requested in the FY 1999 Budget
 and contained in DoDO,s FYDP.

 Funding Priorities

         The Administration urges the conferees to reconsider the funding
 added by the House and Senate for unrequested projects, especially those
 not in the FYDP, and to redirect this funding to requested programs both
 in the Military Construction and the Defense appropriations bills.

         The Administration is particularly concerned about the reductions
 from requested military construction funding levels for:

   Advance Appropriations.  Neither the House bill nor the Senate bill
 provides the advance appropriations of $568.6 million requested for a
 number of large construction projects, especially ammunition
 demilitarization facilities. Advance appropriations would ensure that
 full funding is available to complete projects before construction
 begins. Without full funding, it is difficult to optimize planning,
 scheduling, and cost control. The Administration opposes incremental
 funding of these projects and urges the conferees to provide the advance
 appropriations as requested.

  Chemical Demilitarization Construction Program.  The Senate would cut $50
 million from the $125 million requested.  A reduction of this magnitude


 would extend the construction schedules at Pine Bluff, Umatilla, Aberdeen,
 and Newport and increase life-cycle costs.  The Administration is
 committed to meeting the Chemical Weapons Convention 2007 deadline for the
 destruction of U.S. chemical stockpiles and to developing alternatives to
 current incineration technology. To support these objectives, the
 Administration urges the conferees to approve the House funding level for
 this important program.

  NATO Security Investment Program.  The House would cut $16 million from
 the $185 million request, and the Senate would cut $32 million. Although
 the House level is preferable to the Senate level, we urge the conferees
 to provide the full amount requested.

 Language Issues

         The Administration is concerned with the language in the Senate bill that
 would restrict the use of NATO construction funds.  In addition, the
 Administration urges the conferees to provide the requested transfer
 authorities.

  Restriction on the use of NATO Security Investment Program (NSIP) funds.
 The Senate bill would prohibit the use of NSIP funds for Partnership for
 Peace programs or to provide support to non-NATO countries. No NSIP funds
 have been, or are proposed to be, spent on projects that do not have
 direct military benefit to the Alliance.   Indeed, NSIP-funded proposals
 for projects that happen to be located in non-NATO countries must meet the
 same NATO military criteria as NSIP projects located in the 16 NATO member
 nations. The Alliance must have the flexibility to allocate NSIP funds as
 needed to satisfy NATO military requirements. Restrictions of the type
 included in the Senate bill could invite other NATO members to restrict
 their NSIP con'tributions according to narrow national concerns. The
 restriction could adversely affect future NATO-led military operations.
 The Administration urges the conferees to remove this restriction from the
 bill.

  General Transfer Authority.  Neither the House nor the Senate bill
 includes the requested authority enabling the Secretary of Defense to
 transfer funds within the appropriation accounts in the Military
 Construction Appropriations Act.  Similar transfer authority in Defense
 Appropriations Acts has been used with great success to meet unplanned
 requirements, without reducing the opportunity for congressional
 oversight.

          HomeownerO,s Assistance Program Transfer Authority.  The Administration
 supports the provision in the Senate bill that would provide authority to
 transfer funds from the Base Realignment and Closure account to the
 HomeownerO,s Assistance Program account.  The provision would ensure that
 funds are available to assist Government employees who have to sell their
 homes in depressed real estate markets resulting from base closures.

         We look forward to working with the conference committee to
 address our mutual concerns.

                                                Sincerely,



                                                Jacob J. Lew
                                                Acting Director
.

    Identical Letter Sent to The Honorable Bob Livingston,
    The Honorable David R. Obey, The Honorable Ron Packard,
    The Honorable W.G. Hefner, The Honorable Ted Stevens,
    The Honorable Robert C. Byrd, The Honorable Conrad Burns,
    and The Honorable Patty Murray
