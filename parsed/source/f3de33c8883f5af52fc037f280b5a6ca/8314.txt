TEXT:
Gruber ran into one of Hatch's staffers this weekend, and got some general
info on their lookback surcharges:

They have no company specific, only industry-wide, but the industry wide
are fairly large (starting at $100 m per point, then $200 m, then $300 m
with a cap of $5 billion in early years rising to $10 billion later). But
they are all abateable, i.e., the burden of proof is on the Secretary,
which they think is necessary to avoid constitutional problems.

 Today, Sen. Feinstein said on CNN that they plan to release their bill
 next week. Bruce, did you get any more detail on their bill at your
'meeting?

I'll get DOJ ready to say why surcharges don't need to be abateable to be
constitutional and get those revised numbers from OMB.
