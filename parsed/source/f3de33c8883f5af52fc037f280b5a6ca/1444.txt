TEXT:
Just abit more about the issues involved:

1)   As Cynthia identified: Discriminatory application;

2) Also, the question will be asked: Why the change in policy to require
identifying citizens and LPRs?   Why is this necessary to provide adequate
protection for the President or to attend White House events? [I spoke
with Dawn Chirwa and Counsel's office will work with Public Liaison to
explain this to. the groups.)

3) And regardless of anything else, the groups will believe that this
conclusively establishes their point that employment verification under
the immigration bill will be implemented in a discriminatorY,manner by
employers. The logic is that if even the White House can't avoid
discrimination by asking someone who "looks or sounds foreign" or who has
a so-called "foreign-sounding" name for something that others are not
asked for, how do we expect employers around the country to do any
better.    This is such a fundamental point for the groups that they may
decide to use this from now on as evidence in their arguments against
employer sanctions and employment authorization pilots.
