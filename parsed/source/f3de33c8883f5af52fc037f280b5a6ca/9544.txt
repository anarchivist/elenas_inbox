Re:           RU-486


Purpose
        This memo describes where RU-486 is in the FDA approval process, explains the
legislative status of the Agriculture Appropriations bill and the Coburn amendment preventing
the approval of RU-486, and describes the implications of this amendment both within and
beyond the abortion context.

Pharmaceutical Status

        RU-486 (or mifepristone) is an effective non-surgical method of early abortion (often
referred to as a "medical abortion") that has been in use in other countries since 1981. It is an
antiprogesterone, one of a family of drugs that block the action of progesterone, a hornl0ne
needed to maintain pregnancy. The drug is administered within the first seven weeks following
conception, and is followed three days later by misoprostol, a prostaglandin which causes uterine
contractions.

        RU-486 was approved for use in France, Great Britain, and Sweden following extensive
clinical trials that demonstrated its safety and effectiveness. During the Bush Administration,
the FDA issued an "import alert" which helped ensure that RU-486 would not be available in the
United States for any purpose. A United States District Court that examined the "import alert"
concluded, "[T]he decision to ban the drug was based not from any bona fide concern for the
safety of users of the drug, but on political considerations having no place in FDA decisions on
health and safety."

        When President Clinton took office in January 1993,he signed an Executive Order
directing HHS to assess initiatives to promote the testing and licensing ofRU-486. As the result
of the Administration's efforts following this directive, the French drug company, Roussel Uclaf,
donated the US patent rights to RU-486 to a non-profit research organization, the Population
Council. The Council announced that it would conduct clinical trials in 17 sites across the
country, and would work to locate a manufacturer to produce and distribute the product.

         Population Council has completed its clinical trials, which show that RU-486 is 95%
effective in terminating pregnancy. Women taking the drugs need to see a doctor three times.
Its side effects can include painful uterine contractions, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and
headaches. A small number of the women in the trials had to be hospitalized or given
transfusions because of bleeding, and 1.5% of participants in the US trial required a surgical
abortion.

                                               1

                                                             Hex-Dump Conversion
the Agency declared that clinical trials revealed the drug to be safe and effective for terminating
an early pregnancy, when used under close medical supervision in combination with misoprostol.
 At that time, it issued an "approvable letter" for the use ofmifepristone and misoprostol for
early abortion, but said that it would withhold final approval until it received more information
about the drug's manufacture and labeling. The Population Council has indicated that it has
located a pharmaceutical company willing to manufacturer the drug, which could become
available on the market sometime next year.

Legislative Status

         Representative Coburn successfully offered an amendment to the House Agriculture
Appropriations bill that would prohibit the expenditure of FDA funds for the testing,
development, or approval of any drug for the "chemical" inducement of abortion. "Approval"
was defined to include the approval of production, manufacturing or distribution. The Senate
bill did not contain a similar provision.

         The Coburn amendment and disaster relief are currently the only outstanding issues in
conference. The Senate conferees voted 8-5 against receding to the House language on RU-486
(all the Democrats voted with us, as did Specter and Gorton. Chairman Stevens initially voted
with us, which would have made the vote 9-4, but then switched his vote when he realized that it
was not needed to prevent the language from being accepted by the Senate.)

        If the House and Senate conferees continue to remain in disagreement, they could decide
to approve the conference report with the RU-486 language "in disagreement", meaning that the
conference report would return to both chambers, requiring an up or down vote on the Coburn
amendment. The conference report would first go to the House, which would certainly approve
the Coburn language once again. Then it would go to the Senate, which would probably (but not
certainly) vote against the amendment. However, Lott is adamant about preventing the
conference report from returning to the Senate, because procedural rules would allow the report
to be opened up for any reason, and we could expect Daschle or Harkin to offer an amendment
adding $7.5 billion for disaster relief. For this reason, Lott wants the issue to be resolved in
conference.

Implications of the Coburn Amendment

        This amendment has several far reaching implications both within and beyond the
abortion context. First, this amendment represents the first time that Congress has attempted to
override the FDA's authority in approving a drug. Americans rely on the FDA to appropriately
evaluate drugs for safety and efficacy based on sound scientific principles. In attempting to
legislate against RU-486's approval, Congress threatens the integrity of the FDA and its routine
approval process.

       Second, this amendment would deny women a major medical breakthrough which

                                                2

         provides a safe non-invasive alternative to surgical abortion. Unlike a surgical abortion,
         RU-486 would be available in the privacy of a doctor's office -- rather than a clinic that may be
         subject to violence or protests -- and will be far more accessible to women who do not have
         abortion clinics conveniently located within their county or state.. The amendment would also
         ban the approval of another promising drug named mexotrexate which is currently being testing
         in clinical trials for pregnancy termination. This drug has already been approved for
         chemotherapy and is being widely used for that purpose. Clearly, the Coburn amendment would
         block the FDA from approving its use for medical abortion, including efforts to provide labeling
         for this use.

                 Third, the amendment would freeze research on other drugs which could lead to
         important treatments for a host of diseases benefiting both women and men. For example,
         researchers believe that RU-486 has potential for use in treating breast cancer, endometriosis,
         Cushing's Syndrome, AIDS, diabetes, brain tumors and glaucoma. It has the potential to help
         treat a wide range of conditions related to reproductive health, including uterine fibroids. The
         amendment could also have dangerous implications for the development of drugs that are used
         for purposes other than terminating a pregnancy, but which may cause miscarriages. Many
         drugs, including chemotheraphy and anti-ulcer medications, have the side effect of inducing
         abortion. While the proponents of the amendment argue that their intent is only to ban those
         drugs that have the primary purpose of causing abortions, the research community believes that
         the broad scope of the amendment could stifle research in these other important areas.
