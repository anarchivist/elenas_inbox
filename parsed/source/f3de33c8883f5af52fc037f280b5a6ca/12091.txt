TEXT:
ATSDR told BNA about their new standard (even though they are holding the
printed version, I'm told, til next Friday), BNA printed it yesterday, and
now we have environmental group press releases pointing out that a
bipartisan group of Senators (including Leahy, Jeffords, Wellstone Boxer)
asked earlier this month in a letter to Shalala that this be held and
we're ignoring them. The lead is: Clinton Administration ignoring
bipartisan congressional pleas, set to expose pregnant women and children
to "drastically weaker health standards for mercury." ATSDR is alleged to
be doing "downfield blocking for special interest groups."

Frankly, I had no idea this would cause a ruckus among anyone except us
good government bureaucrats, and I imagine the rhetoric may be
overinflated. Nevertheless, it appears that groups like the New England
Conference of Governors and others are directly involved in the mercury
level issue, so I think it's important to pursue this ASAP.

My initial take is that we have a strong case for convincing Sec. Shalala
that this is an issue that should get a review before ATSDR comes out with
the standard. Someone said this morning that she's in the Far East.

Thanks.
