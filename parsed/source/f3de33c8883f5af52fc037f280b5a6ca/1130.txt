TEXT:
Latest status: We, especially OMB, are considering whether to do HHS's
administrative fix to the bucket.  It is not the advocates' full fix, but
a 2-part regulatory fix HHS devised:  a temporary delay for everyone,
which will help all states with a bucket problem; and a new policy on how
states define "medically needy" Medicaid programs, which will permanently
help some states with a bucket problem. Between the 2 parts, it will fix
a decent portion of the bucket, but not all.   (I will try to get a sense 0
f how much.)

Nancy-Ann's first take is that Raines needs to decide whether HCFA must
come up with an offset to the $1.9 billion cost.   Ken and I have pointed
out that we fixed a lot of the bucket in our welfare legislative fix
package, in our proposal to exempt the disabled from SSI/Medicaid cuts.
So theoretically we have already paid for a lot of this, and we're just
transferring it from a legislative fix to an administrative fix.   OMB is
trying to scope out the overlap and numbers as they write a memo to
Raines.

I am assuming we would agree with HHS's approach.  I think we exhausted
the advocates' approach. And it will do good things for people and it's
fully or largely paid for.   I should note that it could take a bit of the
steam out of our legal immigrant fix package, since the most compelling
cases of legal immigrants in nursing homes would then be temporarily
addressed.  I think the only exception to that would be in states that
affirmatively decide not to extend Medicaid to legals, and I'm not sure
there are any such states at this time.
