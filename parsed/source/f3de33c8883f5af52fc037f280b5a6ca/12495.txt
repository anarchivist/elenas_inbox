                       No More Mr. Nice GuyClinton        should entertain
                       tougher regulations


                       I WOULD LIKE TO hail President Clinton's convocation
                       of an entertainment summit next week to chide the media
                       into showing more concern about what it is doing to
create
                       a cultural climate that is promoting violence. But I
can't.
                       We've been down this road before.

                       Basically, what the president is doing is calling the
media in and telling
                       them to be good. Don't do i t anymore, whatever it is.
And then he'll be
                       able to say he is doing something.

                       I still remember the excitement of the Great Violence
Summit of 1993 in
                       L.A.

                      That was a meeting of some         400 representatives of


broadcasting and
                      cable networks, production and syndication companies,
professors, social
                    scientists, producers, writers and lawmakers,
representing all sides of the
                    debate over TV shows and their possible link to
violence in society. It
                    was the Super Bowl of conferences and committee
meetings on the
                    subject.

                    The result of that glorious summit and all the
promises by broadcasting
                    and cable to do something about the problem was that
the incidence of
                    violence in programing, various scholarly studies
found, actually rose.

                      Now, I am quick to blame the media, and especially TV,
for everything.
                      But even I recognize the biggest problem we face today
in trying to
                      figure out Columbine isn't the media, but kids.

                      Whatever Freud and his followers say about psychosis
and neuroses, the
                      effect of parents and environment, a certain number of
kids are just plain
                      wacko.

                      Their brains are wired wrong. ·I don't think these kids
need the media to
                      tell them to be wacko.

                      And it's too easy for them to do wacko things. You can
have the strictest
                    gun control laws in the world, but it's too late to
keep guns out of their
                    hands.

                      That genie is out of the bottle. However, there are a
few issues the
                      president should be raising.

                    First, television, long before the Internet, was
telling the handful of wacko
                    kids how to do things. It started back in the 1970s,
when made-for-TV
                    movies began to be based on true-life stories. Instead
of two-hour films
                    about great teachers, social workers, humanitarians
who helped the sick
                    and poor, TV did movies about serial killers, stalkers
and hijackers,
                    showing step-by-step how they smuggled weapons onto
planes.

                      In each movie's wake, there were copycat incidents. TV
is an
                      instructional tool.   In the old days kids learned from


books, now they learn
                    from television.

                      News coverage of events has replaced the telefilm as
the educational
                      tool of choice.

                    The culture for violence is not reduced by the
overcoverage of stories
                    like the Littleton massacre. The low point had to be
when they actually
                    stuck the cameras right into the coffin of Isaiah
Shoels. Some of the
                    funerals went on for four hours, covered in their
entirety, it seemed, by
                    Fox News and CNN. It was ghoulish.

                     It's also the fault of people who can't stay off TV
anymore. It used to be
                     we got mad at the local newsmen who, after a shooting,
stuck a mike at
                     a guy who had been shot six times, and was asked "How
do you feel
                     about it?" A man who lost his family in a plane crash
or fire asked the
                     same question was within his rights to punch the
reporter in the face.
                     Now, survivors want to go on TV. One dead kid's family
even went on
                     the Leeza Gibbons show. Whatever happened to grieving
in privacy?
                     The cultural environment has certainly changed. You
say to the kids, Mr.

                      President, be nice. But they watch TV and see adults
on our so-called
                      discussion shows like "Crossfire" on CNN screaming at
each other. They
                      see people on "Jerry Springer" punching each other.
They go to the
                      movies and see wall-to-wall violence. They listen to
violent rock music.
                      They play violent video games and search the Internet
for the cheapest
                      bomb ingredients.

                      While the president is asking for soul-searching from
the various
                      industries that mayor may not be contributing to a
dangerous
                      environment, I would suggest he do some soul-searching
on behalf of the
                      government. I respectfully wish to point out that some
of these things
                      that I mentioned regarding broadcast and cable might
not be happening if
                      his predecessors weren't so eager to give away the
store 10 and 15
                    years ago. If the country still had regulations
regarding the proper use of


                       the public airwaves we would be able to regulate away
some of the
                       media silliness and excesses.

                       Speaking only for TV here,   it used to be that there
were rules and
                       standards.

                       Stations, for example, had to spend a certain amount
of time on public
                    affairs, to limit the number of commercials, in
general to be responsible to
                    the communi ties. Otherwise they were in danger of
losing their licenses.

                       That all went out of the window with Mark Fowler,
chairman of the
                       Federal Communications Commission in the Reagan
administration, who
                     began the gutting of sacred regulations. Today,
executives led by Mel
                     Karmazin of CBS are saying, Mr. president, that you
have to get rid of
                     all remaining regulations regarding station ownership
and responsibilities
                     -and let them do whatever they want for profit, like
cable does.

                       I don't know exactly know what you have in mind for
changing the
                       cultural climate next week. Perhaps you're planning to
make Geraldo
                       Rivera head of the FCC, for having supported you in
the Monica mess.
                       But I say we don't have enough regulations. We     no
longer can depend on
                    these media moguls who are only interested in
swallowing everything up.
                    Whatever you propose next week, they will be paying
lip service while
                    they laugh all the way to the bank with our money.

                       You are asking for social responsibility from a     group
of people with the
                       amount of social responsibility that can be put in the
navel of a gnat and
                       still have room left over for the NAB (National
Asssociation of
                       BroadcastE;!rs) code of ethics. Bring back our missing
regulations, Mr.
                       President.

                      And who knows? In 50 or 60 years,    it might have some
impact on a
                       future generation of wacko kids.   It's a   long shot,   but
it's better than
                       anything. else that may come out of the summit meeting.

                                             E-mail Marvin!
