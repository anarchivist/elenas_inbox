TEXT:
We just told HHS that we did not think we'd need Shalala to brief after
tomorrow's event.   I'm guessing we just want POTUS on camera and that Mike
will be able· to handle any questions regarding our position on the
legislation. Shalala (and/or you guys) would just end up doing the
sausage-making on the Hill, and Mike should probably do that.   That's my
sense right now, anyway.   Any thoughts?
