 TEXT:
 Seth Harris asked me to update you on California's draft guidance saying
 workfare jobs aren't subject to FLSA.  DOL has just been formally asked
 for an opinion on the draft by the assemblywoman who chairs a state-wide
 welfare advisory council, in preparation for a meeting tomorrow.  DOL will
 send a letter today saying the guidance is inconsistent with the law and
 asking more questions.  This mayor may not give the assemblywoman and her
 allies ammo to stop it.

 DOL is still not sure if this is the Governor's or the welfare
 department's initiative.

 Subject:         Action by California on FLSA and workfare

 Seth Harris says DOL hears from reliable sources that California plans to
 send guidance to welfare directors next week that people in work
 experience are not covered by FLSA.    Here's DOL's plan to deal with it.

 1. DOL will call the state now, saying in a neutral way that they hear
 guidance is being prepared, and offer to help in their interpretation,
 with a followup letter saying the same thing.

 2. Then they expect to get within a few days a formal request from a
 Democratic state legislator asking for a formal opinion on the guidance.
 DOL will respond to that by saying the guidance appears to be inconsistent
 with DOL's guidance, that the state is wrong to make categorical judgments
 about the status of work experience participants, but that they need to
 learn more.

 3.  If this doesn't stop the state from issuing the guidance, advocates
 will find a plaintiff and bring suit in federal court.   IAn alternative
 would be for the advocates to ask DOL's Wage and Hour Division to take
 enforcement action, but Seth thinks they'll bring suit.)   If that happens,
 DOL would then like to file an amicus brief in the case. That won't
 happen for a few weeks at the earliest.

 Let me know if you have a concern about DOL's plan of action or would like
 to discuss further.
