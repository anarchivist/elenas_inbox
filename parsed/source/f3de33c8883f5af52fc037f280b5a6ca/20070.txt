If you want a weekly item on tobacco farmers. ( We could also mention
McConnell's surpise move to support Lugar and that Baesler is using the
issue effectively to put Bunning on the defensive.) ==================== ATTACHMENT

       Status of Provision Involving Tobacco Farmers


       The Senate has not yet voted on provisions that deal with tobacco fanners but may do so this
       week. The legislation the Commerce Committee voted out included Senator Ford's provision
       which you supported during your trip to Kentucky last month. However, Majority Leader Lott
       also added Senator Lugar's competing provision to the McCain measure when the legislation
       reached the floor. The Lugar provision would buy-out all farmers from the quota program
       within 3 years at a cost of $18 billion, eliminating the government program and creating a free
       market in tobacco in its place. As you recall, Senator Ford's measure preserves the program and
       gives fanners the option of being bought out, at a total cost of $28.5 billion spread over 25 years.
        USDA calculates that the Lugar free market approach would lead to dramatic increases in the
       amount of tobacco grown in the U.S., and a reduction in the cost of tobacco for companies. The
       Washington Post carried the USDA figures, including the calculation that the companies will
       save $800 million a year or $20 billion over the next 25 years if Lugar becomes law. In
       addition, OMB estimates that the Lugar provision's funding needs would necessitate a 69% cut
       in the research and other public health programs such as cessation, education and prevention
       called for in the McCain legislation. Anned with these numbers, public health groups like the
       Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids have lobbied the Senate for the Ford measure. Procedurally,
       the next move is for both Ford and Lugar to try and strike the other's measure from the bill.
       Along with USDA, V{e will continue to work with Senators Ford, Robb and Hollings for their
       fanners provision and simultaneously seek to fashion a compromise that might gamer significant
       Republican support.
