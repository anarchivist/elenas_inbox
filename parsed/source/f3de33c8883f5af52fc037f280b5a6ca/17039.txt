Subj:          Event Ideas


You had suggested that we should make as many announcements as possible out of the rollout of
the $3 billion grants. Here are some possible ideas for these and other possible welfare events,
including the October 1st child support idea you mentioned this morning which I am starting to
work on.

Christa tells me the October 31st eyent in Florida is planned as a return to the school the
President skipped when he hurt his knee. However, she suggests we do a scheduling memo
ASAP if we want to anything around that time. She is also checking into the October 1 and
November 15th dates.
