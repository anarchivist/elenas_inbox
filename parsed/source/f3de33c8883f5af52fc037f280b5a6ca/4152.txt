TEXT:
Elena: I realize that, but usually there are opportunities to circulate
drafts for input by offices that have a direct stake in an issue before it
gets to the staff secretary.  I tried to get a copy from the staff
secretary office, and they told me to get a copy from you.  I sent an
email request to Mike and haven't received a response yet.   Your help
would be very appreciated. Thanks, Cliff
