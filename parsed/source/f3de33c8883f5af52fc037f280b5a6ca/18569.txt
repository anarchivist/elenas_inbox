A BILL

To prohibit any attempt to create a human being using somatic cell nuclear transfer, to provide
for further review of the ethical and scientific issues associated with the use of somatic cell
nuclear transfer in human beings, and for other purposes.

Thc phrasc "attempt to create a human being" could be interpreted bv ccrtain tactions as an
attempt to create an embryo. although this distinction is cleared up in the prohibitions section.

SECTION 1. Short Title

This Act may be cited as the "Prohibition on Cloning of Human Beings Act of 1998".

This title is succinct and accurate, unlike the titles of other bills. such as the "Human Cloning
Prohibition Act"" which could imply prohibition of inadvertent twinning of some infertility
treatments.

SEC. 2. Findings

This section accurately recounts the lindings of the NBAC on cloning.

SEC. 3. Purposes.

It is the purpose of this Act to-
         (1) prohibit any attempt to create a human being using somatic cell nuclear transfer
cloning; and
         (2) provide for further review of the ethical and scientific issues associated with the use of
somatic cell nuclear transfer in humans.

Once again. the phrase "'attempt to create a human being" could be interpreted bv certain factions
as an attempt to create an embryo.

SEC. 4. Definitions.

In this Act:
         (1) Cloning- the production ofa precise genetic copy ofa molecule (including DNA),
cell, tissue, plant, animal or human.

Some scientists might argue that cloning is 110t a "precise" genetic copy, due to the invariable
mistakes made in replicating DNA, and some would argue that a human is an animal. but this
definition docs not pose any negative implications for research.




                                                                  Automated Records Management Systerr
                                                                          Hex.Dump Conversion
                                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion
        (2) Nucleus- the cell structure that houses the chromosomes, and thus the genes.

Accurate for thc pUl])oses of this Act, but thcre are genes outside of thc nucleus (mitochondrial
gencs.)

       (3) Oocyte-the female germ cell, the egg.

Would this ddinition include immature oocytes? If it did not. this could possibly allow somatic
eell nuclear transfer to create a human being to take placc with an immature oocyte.

       (4) Somatic cell-a mature, diploid cell.

Not entircly clear what "mature" means. Ifit means "differentiated" this would allow somatic
cellnuclcar transfer to create a human being using an undifferentiated embrvo cell, which could
allow for treatment of inferti Ii tv due to mitochondrial diseascs.

        (5) Somatic cell nuclear transfer-transferring the nucleus of a somatic cell of an existing
or previously existing human child or adult into an oocyte from which the nucleus has been
removed.

  This language could allow (if one does not consider an embryo an existing human child) the
usc of this technology to trcat infcrtility duc to mitochondrial defccts. Perhaps a small point of
semantics, but docs "transferring the nucleus of a somatic cell" includc the fusion of a somatic
cell with an oocyte? This is how Dolly was crelltcd. Perhaps could clarify 12l' adding "or fusion
of a somatic cell with an oocytc fi'om which the nucleus .....

SEC. 5. Prohibition.

It shall be unlawful for any person or other legal entity, public or private, to implant or attempt to
implant the product of somatic cell nuclear transfer into a woman's uterus.

This prohibition clearly states the scicntific·intent ofthc Icgislation, and avoids the question of
when life begins or what "creating a human being" really mcans. It also c1eat'lv prohibits an act
or an attempt at action, which is easy to assess, rather than an "intent" to act. This would protcct
researchcrs and others from being second-guessed abo lit their intentions. This would allow the
priv,lte sector to usc somatic ecll nuclear transfer technology to dcvelop therapeutic cell lines
tor the treatment of many disorders via tissue transplantation. Iflhe definition of somatic cell is
interprcted as a differentiated diploid cell, and if"existing human child" is not interpreted to
include an emblYo. this would also allow the use of this technology to treat infertility due to
mitochondrial diseases. One possible concern is that this would not prohibit attempts to implant
such a product to an animal's utcrus.

SEC. 6. Protected Biomedical Research.

Nothing in this Act shall be construed to restrict areas of biomedical and agricultural research or
                                                                              Hex-l)ump Conversion

practice not expressly prohibited in this Act, including research or practices that involve-
        (1) the use of somatic cell nuclear transfer or other cloning technologies to clon.e
molecules, DNA, cells, and tissues; or
        (2) the use of somatic cell nuclear transfer techniques to create animals.

The inclusion orthe phrase "or practices" protects activities such as animal husbandlY or IVF
that may not be considered research. Allowing the usc of this technologv "to clone molecules.
DNA, cells. and tissues" would allow the private sector to pursue this technology to develop
therapeutic tissues as mentioned above. Allowing the usc of this technology to create animals
will allow the continuation of a thriving reseurch base in animal husbandry and transgenic
animals for the production of therapeutic products and animal models. However, as mentioned
previously, one could argue that a human being is un animal.

SEC. 7. Penalties.
        (a) In General-Any person who intentionally violates the provision of section 5 shall be
fined the greater of $250,000 or 2 times the gross pecuniary gain or loss resulting from the
violation.
        (b) Civil Actions-If a person is violating or about to violate the provisions of section 5,
the Attorney General may commence a civil action in an appropriate Federal district court to
enjoin such violation.
        (c) Forfeiture-any property, real or personal, derived from or used to commit a violation
or attempted violation of the provisions of section 5, or any property traceable to such property,
shall be subject to forfeiture to the United States in accordance with the procedures set forth in
chapter 46 of title 18, U.S. Code.
        (D) Authority-The Attorney General shall have exclusive, nondelegable enforcement
authority under this Act.
        (E) Advisory Opinions-The Attorney General shall, upon request, render binding
advisory opinions regarding the'scope, applicability, interpretation, and enforcement of this Act
with regard to specific research projects or practices.

This section uses phrases such as "attempted violation." Thc prohibition already includes the
attempt to implant the product to a uterus. Would this then allow civil actions or forfeitures of
"attempts at attempts" and \vould this lead to the difficult question ofintcntions on a researchcr's
part?

SEC. 8. Cooperation with Foreign Countries.
       It is the sense of Congress that the President should cooperate with foreign countries to
enforce mutually supported restrictions on the activities prohibited under section 5.

SEC. 9. National Bioethics Advisory Commission Report.

      Not later than 4 Y2 years after the date of enactment of this Act, the National Bioethics
Advisory Commission shall prepare and submit to the President a report conceming-
      (1) the state of the science of somatic cell nuclear transfer;
      (2) the ethical and social issues associated with the potential use of this technology in
                                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion
humans; and
      (3) the advisability of continuing the prohibition established in the Act.

       The Commission is authorized to continue for the 1O-year period described in section 12
to prepare such a report and for other purposed as established in Executive order 122975 and
subsequent amendments to such Order.

Suggest adding provisions for additional review by NBAC aller the initial repolt, pillticularly
since the first report may still find insuftleient scientific evidence of safety. Language could
state "Not later than 4 Y:, vears aller the date of enactment of this Act, and at intervals nner that
as necessary, ... " Perhaps could broaden the nature of the report to include the state of the
science of cell and tissue therapies to fUlther investigate the potential for this teehnologv.
"Executive order 122975" may include a tvpo-NBAC's Website states the EO number as 12975.

SEC. 10. Right of Action.

Nothing in this Act shall be construed to give any individual or person a private right of action.

SEC. 11. Preemption of State Law.

        The provisions of this Act shall preempt any state law which prohibits or limits research
or practices regarding somatic cell nuclear transfer, human cloning, cloning of molecules, DNA,
cells, or tissues, the use of somatic cell nuclear transfer techniques to develop animals, or related
research.

This would prohibit poorly written State laws from prohibiting the cloning of DNA. eells or
tissues (as a recent Florida bill would have done) or from prohibiting the private sector from
investigating this technology f()[' the development of therapeutic tissues or cells.

SEC. 12. Effective Date.

        This Act shall be effective for the 10 year period beginning on the date of enactment of
this Act. The prohibitions contained in this Act shall terminate at the expiration of such 1O-year
period.
