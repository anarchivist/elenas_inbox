Subject:         Senior Staff Coverage for Columbus Day

The Chief of Staff has requested information for the upcoming Federal
Holiday, Columbus Day, Monday, October 12, 1998.  I will be collecting
in-office and on-call coverage information for Assistants to the
President and Deputy Assistants to the President.  We will be submitting
this information to the Chief of Staff on Friday, October 9. This
information will need to be forwarded to me by Thursday, October 8 at
noon.

Please remind any staff members who plan to take off time for the holiday
that they are required to take annual leave for those days that are not
the federal holiday.

Remember to provide WHCA Signal Switchboard and the Operator with
contacting phone numbers.

Thank you.
