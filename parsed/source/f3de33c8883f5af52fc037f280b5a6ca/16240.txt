TEXT:
Kim is still travelling with the First Lady, so I will be Ellen's
temporary assistant until the end of this week.

There will be a Women's Meeting this week on Thursday at 9am in Room 100.
(Celinda Lake has had to postpone her presentation, but we will be meeting
as usual.)  Please let me know if you will be able to attend.

Thanks,

Michael
