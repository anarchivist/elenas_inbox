TEXT:
I have not heard back from Emily regarding the Indian Gaming/NGA letter.
But, I did receive about 11 letters from tribal leaders regarding the
Indian Gaming Regulatory Act/Narragansett support. What should I do with
these? Should I still be sending these types of letters to Interior with
a cover letter from Director of Correspondence Jim Dorskind?

Thanks for your help.
