','   ,-

      OLA has indicated we need to get a letter to the Senate by tomorrow
      expressing our views on the newest version of the Child Custody Protection
      Act. ( The latest version exempts parents but otherwise does not meet our
      objections. )

      Attached is a draft letter for your review.

       I will be also asking DOJ to redraft their letter to reflect the changes
       in the legislation.

         The Administration has made clear that changes must be made in S. 1645 in order to
ensure that the legislation is appropriately tailored to achieve its stated goals. Unfortunately,
although S. 1645 has been revised to exclude parents from potential liability, the bill has not been
amended to meet the other critical concerns raised by the Administration. Accordingly, the
Administration strongly opposes S. 1645 as drafted.

        Specifically, S. 1645 must first be amended to exclude close family members from
criminal and civil liability. Under the legislation, grandmothers, aunts, and minor and adult
siblings could face criminal prosecution for coming to the aid of a relative in distress. Imposing
criminal and civil sanctions on family members for helping their relatives, however, would not
promote healthy family communications. SUbjecting family members to criminal or civil
sanction, moreover, would further isolate the minor by discouraging her from seeking advice
and counsel from those closest to her. Finally, creating a civil action that permits family
members to sue each other when a minor within that family has an abortion would not foster
strong families.

       Second, S. 1645 must be amended to ensure that persons who only provide information,
counseling, referral, or medical services to the minor cannot be subject to liability. Exposing
such persons to the threat of criminal or civil sanctions would not further the interests of
promoting family communication, would not deter those who would inappropriately transport
minors across state lines to obtain abortions, and would provide an unintended basis for
vexatious litigation against individuals and organizations.

        Finally, S. 1645 must be amended to address constitutional infirmities that the
Department of Justice has identified in particular provisions of the legislation. The Department
will forward these and practical law enforcement concerns in a separate letter.

        The Administration is concerned that S. 1645, as written, raises novel and important
federalism issues, including the rights of states to regulate matters within their own boundaries.
The Administration believes, however, that legislation that addresses the concerns noted above,
and that is carefully targeted at punishing non-relatives who transport minors across state lines
for the purposes of avoiding parental involvement requirements, would mitigate the federalism
concerns.
