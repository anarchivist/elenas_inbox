                           n.R. 1218 - Child Custody Protection Act
                         (Rep. Ros-Lehtinen (R) FL and 129 cosponsors)

The Administration strongly opposes enactment ofH.R. 1218 in its current form. If a bill is
presented to the President that fails to address the concerns that are described below, the
President's senior advisers would recommend that he veto it.

During Congressional consideration of almost identical bills during the 105 th Congress, the
Administration, in Statements of Administration Policy and in letters from former White House
Chief-of-StaffErskine Bowles to the House and Senate Committees on the Judiciary, stated that
it would support properly crafted legislation that would make it illegal to transport minors across
state lines for the purpose of avoiding parental involvement requirements. Unfortunately, H.R.
1218, as reported by the House Committee on the Judiciary, also fails to address a number of the
critical concerns raised by the Administration. Specifically, the bill must be amended to:

       Exclude close family members from criminal and civil liability. Under the legislation,
       grandmothers, aunts, and minor and adult siblings could face criminal prosecution for
       coming to the aid of a relative in distress.

       Ensure that persons who only provide information, counseling, referral, or medical
       services to the minor cannot be subject to liability.

       Address constitutional and other legal infirmities that the Department of Justice has
       identified in particular provisions of the legislation. These concerns were transmitted to
       the House Committee on the judiciary on June 24, 1998, and again on June 15, 1999.

The Administration continues to be concerned that H.R. 1218 raises important federalism issues,
including the rights of States to regulate matters within their own boundaries. The
Administration believes, however, that legislation that addresses the concerns noted above, and
that is carefully targeted at punishing non-relatives who transport minors across State lines for
the purpose of avoiding parental involvement requirements, would mitigate the federalism and
the Administration's other concerns.

Pay-As-You-Go Scoring

H.R. 1218 could affect both direct spending and receipts; therefore, it is subject to the
pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. OMB's
preliminary scoring estimate of this bill is that it would have a net effect ofless than $500,000.

                                         **********
                (Do Not Distribute Outside Executive Office of the President)
                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion


This Statement of Administration Policy was developed by the Legislative Reference Division
(Pellicci) in consultation with HD ( ), TCJS ( ), EIML ( ), BASD ( ), and the White
House Offices of Policy Development ( ), Legislative Affairs ( ), and the General Counsel (
  ) . The Department of Justice       ( ) and Health and Human Services ( )

OMB/LA Clearance: _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ __

The proposed position is consistent with that taken on June 15, 1999, in a letter from the Justice
Department to the House Committee on the JUdiciary. It also is consistent with SAPs and
letters from former Chief-of-StaffBowles to the House and Senate Committees on the Judiciary
on almost identical bills in the 10Sth Congress.

 Last year's bill (H.R. 3682) passed the House by a vote of 276-150, but the Senate was
unable to invoke cloture on its version of the measure (S. 1645), and no further action was
taken.

H.R. 1218 was ordered reported by the House Committee on the Judiciary by a vote of 16-13
along party lines on June 23, 1999.

Summary ofH.R. 1218

As ordered reported, H.R. 1218 would make it illegal for anyone -- other than the girl's parent or
guardian -- to knowingly transport a minor across a State line to obtain an abortion in cases in
which the minor has not satisfied her home State's laws regarding "parental involvement" (i.e.,
laws requiring parental consent or notification). H.R. 1218 would subject individuals violating
the bill's provisions to civil and criminal penalties, including the possibility of imprisonment for
up to.one year. The bill would allow an out-of-State abortion without parental notification if the
abortion was necessary to save the minor's life.

H.R. 1218 would make it an affirmative defense to prosecution under the bill that the defendant
reasonably believed that before the individual obtained the abortion, parental consent or
notification or judicial authorization that would have been required had the abortion been
performed in the State where the individual resides, took place. In addition, under the bill any·
parent or guardian who is effected from the violation of a parental notification law would be
allowed to seek civil action for damages.

Currently, 22 States require parental consent for a minor to terminate her pregnancy while
17 States have opted for the lesser requirement of parent.al notification. Eleven States have no
parental involvement requirements.

Pay-As-You-Go Scoring

According to BASD ( ), H.R. 1218 could affect direct spending and receipts; therefore, the bill
is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990.
                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion


Individuals prosecuted and convicted under H.R. 1218 could be subj ect to criminal fines.
Collections of such fines are governmental receipts, which are deposited in the Crime Victims
Fund and spent in the following year. OMB estimates that the scoring estimate of this bill is that
it would have a net effect of less than $500,000.
