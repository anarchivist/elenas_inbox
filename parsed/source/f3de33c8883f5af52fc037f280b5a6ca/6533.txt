     PRESIDENT CLINTON ANNOUNCES INTRODUCTION OF SENATE FOOD
       SAFETY LEGISLATION AND REPORT TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF
           IMPORTED AND DOMESTIC FRUITS AND VEGETABLES
                            March 4, 1998

       Today President Clinton will announce the introduction of legislation by Senators
Milkulski and Kennedy to ensure the safety of all imported foods, including fruits and
vegetables. This legislation will enhance Food and Drug Administration's authority to prevent
the imports offruits, vegetables and other food products which do not meet U.S. food safety
requirements. This legislation was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives by Reps.
Eshoo and Pallone. This legislation is part of the President's food safety initiative that was
announced last October. The President also will announce the release of a report that provides a
blueprint on how the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Department of
Agriculture (USDA) will work cooperiitively with the agricultural community to develop
guidance on good agricultural and manufacturing practices for fruits and vegetables.

Enhanced FDA Oversight for Imported Foods. The food safety legislation to be introduced
today in the Senate will provide greater assurance that imported fopds meet U.S. food safety
requirements or achieve the same level of protection required for comparable domestic products.
The legislation also will permit the FDA to consider halting imports from countries or facilities
that do not allow FDA inspections to occur. This legislation gives FDA authority that is
comparable to USDA's existing authority to prevent the importation of unsafe meat and poultry.
The President has already committed to providing approximately $25 million in his Fiscal Year
1999 budget to enable the FDA to dramatically expand its international food safety capabilities.
This legislation is part of a broader Administration initiative to enhance the safety of our
Nation's food supply.

Development of Guidance on Good Agricultural and Manufacturing Practices. The
President will announce the release of a report that provides a roadmap for the Secretary of
Health and Human Services, in partnership with the Secretary of Agriculture and in cooperation
with the agricultural community, to develop guidance on good agricultural and manufacturing
practices. This report outlines the progress made to develop the voluntary guidance for the
growing, processing, shipping, and marketing offruits and vegetables and the time lines leading
to the final publication of the guidance in October 1998. The guidance -- the first-ever specific
safety standards for fruits and vegetables -- will address potential food safety problems
throughout the production and distribution system and help ensure the sanitation and safety
practices of all those seeking to sell produce in the U.S. market. The report also provides both
short- and long-term plans for technical assistance, education, and outreach activities to support
the appropriate application of the guidance.
