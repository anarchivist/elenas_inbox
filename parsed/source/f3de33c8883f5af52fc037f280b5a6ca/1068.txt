TEXT:
The attached agenda for today's 12:30pm interagency meeting is not for
distribution, but rather to guide our discussion of three general issue
areas, as we discussed.

We think you can open the meeting by saying that you know the departments
are working on their responses to the Exec. Memorandum (which we will
distribute) and that they also are working on the interim memos of ideas
and proposals you had asked for in our first meeting (Jeanine, I believe,
had asked for by Wednesday but to my knowledge has not received any) .

You can say that the purpose of this meeting is to have an informal
discussion on three issue areas about which the President and HRC feel
strongly and which we hope will be a part .of the discussions at the
Conference. As the attached agenda lays out, those three areas are:
--child care (issues of health, safety, quality)
--supporting parents
--health issues (beyond or expandin on current leg proposals) .

We can also, if you'd like, give an oral overview of the layout of the
Conference and solicit ideas and advice==================== ATTACHMENT      1 =========
