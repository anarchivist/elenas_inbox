TEXT:
Rep. Levin asked us for talking points to help him persuade less
enthusiastic members of his subcommittee, like Matsui and Stark, that the
welfare portions of the budget agreement were a "win" and worthy of
support. Cynthia notes that such a document would also be helpful here --
for example, in Erskine's meeting later this week with the House
Progressive Caucus.

Attached is an attempt. This version really shies away from taking credit
for the Administration, since that is what Levin wants -- maybe too much.
I would add us back in for any version we use.

Please let me know your comments.

                           Welfare Provisions of Budget Agreement:
                           A Significant Advance for Work, Fairness

A Major Victory on Welfare to Work
The recently announced budget agreement is a major victory for those who believe that the
Federal government should do more to assure that those on welfare have the opportunity to
make the transition to work.

·      The budget agreement includes two critical welfare to work initiatives. The first is
       a $3 billion Welfare to Work fund for cities and states to create jobs and provide
       incentives for employment. This proposal will help move one million adults from
       welfare to work. The second is a tax credit to encourage companies to hire and
       retain long-term welfare recipients. The budget agreement provides all of the
       funds the Administration was seeking in this area.

·      Combined with the extra block grant funds that are becoming available to states as
       caseloads drop, this will afford us an unprecedented opportunity to move people
       from welfare to work.

A Major Victory on Benefits for Legal Immigrants
The budget agreement is a significant victory for those who opposed the welfare law's harsh·
provisions on legal immigrants -- provisions that punish children and legal immigrants with
severe disabilities, and burden State and local governments. These provisions had nothing to do
with the real goal of welfare reform, which is to move people from welfare to work.

·      The budget agreement restores SSI and Medicaid eligibility for disabled legal ihlmigrants
       who entered the U.S. prior to August 1996.

·      After months when the Congressional leadership argued that any change
       constituted "reopening" the welfare law and refused to consider it, this is a great
       turnaround. Although many wish that the budget agreement went further, this $9.7
       billion restoration is a very significant change in the welfare law, especially given that it
       comes as part of an agreement to balance the budget.

A Major Victory on Food Stamp Work Requirement
Liming food stamps to three months in three years for non-disabled unemployed childless
adults was inherently unfair because it did not provide any additional opportunities for
work.

·      The budget agreement provides $750 million to create additional work slots for this
       group. It also lets states exempt 15% of individuals who would lose benefits
       because of the time limits.

·      This last-minute victory in the budget negotiations will help ensure that those
       willing to work keep their food stamps.
