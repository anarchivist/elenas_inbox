TEXT:
The cloning meeting    is shaping up nicely. Are you planning to attend?·
Given the extensive    cast of characters, I think it would be well if you
could at least open    the meeting.   Other wise, Jerry and I will manage.
There does not seem    to be much action on cloning on the Hill. Although
Armey had asked for    a bill by Easter, I just heard that they have not made
much progress.  The    Senate also does not seem anxious to move on a bill.
Obviously, industry    would be happier without a bill.
