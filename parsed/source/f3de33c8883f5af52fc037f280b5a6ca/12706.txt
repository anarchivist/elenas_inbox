earlier)

DRAFT Language for Signing Statement

I am extremely disappointed that the Congress forfeited the federal
governmentD,s claim to the $246 billion tobacco settlement, without any
commitment from the states to use a portion of the settlement funds to
prevent youth smoking. Despite the fact that 3,000 young people become
regular smokers every day and 1,000 will have their lives cut short as a
result, most states still have no programs in place to reduce youth
smoking. Congress passed up an important opportunity to protect our
children from the death and diseases caused by tobacco. This is wrong.    I
will continue to do everything in my power to ensure tobacco settlement
funds are used to reduce youth smoking and promote public health and will
closely monitor state efforts in this area.
