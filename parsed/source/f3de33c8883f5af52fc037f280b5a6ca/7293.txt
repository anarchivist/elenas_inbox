  TEXT:
  Elena:
  I met with Congo Maloney and a staff person from Congo Baker (R-LA) on
  Thursday to discuss HR 3637, which as Congo Maloney wrote the President in
  March would create a secondary mortgage marketing for child care
  facilities and offer guaranty insurance for those who lend to child care
  facilities.  In addition it contains a section with micro loans for child
  care facility improvements as well as offer liability insurance to child
  care providers. The bill with its broad ideological spectrum of support an
  d its market focused approach to expanding child care availability would
  seem to have some appeal. Can you tell me if we are looking at it and how
  we think it might fit within the President's child care initiatives?
  It also carries a $10M price tag which would require some budget tradeoffs
  as well.
