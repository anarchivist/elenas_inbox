Here are nine things we could announce at State of the Union/Blair/Chamber
of Commerce.
The only tentative one is #6 (1-800 number for employers to call re: EITC)
-- Treasury is planning such a number but its unclear whether it will be
ready in time.

                                 Welfare Reform Announcements



    1.   Anounce that we've met the goal -- two years ahead of schedule -- to move two million
         more Americans off of welfare by the year 2000 (goal set by President in last year's State
         of the Union).

    2.   Announce that welfare caseload have fallen below 10 million for the first time since 1970
         and release state by state numbers.

    3.   Announce President's new plan to provide 50,000 vouchers to families who need new
         housing in order to move from welfare to work.

    4.   Announce a nationwide competition to reward state efforts to reduce out of wedlock
         births -- distributing $100 million a year to five states with the largest reduction.

    5.   Announce a nationwide welfare to work competition, distributing $1 billion in high
         performance bonuses to states that do the best job of placing people into jobs and helping
         them succeed in the work place.

    6.   Announce a new 1-800 number for employers to get help with the Earned Income Tax
         Credit, so to help companies retain employees and give them a raise in every pay check.

    7.   Announce the first state and local welfare to work grants, created in the Balanced Budget
         Act to fund welfare to work efforts in high poverty areas (GA, IL, KS, LA, MI, NE, NV,
         Sc).

    8.   Announce that 3,000 companies have pledged to hire welfare recipients, and challenge
         the Welfare to Work Partnership to grow to 10,000 in the next year.

    9.   Call for new penalties for states that have not put in place systems to collect child support
         from deadbeat parents.
