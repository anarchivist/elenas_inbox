TEXT:
Maria has asked about a recent 9th circuit case (Magana-Pizano v. INS)
that the advocates think could be a basis to challenge the INS's
interpretation of the removal of federal jurisdiction from the late
amnesty cases (in Section 377 of the I996 Act).   I found the case (and an
earlier one from the 1st circuit) and forwarded them to Rob Weiner.
According to Rob, he has been in contact with DOJ about this.   Maria has
asked me to look at the case also and give her my read.
