TEXT:
According to figures released today by the University of California
System, based on Statement of Intent to Register responses from admitted
students, all UC campuses show slight increases in the percentage of
underrepresented minority students (i.e., African American, Hispanic, and
American Indian students) who accepted their offers of admission for Fall
1998.  In other words, the concern that those minority students admitted
to UC institutions would choose not to enroll because they would not feel
welcome did not materialize.

However, the actual numbers of underrepresented minorities at the most
selective UC campuses (e.g., Berkeley and UCLA) show significant declines
from last year.

For example, the 1998 freshman class at Berkeley is predicted to include
14 American Indian students (down from 24 in 1997), 98 African American
students (down from 260 in 1997), 185 Chicano students (down from 411 in
1997), and 79 Latino students (down from 81 in 1997): Meanwhile, Berkeley
is expecting an increase in the number of Asian American freshman in 1998
to 1,527 (up from 1,478 in 1997) and in white students to 1,131 ( up from
1,095 in 1997).   In sum, the percentage of underrepresented minorities in
the freshman class at Berkeley is expected to fall from 21.4% to 10.4%.    I
will prepare a more complete analysis shortly.   Please let me know if you
have any immediate questions.
