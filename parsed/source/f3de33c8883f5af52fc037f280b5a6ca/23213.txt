                                      MEDICARE


Q:   When is the President going to unveil the Medicare reform plan that he said
     yesterday he would submit to Congress?

A:   The President is determined to work with the Congress in a bipartisan way to enact
     Medicare reform legislation this year. While he has not decided on a specific date
     for sUbmitting his proposal, he will send it to Capitol Hill early enough to ensure
     that the Congress has the opportunity to pass it this, year.

Q:   What will be in this proposal?

A:   The President has been very consistent about the principles he believes must guide
     any Medicare reform legislation this year. His own proposal will certainly follow
     these principles:

     A) It will include a provision to dedicate surplus dollars to the program. This will:

            1) strengthen the program's financing and extend the life of the trust fund;
     and

            2) prevent excessive increases in out-of-pocket costs for beneficiaries or
            excessive reductions in payments to providers.

     B) It will include a meaningful prescription drug benefit.

     C) It will include a number of provisions to modernize the program and make it
     more competitive.

     We won't have further details for you until the President unveils his proposal.

Q:   You've indicated that the President wants to modernize the program and make it
     more competitive. Does that mean that his proposal will include a premium support
     mechanism?

A:   The President believes that the premium support mechanism in Senator Breaux's
     proposal was deficient because it had the potential to lead to excessive premium
     increases in the traditional fee-for-service program. The President is committed to
     introducing greater competition into the Medicare program, but his proposal will do
     this without imposing significant cost barriers to beneficiaries wishing to remain in
     the fee-for-service program.

Q:   Senator Kerrey, a Democrat who voted for the Commission's recommendations, was
      critical of the President'S insistence on the use of the surplus. He also disagreed
     with the President's concerns about increasing the age of eligibility to 67. How do
                       Hex-Dump Conversion

     you respond?

A:   We clearly disagree with Senator Kerrey on these issues.

     First, on the issue of the surplus, every independent Medicare expert has recognized
     that the program needs additional revenues to ensure the long-term financial health
     of ~he program: the only alternatives to new revenues are excessive cuts in benefits
     or provider reimbursements. And using the surplus is a far better way to obtain
     additional revenues than increasing the payroll tax.

     As to the eligibility age issue, the President opposes raising the age to 67 without a
     viable policy to prevent the number of uninsured from increasing. There are now
     over 3 million uninsured people just between the ages of 55 and 65: they are the most
     rapidly growing group of the uninsured. Without Medicare or some accessible,
     affordable alternative, many 65 to 67 year-aIds would be uninsured as well.


Q:   Last night, a number of the members of the Commission complained that the
     President preempted the Commission's vote by making a statement before their
     final vote. How do you respond?

A:   The President made his statement after Senator Breaux and Congressman Thomas had
     made public remarks on what the Commission would do. The President wanted to
     respond to the Breaux-Thomas proposal as soon as it was final. He was in no way
     expressing disrespect for the Commission's work; to the contrary, he believes that the
     Commission performed a very valuable service, which he will attempt to build on.
