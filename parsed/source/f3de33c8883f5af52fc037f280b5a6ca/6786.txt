Question:   The Administration has pointed to the decline in welfare caseloads as a sign
            that welfare reform is working, yet a story in today's Washington Post says
            one of the main reasons people are leaving the rolls is that they are being
            sanctioned. Do you consider this a success?

Answer:     The rise in sanctions is a significant trend and one that deserves close attention.
            While national infolmation is still very preliminary, we are aware of evidence in
            specific states about the increased use of sanctions. One of the principles of the
            welfare reform law enacted in August 1996 is personal responsibility.
            Establishing fair, firm and credible consequences if people fail to follow the rules
            is an important part of the new approach. Certainly we would prefer that people
            leave the rolls to go to work, but in some cases, sanctioning may be a step along
            the way.

            It is also important to look at what happens to people who are sanctioned.
            Sanctioning is a complex issue with significant variation among state policies.
            Some states cut off the entire welfare grant whereas others only reduce the adult
            portion of the grant. Some states reduce or eliminate the entire grant immediately
            whereas others have a series of progressively tougher steps geared to encourage
            people to come into compliance. Different individuals react differently to
            sanctions. Data from several state studies finds that after being sanctioned, about
            half the people are working and approximately 40 percent have an increase in
            their income. Several states also found that one-quarter to one-third of those
            sanctioned returned to the rolls, presumably after complying with the
            requirements.

            Information compiled by HHS for the period October 1996 through June 1997
            shows that, nationwide, 38% of cases were reported by states as closed for failure
            to comply with procedural requirements. The percentage varies widely among
            states. This is based on old AFDC reporting systems--it does not yet reflect state
            reporting under the new T ANF data collection system, which is still being
            compiled by HHS. It is worth noting that while we do hear anecdotally and on a
            state specific basis that the rate of sanctioning has increased, this particular
            statistic does not depart much from the past. According to HHS, the comparable
            figures in 1993 and 1995 were 32% and 33% respectively.


Question:   The Post article cited a women in Tennessee who was sanctioned even though
            she had back problems. What is federal policy for people with such health
            problems?

            It is difficult to respond to the circumstances of a particular individual without
            knowing all the facts. Federal law requires states to sanction individuals who fail
            to comply with certain welfare reform requirements, but also gives states
                considerable flexibility in how they administer such sanctions. According to a
                recent survey by the American Public Welfare Association, most states waive
                sanctions when a person has good cause for not complying, with disability,
                incapacity or illness the most frequently cited reason for good cause (by 31 states).
                 In addition, the federal SSI program is designed to assist low income individuals
                with disabilities that prevent them from working.


    Question:   Today's New York Times cites evidence in New York that only one-third of
                those leaving the rolls are actually working. Are you disappointed by these
                results?

    Answer:     This initial information from New York appears to differ somewhat from
                several other states who have done follow up studies. A number of other'
                states have found that between 50% and 60% of those leaving the rolls were
                working. We believe it is very important to increase the number of people
                leaving welfare for work. That is why HHS recently released formal guidance
                on the High Performance Bonus that will award $200 million a year to the states
                who have the most success in placing people in jobs and ensuring that welfare
                recipients succeed injobs once they get them, by remaining employed and seeing
                their earnings climb over time.

                [NOTE: New York state staff say they have not completed a surveyor a
                study and that the data referenced in the NY Times article is preliminary and
                incomplete.]
