TEXT:
Ed Lorenzen says the Texas and the Republicans have officially pulled the
plug on Texas. He would like to spin it that Texas and the Republican
leadership pulled the plug without approaching us about any specific
concerns, and that the White House was willing to try to work out details,
and wants to make sure this is accurate. What do you think?
