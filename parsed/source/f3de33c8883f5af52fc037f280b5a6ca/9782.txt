delegation is aggressively lobbying the Administration to waive administratively potentially
hundreds of millions of dollars that HCFA's fiscal intermediaries have concluded that the
state's hospitals owe as a result of inappropriate Medicare DSH payments. The
Congressional delegation, the state, and the hospitals have taken the position that they were
unaware that billing for these DSH payments was problematic. Some even argue that
their interpretation of the law is that the payments are legal. The delegation decided not
to pursue a legislative fix in this area because CBO scores such an intervention as costing
the Treasury and the Medicare Trust Fund over $300 million. They are, instead,
advocating for HCFA to step in administratively and place a moratorium on their FI's
collections of past (and future) liabilities for a long enough period to fight HCFA in court
or for Congress to intervene legislatively next year. Particularly because of the strong
Democratic interest in this area and because it appears that HCFA has been inconsistently
been applying the reimbursement rules, we are urging HCFA to be responsive as possible.
We have been informed that HCFA will probably be able to announce a temporary
moratorium late next week. We will make sure the roll-out is done to reflect the interest of
the Members.
