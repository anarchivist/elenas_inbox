TEXT:
On Sylvia: That's sounds exactly right.  If its okay with you, I'll pass
along to Richard Socardes that you'll talk with Sylvia.

On other matters: the food safety legislation meeting was a bit contentous
between USTRjUSDA vs. FDA.  I talked to O'hara after the tobacco meeting
about trying for a fixed bill by early next week which seems doable.  If
it looks broken down, DPC may need to call a meeting.

Also, we met with EEOC and DOJ civil rts today.  They didn't have much in
the way of reforms, frankly, but I think we will have a package that could
consist of things like fixing the EEOC backlog (they deny having one),
appointing the new EEOC chair; creating a coordinating civil rights
structure, encouraging mediation instead of litigation, and maybe one or
two other things that improve efficiency ...
