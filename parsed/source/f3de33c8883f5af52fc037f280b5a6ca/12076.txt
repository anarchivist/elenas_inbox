         TEXT:
         Folks--comments were due 3/26. While it is true that the President's
         attention has been directed elsewhere these last ten days, at some point
         soon he will be focused on the book. Therefore, we need all of your


 comments to Todd by Monday, April 5 (copy to me, please). We want to
 schedule some time next week for the President on this matter and having
 everyone's comments in will help us structure how to best utilize his
 limited time.  Thank you all very much for your prompt attention to this
 matter.  Remember we are down the home stretch--the end is in sight;
 please help us get there.
