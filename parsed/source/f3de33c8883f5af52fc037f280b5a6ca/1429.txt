TEXT:
Carrie is putting together a binder of the agency preview policy documents
for you.   The final documents requested in the Presiden'ts memo are due on
Monday.   I was thinking we should schedule an interagency meeting on
Tuesday to ensure we have all the documents on Monday or Tuesday at the
latest. We would give a status of the conference, the satellite
conference plan, materials, and that we will develop an announcement
schedule.

I would also want the Consumer Product Safety Commission. to be sure to
come to the next meeting as well.

What do you think?
