TEXT:
FYI: This memo compares the Harkin amendment on violent disabled youth
and our treatment of this issue in the ESEA bill which we will send to
Congress tomorrow. As the memo notes, the Harkin amendment goes
significantly further than our proposal.

Subject: Harkin/ESEA side-by-side


As requested, below is a comparison of the Harkin amendment to the
Administration's ESEA reauthorization proposal, included in Title IX,
Section 11206 (Sound Discipline policy) of the Act, which addresses the
   ,.

same issue.

The Harkin amendment requires school personnel to provide immediate
interventions and services, including mental health services, to any child
removed from school for any act of violence, including both
weapons-related conduct and other violence.

Alternatively, Section 11206 of the Administration's ESEA re'authorization
proposal requires States who receive ESEA funds to have a state discipline
policy that requires LEAs to develop a policy that would provide
appropriate counseling, mental health, and other services to students who
are suspended or expelled from school.

The main differences of these two legislative proposals are that:

Right to Services: First, the Harkin amendment goes much further than the
ESEA discipline policy provision in terms of the services a student is
required to receive.  The Harkin amendment appears to create a new
fundamental right for services for all students who are suspended or
expelled for any act of violence.  In comparison, the ESEA proposal simply
requires the States and LEAs to develop a policy to provide appropriate
services to students who are suspended or expelled in order that they
continue to meet the State's challenging standards.

For example, if a student throws a book across the classroom and is
suspended or expelled for doing so, the Harkin amendment would require
schools to provide immediate intervention services, including possibly
mental health services to the student.  In fact, it appears that under the
Harkin amendment, the parent could sue the school for failure to provide
services or mental health counseling for the suspended child.

Under ESEA, for the same child, the school would only be required to have
a discipline policy to continue to provide an appropriate level or
services to the child during the suspension or expulsion so that the child
may continue to meet high standards. The only time mental health services
are required under the ESEA are in cases where children bring firearms to
school. Since the ESEA provision deals with the school's discipline
policy and not the specific rights of the student to services, it appears
that the parent would not be able to use the ESEA provision as the basis
of a lawsuit.

Applicability: Second, the Harkin amendment is more narrowly focused, as
it applies only to violence-related suspensions and expUlsions. The
Harkin amendment's requirement apply to any student who is suspended or
expelled for any weapon related or other act of violence. On the other
hand, the ESEA discipline policy applies to all students who are suspended
or expelled, regardless of the reason for their suspension or expulsion.

Funding: The Harkin amendment authorizes such sums for the services
schools must provide, while the ESEA reauthorization proposal just ties
the discipline policy requirement to receiving ESEA funds -- it does not
authorize any new funds.
