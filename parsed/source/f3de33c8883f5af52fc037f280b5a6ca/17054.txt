TEXT:
I finally understand from Mickey what he wants:  a meeting on FLSA with
Karen T. , you/Bruce, Craig, me to talk about our strategy on FLSA.  He
thinks its "vital" to have Karen there.  Mickey is going to a meeting with
the Democratic Govs in VT this weekend and wants a meeting before then.
Rahm is going to the DGA meeting as well, so we should invite him to the
FLSA meeting, although he won't attend.

Could you set this meeting up? I guess Karen is at AFL-CIO meeting and
won't be back until Thursday. Let me know. Thanks.
