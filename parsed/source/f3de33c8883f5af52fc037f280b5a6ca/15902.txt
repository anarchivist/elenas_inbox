Subject:

The following is revised (by Tarullo) language for the Denver Summit of
the Eight Communique as agreed to by Rachel and Elizabeth.  I will run it
by Dan once again; we plan to transmit the communique early this afternoon.

Human Cloning

We have taken note of recent scientific experiments which could open the
way to creating a child by cloning an existing person. While recognizing
the considerable benefits for basic research, agriculture and human health
from cloning technology, we agree on the need for appropriate domestic
legislation and close international cooperation to prohibit the use of
somatic cell nuclear transfer to create a child, while countries explore
ethical and scientific implications in greater depth. We are encouraged by
the reflections underway within national ethics committees, as well as in
various regional and international fora, which will enable a measured
approach in deciding which uses of this technique are, and which are not
unacceptable. We are determined to give a strong impetus to their work
with a view to arriving as soon as possible at an appropriate universal
moratorium.
