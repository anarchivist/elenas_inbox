 Subject:         A Smart gun for every youth cadet

 1.         Smart Guns.

          Perfect timing on your request. NIJ is about 2-4 weeks away from
 announcing that they have chosen a prototype smart gun that they will
 start testing in the field.   They are providing a $500,000 grant to
 consortium of companies such as Colt Manufacture to demonstrate the gun.

         The gun will have a "Active Radio Frequency Tag" that will permit
 the gun to be only fired within a 3 feet (or less) range from a wrist band
 that the police officer will wear.  The gun will also have a "lasar-aiming
 element" so that when the officer points his gun at a bad guy,  a red dot
 will appear on his target.  Supposedly, this serves as an effective
 warning to the culprit that he could potentiallly be blown away so he
 better calm down. This stuff is so cool.

            I told Boyd to wait this time before he leaks all of this to the
 paper.


 2.         Police Youth Academies.

         I talked to Justice Department -- BJA has funded the NYPD youth
 academy program for two years at about $50,000 per year.   This is a summer
 program that Bratton started and that Safir has continued.

         COPS told me that they have never considered this and that
 because of FY 97 appropriations language -- they are prohibited from
 using funds for non-hiring grants.

            However, they admitted to me that the received reprogramming


 approval from Congress to fund $75 million in backlogged applications for
 their "Problem-solving Partnerships" program. This is the program that we
 tried to Brattonize and they were resisting.    In fact, I recall Bratton
 having a grant application for this program to fund a Corns tat initiative
 for about 20+ New England towns   ( I have much more that I have learned on
 Comstat in the last day that I want to share wi you at some point --- this
 is great stuff that we could probably be doing more on) .

         I have a call into Brann to push him on the youth academies.
