TEXT:
I am getting calls from the counties, cities, about the lack of clarity on
the obligation of states to pass through funds to local govts. who have
incurred costs in their health expenditures. There is a feeling out there
that the Administration is not being clear on this point.  I have repeated
what Elena told me, but the anxiety level is high at the moment. Can. you
give me more to say? On the local lawsuit. issue, Sen. Feinstein is
offering an amendment that would allow the locals who began suits by 1977
to go forward.  I hope we will not oppose that.  The National League of
Cities had written saying they would not support the bill if that
prOVlSlon were not in--I pushed back and they will simply work hard on
Feinstein and see what happens.
