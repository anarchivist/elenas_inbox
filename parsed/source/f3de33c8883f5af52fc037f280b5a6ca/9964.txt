PW: I know that Laura is out, this is late, and Cathy thinks the weekly is
already done, but I'm sending on the off chance that they can be
included. These aren't terribly urgent entries, and it isn't the end of
the world if they don't make it in -- but just in case ...

Crime -- Gang Study: The Justice Department's National Institute of
Justice (NIJ) recently released a study on youth gangs. The study     which
defined youth gangs as young people between the ages of 10 and 22
years-old -- was conducted in Colorado, Florida, and Cleveland.   Findings
of the study include: (1) gang members committed significantly more
violent crime, including homicide and drive-by shootings, than other
at-risk youths; (2) gang members were over 12 times more likely be
involved in drug sales, and were much more likely to own a gun, as
compared to other at-risk youth; (3) reprisals suffered by youths who
refused to join a gang were often milder than the serious assaults endured
during gang initiations; (4) youths who resist gangs are less likely to
experience arrest, incarceration, injury, and deaths associated with gang
membership; and (5) the age of first arrest for youth is the same age at
which most youth join gangs (14 years-old).

Crime -- Community Policing Conference: Next week, more than 750 police
and community leaders from across the country will attend a community
policing conference sponsored by the Justice Department's COPS Office and
National Institute of Justice.   The conference will focus on effective
problem solving and community-building strategies that are helping law
enforcement agencies respond to crime, fear, and disorder in their
jurisdictions.   In addition, this week the COPS Office released $18
million in grants to 139 law enforcement agencies to hire 276 officers.
This brings the total number of officers funded through the COPS program
to 88,797.
