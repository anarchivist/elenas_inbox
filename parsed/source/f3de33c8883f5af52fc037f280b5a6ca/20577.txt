TEXT:
Elena,
Yesterday, Maria convened a follow-up meeting with the LCCR folks to
discuss our civil rights enforcement initiatives. Wade asked for a higher
profile for our civil rights enforcement package. Maria and Minyon agreed
that they would try to incorporate support for the cr package (as a
package) in upcoming principal events. Next week the VP is speaking at
the NAACP and the FLOTUS is speaking at La Raza.  These were identified as
two opportunities.

wade also indicated the LCCR's intention to draft a letter to the
Congressional leadership + committee members outlining the "package"
concept and expressing strong support for the increases in the President's
budget. Though this sort of sets them up in a way that may make them a
target ("here is all the stuff that is important to us"), they believe
that it would be an important rallying tool. Wade also indicated that
LCCR plans to work on getting a bi-partisan letter from members of
Congress and former EEOC commissioners expressing support for the use of
employment testers.

Julie
