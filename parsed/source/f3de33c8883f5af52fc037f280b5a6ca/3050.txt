This a.m., we agreed on an Eli event, probably in St Louis, in the 10-day
window before the Aug 22' anniversary. Couldn't get a firm POTUS
commitment to DLC conference; I'll talk to will Marshall to see if they'd
take Gore.

There is great interest in releasing the case load numbers.   Cynthia or
Diana, can you find out when that will be?

The WH Conf on Child Care is now on the schedule for Oct. 23rd
(tentative). The Clintons will be on vacation from around Aug 20 to Sept
19, and in S.America from Oct 10-19.
