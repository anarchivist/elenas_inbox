TEXT:
Per our conversations; please comment.

An amendment to the Committee bill would prohibit HCFA from paying for a
specific pharmaceutical agent under Medicaid except for post-surgical
treatment. We oppose the use of the appropriations process to make
selective coverage determinations and judgments regarding how best to
treat specific medical problems.  Further, the amendment is unnecessary
because the Secretary already has authority to limit coverage for
pharmaceutical agents if prescribed inappropriately, and States already
have broad latitude to limit the use of drugs under Federal law through
drug utilization review and prior authorization programs.
