  Beverly Barnes and I discussed this yesterday. We plan to alert the
. African American media and key leaders across the country through our fax
  network. All black radio talk show hosts will get the information on her
  as soon as its available. Additionally, African American leaders from the
  business, clergy, women, and civil rights communities will notified. As
  soon as I get the Bio, I will personally call Simeon Booker of Jet to
  inform him.    When can we meet her? Thanks.
