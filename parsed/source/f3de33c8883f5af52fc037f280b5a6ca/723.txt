TEXT:
INS requests that this language about setting a goal of 100,000 not be
used.

INS' target for this FY year is 93,000 deportations.     I assume that
someone at the White House has taken an average of about 10,000
deportations a month that this figure reflects and extended it beyond the
fiscal year to the end of the calender year to get 100,000.    INS is
concerned for a variety of reasons -- including that they may be sued on
some of the new provisions of law that effect deportation which could
disrupt their deportation program this year and make it difficult to reach
their target.    Therefore, they advise that the President should not
highlight this is the State of the Union.   Let me know if you have any
other questions.

Are there other immigration   legal or illegal -- points made in the
speech draft? I have not seen a copy.


thanks
