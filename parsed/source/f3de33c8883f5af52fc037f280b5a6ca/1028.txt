TEXT:
I attended the meeting over at the Department of Agriculture, chaired by
Jill Long Thompson,  with a number of representatives of Black farmers,
Ag. staffers,  and several Congressional staffers.    The meeting focused
on requests for assistance from the federal government for minority
farmers.  The type of assistance sought, outlined in the report you
provided to me, ranges from funding to cooperative public/private
efforts.

There is no immediate follow-up needed by the White House.  Dept. of Ag.
staff pledged to review the proposals and see if they can help.   Ag.
will contact us to update us on how this is going in the near future.
Depending on their determinations, we can decide on appropriate actions.

Thanks.
