TEXT:
I've talked to USDA, HHS, and OMB, and we are making progress. We've got
some budget language that USDA could live with.  HHS, however, does.not
want to use the word "budget", but wants to use the term "food safety
resource plan."

In addition, the following major issues remain:

1.      HHS (per Jim O'Hara) doesn't want DPC, NPR, and OSTP as members
of the Council. O'Hara says HHS only wants those agencies with "line
authority" for food safety to be members of the council. HHS says the
Council could consult with the DPC, NPR, and OSTP like the Council will
consult with state and local governments and private entities. The
reasoning for this is basically the "Evil President" theory. Along those
lines, they don't want DPC to be the third co-chair.  HHS is not opposed
to a third co-chair, but would want it to be an agency like EPA, not a WH
agency.   This seems to be HHS's way of getting around the sunsetting
provison.

2.     However, OMB and EPA are still pushing sunseting.
