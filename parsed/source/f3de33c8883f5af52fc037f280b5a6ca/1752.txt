TEXT:
Our legislaiton covers "child care facilities licensed under State law."
That excludes many types of child care arrangements (e.g. church-based
centers exempt from license requirements in some states; relative care;
etc.).   OPM has heard complaints about this provision in the legislation,
and doesn't want to be as narrow in this directive, but I don't want to
move off legislative proposal.  I suggest we just say "child car~" in the
memo from POTUS w/out elaborating.  If asked how we're defining (I doubt w
e'll be asked), we can state that the agencies will have flexibility and
OPM will provide guidance. Does that make sense?
