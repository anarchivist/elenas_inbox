Justice has just advised that it has been invited to testify tomorrow

morning

(10:00 a.m.) before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary on the use of

dispensing or distributing controlled substances for purposes of physician

assisted suicide.    Justice intends to use its letter that you have for

review

as its testimony.    Justice is anxious to know when we can give them

comments?

please advise.    Thanks.
