             Education -- Charter School Legislation: We are continuing to work with
     congressional staff to reach an agreement to bring a bipartisan charter
     school bill to the floor of the Senate in the next few days.  Secretary
     Riley persuaded Senator Harkin Tuesday to drop an amendment that could
     block enactment of the bill -- as long as no other amendments to the bill
     are offered. While we are not currently aware of any other possible
     amendments, it is still possible that one could be offered -- leading
     Harkin to offer his amendment too and likely blocking chances of
     enactment. We are working with congressional staff to resolve what we
     hope are relatively minor disagreements (including an issue on charter
     schools and special education also raised by Senator Harkin) through a
     consensus manager's package that could come to the floor within a few days.

             Education -- Wisconsin Charter School Issue:   Secretary Riley will
     respond within a few days to letters from the Wisconsin State Department
     of Public Instruction and the City of Milwaukee requesting his
     intervention in a dispute about whether and how three new charter schools
     created by the city must abide by the Individuals with Disabilities
     Education Act -- the federal special education law guaranteeing students
     in public schools a "free and appropriate public education" (FAPE).

             The State Department of Public Instruction is threatening to block
     all funding for these new schools
     until the city clarifies how this obligation will be met, and it has
     justified that threat partly by
     concerns that failure by the city and these schools to comply with federal
     law could jeopordize
     $80 million in federal special education funding.   The city is arguing
     that: 1) Wisconsin charter
     schools are not necessarily public schools and might therefore not be
     covered by this federal
     law; 2) if these are public schools, Wisconsin state law either designates
     the Milwaukee public
     school district as the public entity responsible for ensuring that these
     students get FAPE or provides
     the State with flexibility to determine who is the appropriate responsible
     public entity. These three
     schools opened this month and are expecting the first installment of
     operating funds from the state
     within the week.   The Education Department is carefully reviewing these
     letters and will respond
     shortly -- likely answering that: 1) charter schools are public schools;
     2) the state has flexibility to
     determine who should be the public entity with responsibility to ensure
     that students get FAPE; and
     3) that Wisconsin's federal special education funding could be at risk if
     an agreement is not
     reached on this issue.
