Departments of Justice (Taylor), Transportation (DeCell), and the
Treasury (Levy), White House Counsel (), National Economic
Council (), Domestic Policy Council (), General Counsel (),
Economic Policy (), TCJSD (), HTFD (), BASD (Balis).
H.R. 234 was reported favorably by a voice vote of the House
Committee on the Judiciary on October 31, 1995.
Description of H.R. 234
H.R. 234 would amend the Bankruptcy Code to make nondischargeable
a debt for death or personal injury caused by the debtor's
operation of a watercraft or aircraft while intoxicated from
alcohol, drugs, or other substances.
Under current law, those who incur debt as a result of 'their
operation of a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol
cannot have their obligation dismissed. This bankruptcy
provision has been interpreted as applying only to automobiles.
H.R. 234 bill would extend the law to operation of watercraft or
aircraft.
