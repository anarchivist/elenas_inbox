The Honorable Dan Burton
Chairman
Corrunittee on Government Reform and Oversight
U.S. House of Representatives
Washington, D.C.    20515

Dear Chairman Burton:

I am writing to express the AdministrationD,s support for H.R. 3725, a
bill that would apply the requirements of the Occupational Safety and
Health Act (OSH Act) to the U.S. Postal Service. We hope that Congress
will give postal employees the full benefit of OSHAD,s expertise and
authority.

The U.S. Postal Service, with more than 20,000 facilities, comprises 30
percent of the Federal civilian workforce.  However,  Postal Service
workersD, injury and illness cases involving lost time represent about 42
percent of the GovernmentD,s lost time cases.  The total injury and
illness cases of the Postal Service constitute about 48 percent of the
entire GovernmentD,s claims.   Consequently, we welcome the additional
tools H.R 3725 would provide in our efforts to improve occupational safety
and health in the Postal Service.

In keeping with the Department of LaborD,s expressed concern during this
and the previous Congress that many Federal employees are not adequately
protected under the OSH Act, we would support an amendment to extend the
requirements of the Act to all Federal employees with the exception of the
uniformed members of the Armed Services.  In addition, the Department of
Justice advises that H.R. 3725 needs to be amended to ensure that the
President retains his ability to review and resolve any interagency dispute
 concerning enforcement of the Act short of litigation and his ability to
block any such litigation.

The Federal Government should be the model for providing employees
workplaces that are safe and healthy.  H.R. 3725 is an important step in
improving the quality of public sector workplaces, which civil servants
and their families deserve.

The Office of Management and Budget advises that there is no objection to
the presentation of this report from the standpoint of the
AdministrationD,s program.


                    Sincerely,



                    Alexis M. Herman
