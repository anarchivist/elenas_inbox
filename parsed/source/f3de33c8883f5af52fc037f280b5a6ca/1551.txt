TEXT:
This is from Maria(because my computer is under plastic because of
painting)--Elena--If someone on your staff would please provide a copy of
the FCC liquor letter to Marjorie/Ben Johnson ASAP--so our folks in OPL
can give the appropriate heads up, before the event on Tuesday.  For
example, Edgar Bronfman (Seagram's) is a very important leader in the
Jewish community--other business leaders may also appreciate a heads up.
Jay, Barbara, Cheri and Ben--I don't know who else has constituencies that
need to be touched right before the event on Tuesday.  Please handle and
please advise me of results of outreach.
