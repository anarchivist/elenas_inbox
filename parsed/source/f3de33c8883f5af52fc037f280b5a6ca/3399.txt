HEADLINE: The GOP's Welfare Gut Check
BYLINE: BY MICKEY KAUS

Will Republicans sabotage their own reform?

    IN THE NEXT WEEK OR TWO CONGRESS will decide the fate of welfare refonn.
Welfare refonn? Isn't that last year's story? Well, yes. Last year Congress
passed a refonn that was the most significant legislation of Bill Clinton's
first tenn -- and just about the only revolutionary act of Newt Gingrich's
"revolution." So far, the law seems to be working: caseloads are plummeting
nationwide.

   Yet now, when nobody's looking, those soft-headed, entitlement-loving
politicians in Congress are busy undennining the 1996 refonn, gutting its work
requirements and imposing Washington-knows-best restrictions that ensure states
will not be able to put large numbers of recipients to work.

   Typical. Except for one thing: the members of Congress doing the undennining
are Republicans in Republican-led committees in a Republican Congress.

    It is, as Gingrich would say, frankly bizarre. You'd think the GOP would
jealously protect last year's achievement. The 1996 law abolished the main
federal welfare program and gave the money in a "block grant" to states to spend
on aid programs of their own devising. To prod governors in the right direction,
the law required states to have a rising percentage of their caseloads working
-- 50 percent by 2002. Wisconsin has been leading the way, with an ambitious
program to require all recipients to work, in last-resort "community service"
jobs if necessary.

   If you wanted to subvert this successful (so far) scenario, what would you
do? Not launch a frontal assault on the popular refonn. Instead, you'd just
change a few crucial details. Two, in particular:

   You'd quietly eviscerate the work requirements: Fifty percent of the caseload
must be "working" in 2002. Sounds tough. But let's look at the math. Under the
original refonn, states get credit for any caseload drop since 1995 -- already
about 15 percent. Then there's a credit for recipients with part-time jobs --
about 4 percent of the caseload. Plus the "mothers with kids under age one"
loophole (you don't want to know the details), which is good for another 3
                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion
percent. That's a total of 22 percent right off the bat.

    And, this past week, Republican committees in the House and the Senate opened
 up new loopholes. Under the,House Ways and Means plan, states could count as
 "working" teenage parents in school -- about 7 percent of the caseload. And, in
 2002, states could put another 15 percent of the caseload into classrooms and
 count that as "work," too. Add up all those numbers and you realize that the
 average state could, without getting any additional recipients working, achieve
 a "work" percentage of 44 percent. If the caseload drops 6 more points, most
-states wouldn't have to require a single soul to work.

   You'd push recipients into meaningless jobs: At least states like Wisconsin
that want to put recipients to work can do it, right? Don't be so sure. In the
current budget debate, three key GOP-led congressional committees, with
Republican votes, have approved union-inspired restrictions that would make it
very hard to give "workfare" participants work worth doing.

   Workfare has always been a threat to government employees, who worry that
cheap workfarers will take their jobs. The 1996 law said existing workers
couldn't be fired and replaced with welfare recipients. That seems only fair.
But the new "anti displacement" restrictions would ban a welfare recipient from
doing a task if it would "infringe in any way upon the promotional
opportunities" of existing workers, or be "inconsistent" with union work rules.

   The practical effect, as Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson argued in a letter of
protest, will be to let unions block workfare assignments "at will." Governors
will be forced to place workfarers far away from anything existing workers are
already doing, which is to say anything visibly useful. No fixing up parks, no
cleaning up subway stations. Instead, recipients will be pushed into the
amorphous nonprofit sector, into makework and fake-work. That's what happened in
the last big public-jobs program, CETA. The government wound up paying people to
do things like "checking on" cars in a housing project.

   Don't be fooled by the showy congressional debate over whether workfarers
should get the minimum wage. The "antidisplacement" provisions are the real nub
of the current welfare fight. There are signs GOP House leaders are finally
waking up to the threat to last year's reform. But, with the welfare changes
passed by committees in both houses, it may be too late. And the two sets of
changes, read together, do make strange and brilliant sense: the union-inspired
restrictions make it hard for states to require work; the new loopholes tell
them they don't really have to. The end result could be a welfare system a lot
like the one we thought Congress replaced in 1996.
