>Please. please tell me why the Boston Globe continues to perpetuate the

>impression that Boston Public schools has historically been captive of the

>"social promotion phenomenon"    (Thomas Payzant,   "Boston Is Taking Strong



>Steps Toward Better Schools," 9/8/98).       This is simply untrue.

>

>In 1988, over one out of every nine Boston students (11%) was retained in

>grade.    In addition, over one quarter of all ninth graders were not

>promoted, with rates even higher for African American and Latino students.

>Those retained included 1000 first graders.      By the time students entered

>sixth grade, approximately 40% were one year behind their appropriate

grade.

>

>Once in middle school, students faced more non-promotions: 9.7% in Grade

6,

>14.0% in Grade 7, and 10.9%     in Grade 8 were not promoted.   Many students

>retained in the middle grades repeated their grade at a lower "ability

>level."   This pattern mirrors research that finds that students retained

in

>grade are more likely to end up in special education placements.        Yet

>being categorized as special education students does not protect them from

>further grade retention.     Just 10 years ago, in 1988,   17% of Boston's

>mainstreamed special education students were retained in grade.

>

>As Boston's own data revealed that grade retention was not producing

>achievement gains, Boston school gradually reduced retention rates.          Did

>test scores drop dramatically?     No.   Test scores stayed about the same.

>But gradually, the dropout rate has declined.       In other words, grade

>retention undermined students' persistence in school, but made no

>difference to achievement.    Do we want to return to the days of low

>achievement AND high dropout rates?      We can do better, and it does not

>require filling up the elementary and middle grades with overage students.

>Superintendent Thomas Payzant shows an alarming lack of awareness of the
