RE:   Big News in the AmeriCorps World

 As many of you know, Harris has worked extremely hard to develop strong
bi-partisan support for AmeriCorps. This prospecting for support is
time-consuming, and the results come slowly.  Sometimes they come so
slowly
that one wonders if they are coming at all.

 Well today we got a big break, one that Harris has been working on for a
long time.  In a story in today's Columbus Dispatch, Rep. John Kasich said
that he has changed his mind about AmeriCorps, and that he would no longer
vote to eliminate the program.

 Some time ago, Kasich visited the Harlem Peacemakers program and was
exceptionally impressed by the program.  He was surprised to learn that
many
of the people working with the program were AmeriCorps members, and soon
thereafter told Harris that this experience was causing him to rethink his
view of AmeriCorps.  Kasich then had a long session with Harris in which
he
learned more about AmeriCorps, and clearly seemed to be reconsidering his
position.  Today's story shows that he has completed his decision-making
process.


       The full story from the Dispatch is reproduced below.   Please read it and
      enjoy this news.  Thanks. JG



      Kasich reverses on AmeriCorps

      February 21, 1999
      By Jonathan Riskind
      Dispatch Washington Bureau

       MUSCATINE, Iowa -- When Rep. John R. Kasich visited an AmeriCorps office
      Friday during a campaign stop for his presidential bid, he revealed that
      he
      has changed his mind about the federal program.

       The Westerville Republican and House Budget Committee chairman said he
      has
      been transformed in recent months from a foe to a fan.

       Kasich in the past joined many other Republicans trying unsuccessfully to
      eliminate the Clinton administration program. AmeriCorps provides a
      stipend
      and educational scholarships to those who spend a year in public service
      jobs.

       Critics have said AmeriCorps isn't a true volunteer effort because
      participants are paid. Some questioned whether the benefits are worth the
      cost.

       But AmeriCorps has stopped calling its participants volunteers, and
      Kasich
      said he has witnessed AmeriCorps making valuable public-service
      contributions.

       "I have seen them do some amazing things in Harlem     . I know that
      AmeriCorps workers were involved in a number of the homeless programs,
      he
      said. "I would like to spend some time trying to refocus pieces of it and
      trying to make it more of a public/private situation, but I don't think I
      would cast a vote anymore that would eliminate it."

       Kasich said the program can be made more effective,   "but they've done
      some
      really great work, and I'm impressed with them."

       Tina Dunphy, a slightly surprised AmeriCorps project director who greeted
      Kasich when he entered her storefront office in this eastern Iowa town,
      said
      20 "members" work here on such projects as tutoring and mentoring
      elementary-school students.

       Clinton has requested $585 million for AmeriCorps in his 2000 budget
      proposal, a $113 million increase over current funding.  The increase
      would
      add 20,000 participants to the program, for a total of 70,000. Clinton has
      proposed funding 100,000 members in 2002.
