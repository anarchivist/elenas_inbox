Mickey--lots of things in flux, but these issues are on the radar screen
in one way or another--for on tobacco, --elena, on rum tax--this may be
part of extenders, unclear but it's in gene's shop-I'd call john kaplan to
find out the latest, on chip, ed-flex and medicaid alloca--barbara chow's
office should have latests; indian gaming--part of interior discussions,
wes warren might be able to help (on this, I think there is resolution).
While a budget briefing would make it easier--too many people working on
all these issues (and more) and it's constantly changing.

It would be very helpful to IGA to get a budget briefing on where we stand
with about a half dozen remaining priority issues for IGA. They include Ed
Flex, Medicaid Cost Allocation, Tobacco medicaid recoupment, Indian Gaming
{Enzi-Sessions amendment}, Rum Tax Cover Over, and CHIP dollars for Puerto
Rico and Virgin Islands. What would you suggest?
