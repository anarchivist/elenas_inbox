TEXT:
Regarding the privatization letters:
        I drafted a response from Bowles to Gramm as you requested, which
references their meeting. At the same time, we had letters to the
President from the other members of the Texas delegation that Bowles et.
al. also met with.  I would propose that the same letter from Bowles go to
them as well, rather than one from Bruce. The letter from Bruce would go
to those who wrote the President but we had no meetings with. What do you
think?
