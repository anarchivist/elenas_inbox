Nov. 3 Votes Can Affect Gay Couples' Struggle for Freedom to Marry

Lambda describes national impact of votes in Hawaii and Alaska

"Next week's votes will shape what comes next .... and win or lose, a lot
will
come next."

 (NEW YORK, October 29, 1998) -- Lesbian and gay couples' freedom to marry
faces a major challenge with votes in Hawaii and Alaska on November 3,
said Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, a civil rights organization
leading the national battle to end marriage discrimination.


In an unprecedented vote, the people of Hawaii and Alaska are being asked
to amend their state constitutions so that lesbian and gay couples can be
singled out and excluded from civil marriage.

"Next week's votes will shape what comes next," said Lambda Marriage
Project Director Evan Wolfson, adding, "Win or lose, a lot will come next.
Like any civil rights movement, the fight to winning the freedom to marry
is a long- haul struggle, and it is growing across the country."

The stakes are high. will voters support their states' constitutions and
protect the freedom to marry as a basic human right grounded in love and
commitment? Or will voters be persuaded by an ugly campaign funded by the
Religious Right to try to rob loving lesbian and gay couples of fair and
equal treatment for their personal relationships?  "How frightening that
anyone's basic civil rights should be subjected to a vote!" Wolfson said.

The courts should be allowed to do their jobs. Courts in Hawaii and
Alaska have recognized that civil marriage laws discriminate against
same-sex couples wishing to wed.  "These ballot measures are attempts to
undermine the courts and the constitutional guarantees of equality in
these states and nationwide," Wolfson said.

Hawaii is on its way to becoming the first state to end that
discrimination, a breakthrough that will be felt across the country.
Lambda is co-counsel in the historic Hawaii marriage case, in which Judge
Kevin Chang ruled in 1996 that, under the Hawaii Constitution, there is no
valid reason for denying civil marriage to same-sex couples.

With the state's appeal of that decision now pending before the Hawaii
Supreme Court, and an Alaska judge having ruled that that state must also
demonstrate a compelling reason why lesbian and gay couples should be
prohibited from marrying, the constitutional amendment questions in both
states are intended as an end-run around the courts.

A third case challenging sex discrimination in marriage is expected to be
argued in Vermont's highest court in mid-November.

If you want to understand the impact of this   vote and the national
outlook, contact Lambda, whose litigation in   Hawaii will move ahead
regardless of this divisive ballot campaign.   Lambda can provide you with
background on the important social and legal   issues ignited by this
movement and the likely ramifications of the   November 3 vote in Hawaii and
Alaska.
