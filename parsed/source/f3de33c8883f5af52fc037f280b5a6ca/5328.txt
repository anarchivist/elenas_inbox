TEXT:
By the way, if we're doing AmeriCorps, Rahm asked Steve Silverman for
ideas of reporters, other than Jonathan Alter, who we could leak the story
to. Any ideas?

The Corp. is not inviting members of Congress to the address.  In fact,
now that theY've missed the chance to get their reauthorization proposal
introduced this session, they are leaning toward not even releasing the
bill at this point, but just a summary, and taking the opportunity to play
with the draft and talk to people over the recess. Do you think that's a
problem?

We're working on a letter from the President to Powell saying nice things
and attaching our 6 month accomplishment piece.  We would then release
that to the press, either with the radio address or just as a freestanding
piece prior to Powell's thing Tuesday.

Also, we are investigating whether we could reach a quick agreement with .
America's Promise that we can announce on Friday that we are working with
them on child health outreach -- getting kids signed up for Medicaid and
the new child health program. Not sure we can pull it off in the next day
or two, other than as a vague announcement.
