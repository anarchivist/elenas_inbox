       Clinton Adviser Wants Andro Probe

                                   By SONYA ROSS Associated Press Writer

                                   WASHINGTON (AP)   - - President Clinton's drug
       policy
                                   adviser wants the federal   government to
       investigate the health
                                   effects of androstenedione,    the over-the-counter
       product used
                                   by baseball slugger Mark McGwire, who broke the
                                   single-season home-run record last year.

                                   Barry McCaffrey wrote to the Drug Enforcement
                                   Administration and the Federal Trade Commission
       urging that
                                   they study recent Canadian and Swedish
       laboratory analyses of
                                   the product, known as andro.

                                   Androstenedione is classified as a dietary
       supplement that the
                                   body metabolizes into testosterone, which is
       considered a
                                   steroid. It is banned by the Olympics, the NCAA,
       the NFL,
                                   and the men's and women's   tennis tours, but is
       not banned by
                                   baseball.

                                   Andro soared in popularity last fall after
       McGwire revealed he
                                   used it to enhance his we ightlifting regimen
       prior to last season,
                                   when he hit a record 70 home runs. Steroid
       experts warn there
.
                      could be serious health consequences for
teen-agers who take
                      it to emulate McGwire.

                      McCaffrey asked the agencies to confirm tests by
the Swedish
                      Board of Customs and the Canadian Doping Control
Lab,
                      which found some andro products contained
significant
                      quantities of testosterone not mentioned on the
label.

                      " I f this is the case, a large number of
Americans who are
                      taking these products are unwittingly placing
themselves in
                      serious jeopardy,   I   I   McCaffrey wrote.

                      If their review backs up the Canadian and
Swedish findings,
                      McCaffrey urged that andro be reclassified as an
anabolic
                      steroid under the Controlled Substances Act.

                      "We know this substance serves as a steroid
precursor, which
                      alone is grounds for caution,             I   I   McCaffrey said .
. "Given the
                      dramatic increases in youth use rates of andro,
and the mere
                      potential that such use may have severe health
consequences, it
                      is important that we act swiftly.                     I   I




                      He cited anecdotal information indicating young
people are
                      taking 200 to 300 times the recommended dosage,
a practice
                      known as "stacking,         I   I   and some are exhibiting
    side effects
                      "similar to those found with steroids, such as
    heightened
                      aggressiveness and problem acne.                  I   I




                      Its wide availability over the Internet makes it
vulnerable to
                      misuse, he noted.
