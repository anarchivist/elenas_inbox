The following is from NEC's briefing for the AFL-CIO conference:

PRIVATIZATION OF THE EMPLOYMENT SERVICE

Michigan: Governor Engler recently issued an Executive Order that would
allow for the privatization of the Michigan Employment Service.
Approximately 400 merit-staffed State employees," represented by SEIU,
would be affected by the Executive Order, scheduled to effect on October
6.   The Department of Labor directed the Michigan Jobs Commission to
suspend implementation of the reorganization plan. The Department has not
made a final decision on the legality of MichiganD,s plan.

Texas: A request by the State of Texas to privatize its Employment
Service is on hold.  Last spring, HHS rejected TexasD, plan to privatize
portions of its Medicaid and Food Stamps program.    Other states are
closely watching the Michigan situation; -New York, Illinois and
Pennsylvania are considering similar privatization efforts.
