PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
DEPARTURE STATEMENT ON TOBACCO LEGISLATION
THE WHITE HOUSE
June 22, 1998

        In a few moments I will be leaving for the Vice PresidentD,s
Family Reunion Conference in Nashville, where I will speak about the
health care concerns American families face.  Before I depart, I want to
make clear: one of the most important health issues our families face is
youth smoking.  3,000 children a day start smoking, and 1,000 of them will
die early because of it. That is why, three years ago, through the FDA,
my administration began to act to end the practice of tobacco companies
marketing to our children. And that is why, for the past year, we have
been working to forge an honorable, bipartisan compromise that protects
our children from the dangers of tobacco.

         A majority of the Senate stands ready to join us in making
progress; but last week, the Republican leadership placed partisan
politics -- and tobacco companies -- above AmericaD,s families.   Their
vote was not just pro-tobacco-Iobby; it was anti-family. The bipartisan
bill they blocked would not only protect families from tobacco advertising
that targets children; it would protect kids from drugs, and give low- and
middle-income families a tax break by redressing the marriage penalty.  It
would also make an important investment in cancer research.

        The congressional leadership seems willing to walk away from its
obligation to AmericaD,s children.  But this issue is too important to
walk away. We will continue to move forward on every regulatory front to
protect the health of our children. By the end of the year, the FDAO,S
operation to enforce its ban on tobacco sales to minors will be active in


     nearly every state in America. And while we wait for Congress to heed the
     call of AmericaD,s families, I am instructing the Department of Health and
     Human Services to produce the first-ever annual survey on the brands of
     cigarettes teenagers smoke, and which companies are most responsible for
     this problem.  Parents, quite simply, have a right to know.  Public health
     officials can also use this new information to reduce youth smoking.

             The tobacco companiesD, automatic and angry dismissal of this new
     survey shows their continued disregard for childrenD,s health and
     parentsD, concerns. But once this information becomes public, tobacco
     companies will no longer be able to dodge accountability -- and neither
     will Congress.  From now on, the new data will help to hold tobacco
     companies accountable for targeting our children.

             Again, I urge Congress to pass a comprehensive, bipartisan bill
     rather than a watered-down bill,written by the tobacco lobby. The
     congressional leadership must put familiesD, interests above big
     tobaccoD,s selfish interests. AmericaD,s children deserve better, and I
     will continue to do everything in my power to ensure they receive it.
