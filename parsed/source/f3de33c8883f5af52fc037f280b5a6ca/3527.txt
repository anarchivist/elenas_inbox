      MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

      FROM:          Bruce Reed
                     Elena Kagan

      RE:           DPC Weekly Report


               1. Welfare - Counties: "Counties are making welfare refonn work," said a report
      released this week by the National Association of Counties, by "using the flexibility granted in
      the new law to develop innovative programs that are best suited to their local needs." The report
      profiles successful efforts in four counties (Fulton County, GA; Santa Clara County, CA; Dade
      County, FL; and Hennepin County, MN) to provide transportation, child care, and public sector
      jobs; to assist legal immigrants losing federal benefits; and to create collaborative partnerships
      between the public, private, and non-profit sectors. The report notes that NACo opposed the
      welfare law, but commends the Administration and Congress for addressing counties' primary
      concerns, funding for job creation and benefits for legal immigrants. The report also ernphasizes
      that ''the need for transportation services is tremendous. It was the most common thread that
      linked all counties and outpaced all other concerns as their most urgent need ... The
      reauthorization of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act including new funds to
      help those who are making the transition from welfare to work is therefore paramount."

      [EK--the report never says ''welfare refonn is working"--its tone is "challenge and opportunity".]

              2. Welfare - Budget Conference Update: The House and Senate conferees have
      exchanged welfare refonn offers, which settle some of the minor issues regarding the structure of
      the $3 billion welfare to work program and benefits for legal immigrants. However, all the most
      contentious issues are still on the table: disability and health benefits for disabled legal
      immigrants; minimum wage, worker protections, and hours of work for workfare participants;
      privatization of Food Stamp and Medicaid operations; and whether the $3 billion welfare to work
      program should be operated by HHS or the Department of Labor (the House agrees with us that
      DOL should be the lead agency; the Senate so far disagrees). We have been working at all
      levels to ensure that the Congressional negotiators understand our views on these issues.

             3. Education -- Vocational Education Bill: The Perkins vocational education
      reauthorization bill, H.R. 1853, should reach a House floor vote soon. This week Democrats
      and Republicans reached a compromise on a within-state funding fonnula and other provisions
                                                                          Hex-Dump Conversion


that target more funds to low-income and urban areas, thus avoiding a highly partisan vote. The
bill would achieve several administration goals, including the consolidation of numerous existing
set-asides into a flexible state grant. However, serious concerns remain, including poor
accountability for performance, limits on the use of industry-recognized skill standards, and
still-inadequate in-state targeting as compared to existing law. The Department of Education
hopes to address some of these problems in the Senate.

        4. Education - Civil Rights Investigations of Higher Education in California and
Texas: In response to a complaint filed by several civil rights organizations, the Office for Civil
Rights (OCR) at the Department of Education will investigate the current admissions policies at
the three University of California law schools: Boalt Hall, UCLA, and UC-Davis. The
investigation will determine whether the policies violate Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964
by having a discriminatory impact on minority students. Preliminary analysis shows a
significant disparity in the admission rate for certain minority group students compared to whites.
 The investigation concerns current admissions policies, rather than the widely-reported decline
in minority admissions following the discontinuation ofUC's affirmative action program.

        An extensive OCR-initiated investigation of the Texas higher education system, begun in
February, 1997 as part of a series of state higher education desegregation reviews, is continuing.
The review will determine, consistent with the Supreme Court's Fordice decision, whether
vestiges of past discrimination remain in the Texas system. A chapter of the National Black Law
Students Association filed a complaint with OCR last fall, asserting that Texas continues to
operate a dual system of higher education and challenging the state's implementation of the
Hopwood decision. In April, OCR informed the association that its Title VI allegations would
be reviewed as a part of the existing investigation, while OCR plans to refer the group's
Fourteenth Amendment allegations to the Department of Justice.

       s.    Education - Vocational Education Bill: The Perkins vocational education
reauthorization bill, H.R. 1853, should reach a House floor vote soon. This week Democrats
and Republicans reached a compromise on a within-state funding formula and other provisions
that target more funds to low-income and urban areas, thus avoiding a highly partisan vote. The
bill would achieve several administration goals, including the consolidation of numerous existing
set-asides into a flexible state grant. However, serious concerns remain, including poor
accountability for performance, limits on the use of industry-recognized skill standards, and
still-inadequate in-state targeting as compared to existing law. The Department of Education
hopes to address some of these problems in the Senate.

       6 - National Testing Initiative: There were several related developments affecting the
national testing initiative this week. The House appropriations subcommittee mark-up includes a
provision requiring the National Academy of Sciences to complete an evaluation of the
development and field-testing of the national tests before we can proceed to administer the tests.
This provision was inserted at the request of Mr. Goodling. The Education Department had
already been planning to contract such an evaluation with NAS, so there is no fundamental


                                                2
                                                                             Hex-Dump Conversion


objection to this provision. We are working with Mr. Obey's staff to ensure that the timelines for
completing the study are reasonable given the work to be done, and will produce information in
time for next year's appropriations process. We believe this can be accomplished.

        Second, Diane Ravitch and Checker Finn have launched an attack on our testing effort --
through an article in the Weekly Standard and in a letter reported in the Washington Times.
They have criticized the Administration for failing to provide a governing role for NAGB over
the national tests. This is a step we would like to take, but haven't yet because it would require
new legislation. At the request of Frank Riggs, who chairs the relevant subcommittee and who
supports the testing initiative, we have not submitted legislation pending our collective ability to
move Mr. Goodling to a more favorable stance on the tests. Both Checker and Diane are fully
aware of the need to work with Riggs and Goodling on this issue.

        While we do not believe these attacks have yet caused significant harm, we are concerned
that they could over time. Therefore, we are exploring the possibility of providing NAGB with
the needed statutory authority through the conference on the appropriations bill, and have begun
to discuss this prospect with key Senate staff.

         7. Education - National Testing Initiative and Civil Rights Groups: Secretary Riley
met last week with Chris Edley and representatives of a number of civil rights groups, to listen to
their concerns about the testing initiative. Their concerns included (1) the possible use of the
tests for tracking students, (2) the prospect that too many students would be excluded from taking
the tests; (3) the prospect that the tests would be used for high stakes purposes without also
relying on additional information from other tests and from classroom performance; (4) the need
to provide parents with information about how they can use test score information to help their
children and to hold school accountable; and, (5) their view that the Education Department
should require participating states and school districts to desegregate the test score results by
school district, school and demographic subgroup.

        While few of these concerns are new or unique to our tests, there are several specific
responses we can make. The Education Department is developing material that will provide
information to parents about how to use the test results. With regard to reporting requirements
for participating states and school districts, while we and the Education Department agree with
the idea of disaggregating the data, we have been reluctant to add specific reporting requirernents
to states or cities that use the tests. Further, it is increasingly common practice among states and
school districts to report disaggregated data at the school and district level, and the Title 1
requirements reinforce this. While we don't think our policy should change, it could be helpful
if your rhetoric about the tests emphasized that the results should be incorporated into school
report cards and used for accountability purposes. You could do this almost immediately -- next
week when a number oflarge cities sign up for the tests, and the following week at NGA

           8. AIDS - Needle Exchange: The House LaborlHHS Subcommittee of Appropriations
    marked up their bill on July 15 without a challenge to the Chairman's mark which preserves the
    waiver authority ofthe Secretary ofHHS. HHS (Kevin Thurm) and the AIDS advocates have
    been assured by the staff directors for Reps. Porter and Obey that no unfriendly amendments are
    expected at full committee. This is great news so far, however we are anxiously watching,
    waiting, and keeping our fingers crossed.

            We are in daily contact with a number of AIDS organizations on this issue and continue
    to assure them that we are prepared to fight to preserve the Secretary's authority should the need
    arise.

            9. AIDS - Decreases in the AIDS Death Rate: On Monday, July 14 the CDC released
    new figures showing a 19% decrease in the AIDS death rate in the first 9 months of 1996,
    compared with the same period in 1995. The CDC attributed these findings to greater access to
    medical care and the development of effective therapies for HIV and associated opportunistic
    infections. The AIDS advocates noted that as AIDS death rates decline, there are increasing
    numbers of individuals living with HIV who require access to these lifesaving interventions.

            We are continuing to emphasize that, while we are delighted with the news of the drop in
    death rates, we must not forget that rates of infection are on the rise in women, people of color,
    and adolescents. The epidemic is not over.

            10. Crime - Juvenile Crime Bill Update: On Tuesday and Thursday, the Senate
    Judiciary Committee met to mark-up S. 10, Senator Hatch's juvenile crime bill. While the
    Committee did not get much work done, it did vote down Senator Kohl's amendment on child
    safety locks by a one-vote margin. Senator Hatch offered to work with Democrats over the
    weekend to limit the number of pending amendments (87) and complete action on S. 10 next
    week.
