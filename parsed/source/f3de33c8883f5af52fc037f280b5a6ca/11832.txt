Good news. We are reaching out to USCM.   If we don't hear from them for
their choices, we are going Rendell, then Richmond.

Update. I just spoke to Nancy on Radio Address. They have a packed House
for Oval and will use Roosevelt Room for overflow. We reached agreement
however, that we would add one mayor to represent them all. I suggest we
invite Rendell but perhaps we should consult with USCM first. How 'bout
you checking with USCM to get three recommendations in priority order
knowing that only one will be in attendance. In any event, I hope to talk


with Rendell today.
