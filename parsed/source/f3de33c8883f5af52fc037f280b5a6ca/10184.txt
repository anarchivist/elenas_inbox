TEXT:
white House staff donated a little over $3200 (in a 2 hour period - - not
bad!) to Doctors Without Borders. The checks/cash were handed over to a
DWB staffer in Nicaragua during HRC's trip.  Thanks for you contribution.

Below is an email I just received from our contact at the organization.

(I'm sure I've left some folks who donated off this e-mail - - I forgot to
keep a list.  Please send this on to the donors on your office staff who I
may have left off this e-mail. Thanks.)

Happy Thanksgiving.

Subject: Thank You!




         Dear Julie and Friends at the White House,

         Thank all of you so very much for your generous support of our efforts
         to aid the victims of Hurricane Mitch!

         All of the Doctors Without Borders volunteers and staff in our offices
         here in New York, as well as those in Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala,
         and even El Salvador, were very moved by the great effort that the
         White House staff made to include us in your Hurricane Mitch fund
    drive.

         Mary Lightfine, the nurse who accepted the donations on behalf of
         Doctors Without Borders, was absolutely thrilled to meet Julie and the
         First Lady in Managua. Right now she is traveling to
         remote regions of Nicaragua to deliver emergency nutritional
         supplements to children in villages hard hit by the hurricane.  If
         you're interested in "following" Mary's work, she is filing a "Journal
         from Nicaragua" with ABC News Online
         [http://www.abcnews.com/sections/living) whenever she has a chance.

         The funds you and the White House staff donated will be used directly
         for our hurricane relief efforts in Nicaragua.   To give you an idea of
         where the money is going, .let me give you a quick overview of our
         emergency operations in Nicaragua. Doctors Without Borders is
         currently using helicopters and four-wheel drive vehicles to deliver
         emergency medical and nutritional aid to populations that have been
         cut off since the hurricane. Last week, 15 Doctors Without Borders
         mobile teams reached victims of the hurricane in the regions of
         Esteli, Nueva Segovia, Chinandega, Jinotega, and Managua.   Several
         teams are based near the volcanoes of Cierro Negro, Las Casitas, and
         San Cristobal, where mudslides have occurred and additional slides are
         possible. The teams are distributing medical kits, high-energy protein
         supplements, and relief materials, including blankets, plastic
         sheeting, and water cans, to displaced people in these regions.    In
         addition, Doctors Without Borders is installing water tanks and water
         chlorination systems.  Fifty-seven tons of relief supplies have
         already arrived in Managua, and additional supplies are being
         purchased locally.

         It is the overwhelming support of people like yourselves and many
         others allover the United States and the rest of the world that are
         making our relief effort possible. And, just as important as your
         generous financial donation, is the boost to the spirit that your·
         visit and gesture gave to our many relief workers in Nicaragua and
         throughout Central America. We sent word to all of our offices there
         about your gift.

         Thank you again for all that you did to make this possible.

         Best wishes for a happy and healthy Thanksgiving!

         Kris Torgeson on behalf of the entire staff of Doctors Without Borders
         USA
