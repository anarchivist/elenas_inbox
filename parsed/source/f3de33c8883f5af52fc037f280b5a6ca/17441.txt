I think we need some more discussion to address the questions Sylvia
posses below. Based on further conversations I've had with the USCM and
the experience of the Detroit Summit last week, I would like to meet this
week to see if we can reach agreement so a larger meeting can be convened
by Sylvia to move forward. Please let me know if you have some other
suggestions for addressing these issues you'd like to express before the
meeting. I will ask Suzanne Dale to schedule. Thanks.

The only question I have about having a meeting now is has enough work
been done to try to answer some of the fundamental questions:

Who should attend?
what would be the theme? Responsibility in Schools?
What is the objective of the conference?

IF you think we are far enough along on these questions, please let me
know and I will call a meeting.

Subject:         Public Schools

I met with Mayor Paul Helmke (R-Ft. Wayne, IN), president of the US Conf.
of Mayors, DeeDee Corradini (D-Salt Lake City), vice president of USCM,
and Tom Cochran, executive director, USCM yesterday to discuss a number of
   ,.
issues of cncern to them and the White House. Regarding a possible WH
Conference on Public Schools, I indicated that we are actively considering
their proposal and it seemed clear to me that any such conference would
need the involvement of a number of major stakeholders in education (more
than mayors). They mentioned superintendents, school boards, and teacher
organizations as perhaps logical but caution against too many. They also
do not want to get lost in the crowd.

Sylvia, I think we need you to play the "honest broker" role in the next
discussion of a WH Conference on Public Schools. I suggest we insist on
attendance from Bruce or Elena, Gene, Ann, Leg.Affairs,Maria, Mike Cohen,
and me to get the issues on the table. I sense from our last discussion of
this issue at our message meeting yesterday,   there is angst relative to
the role of Mayors and the ownership DPC and NEC feel about the issue of
education in general.

 I think you are the best bet for bringing closure to a decision ---yes or
no for a conference. And if yes, I'm very confident everyone's concerns
can be addressed by a planning group led by DPC. I strongly believe the
conference should occur, preferably in April after all the Washinton
winter meetings of the intergovernmental groups are concluded and that
the USCM should playa prominent role. However, I think it would be
difficult for IGA to play the lead role. If you think differently, I'd
like a chance to discuss this with you. Thanks for all your support.
