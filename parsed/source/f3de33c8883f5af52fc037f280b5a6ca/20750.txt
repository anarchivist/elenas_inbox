TEXT:
1. In mid-August, the prestigious National Academy of Science is supposed
to release a report on the utility of a single food agency. We are
starting to get rumors of what it will say.  It is likely to get some
attention.

2.    The report is likely to be very critical of the current food safety
regulatory structure, particularly that USDA has a lot of money but little
authority and FDA little money, but much authority.

3. The report will suggest four options:   1. create a WH food czar who
puts out a single food safety budget; 2. put either USDA or FDA in charge;
3. create a single food agency like EPA; or 4.   designate one agency as
the lead on the issue.

4. We have been pushing the agencies to come up with some more movement
on creating a "virtual food agency" that could be announced in August--
advances like the research institute the President announced that combine
FDA and USDA in other areas. Already there is a working group on the
budget which it might make sense to institutionalize in a formal structure
and require a formal annual plan. Is there any interest in option of "1"
of the NAS report -- creating a coordinating food safety czar?
