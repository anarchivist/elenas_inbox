TEXT:
The President has asked the core question raised by these studies.  The
President asked why could there not be population based controls; i.e.
women who did not receive AZT who are in the general population in stead
of a Placebo control.

Answer:

The research design of all of the studies made the following assumptions
in deciding on the final methodology.  The state of the epidemic in each
of the host countries is acute and unchecked;  the number of children
impacted by HIV is increasing; there is no chance of resources being
identified to pay for the known and effective therapy of AZT perinatally.
 To maximize the ability to identify effective therapeutic interventions
at the earliest possible time, the control groups were deliberately
defined as the local standard of care, which is the equivalent of no AZT
or placebo.  This methodologic approach allows for the earliest possible
identification of a statistical difference between the treatment arms, and
thereby minimizes exposure times to ineffective therapies for those in the
study.
The question gets to the heart of the ethical concern.  If it were not for
the "extreme" context, this experimental design would not be justifiable.
