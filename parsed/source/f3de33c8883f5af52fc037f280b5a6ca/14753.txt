Oops, sorry.   I dido' t think I sent that yet.

I set Elena an e-mail on Friday night and left Kathy a phone message
regarding a meeting I set up with Public Citizen and Citizen Action for
2:30pm on Wednesday, March 12. I have not gotten a room yet.

Here are my questions:

Can you both attend?

Is there someone else who should be invited, also?
