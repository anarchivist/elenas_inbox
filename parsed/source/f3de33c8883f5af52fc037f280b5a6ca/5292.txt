TEXT:
They're checking their calculations ..... but Michael Kharfen says it looks
like caseloads fell another 236,000 from June to July ... a 27% drop since
1/93 to 10,258,000.

I want to get them to do state-by-state color map.        Do we want:

           1) Case load drop since August '96   (over 1.9 million)

           2) Caseload drop since January '93    (over 3.8 million)

        3) Or both (if you choose this option, you have to give me a
priority of #1 and #2).

I think I'd rather have #1, since it shows momentum since signing (as do
the rest of the announcements)
