MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:         Bruce Reed
              Elena Kagan

RE:           DPC Weekly Report



        1. Smart Guns: The Justice Department is ready to announce a $500,000 grant to the
Colt Company in Connecticut to finish the development of the "Smart Gun." A smart gun can
only be fired by the owner when the owner is wearing a wrist band. This technology will deter
accidental shootings and gun theft and is a major breakthrough in the gun control debate. The
Justice Department currently has a prototype that can be exhibited. We need to announce this in
the near future and would recommend a Radio address.


        2. Washington State Request for Food Stamp Waiver: You asked about a recent
Cabinet Affairs report that the Department of Agriculture denied Washington state's request to
waive the food stamp three-month time limit for those pursuing their graduate equivalency
diplomas. The welfare law limits food stamp benefits to only three months in a three-year
period for non-disabled childless adults between the ages of 18-50 who are not working. The
law also allows USDA to waive that requirement at state request in areas where unemployment
rates exceed 10% and areas with insufficient jobs.

         USDA debated whether this language allowed them to go beyond strictly geographical
criteria to exempt individuals who had not completed high school (on the theory that a person
without a high school diploma did not have access to an adequate job), or to use some other
educational criteria. They concluded that the law did not give them such authority, and that
Congress would likely react very negatively if they were to interpret the law in this way. USDA
now awards waivers based on geographical criteria such as labor surplus areas as defined by the
Bureau of Labor Statistics. Therefore, Washington's waiver request clearly fell outside of the
bounds of the waiver program they have been running. However, 40 states have gotten waivers
from USDA exempting certain areas. Washington has already gotten approval for all or part of
24 counties and 7 Indian reservations.

       3. National Standards and Testing Initiative: We are continuing to identify states to
sign up for the 4th and 8th grade testing initiative. Gov. Weld announced -- at an education

                                                               Automated Records Management System
                                                                       Hex-Dump Conversion
initiative. Last week the West Virginia State Board of Education voted to participate; the State
Board is now working to secure Gov. Underwood's support as well. Secretary Riley has recently
met with Gov. Carnahan in Missouri and Gov. Dean in Vermont, and believes that both states
will be willing to sign up shortly. New York State Commissioner of Education Rick Mills is
working to secure the support of the State Board of Regents and Gov. Pataki. We believe this
may be possible by early June. We expect to identify several additional states in the coming
weeks, and to propose a White House event to highlight the participation of this new group of
states.

         4. Incentives for A Career in Teaching: In preparation for the Service Summit, DPC is
working with the Education Department to develop an initiative, similar to the Police Corps, that
would provide incentives for young people to make a career of service as school teachers. This
initiative will likely target inner city and possibly rural schools where the shortage of well
prepared teachers is the greatest, and provide scholarships or other financial incentives to attract
and retain well prepared individuals.

        5. Child Support Enforcement: We have three child support enforcement
announcements that we would like to combine into a radio address for May 3rd or May 10th.
First, we are ready to transmit to Congress the 20th Annual Report to Congress on Child Support
Enforcement prepared by HHS which shows that from 1992 to 1996 child support collections
increased by 50%, from $8 billion to a record $12 billion; the number of paternities established
nearly doubled increasing from 516,000 to nearly one million; and the number of child support
cases with collections rose to 4 million, an increase of 43 percent, from 2.8 million.

       Second, as a result of the Executive Order you signed on September 28, 1996, the
Treasury Department has just notified the first 123,000 delinquent parents that their federal
payments will be seized for past due child support. Thousands more payments will be seized as
Treasury adds more types offederal payments and more states to its new system (the 123,000 are
from just three states and the District of Columbia).

         Third, in response to a directive you issued to the Attorney General on July 21, 1996, we
are ready to transmit to Congress legislation which would establish felony violations for certain
egregious actions taken to avoid paying child support. The legislation would make it a felony
offense to 1) travel in interstate or foreign commerce with the intent to evade a support obligation
that is greater than $5,000 or has remained unpaid for longer than one year; 2) willfully fail to
pay a support obligation regarding a child residing in another state if the obligation has remained
unpaid for two years or is greater than $10,000. The language is a revised version of language
the Department of Justice sent to the Hill at the end of the 104th Congress.

       6. Study on Crime Prevention -- This week the Justice Department released a
comprehensive study, requested by Congress, on federal crime prevention funding. The study
received a fair amount of press because it concluded that many prevention programs, including
DARE, midnight basketball and others, have little impact. It recommends directing funding to
urban neighborhoods where youth violence is highly concentrated and concludes that targeting




                                                       Automated Records Management System
                                                               Hex·DiJmp Conversion
And in what some might consider self-serving, the authors, who are University of Maryland
researchers, recommend that 10% of all funding for crime prevention should be used to conduct
program evaluations.

        Although this report was interpreted by some as an indictment of prevention programs, it
in many respects supports the direction the Administration has taken: it supports additional
policing and prison drug treatment; it found formula and block grants to be less effective than
discretionary grants; and your Anti-Gang and Youth Violence Bill would reserve 10% of juvenile
justice grants for research on program effectiveness.

      In addition, you should be aware that the Department of Education is currently working
with DARE to improve their curriculum in light of recent criticisms of the program.
