TEXT:
does the conrad bill still direct funding of what we call the unresticted
state pool to health care and require HHS approval? if so, and we say nice
things about the bill, govs will go nuts.

on talking to dem govs: you wiill be invited to talk to them in person the
Saturday of NGA ( Feb 21) at the DGA meeting. clearly we have to do this.
they want to do something fact-to face~-not on the phone. we should think
over the next week if there is anything we can throw their way.
