TEXT:
I'm in the market for a new assistant, since Jonathan is going over to
Treasury.  A Kevin Moran/Melissa Green type is what I have in mind.  If
anyone's got any bright ideas of a smart, young, organized person who'd
staff the front desk and have an opportunity to soak up some climate
change politics and policy, please let me know.  tds
