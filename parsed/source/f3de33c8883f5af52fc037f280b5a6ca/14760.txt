 TEXT:
 In preparing for tomorrow's meeting:

 1.   Think about the bottom line: What is the message we want to convey
as a result of the conference ?     What is the phrase or sentence that
reaches to the largest number of people with the most imprtant point ?
         Is the longer explanation that new research makes clear the
importance of the early (0 to 3) years to the development of the brain and
thus the lifelong ability to learn ? What else ?
        "Our ability to learn -at school and at work - depends on (how our
brain develops) (How our brain is nourished)  when we are very young.
That's why it's so important that   ......... "
       "Just as we give babies vitamins for their bodies, we want to be
sure they're getting the best nutrition for their brains .... "
     Jim Hunt is already using Smart Start , I think. Does his program
begin this early? What about:                        " We want to encourage
parents to give their baby the Right Start...     or "Give your baby the
Right Start

     2. I agree with your to-do list: thinking about communications in
 three phases: Pre, Day of and follow -up. You mentioned a Report to be
 issued. Do we have funding for a professional looking report or summary ?
 What aout other forms of reports: a video that can be distributed to right
.audinces (eg professionals, parents, etc.) Given the success of HRC's
 taping of her book, could we do an audio tape that parents could play in
 their car ?

 See you all tomorrow.
