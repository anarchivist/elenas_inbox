TEXT:
We've been working with NPR staff to develop a strong VP event to mark the
one-year anniversary of the federal welfare to work hiring initiative.
They're now ready to do a VP scheduling memo and would like to be able to
say DPC supports it. We think this has good potential--do you agree?
The event would happen sometime in March or early April to correspond with
the March 8th radio address or the April 9th cabinet meeting last year.
The VP would announce our success to date (should be well over 3,000
recipients by then), release a first year report to the President,
challenge federal contractors to do their part in hiring welfare
recipients, and set some kind of goal for Cabinet secretaries to do more
in working with their contractors in 1998.
We see a panel with several Cabinet secretaries who have done the most to
reach out to contractors (Pena and Cohen are most likely), along with one
or two businesses who are federal contractors and have hired welfare
recipients.   In the audience, several hundred contractors, primarily from
D.C. area, invited by each Cabinet secretary.
We'd also like to involve someone from the Partnership Board--you may
remember that at the Nov. 19th meeting in the Roosevelt Room, Greenwald
talked about how United had reached out to their suppliers and thought the
federal government should do the same (encourage not coerce).
We hope the partnership will take an active role. Lyn is checking on
their level of enthusiasm and how this fits in their priorities.   If
nothing else,   the contractors in the room should be encouraged to sign up
with the Partnership.
