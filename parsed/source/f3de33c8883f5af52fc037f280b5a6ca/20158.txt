                         Modified Gramm Amendment Would Consume
                    Nearly 80 Percent of Tobacco Revenues Between 2008-2022


 Background note: This is based on OMB's analysis of receipts under the McCain bill.

. Talking Points:

          I strongly urge you to vote against the Gramm amendment because it would prevent the
        . legislation from achieving important health goals.

         Over the first four years, the Gramm amendment would spend $13 billion for tax cuts, or
         28 percent of the $45.7 billion in spending under the McCain bill. If funding for states
         and farmers is held constant, funding for public health and research would be reduced by
         67 percent.

         Over the next five years, the Gramm amendment would spend an additional $30 billion
         on tax cuts, or 42 percent of the $71.1 billion in the McCain bill allocated for spending.
         If states and farmers get first priority in terms of funding, the amendment would
         completely eliminate all funding for public. health and medical research during those
         years.

 ·       Between 2008 and 2022, the Gramm amendment explodes: it would absorb $225 billion,
         or 78 percent, of the $289.5 billion in the McCain bill allocated for spending. If states
         and farmers get first priority in terms of funding, the amendment would completely
         eliminate all funding for public health and medical research during those years. Funding
         for the states would by reduced by 62 percent, and funding for farmers would be reduced
         by 57 percent.

         The Gramm amendment would thus eviscerate funding for critical public health programs
       . such as smoking cessation, education and counteradvertising. This would significantly
         unqermine efforts to reduce youth smoking in this country and help adults who want to
         quit. Critical funding for medical research would also be cut drastically, including
         research into smoking-related diseases such as cancer and heart disease.

         Additionally, States would be expected to forgo their claims in court and receive, in
         exchange, minimal compensation for their enormous expenditures related to
         smoking-related illnesses. Funding would also be significantly reduced for tobacco
         farmers, who have done nothing wrong and who deserve to be compensated for the losses
         they will suffer as a result of tobacco legislation.
