MEMORANDUM FOR LEON PANETTA

FROM:         Bruce Reed                            Michael Waldman
              Paul Weinstein                        Jim Weber

SUBJECT:Possible Q&A on President's Campaign Finance Reform Announcement


QUESTION: What exactly is the President proposing?

RESPONSE: The President today is calling on Congress to pass the bipartisan campaign finance
reform legislation introduced last session by Senators McCain and Feingold. The principles of
McCain-Feingold are ones the President has advocated since he first ran for office in 1992 and are
the key elements of real reform: spending limits; curbing PACs and lobbying influence; free and
discounted broadcast time; and ending the "soft money" system.

The President is challenging Congress to enact this legislation in the first six months of the 105th
Congress. He is committed to working closely with the leadership of both parties in achieving this
goal. However, if the Congress cannot find the political will to pass this bipartisan bill, then as a
last resort, the President will support legislation to establish a binding campaign finance reform
commission that will send comprehensive reform legislation to his desk by the end of 1997.

The President also announced today that he agrees with Senators McCain and Feingold that
non-citizens should not be able to influence our elections. From now on, the President will only
support campaign finance reform that includes the following rule: if you are a non-citizen and can't
vote, you can't contribute.

QUESTION: Why are you announcing this now?

RESPONSE: This announcement is consistent with the President's long-standing commitment to
campaign finance reform and to changing business as usual in Washington. In the last three years,
the President repealed the tax loophole for lobbyist deductions, enacted legislation to make the
Congress and the White House live by the same laws Washington applies to rest of the nation,
signed legislation to require lobbyists to disclose how much they spend and what they spend it on,
enacted the line-Item Veto, and made it easier for millions of Americans to register to vote.

In 1992, the President made campaign finance reform a central piece of his agenda and throughout
his first term he pressed the Congress to pass real, bipartisan legislation.

QUESTION: Both parties have been unable to resolve the campaign finance reform issue for
                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion

years, why should the American people expect you and Congress to take action next term?

RESPONSE: Last Congress we enacted Lobbying Disclosure, the Gift Ban, Congressional
Accountability Act, the Line-Item Veto. We have a proven track record of getting the job done on
political reform. Campaign finance reform is the last step, and most important step. The President
believes that the Congress should and must make passage of McCain-Feingold a priority. He is
challenging Congress to pass the bipartisan McCain-Feingold bill in the first six months of the
105th Congress, and not deny the American people any longer. If that fails, he will challenge
Congress to create a bipartisan commission whose recommendations will become law on a
fast-track basis.

QUESTION: There has been a lot of controversy about foreign contributions to the DNC. Do
you think it is wrong to accept contributions from non-citizens?

RESPONSE: The system is broken, and needs to be fixed. The voting public must have
confidence that the process is fair and works for them. That is why we agree with Senators McCain
and Feingold that real, bipartisan campaign finance reform must include effective limitations on
non-citizen contributions. If you are a non-citizen and can't vote you should not be allowed to
contribute.

QUESTION: Does your support for limitations on non-citizen contributions mean that you will
direct the DNC to stop taking such contributions immediately and return those contributions
received this elections cycle?

RESPONSE: No. It is clear, that the system is broken and that the rules need to be changed. We
support banning these contributions by law. We need quick action by Congress on this issue as part
of comprehensive, bipartisan campaign finance reform. We will discourage those contributions
beginning immediately.

QUESTION: How will you enforce this ban, and how broad will it be? For example, would the
ban include U.S. subsidiaries offoreign-owned corporations?

RESPONSE: Many of the specific details of the ban would have to be worked out with Congress.
However, the principle is clear, if you are a non-citizen and can't vote, you can't contribute --
individual contributors would have to certify citizenship.

With regards to corporate contributions, the McCain-Feingold bill would ban PACs and eliminate
the current "soft money" system. Therefore, no corporate entity, foreign or domestic, could make a
Federal campaign contribution.

QUESTION: If you believe it is wrong to acceptforeign campaign contributions, is it wrong to
accept non-citizen contributions to your legal defense fund?

RESPONSE: The President's Legal Defense Fund does not accept contributions from registered
lobbyists and PACs. In addition, contributions are limited to $1,000. (Additional recommended
response is: "In the future, the President's legal defense fund will not accept contributions from
                                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion

foreign donors.)

QUESTION: Aren't you, by endorsing the bipartisan commission as a fallback position,
undermining any real hope that McCain-Feingold will pass?

RESPONSE: The President has been and remains a strong supporter of McCain-Feingold, and
believe the principles of that legislation are the key elements of real reform: spending limits;
curbing PAC and lobbying influence; free and discounted broadcast time; and ending the "soft
money" system. He supports a bipartisan commission only as a last resort, if the Congress lacks the
political will to pass McCain Feingold.

QUESTION: Will this be a number one priority for your administration?

RESPONSE: This will be a key priority in the President's second term. He has long felt that this is
one of the most important issues facing the American political system. We must restore the faith of
the American people in their political leadership in order to build a bridge to the 21 st century.

QUESTION: How does your plan compare with Bob Dole's?

RESPONSE: The President supports the bipartisan McCain-Feingold bill. When he was in the
Senate, Bob Dole opposed that legislation. While Senator Dole introduced a bill to create a
campaign finance reform commission immediately, the President supported efforts to pass real,
bipartisan campaign finance reform. The President continues to support McCain-Feingold, and
calls on Congress to pass this legislation in the first six months of the next term. However, if
Congress cannot find the political will to pass McCain-Feingold, then as a last resort he supports
creating a binding, bipartisan commission that will send a real campaign finance reform bill to his
desk by the end of next year. However, Senator Dole and the President do agree that non-citizens
should not be able to contribute to campaigns for federal office and that we must end the current
"soft money" system.

QUESTION: How would your plan to ban campaign contributionsfromforeigners impact
unincorporated partnerships?

RESPONSE: Contributions from unincorporated partnerships would be pro-rated and counted
against the $1,000 individual contribution limit of each partner. For example, if a partnership of
ten individuals made a $1,000 contribution to a campaign, $100 would be counted against the
contribution limit of each partner. If a non-citizen was a member of a partnership, a greater share
of the contribution would count against the $1,000 limit of the other partners. A partnership which
is owned by a majority of non-citizens should be prohibited from making contributions.

QUESTION: How would the ban on non-citizen contributions affect entities, such as unions,
that collect funds for independent political expenditures?

RESPONSE: Independent political expenditures would not be covered by the ban on campaign
contributions by non-citizens. Independent political expenditures would have to be addressed
separately from the contributions issue.
                                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion


QUESTION: How would tire McCain-Feingold bill be impacted by tire Supreme Court's decision
in Colorado Republican Campaign Committee vs. the FEC?

RESPONSE: [Counsel's Office drafting response]

QUESTION: Doesn't a ban on Federal campaign contributions from non-citizens violate the
First Amendment of tire Constitution?

RESPONSE: [Counsel's Office drafting response]

QUESTION: How would your campaign finance reform plan Irave prevented the contributions
tlrat have caused the recent controversy?

RESPONSE: I believe it is inappropriate to comment on some of those specific incidents because
they are currently under the jurisdiction of the courts. With regards to future elections, passage of
McCain-Feingold and the President's proposal to prohibit contributions from non-citizens will
greatly insure that the people's interest are protected.
