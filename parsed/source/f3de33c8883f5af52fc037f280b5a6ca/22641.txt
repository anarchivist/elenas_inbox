TEXT:
I have a different thought on the visibility call for Monday. Our big
visibility effort for this week is the University of Maryland event on
Wednesday.  And all of us are focused on getting that done as well as
possible.  I wonder if we can do the following:

 1.   Transform this call into a check-in call on the Wednesday event; and

 2. Move it earlier in the day so that based on what gets discussed and
 decided, there is an opportunity to follow-up on Monday.

 Is this possible.   Let us know.   Thanks.   JG
