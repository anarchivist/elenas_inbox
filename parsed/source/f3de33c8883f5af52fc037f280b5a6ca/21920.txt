TEXT:
A study of abortion services is being by released by Alan Guttmacher
Institute today, embargoed until Friday, which has two main findings of
interest:

l)The number of dilation and extraction procedures (the recognized medical
procedure which most closely resembles "partial birth")  performed in 1996
was estimated to be 650 out of a total of 1.36 million abortions. This is
similar to the number AGI put out at the begininng of the late-term
debate.

2)There has been a sharp decline (14% between 1992 and 1996) in the
overall number of facilities providing abortions. The decline occured
primarily in hospitals and physician practices (ie, not in clinics). This
is a drop of 85 providers per year, compared to a drop of 51 per year
between 1998 and 1992.

I'm not recommending any immediate follow-up but wanted to make you all
aware that these numbers would be out there.

I have copies of the study for those who are interested.
