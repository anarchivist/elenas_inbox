               President Clinton: Fighting for a Drug-Free America
                                December 11, 1997

Shielding America's Frontiers (rom the Drug Threat

Record Coast Guard Interdictions: In FY 1997, the Coast Guard- the nation's lead agency
for maritime drug interdiction -- seized or assisted in the seizure of more cocaine than ever
before.

·      The Coast Guard, in conjunction with other U.S. law enforcement agencies, seized
       103,617 pounds of cocaine -- more than triple the previous year's total. Moreover,
       the Coast Guard increased their arrests of drug traffickers by a stunning 1000%.

Increased Department of Defense Funding for Drug Control: Despite reports that the
Department of Defense planned to cut funding for its drug control budget, the Department
is proposing to increase its FY 99 drug budget request by $73 million.

·      The Department will use increased funding to: enhance source country interdiction
       efforts, primarily in Peru; carry out our international commitments to assist the
       Caribbean nations with maritime interdiction efforts; and work with Mexico to
       assist them in establishing their own interdiction capabilities.

Reducing Drug-Related Crime and Violence

Expanding High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas (HIDTAs): Recent crime data show that
drug-related crime is in decline. To further build our efforts to combat drug-related crime
and counter drug trafficking, Drug Director Barry McCaffrey and members of Congress
announced the formation of the Central Florida High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area.

·      The HIDT A program provides federal assistance to better coordinate and enhance
       counter-drug law enforcement, from the local to the federal level, in critical areas
       where drug production, manufacturing, importation, or distribution flourish. This
       newest HIDTA will bring the total number of designated areas to 23- 18 of which
       have been created under the Clinton Administration.

Educating Our Youth to Reject Drugs

The $195 Million National Anti-Drug Youth Media Campaign: The number one priority in
the President's 1997 National Drug Control Strategy is to motivate our kids to reject the
use of illegal drugs. Recently, the President signed into law funding to launch the
campaign.

·      The $195 million National Anti-Drug Youth Media Campaign will use the full force
       of the media --from prime time television to the Internet to sports marketing -to
       educate kids and parents about the dangers of drugs. The campaign will begin

                                                                Automated Records Management System
                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion

     next month with ads in 12 pilot cities across the nation and eventually move
     nationwide.
