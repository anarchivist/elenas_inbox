TEXT:
In case you don't already know, the Senate has 4 hours of debate on
Partial Birth bill, and then they will vote tomorrow.  Durbin is
introducing a substitute amendment which will include the Daschle language
from last year in addition to a provision requiring a women to get a
second opinion (ie. a second doctor must certify that the procedure is
necessary to protect a woman's life or from greivous harm).  I don't think
Durbin has decided yet whether or not to bring it up for a vote,  I'll
keep you posted.
