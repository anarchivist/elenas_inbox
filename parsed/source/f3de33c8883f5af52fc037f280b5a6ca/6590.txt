TEXT:
The Catholic Health Association brought to Chris and my attention a
situation that we thought you should be aware of regarding HCFAs
interpretation that managed care risk plans be required to certify that
they would cover medically necessary, elective abortions in order to
quali'fy as a Medicare risk plan. CHA has been given inconsistent reports
from HCFA regarding whether and when HCFA requires a health plan to
certify coverage of elective abortions . . A requirement to certify coverage
of elective abortions would create an enormous problem for CH plans when
they apply to HCFA to be certified as a Medicare+Choice plan.

Catholic health plans should not be excluded from participation in the
Medicare risk plan program or the· Medicare+choice program because of their
religious belief that the provision or coverage of abortion is morally
wrong.

CHA is getting pressure from the pro life side.  CHA has asked chris for
some written letter from someone.  Chris thought we may want to do a call
or meeting on the issue.
