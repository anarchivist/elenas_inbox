TEXT:
The Journal carried an item today indicating that Conrad is working on a
compromise and Ford thinks he has 50 votes.

1. Conrad has said pretty consistently that he wants less money in the
overall LEAF package, and some money for ND farmers -- particularly those
in emmergency situations. He and Ford have been confidentially
negotiating some money for farm staters and I think that is what the
Journal is referring to.  Tom Mahre said there is no compromise, he thiks
that is what the Journal is talking about. A move in this direction is
necessary to hold our D's, most likely, but it won't increase our overall
vote count (doesn't take from the Lugar total).

2. The Journal says Ford thinks he has 50. Ford is saying he thinks he
will probably hold the 45 D's, he's got 3 publicly committed R's, and so
needs one or two R's depending on whether Lott and/or Faircloth abstain.

3. We need a way to break up the Lugar coalition. One idea is to get a
vote on whether, should Lugar pass, the bill will require $6 billion of
spending or $2.1 billion as indicated in Title IV.  If it is $2 billion,
McConnell and Helms etc. could not support Lugar, if it is $6 billion it
would presumably make it much harder for Jeffords, Chafee. We need to
explore this.  Lugar is said to be considering some options on spending,
either a separate excise tax dedicated to farmers or suggesting the money
come out of the budget surplus.  This is rumor.

4.   We are still working to build a compromise.  Ford does think he will
win, if he loses he thinks that is the time to offer the compromise.
