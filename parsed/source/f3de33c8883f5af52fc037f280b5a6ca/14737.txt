sorry to do this, but we need to postpone the Head Start meeting until
tomorrow.

I talked w/ Golden's office and 5:00p works for them (follows the Reed
Weekly Welfare Reform meeting) .

Elena -- does this work for you?
Melissa - I'm not sure who you may have forwarded this message to on your
staff.  Please let me   know who plans on attending this meeting
(wallman? )

thanks.
