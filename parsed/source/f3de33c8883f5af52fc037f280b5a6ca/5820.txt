TEXT:
FYI. The meeting yesterday with Cabinet Affairs, PIR and National Service
Corporation went well. The folks from the Corporation are going to
coordinate with Bibb and Audrey to link Cabinet and Board members to
service projects on the 19th, likely both MLK grant sites and other
Americorps sites. By the end of next week, the Corporation is going to
get us a more comprehensive list of all Americorps sites where service
could happen on the day (right now, we only have the list of MLK grant
sites). Also, the Corporation is going to try to identify key sites (a
sort of top 10 or 20 list) where it would be most helpful to have a
Cabinet presence (because of a link to a member of Congress who might be
helpful for purposes of Americorps reauthorization next year)/

Andrew Mayock (from Chief of Staff's office) was also present, and stated
that he wanted to get White House staff involved also in serving on the
day. Julie from the Corporation is going to check on the capacity at the
various D.C. serVice sites.

Talking points on service for the Cabinet and Board members are being
coordinated by Stacey and the Corporation .. Also, the PIR is going to put
together a one-page questionnaire for all who participate in service on
the 19th that will allow them to doa preliminary evaluation of whether
the site is a "promising practice" for purposes of the PIR compilation.

That's it.    Happy New Year.
