TEXT:
Can you call me ASAP about this? Editing changed the draft I gave them
(provided by Elizabeth Drye and cleared by you).    Is their final version
OK?!? The draft I gave was much more tentative "The recent settlement
agreement proposed by ... provides another potential opportunity ... " This
says "I believe the agreement is an opportunity." This is about to be
sent to Gov. Glendening and Gov. Locke -- Let me know if I need to stop
it. Thanks. Sarah x65514

editied version of settlement letter
Thank you for your letter regarding the proposed tobacco settlement.
I appreciate knowing your views on this important issue.

I believe this agreement is an opportunity to build on the progress we
have already made in protecting our children from tobacco.  I have
asked my domestic policy advisor, Bruce Reed, and the Secretary of
Health and Human Services, Donna Shalala, to review the agreement
carefully, to listen to public health experts, and to help me ensure
that any agreement that goes forward is in the best interest of the
public health, especially the health of our children.

As we review the agreement, I will keep your views in mind, and I hope
you will remain involved as we work to create a healthier future for
our children.
