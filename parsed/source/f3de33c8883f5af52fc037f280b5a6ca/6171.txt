    TEXT:
    Everyone at the Partnership is jumping for joy over the State of the Union
    and Eli said to say thanks to everyone.

    Eli would like the President to send a personally signed letter to the
    five founding companies and a more mass produced one to all 3000 companies
    (they would take care of production). They will of course will have
    suggested language.  It sounds like a pretty good idea to me -- what do
    you think? In any case, I'm getting a more detailed update on what the
    founding five companies have done -- UPS has hired 8,268 'welfare
    recipients in the last year -- for a possible weekly item.
    Eli would also like to give the President a perso~al briefing on their
    success to date.
