TEXT:
There are two very technical child support rules that will go final
between now and Aug. 22nd (both were proposed in March in nearly the same
form).  Both relate to the $400 million provided in the Personal
Responsibility Act for child support computer systems. One simply
finalizes the state formula for the funds.  The other specifies what sort
of Advanced Planning Document states must submit in order to get these
funds.  Under Keith Fontenot's guidance, OMB added safeguards to the rule
last March to try to head off future state state computer systems
problems, requiring states to meet milestones of progress to continue to
get funds and to obtain review from independent computer systems experts.
