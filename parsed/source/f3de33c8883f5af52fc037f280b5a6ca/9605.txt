TEXT:
I wanted to clarify what is in the Moynihan bill.  (This morning, I
confused it with another recently introduced "family" bill.)  The bill is
based on a set of proposals by James Q. Wilson and would:

1.      Provide support for "second chance" maternity homes for unwed
teen mothers;
2.      Promote adoption by increasing the number of children eligible
for federal adoption assistance and by encouraging states to test a "per
capita" approach in child welfare (ie., the states give agencies a fixed
sum for each child, thereby providing an incentive to find a permanent
placement quickly);
3.      Fund early childhood development programs, including preschool
and home visiting; and
4.      Creating education assistance to help parents stay at home with
their young children and help them later enter the workforce.
