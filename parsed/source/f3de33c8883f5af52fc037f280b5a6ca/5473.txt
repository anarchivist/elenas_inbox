TEXT:
Rob Weiner just told me the following:  OLC has informed HHS that they
think their proposed definition of federal public benefits is "not
tenable." HHS has therefore gone back to the drawing board.   Presumably
they will run their next proposal by OLC.

HHS may choose to consider Rob's suggested reading of the law, but OLC has
not expressed an opinion on that reading yet (nor were they asked to) .
