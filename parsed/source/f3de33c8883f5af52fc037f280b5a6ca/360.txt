It is true that the meeting tomorrow turned out to be on a
different subject -- cost neutrality or something. However, I
spoke with Judy Chesser about the imperative that this move along
and we leapt into action and have scheduled a meeting at 2pm
tomorrow in rm 211.  SSA is making the calls and will provide us
with a list of attendees.   That is all I have for now on this.
Also, the SSA POMS have finally arrived and they are huge.   Do you
want copies?
thanks
