TEXT:
The more I think about Chris's calls for brainstorming meetings, the less
clear I am about its purpose:

1. Is the thinking that POTUS will put out a race book sometime this fall
with "bold new proposals" in education, crime, etc?   If so, how would this
fit with (1) last year's bold new proposals that haven't been enacted yet
(e.g., class size, zones) (2) the bold ideas from the year before that
haven't been enac ted yet and mayor may not be before Congress adjourns
(e.g., school construction, America reads), (3) the bold new ideas we will
invent this Fall, as part of the Budget process, and" as part of the effort
to reauthorize all federal K-12 education programs?     Brainstorming
without understanding how what we do would fit into this context isn't
going to get us very far.

2.  I know from my brief conversation with him that Chris is thinking
about Presidential challenges to states along two related lines:   (1)
school finance equity and (2) opportunity-to-learn standards, by which he
means having states in some fashion define and guarantee to provide the
necessary inputs to education (qualified teachers, textbooks/ computers,
safe buildings, etc.). Do you know if he has anything else in mind?

3. More generally, is there any guidance on the extent to which this book
is supposed to be programmatic vs bully pulpit?

Subject: hi there



I'm anxious about getting the brainstorming efforts on crime and education
going this week. I'm in Boston on Wednesday, back Wednesday evening.

We don't have tons of time, but DPC has the lead on these issues, so
