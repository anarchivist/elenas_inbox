Subject: Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA)


This memo provides you with background on two issues concerning the Individuals with
Disabilities Education Act (IDEA): the potential controversy surrounding the publication of the
IDEA regulations; and the criticism by the National Governors Association and others that the
federal government does not adequately support the cost of educating students with disabilities.

General Background

The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) Amendments of 1997 substantially
reflected the Administration's own reauthorization proposals, and were the result of substantial
negotiation with Hill leadership. The reauthorization retained the civil rights component of the
law, in place since the mid 1970's, by still requiring States to provide all children with disabilities
a "free appropriate public education" (FAPE) designed to meet their individual needs. This
requirement was an is without regard to the cost of the services or the size of the federal
appropriation. These amendments added a focus on improving educational outcomes for
children with disabilities. For instance, these amendments required States to develop
educational achievement goals for children with disabilities, and include children with
disabilities on State and district-wide assessments.

The IDEA has always been controversial because it imposes prescriptive and costly
administrative mandates on States, and because States want the federal government to pay a
larger share of their costs.

IDEA Regulations

The 1997 reauthorization made a number of significant changes in the law, and has been the
subject of a lengthy and contentious regulatory development process. The Department of
Education plans to publish these regulations in final in early March (publication is being delayed
pending final review of the issues). While the NGA did not comment on the proposed
regulations issued in October 1997, some individual Governors did. States have been concerned
with the fact that, consistent with the law, the extensive and complex regulations do not relieve
the States of administrative burden.                                                            '

In response to over 6,000 comments on the Department of Education's first draft of the
regulations, which were published for public comment in October 1997, the Department made an
effort across the board to ease the requirements proscribed in the regulations, and to make the
regulations easier to understand. For instance, the Department removed the extensive notes they
had included in the regulations that tried to clarify the regulatory language. Critics argued that
these actually made it more difficult to understand the regulation, and that they had questionable
                                                                            Hex-Dump Conversion
legal weight. To rectify this problem, in many cases the Department simply incorporated the
language in the notes into the regulation itself.

The Department's main changes to the regulations were in the provisions relating to discipline of
a disabled student who is violent or troublesome, in what kind of classroom setting to place a
child during a dispute over hislher current placement, and the provision of services to students
aged 18-21 (discussed below).

It is our understanding that Republican staff believe the regulations, with the Department's
adjustments, do an adequate job of addressing their main issues, but they cannot guarantee that
some members will refrain from attacking the Administration on discipline or other issues.

Discipline: A major provision that was the subject of proposed appropriations riders last year
concerns handling discipline for children with disabilities. This may be the lead topic of
renewed criticism when the regulations are published; many in Congress and many school .
systems will believe that the schools are given too little flexibility in addressing disruptive
children with disabilities.

The IDEA statute allows school personnel to suspend students with disabilities for up to 10
school days before the suspension is deemed a "change in placement," where a school district is
required to reevaluate the educational services provided to the student (determined through the
student's Individualized Education Plan, or IEP), and determine whether the student's behavior is
a manifestation of their disability.

In the proposed regulation, the Department of Education defined 10 days as meaning 10
cumulative days in a school year rather than 10 consecutive days, which had been the standard in
existing regulations. Congressional Republicans and school officials objected to this definition
because they felt it would require schools to conduct a much larger number of costly evaluations
of disabled students' IEPs (for example, they would now have to reevaluate the IEP if a disabled
student was suspended three separate times for four days each in the same school year). As a
compromise, the Department agreed to scale back the steps to be taken following the 10th
cumulative day. In most cases, schools will only need to look at whether and which
behavior-related services should be provided to the student. At the same time, the Department
retained the lO-consecutive day requirement for a full IEP review, which is not controversial.

Pendency: The IDEA statute sets up a hearing process to arbitrate between a parent and a school
when there is a disagreement over whether a child's placement should be changed (e.g., from a
special education class to a regular education setting). During such a disagreement, the statute
requires the child to remain in hislher current placement, unless the school and parent agree
otherwise.

The contentious issue in the regulations regarded the placement of the child following the first
hearing officer's review and the pending appeal. In the proposed rule, the regulations stipulated
that if the hearing officer sided with the placement, then the child would be placed where the
parents wants them placed; if the hearing office sided with the school, the child would remain in
                                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion
hislher current placement pending further review. In the public comment, objections were raised
that this procedure did not treat parents and schools equally. To compromise, the Department
mandated the above process only when the child's case was being heard by a State hearing
officer. In all other cases, the child would be placed according to the decision of the first
hearing officer pending appeal.

Services to Students Aged 18-21: Some States continue to provide special education services to
students beyond age 21. In regard to providing special education services to students aged
18-21, the IDEA statute defers to each State's law for educating these students. In the
Department of Education's first draft of the regulations pertaining to this provision, it required
that graduating students be reevaluated to determine whether additional services should be
provided, and provided non-binding guidance that a student would have to graduate with a
regular diploma (i.e., not a certificate of attendance) in order for eligibility of services to
terminate.

In response to complaints about the regulation'S proscriptive graduation policies, the Department
changed the regulation to state that students with disabilities do not have to be reevaluated when
they graduate with a regular high school diploma, and that they must continue to receive services
if they graduate with less than a high school diploma until they reach the maximum age set in
State law.


Special Education Funding

Critics, most particularly the Governors, argue that federal funding does not live up to the IDEA
statute's commitment that the federal government will provide States with 40 percent of the
average per pupil expenditure for each disabled student. In fact, the IDEA makes no such
commitment. The statute only limits the maximum grant a State can receive in a year to this 40
percent level. The highest percentage ever reached was 12.5 percent in 1979; 1999 funding
should cover about 11.2 percent.

While federal funding for special education State Grants (the primary federal special education
program) has increased by $2.2 billion or 110 percent during this Administration, from $2.1
billion in FY 1993 to $4.3 billion in FY 1999, these increases were not requested by this
Administration. Congressional Republicans in recent years have seized on IDEA as a defining
issue on education, demonstrating their concern for the "mandate" and for the burden placed on
States, by providing large annual increases. We believe this pattern will be repeated for FY
2000.

Whatever amount we might proposed for IDEA, the Republicans will always be able to offer
more, because they will not, at least initially, fund our other education and training priorities at
the levels we seek, such as Title I or the Workforce Investment Act. Instead we argue that we
are in fact substantially aiding children with disabilities with many of our other high priority
investments. These children benefit from the smaller classes in our Class Size Reduction
                                                                             Hex-Dump Conversion

iniative, from modem school facilities in our School Modernization Bonds proposal, and from
our early intervention initiatives such as America Reads and Head Start.

We have also targeted smaller increases toward early intervention programs for specifically for
students with disabilities, and to help States take advantage of research on effective practices.
The FY 2000 Budget provides a $116 million increase to special education, targeted in this way.

It should also be noted that the IDEA Amendments of 1997 imposed a "trigger" engaged when
federal funding reached $4.1 billion, allowing an LEA to divert up to 20 percent of their
maintenance of effort funding away from special education if the allocation exceeded that of the
prior year. Therefore, federal IDEA increases do not increase spending on children with
disabilities dollar for dollar.
