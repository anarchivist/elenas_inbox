TEXT:
I'm sure there will· be a movement  (external and internal) for the
President to do some event (anything) to show he is leading on tobacco.   I
think we should brainstorm a bit on what we might propose to get ahead of
this, maybe these are starters.    I'll call around ...


1.     Invite Congressional leadership up here again to discuss next steps.

2     Hold a town hall meeting on smoking in tobacco country.

3.     Announce support for the new indoor air pollution bill (primarily
smoking related causes) which has a chance to reduce some the major causes
of workplace illness effecting millions .

Regards, Tom
