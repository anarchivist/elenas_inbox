TEXT:
Some answers to your questions:

1. Can we combine policy and enforcement?
Sylvia sees these as separate pieces.  I think this it is a good question
for her during Monday's meeting. The way I see it is that you certainly
could (and should) combine them for the development process for the EBB
presentation - I can tell it's easier that way.  However, as for treatment
of these issues beyond that meeting, we'll have to deal with Sylvia.  If I
understand correctly, there will be a separate enforcement apparatus here
at the WH, similiar to one headed by Edley and Deval during Clinton I, and
that is why they are separate.

2. Can we put Tom Freedman in that group too?
Tom may certainly be in the group. In fact, I see the policy group as
your group. The names in the e-mail referred only to must-members and
team leaders.

3. Can you put me on the tough messages group?
I passed this onto Sylvia. I don't see it as a problem, but will let you
know.
