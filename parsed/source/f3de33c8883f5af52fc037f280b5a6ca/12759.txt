TEXT:
Josh, Chuck,and Sally Katzen agreed that the request is covered by the
Paperwork Reduction Act, but that the main message to send to Labor is
that we want to get the scheduling letter out and collect the wage data.
Chuck and Josh are going to call Labor and tell them it is more prudent to
have the cover of the Paperwork Reduction Act so that contractors don't
try to litigate whether it is covered or not.  More importantly, however,
they are going to tell Labor that they need to work with OMB staff during
the next week to come up with a less burdensome way to collect this data
-- preferably a summary form by occupation with average wages.   The way
to sell this to Labor is to say that we are basically doing a pilot on
their 60-2 regulation which would collect this data in a summary form as
well.
