            Did you know:

            1) That Xian and the surrounding area are considered the cradle of Chinese
            civilization, and that it served as the capital of the tang dynasty
            between (618 and 907 AD)?;

            2) That Xian is a mid-sized industrial city that has about 2.6 million
            people? ;

            3) That China is 12 hours ahead of us?; and

            4) That bullets for today's daily report MUST be submitted to me by 3 PM
            for us to get the Report to the road in time for the trip's morning
            meeting?

            SEND ME YOUR BULLETS via e-mail, the sooner the better.   Call if you have
            questions.
