I just sawall this.   I will try to figure out who on Sylvia's staff might
call NGA/Scheppach and try to make sure we're in the middle of this.

In response to this note, Barry wrote that there is $24 million already
appropriated on the mandatory side, specifically to study welfare to work
success or failure over the next few years. That's in addition to $31
million on the discretionary side for welfare research annually and "more
is not called for."

I noted that "child only" cases are riot subject to the five year time
limit and that many grandparents caring for grandchildren fall into this
category.

But we are on notice that Rep. Waters is looking for more action in this
area. Note that Sylvia plans to call Ray Scheppach.

    At the meeting today with the Director, Sperling, the COS, and Sylvia
    Mathews, Mrs. Waters and her staff reiterated their interest in doing
    something on this issue.  She noted that these grandparents are subject to
    the time limits, that HHS had provided a lot of information, but that "we
    are not done" with this issue. Sylvia suggested that her staff contact
    Ray Shipock (sp?) at the NGA to see if they could get it into their policy
    mix for the new year's initiatives.

    Also she was interested in getting funding for a study for welfare to work
    to see how we are doing with implementation. Everyone seemed to agree
    that was a good idea, but wondered if it had been included in the welfare
    bill by Shaw. Keith do you recall this? If it was in there are we
    funding it and moving on it?
