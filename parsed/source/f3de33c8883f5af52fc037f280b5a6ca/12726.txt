MEMORANDUM FOR THE VICE PRESIDENT

FROM:        BILL GALSTON

VIA:           ELAINE KAMARCK

SUBJ:         RELIGIOUS FREEDOM RESTORATION ACT


        During the speech preparation on Monday, you indicated a strong interest in the Religious
Freedom Restoration Act. The purpose of this memorandum is to provide some background on
this legislation, update you on its current status, and offer a proposed position and speech
language for your consideration.

Background

        From 1963 through 1990, legislation and jurisprudence concerning the free exercise of
religion was guided by the Supreme Court's decision in Sherbert v. Verner. In that decision, the
Court said that any law "substantially burdening" religious liberty could only be justi fied if it
promoted a "compelling state interest." This test had the effect of forcing government to
discharge a heavy burden of proof before it would be allowed to proceed with legislation that
interfered with religious free exercise to any significant degree. Most faith communities were
satisfied with this interpretation of the Free Exercise Clause.

       In 1990, the status quo was disrupted by the Court's decision in Employment Division v.
Smith. In a bitterly contested 5-4 decision with the majority's opinion by Justice Scalia, the
Court set aside the compelling state interest test and said in effect that neutral laws of general
applicability promoting legitimate state purposes would be presumed constitutional even when
not supported by a compelling governmental interest, and even if their effect was to interfere
with the religious practices of some individuals or religious groups

        This decision sparked widespread outrage in faith communities. Starting in 1991,
Congress convened hearings, and a broad coalition came together around the Religious Freedom
Restoration Act (RFRA), which was enacted into law in 1993 with the strong support of the
Clinton-Gore administration. The stated purpose of RFRA was to restore the compelling state
interest test as set forth in Sherbert v. Verner and to offer opportunities for legal claims and
defenses to individuals whose religious exercise is substantially burdened by government. The
law prohibited government from substantially burdening religious exercise unless it can be
demonstrated that the burden (1) furthers a compelling governmental interest and (2) is the least
intrusive means of furthering that interest.

       From the outset, worries were raised about the constitutionality of this law. There was
no doubt that it was intended to overturn the Smith decision and to establish through legislation
                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion
an alternative understanding of the Constitution. This could be regarded as a violation of
separation of power--that is, as a congressional usurpation of a quintessentially judicial function.
That is what the Supreme Court did in City of Boerne v. Flores, handed down in 1997. The
facts were as follows: the Catholic archbishop of San Antonio applied for a building pennit to
enlarge a church in the town of Boerne, Texas. When local authorities denied the pennit, citing
a local historic preservation ordinance, the Archbishop brought suit under RFRA. The Court
held that RFRA was not a proper exercise of congressional authority under section 5 of the
Fourteenth Amendment, on which Congress had relied in making RFRA binding on the states.
Six justices concurred, though for varying reasons; three--O'Connor, Breyer, and
Souter--dissented.

        In the wake ofthe Boerne decision, the religious coalition regrouped and redrafted RFRA
to neutralize the Court's constitutional objections. Rather than relying on section 5 of the
Fourteenth Amendment, the revised bill--now called the Religious Liberty Protection Act
(RLP A)--rests its case for enforcement powers vis-a-vis the states on the commerce and spending
clauses.

        After going nowhere in Congress in 1998, the RLP A has gathered momentum this year.
Hearings were help before the House Judiciary Committee in March, and a markup is expected in
the next few weeks. The religious coalition that supported RFRA so strongly continues to push
for the revised bill.

        There is a new wrinkle, however. I am told that some groups--mainly gay and lesbian
rights organizations--have raised objections to RLPA on the grounds that it could enhance the
ability of individuals citing religious convictions to discriminate against them and other
minorities. For this reason, the ACLU has broken ranks and is demanding language in the bill
specifying that religious free exercise claims cannot be used to justify discrimination. (This may
be the reason why there are as yet no Democratic cosponsors for this bill in the House.) The
pro-RLP A coalition, though overwhelming sympathetic to this concern, believes that allowing
any carve-outs would open the political floodgates to a host of others--prison officials, local
zoning authorities, and school administrators, for starts--that would kill the bill, and they are
therefore opposing all amendments. This is the position of traditionally liberal, pro-civil rights
religious groups such as Reform Jews as well as more traditionalist groups.

        You should also be aware ofthe fact that a coalition of the principal organizations
representing states, counties, and municipalities has put this bill on its list of so-called
"preemption" legislation that the coalition opposes on the grounds that it makes life more
difficult for state drug programs, municipal zoning ordinance, and the like.

Recommendation

        Despite these difficulties, I believe that you should move affinnatively in this area and
that you can do so without becoming entangled in a controversy among friends. Specifically,
you could say in next Monday's speech that:
                                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion


        (1) The free exercise of religious faith is one of the very most importance values in our
entire constitutional tradition and deserves that highest possible level of protection.

        (2) You disagree with the Court's Smith decision on the grounds that it needlessly and
dangerously weakens protections for religious freedom against government intrusion. (For
example, in the wake of Smith, courts in Michigan and Rhode Island forced the families of
Jewish accident victims to endure government-ordered autopsies of their loved ones even though
autopsies directly violate a basic tenet of Jewish law and there was no finding that the autopsies
were necessary for compelling government purposes such as suspicion of foul play or contagious
disease.)

        (3) While you understand the Court's constitutional objections to RFRA, you continue to
believe that corrective legislation is necessary and proper. Our tradition of civil rights makes it
clear that no part of our government--federal, state, or local--has the right to act in ways that deny
individuals the enjoyment of fundamental liberties, and religious free exercise is certainly one of
those liberties.

        (4) You support legislation, consistent with the Constitution, that requires governments to
show that action restricting religious free exercise is necessary to further a compelling purpose
and does so in the least burdensome way. You are convinced that this can be done in a way that
is consistent with the full range of our cherished individual and civil liberties.
