PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
REMARKS FOR WELFARE TO WORK EVENT
THE EAST ROOM
May 27, 1998

        Acknowledgments: Sec. Herman; Sec. Shalala; Administrator Alvarez; Eli
Segal; Jerry Greenwald.

        I want to start by congratulating Rhonda Costa and all the other women
here today who have had the courage and the strength to fight their way


from welfare to work.  I understand weD,ll be seeing a lot more of Rhonda
when the Welfare to Work Partnership airs its new national public service
announcements.  ID,m certain she will be an inspiration to people who are
trying to get off welfare -- and I know she will help convince more
business owners to hire more people off of welfare. As Jerry Greenwald
made clear a moment ago, hiring people off welfare isnD,t just good for
America -- itO,s good for American business.

        For years, our old welfare system trapped too many women like
Rhonda, exiling entire generations from the mainstream of American life.
When I was the governor of a small state with its share of people on
public assistance, I became convinced that the only way we could hope to
break that cycle of dependency and despair was to change our approach.   I
saw that we had to put an end to a system that did nothing to encourage
work or responsibility, and replace it with one that did.  I saw then that
work -- work that gives structure and dignity to our lives -- was the only
way to truly reform welfare.

        When I became President, that became our guiding principle. We
began by granting waivers to 43 states to launch welfare reform
experiments that set time limits and required work.  Those efforts alone
brought the welfare rolls down by nearly two million people.

        Then, in 1996, I signed the historic bipartisan Welfare Reform
bill that ended welfare as we knew it. As I said then, that was just the
beginning of welfare reform.  The hardest work -- creating the private
sector jobs for the people we were now requiring to work, and giving
welfare recipients the training and support they needed to succeed in the
workplace -- lay ahead. And I called on private business to help us meet
that challenge.

        We are here today because Eli Segal, Jerry Greenwald, and a group
of committed corporate leaders rose to my challenge and founded the
Welfare to Work Partnership.   Eli just told us that in a single year,
5,000 companies have joined the Partnership -- ranging from Fortune 500
corporations to small businesses with just 5 employees.   That is a
remarkable accomplishment.   But what he didnD,t tell you is that in the
same time, those companies have hired 135,000 people off of welfare. That
is cause for celebration.

        You are showing that welfare recipients donD,t need handouts --
they need a helping hand to find a job, and a chance to succeed. And
given that opportunity, they do succeed with tremendous benefits to
companies. As United Airlines and many other companies have found, hiring
from the welfare rolls can reduce employee turnover, and motivate existing
employees to work even harder.

        Here in the national government we have done our part as well,
connecting small business owners to new workers through Small Business
Administration offices all across the country ... mobilizing civic,
religious, and non-profit groups under the Vice PresidentD,s leadership to
step up their efforts to help people succeed in the workplace through
mentoring and other support ... and in just one year, we have hired more
than 4,800 welfare recipients to work in the federal government -- well on
our way to meeting our goal of hiring 10,000 by the year 2000.
        The historic balanced budget agreement I signed into law last
summer includes a $3 billion Welfare to Work program to help states and
local communities move long-term welfare recipients into lasting,
unsubsidized jobs.  It also includes a welfare to work tax credit to
encourage private employers to hire welfare recipients.



        Our combined efforts have produced the largest drop in the welfare rolls
in history, reducing them to the lowest they have been in nearly 30
years. Since I took office, there are 5.2 million fewer people on-the
welfare rolls -- fully 3.3 million fewer since I signed the Welfare Reform
bill in'1996.

        This is a hard-won victory for all the families who have moved
from welfare to work.  It is a victory for all of us who have worked so
hard to reform the old welfare system.   And it is a victory for America.
But with millions of Americans still on the welfare rolls, we know we must
not rest. And once again, everyone of us has a part to play, in
government, in business, and in every sector of our society.

        First,  we must continue to find jobs for people who are moving from
welfare to work -- and that means encouraging private business. Today, I
challenge the companies in the welfare to Work Partnership to double the
number of people they hire off welfare to 270,000 in 1998. And I
challenge business owners allover America -- not only those in the
Welfare to Work partnership -- to follow the partnershipD,s example, and
find new ways to hire welfare recipients.

        Second, we must continue to do everything we can to help welfare
recipients .succeed in the workplace. We know that many of the people who
remain on welfare face challenges that make it hard for them to get and
keep jobs. Secretary Herman has seen many of these problems first-hand,
as she has traveled around the country, talking to employers, new workers,
and community groups

        Today, I am pleased to announce $186 million in Welfare to Work
competitive grants from the Labor Department that address many of these
concerns. These funds -- which are fully paid for in my balanced budget
-- will support 49 innovative welfare to work efforts.  Some of these
projects will provide on-the-job training and support to welfare
recipients with disabilities, limited English skills, and who live in
remote rural areas. Others will help people move from entry-level jobs
into higher paying positions. Still others will help unemployed fathers
who donD,t live with their children to go to work, increasing their
ability to honor their responsibilities to pay their child support.

        We know that securing adequate child care is also critical for all
parents who work. My child care initiative will help America's working
families succeed at home and at work by paying for safe, quality child
care, and expanding after-school programs around the country.

        Third, we must continue to do everything we can to make sure that
welfare recipients can reach the jobs we are working so hard to create.
We know that more than 80% of welfare reCipients live in our inner cities
and rural areas, far from the suburbs where the vast majority of new jobs
are being created. My balanced budget proposed $283 million dollars in
Welfare to Work housing vouchers, to help welfare reCipients move closer
to new jobs, reduce long commutes, or secure more stable housing to
eliminate emergencies that increase absenteeism and lateness on the job.

        Congress acted just this month to fund my D&Access to JobsDB
proposal, by providing up to $150 million in funds for local communities
to improve transportation for welfare recipients. Today, I urge Congress
to fully fund my Welfare to Work housing voucher initiative as well, and
give people on welfare another tool to make a successful transition to
work.
·

            Our progress in the last five years is a product of hard work, and
    bipartisan co-operation. When I signed the welfare reform bill into law,
    we knew that it wasnD,t perfect, but we also knew that it was the single
    best chance in a generation to break the cycle of dependency and restore
    millions of families to the dignity of work.  But the bill also contained
    several provisions that had nothing to do with encouraging responsibility
    and work.  I was proud that Congress did the right thing last year to
    restore critically important disability and health benefits to legal
    immigrants. Last week, the Senate voted overwhelmingly to restore Food
    Stamps to elderly, disabled, and very young legal immigrants.  Today, I
    want to urge the House of Representatives to follow the SenateD,s lead --
    it is the right thing to do.

            We will continue to do everything we can in the national
    government to sustain our success and finish the job of welfare reform.
    But today, I want to encourage all Americans to join us, in their
    communities, in their communities of worship, and even in their workplaces
    to help people move from welfare to work.  Be a mentor to a person on
    welfare; volunteer at a job training center to help someone learn computer
    skills. Above all, remember that people trying to move from welfare to
    work -- people like Rhonda -- deserve our respect and all our
    encouragement.

            If we do this, we can help make America stronger than every in the
    21st Century.
