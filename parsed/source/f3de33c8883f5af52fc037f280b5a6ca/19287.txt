TEXT:
You should have already received, or will receive shortly, a draft Justice
letter on H.R. 3206, the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1998. The bill is
being marked up Wednesday morning at 10 a.m. by the House Judiciary
Committee.

In this letter to House Judiciary, Justice presents the same position on
H.R. 3206 as it did in its letter to the Constitution Subcommittee
(strongly oppose).  The letter to the full Committee, however, describes
in more detail the basis for the Department's opposition to the bill as it
is expected to be amended by Rep. Canady.  (A copy of Canady's amendment
in the nature of a substitute was sent along with the draft letter.)

please note that the deadline for review is 5:30 p.m. today.   I apologize
for the extremely short turnaround time.

please call me (5-7887) if you have any questions or did not receive the
report.
