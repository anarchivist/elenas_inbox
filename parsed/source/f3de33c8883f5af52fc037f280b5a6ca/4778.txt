 Subject:         Draft Decision Memo on the Office of Consumer Affairs

 The Congress has zeroed the Office of Consumer Affairs, which has been
 located in the EOP but funded (reluctantly) by HHS. Attached is a draft
 options memo to Erskine listing the likely alternatives. Since
 maintaining OCA will require either using EOP or agency funds/slots, we'd
 like to represent your views.

 After you've had a chance to review, please call me at 395-9188.    Thanks.

 DRAFT

 MEMORANDUM TO ERSKINE BOWLES

 THROUGH:                Frank Raines

 FROM:           Josh Gotbaum

 SUBJECT:                The Office of Consumer Affairs

 The VA/HUD appropriators have terminated funding for the Office of
 Consumer Affairs (OCA) in this yearD,s House, Senate, and Conference
 bills. This memorandum discusses whether and how OCA and/or its functions
 might continue.

 Background: OCA is a small, independent agency, administratively
 supported by HHS but part of the EOP. (The Director, Leslie Byrne, a


 former US Representative from Virginia, also serves as Special Assistant
 to the President on Consumer Affairs). OCA was founded in 1971 and had a
 relatively high profile in the Nixon and Carter Administrations, but has
 had much less'visibility since then. OCA operates a consumer hotline,
 published the ConsumerO,s Resource Handbook (until Congress moved it to
 GSA in FY 1997), represents consumersO, interests in international fora,
 helps coordinate Federal consumer protection activities, chairs the
 Consumer Affairs Council, and advises the President on consumer
 interests.  In FY 1997, OCA employed 13 people.

 If the agency is eliminated, there will be some concern about the
 symbolism of removing a "consumer representative" from the White House.
 However, the agency has developed congressional opposition: Congress has
 zeroed OCA out for the past two years.   (The Administration successfully
 demanded $1.5 million in the FY 1997 omnibus appropriations bill, but
 doing so left some scars.) Other organizations (e.g., GSA, the Consumer
 Product Safety Commission, HHS, USDA, DPC) perform functions that overlap
 with the activities of OCA and could assume some of its work.

 Once the VA/HUD bill is enacted and OCAD,s funding runs out, HHS has
 prepared plans to absorb most of OCAD,s employees and encourage GSA to
 hire some OCA employees for the Handbook. HHS would like direction
 regarding OCA, since the VA/HUD appropriations bill will require HHS to
 pay the administrative costs required to close OCA.

 Options:

 Continue OCA Administratively.   One option is to reduce OCAD,s staff to
 six FTE and place it back within the EOP, which Bob Nash has proposed (see
 attached memorandum). The hard part might be finding these resources
 within EOPO,s 1998 appropriations.  Director Byrne has proposed recon
 stituting OCA through modifying the current Executive Order that
 established the Consumer Affairs Council and funding OCA through a tap on
 all of the agencies within the Council. However, Section 611 of the
 Treasury/Postal FY 1998 appropriations bill prohibits an interagency
 council from being funded by "passing the hat" to other agencies.    Under
 current law, however, a council cannot pass the hat; even an interagency
 council must be supported by a single agency.  In OCAD,s case, it would be
 feasible to reduce OCAO,s staff to six FTE, have two to three FTE
 supported by the EOP and the other three to four FTE paid for by another
 agency'(e.g., Labor, Education or even HHS). This could probably be
 accomplished for a total cost of about $600,000-$800,000.   Since Congress
 zeroed out OCA, however, the appropriators might have concerns about any
 proposals to save the office.

 Terminate OCA.  If OCA is "zeroed", DPC could assume responsibility for
 consumer policy. Other agencies might pick up other activities, including
 the Consumer Information Center (CIC) in the General Services
 Administration (GSA) and the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC).
 While these agenciesO, activities do not precisely replicate current OCA
 activities, they could assume some OCA functions if encouraged and/or
 funded.  The CIC could develop the Handbook (which Congress again has
 given to them in FY 1998); the CIC or CPSC could operate the hotline; and
 DPC, crc, or CPSC could chair the Consumer AffairsO, Council.

 Recommendation: We recommend finding a way to keep (a smaller) OCA, by
 reducing the FTE to six and supporting it through the EOP and another
 agency. This would allow the Administration to continue to have a
 consumer representative in the White House and allow OCA to continue
 coordinating consumer affairs functions across all federal agencies.


 This seems to be the best alternative to strike a balance between
 Congress, who might be upset by the continuation of an agency they have
 zeroed out and consumers, who favor having a consumer representative in
 the Administration.  This will require finding an agency willing to
 support this activity.

 please give me or Jack Lew a call with any questions.

      !   CIC expects to have complete responsibility for the Handbook in FY 1998 and has sought responsibility for the
      Handbook in its FY 1999 budget request. CPSC has informally indicated to DMB that they are not interested in
      assuming any DCA responsibilities because DCA's activities do no fall direcdy under its mission as a regulatory
      agency responsible for consumer produd safety.
