TEXT:
A meeting has been set up with 17 members of the Choice Coalition
for Monday, December 4, 1995, Room 180, OEOB, 11:00 am - 12:00
noon.  Participating in the meeting will be Ann Lewis, Jack Quinn,
and Alexis Herman. The purpose of the meeting is to discuss the
broad issue of choice--from the budget perspective to the
constitutionality of third trimester legislation.
If third trimester legislation comes up in the Senate on Monday we
will move the meeting.
Please let me know if you cannot make the meeting at 62155.
