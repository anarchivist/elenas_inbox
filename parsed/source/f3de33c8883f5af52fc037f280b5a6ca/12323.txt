TEXT:
I understand Kevin Thurm is trying to reach Elena to discuss preparing for
possible Supreme Court action on the FDA case.   I think they want us to
pull HHS and DOJ and us together to discuss.   Elena have you spoken to him
and made any plans?

The Justices apparently have a conference on Friday.   FDA is on the list
of cases they could possibly discuss, so we could get a response to our
cert petition· as soon as next week (or it could be weeks).

Tomorrow, the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids is doing a background
briefing on the issue for reporters tomorrow so they know why the FDA rule
is important.
