TEXT:
I'll see how the bill language to back this up is coming with OMB. In the
meantime, here is the draft cover memo.

MEMORANDUM FOR ERSKINE BOWLES

FROM:           Bruce Reed

SUBJECT:                Goals 2000 back-up language

Attached is language amending the Goals 2000 Act.  It can be sold to the
Republicans on the basis that it permits states and local school districts
to use Goals 2000 funds for the purposes in the Title VI block grant. At
the same time, we are confident that it maintains the integrity of the
Goals 2000 program (because, as is the case in current law, funds could be
spent only on activities consistent with the state or local education
reform plan developed under Goals 2000) .

If the Republicans want a victory on one of the AdministrationD,s
signature programs on standards (Goals 2000 or national tests), we can try
to give them this.
