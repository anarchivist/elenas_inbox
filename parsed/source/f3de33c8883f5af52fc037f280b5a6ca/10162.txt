TEXT:
According to Ceci Rouse, Treasury will not be attending so there will not
an opportunity to discuss the outstanding policy issue on employer tax
credits vs. grants to subsidize workplace education.  Also, Gene is
apparently leaning toward rolling the $50 M "Jump Start for Literacy"
initiative to improve quality of adult ed teaching within the basic block
grant -- as Cynthia's notes on your meeting memo indicate, we would
concur.
