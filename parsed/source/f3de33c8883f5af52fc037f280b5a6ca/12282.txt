TEXT:
I would like to follow-up on our discussion about the roll-out of the
public charge proposed regulation.

Based on our discussions this morning, I understand there is strong
interest in a POTUS or VPOTUS announcement but I would like to schedule a
meeting to discuss in more detail the roll-out options and to vet these
options.  Please let me know if you think it make sense do a DPC meeting
first to come up with a DPC recommendation and then invite others (Janet,
Maria, etc) to discuss these options.

Fyi - The timing of the clearance of the reg is still unclear since we are
just receiving it but upon a quick review of the proposed reg it looks
good.   We are still waiting for the field guidance.

Please advise. Thanks.
