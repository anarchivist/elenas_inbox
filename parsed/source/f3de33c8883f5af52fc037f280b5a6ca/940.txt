        WASHINGTON D.C. COLLEGE READING TUTOR ANNOUNCEMENT
                            February 20,1997


             DATE:     Friday, February 21, 1997
             LOCATION:         Garrison Elementary School
                               12th & S Street, NW (Shaw Neighborhood)
             TIME:             10:00 a.m. - 12:10 p.m.
             FROM:             Gene Sperling
                               Melanne Verveer
                               Bruce Reed

I.    PURPOSE

      To announce that seven DC college presidents have responded to your America Reads
      challenge by committing to partner with District public' schools and place thousands of
      college student reading tutors in the DC schools over the next five years. You will also
      announce that AmeriCorps participants will coordinate and recruit additional tutors in
      targeted District schools. General Becton will announce that DC is taking the first steps
      towards meeting your America Reads Challenge.


II.   BACKGROUND

      The Clinton Administration has secured commitments from seven DC college presidents to
      place at least 680 new college reading tutors in the DC schools next year alone, and
      thousands over the next five years. This is in addition to the hundreds of college students
      who are already tutoring in the District schools. Most of the new tutors are federal college
      work study students. The colleges will use the increased federal work study funding and
      take advantage of your having waived the local match for work study students who tutor.

      Last fall, you proposed that colleges dedicate half of their additional work study slots --
      100,000 slots -- to tutoring in reading or other community service. In December, you
      announced that 21 college presidents had responded to your challenge to dedicate work
      study slots for tutoring in reading and formed a steering committee to recruit additional
      colleges. This is an excellent example of how you are using the presidency to mobilize
      Americans without waiting for Congress to enact legislation. Father O'Donovan, President
      of Georgetown, and Dr. Robert Corrigan, President of San Francisco State University, are
      both members of this steering committee and both will be at the Garrison School tomorrow.
       While the total number of additional college students pledged to tuli1'lKilluitp D.iatJW1oi!; lower
       than we had originally thought, it is still a substantial initial commitplent. You challenged
       colleges nationally to provide 10 percent or 100,000 of the 1 million reading tutors called for
       under America Reads. The 680 new tutors pledged in the District are over 10 percent of the
       5,400 tutors General Becton believes he needs to reach his goal of tutoring all the first
       graders in the 18 public schools he has targeted for tutoring.

       General Becton will announce that DC will be taking the first step toward meeting your
       America Reads challenge by creating "DC Reads," a public-private partnership to use these
       college tutors and mobilize additional volunteer reading tutors to improve reading skills in
       the 18 elementary schools with the greatest academic need. AmeriCorps will put two
       AmeriCorps participants at each of the 18 schools to coordinate and recruit tutors, and
       General Becton will hire reading specialists to train the tutors at each of the schools. The
       non-profit, Communities In Schools, formerly called Cities in Schools, will help coordinate
       resources at each of these schools and recruit private sector partners. The private sector
       partners will include Nations Bank, First Union Bank, Buvermo Properties, and the
       Washington Post, although they have not finalized their commitments.

       The three initial components of DC Reads are:

       1.     Book Buddies: Beginning later this year, AmeriCorps members, along with
              Communities in Schools, will recruit and coordinate volunteers or "book buddies" to
              tutor first grade students twice a week in each of the targeted 18 elementary schools.
              All tutors will be trained and assisted by reading specialists hired by General Becton;

       2.     Saturday Academy: DC Public Schools will establish Saturday Reading Academies
              for 3rd and 6th graders at the 18 targeted schools; and

       3.     Family Resource Centers: District and AmeriCorps will work with public and
              private partners to establish Family Resource Centers in the targeted schools to help
              parents support their children's reading.

       You are making this announcement at Garrison Elementary School because it is the pilot
       school for DC Reads and is one of the 18 targeted schools. Three AmeriCorps participants
       recruited reading tutors who began tutoring there this week. Education Department
       employees and Retired Senior Volunteer Program (RSVP) members and Foster Grandparent
       members tutor at Garrison as well. Communities in Schools is also a partner at Garrison.
