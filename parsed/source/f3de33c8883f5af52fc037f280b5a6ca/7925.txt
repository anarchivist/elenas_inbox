Dear Democratic Colleague:

 In response to President Clinton's call to improve child care by making
it safer and more affordable for America's working families, House
Democrats will introduce our Democratic Child Care Proposal on Tuesday,
June 9th. As part of the President's balanced budget, the Democratic
proposal will introduce significant new investments in child care to
help working families pay for child care, build a good supply of
after-school programs, and improve the safety and. quality of care and
promote early learning.

 We are writing to urge you to join us as original cosponsors of the
Democratic Child Care bill to be introduced next week.  This proposal
doubles the number of children receiving child care assistance;
increases tax credits for three million working families to help them
pay for child care; establishes a stay-at-home credit for children under
the age of four; provides after-school care for up to one million
children per year; improves child care safety and quality; and enhances
early childhood development.

 Attached is a summary which will illustrate the major components of the
Democratic bill. We urge you to join your colleagues in working to
provide better child care to America's working families.   If you have
any questions or would like to add your name as an original cosponsor,
please contact Sean Marcus at the Democratic. Caucus at X6-3210.
