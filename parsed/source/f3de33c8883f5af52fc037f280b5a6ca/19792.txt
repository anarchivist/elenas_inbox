FYI:  Attached is an article from yesterday's LA Times reporting that
Boalt Hall's admissions of minority students have increased from last year
(the first year of the ban on affirmative action) apparently as a result
of increased outreach and private scholarship incentives.

          California and the West Boalt Hall Accepts More Blacks, Latinos Education:
         Figures for Berkeley law school rebound from last year, when affirmative action
                                          was scrapped.

   UC Berkeley's Boalt Hall School of Law announced Tuesday that it has accepted 32 black
students, more than twice as many as last year--when none of the students who had been accepted
actually enrolled.

 The number of Latino students also rebounded this year, with 60 Latinos accepted compared
with 46 in 1997.

   "It's marvelous," said Herma Hill Kay, dean of the law school. "We went to extraordinary
lengths to overcome this negative image that Berkeley doesn't want African Americans."

  To drum up applications, Boalt's admission director visited more historically black colleges
than in the past. The black and Latino alumni joined in hosting receptions in Atlanta and other
cities for prospective students, while current students visited California State University
campuses in an outreach effort financed by the law school alumni.

  Although encouraged by the numbers, Kay cautioned that the school won't know until August
how many of the 32 students agree to sign up for fall classes.

  Altogether, Boalt selected 857 students out of an applicant pool of 4,587. Law school officials
expect that fewer than a third of those accepted will enroll. The school plans for a first-year class
of 270 students.

  Last year, none of 15 African Americans accepted to BoaIt decided to enroll, prompting Kay to
call the numbers "a total wipeout." One student who had deferred admission from the previous
year became the lone African American in the first-year class of270 students.

 Kay said she hoped for a better showing this year. But she said that Berkeley often loses
minority students to elite private law schools, such as Stanford and those in the Ivy League,
which can afford to offer more enticing scholarships to promising students.

  Boalt, as a public school, is prohibited from targeting scholarships by race, Kay noted, while
private colleges are free to use affirmative action in all their decisions.
                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion


  This is the second year in the post-affirmative-action era that Boalt and other UC graduate and
professional schools have picked their first-year classes without any preferences for race or
gender.

  The new rules ending affirmative action in admissions were phased in this year for
undergraduates, resulting in sharp drops in the number of blacks, Latinos and Native Americans
accepted at the most competitive UC campuses.

  Boalt accepted slightly fewer Asian Americans this year, 144, compared with 149 last year.
The number of white students also declined--to 461, from 499 last year. The school accepted four
Native Americans, compared with two last year. Blacks, Latinos and Native Americans are
considered "underrepresented minorities," who once benefited from the school's affirmative
action program.

  The San Francisco Bar Assn. also joined the recruitment drive last week, saying that it would
offer $5,000 scholarships--enough to cover about half of Boalt's tuition--to half a dozen minority
students. Because the bar association is a private organization, it is not covered by the state's ban
on affirmative action.
