Draft 6/10/98 3pm
June Shih and Jordan Tamagni   (note -- this is about 15 minutes long)

PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
D&THE NEW IMMIGRATION:
BUILDING ONE AMERICA IN THE 21ST CENTURYD8
PORTLAND STATE UNIVERSITY
JUNE 13, 1998

        I am honored to address the Portland State University graduating class of
1998. Looking around this campus, it is hard to imagine that it all
started in a handful of temporary buildings in a shipyard 52 years ago,
with a dream to give soldiers returning home from World War II the
opportunity to go to college -- and a chance to build a better life.  In
so many ways, Portland StateD,s mission is the mission of America: to meet
the challenge of changing times by holding fast to our founding principals
-- to widen the circle of opportunity for all our people, to deepen the
meaning of our freedom, and to form a more perfect union.

        This Spring, as I speak to graduating students, I am focusing on
what we must do in our own era to make the promise of America real for
generations to come: defending our security against the new threat of
terrorism; advancing opportunity amid the challenges of the Information
Age.

         Of all the challenges before us, none is more complex than the challenge
of our nationO,s growing racial and ethnic diversity.  One year ago
tomorrow, I launched a national initiative on race, to engage all
Americans in a conversation about the lingering problems and limitless
possibilities of our racial diversity.

         Today, I would like to talk all of you about the driving force behind
this diversity -- the new immigration.  Millions of new immigrants are
changing the face of America. And I come to you today to talk about our
shared responsibility to welcome them -- and our responsibility to ensure
that this new immigration strengthens our nation.  For while these changes
are good for America, they demand more of all Americans. We must redouble
our commitment to those shared ideals and values that have held us together
, that have made us American, for two centuries and more.

        More than any other nation on earth, America has drawn its
strength and its spirit from a constant flow of immigrants -- the most
restless, the most adventurous, the most industrious people of the world.
Together, they built a new nation on a powerful idea: that all men are
created equal.  Together, each bearing their own memories, each honoring
their own heritage, they forged a different and dynamic new culture. Each
group of newcomers was met with suspicion, with violence and
discriminatory laws, with doubts that they could ever become truly
American.  But the American ideal proved stronger.

         Now, that ideal is being tested again -- by a new wave of
immigration, larger than any in a century, far more diverse than any in
our history. Each year, nearly one million people come legally to build
new lives in America. Today, nearly one in ten people in America was born
in other lands; one in five schoolchildren are from immigrant families.
In four school districts just miles from the White House, children from
nearly 200 countries, speaking more than 100 languages, are learning side
by side.   Today, largely because of immigration, there is no majority race
in Hawaii or Houston or New York. Within 5 years, there will be no
majority race in California. And in as few as fifty years, there will be


no majority race in America.

        No other nation in the history of the world has gone through
demographic change of this magnitude, over so short a time.  It can either
strengthen and unite America, or weaken and divide us.

        Let me state unequivocally: I believe the new immigration is good
for America.  It is revitalizing our cities.  It is building our new
economy, and strengthening our ties to the global one.  It is energizing
our culture and broadening our view of the world.  It is renewing our
values. And it is reminding all of us what it truly means to be an
American.

          It means working hard, like the teenager from Russia who rushes home
after school to babysit so his mother can work the night shift.   It means
making a better life for your children, like ~he father from Vietnam who
works two jobs and still finds the time to take his daughter to the public
library everyday to practice reading. And it means [example of immigrant
student at PSU, tkl

        We see these new immigrants, and we see the spirit that built America
the drive to succeed, the commitment to family, the hope for a better
life. We see our grandparents ... we see ourselves ... we see Americans.

        But too many people do not.  They hear the new accents, they see
the new faces, and they feel unsettled. They worry that the new immigrants
come to our shores not to promote our prosperity but to live off our
largesse. They are afraid the America .they know and love is becoming a
foreign land.

        This is understandable.   But it is wrong, profoundly wrong.

        Let me be clear: No American should tolerate illegal immigration
that flouts our laws and strains our tradition of tolerance. We must
strictly enforce the immigration laws, and we. must continue to bring the
rule of law to our borders.

        But we should also remember: the vast majority of immigrants are
here legally. And in every measurable way, the new immigrants give more
to our society than they take. On average, immigrants pay $1,800 more in
taxes than they receive in government benefits. And legal immigrants are
paying into Social Security at record rates, helping to offset the
millions of Americans who will be retiring in the next 20 years.

        And they benefit our nation in ways that are not as easily
measured.

        We should be honored that America -- whether it is called the
D+city on a hill,D, the D+old gold mountain,D, E1 Norte     is seen around
the world as a land of opportunity and new beginnings. We should all be
proud that people living in isolated villages in far corners of the world
recognize the Statue of Liberty. We should be proud ,that children all
around the world study our Declaration of Independence, that, to this day,
it is inspiring men and women to join us.
        My fellow Americans, it is wrong for people whose ancestors passed
through the portals of Ellis Island to lock the door behind them. And it
is wrong for those who were denied the rights of citizenship simply
because of the color of their skin to deny those rights to others because
of the country of their birth. We should treat these new immigrants as we
would have wanted our own grandparents to have been treated.



         I believe that every American is honor-bound to share our country with
immigrants, not to shun them or shut them out.   But I believe this as
well: We cannot be blind to the fact that immigration of this sweep and
scope can threaten our unity. Around the world, we have seen what can
happen when people who live on the same land put ethnicity before
country.

        If America is to remain the worldD,s most diverse democracy, if
immigration is to strengthen America as it has throughout our history,
then we must say: whether your ancestors came here in slave ships or on
the Mayflower; whether they landed on Ellis Island or LAX or have been
here for thousands of years, if you believe in the Declaration of
Independence and the Constitution, you are an American. And only that
belief, strengthened and renewed in a time of great change, will keep us
one America in the 21st Century.                                       '

        Today, all Americans and all immigrants must recommit to ourselves
to the true duties and spirit of citizenship. Immigrants must seek to
become citizens; and all Americans, wherever they were born, must act as
citizens.

        Not just immigrants, but every American should study our
Constitution and understand our shared history.

        Not just immigrants, but every American should take part in our
democracy -- not only by voting, but by going to city council meetings,
volunteering in our schools, and perhaps even running for office.

        Not just immigrants, but every American should reject identity
politics, on our campuses and in our communities. We are Americans first
and foremost.  We must refuse to be swayed by the voices of division.

         And not just immigrants, but every American should recognize that
our public schools are not just places where our children learn to read,
but where they learn to be American, where they make American heroes --
from Washington to Lincoln to Rosa Parks -- their own.   Today, too many
Americans, and far too many immigrants, attend crowded inner city
schools.   Too many young people, and far too many Hispanic young people,
drop out of school altogether. With more children from immigrant families
entering school than at any time since the turn of ,the century, we must
redouble our efforts to renew our public schools, and give all of
AmericaD,s children the best education in the world.

        And we must ensure that all of AmericaD,s children can speak English.     As
I told you a minute ago, there are schools in America where children speak
nearly 200 languages, languages they should be encouraged to remember.
But the sooner they learn English in school, the sooner they will be able
to reach their full potential.

        I applaud the students here at Portland State who are tutoring
immigrant children to speak and read English -- and I call on more
Americans to do the same.  For in the end, we will only overcome ignorance
and fear by reaching out and helping one another: in our schools, in our
communities, and across this land. We will only become one America if we
come together in the sincere belief that we have much to learn from one
another -- and far to travel together toward our common future as
Americans.

        Today, I offer you, the Portland State University graduating class


of 1998, my congratulations. Many of you have sacrificed much to reach
this day -- you have held down jobs and cared for your families and still
found the energy and the passion to reach for your dreams. You have the
right to look back and feel pride in all you have achieved.

        But I also offer a challenge: Go out and build the America we all
want for our children and their children.  Take the knowledge and skills
you have earned, and share them, not only with your family and your
community but with your nation.

        The challenges we face are new and real.  But the way we will meet
them is as old as America. 140 years ago, in the City of Chicago,
immigrants outnumbered native born Americans. Abraham Lincoln asked what
connection those immigrants could possibly feel to those who founded our
nation. O&If they look back through this history to trace their connection
with those days by blood, they find they have none,Os he said.  But our
founders proclaimed that we are all created equal. And that, he said, O&is
the electric cord in that Declaration that links the hearts of patriotic
and liberty-loving [people] together.Os

        It is the cord that links every graduate here today with every new
immigrant and every American who came before us -- and if we act with
conscience and courage in our own time, it will light the way for the
generations of the 21st Century.                         '

       Good luck and God bless you.
