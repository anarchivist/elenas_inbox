TEXT:
On question on Engler policy on immigrants in Cynthia's note on Michigan,
I assume this means that legal aliens are eligible for TANF.  Something
like 47 states are doing this, so I wouldn't single it out for praise.

Cynthia's writeup also says "state plans to use ... state dollars to help
most legal immigrants who become ineligible for SSI and food stamps."
This could simply mean that they are eligible for TANF, as stated above,
but it could also mean he is trying to fill the gap for the loss of SSI
and food stamps. The latter is very expensive to do, and so I doubt he is
doing it. Even Whitman said she couldn't afford that, I think.
