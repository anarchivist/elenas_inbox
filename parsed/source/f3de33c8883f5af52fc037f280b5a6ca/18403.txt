TEXT:
I went to the meeting you forwarded the invite to on cloning where the
Biotech industry laid out its concerns on proposed cloning legislation;
they are worried it will inadvertently ban embryo research etc ..

The WH has a proposed formulation I think Bill Marshall put together, the
bio tech industry has another and the Reproductive doctors society has a
third.  I am forwarding them to you.

Everyone, including Bill, felt more info was required on the effects of
the different approaches.
Rachel Levinson from OSTP will circulate a draft options memo on the
scientific approaches and their implications for research, and right to
life issues.

The basic issue centers on: how do you define what type of research is
banned? The WH version bans all entities from using "somatic cell nuclear
transfer with the intent of introducing the product of that transfer into
a woman's womb or in any other way creating a human being." That would
seem to not ban experimentation with cloned embryos and would have right
to life implications.  The Biotech industry language: "it shall be
unlawful for any person to use federal funds to create a human child
identical in terms of DNA to an existing or previously existing individual
using somatic cell nuclear transfer technology." Doesn't effect private
sector, doesn't deal with experimentation and right to life.  The
reproductive society says "It shall be unlawful for any person to create a
human child using somatic cell nuclear transfer." (applies to all,
protects research specifically in separate section) .

There is also a preemption issue.
