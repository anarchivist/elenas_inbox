TEXT:
FYI: The VP will be in New Hampshire tomorrow, and is doing an interview
with WMUR.

I think he could get a question on special education funding.  I was
basically going to use our current Q&A --including the sentence saying
that we need to fund increases in both IDEA and class size. My guess is
that the VP will want to make very clear that he supports increased
funding for special education. But I'll draft a paragraph for his
briefing explaining why it's important for him to avoid going too far on
this.
