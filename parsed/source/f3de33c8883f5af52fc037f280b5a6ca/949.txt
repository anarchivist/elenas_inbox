         That reminds me of the other thing I wanted to put in the weekly -- a note
         that Erskine and I met with Harris Wofford to ensure that plans for the
         service summit are on track.  Steve Silverman and Diana Fortuna will be
         working on it, Silverman going to planning mtgs, etc. A Rendell aide,
         Stuart Schapiro, is running the summit.   I met with Rick Little, who will
         run the non-profit that follows up on the summit; he is the founder and
         director of the International Youth Federation, a worldwide service
         organization, and is thoroughly non-political.   Then mention some of the
         recent commitments from the Newsweek box (Diana has these), including
         several to the President's reading initiative.

              Pauline told me of your inquiry about Newsweek printing the
         Scholastic
              figure.   As I shared with her, the commitments being made to the
              Summit are not on the whole being shared with us nor any agency as
              best I can tell.   I am working hard to have a smooth working
         operation
              with the Corporation on America Reads and feel success is in place on
              that front.   However, the Summit is not something we work on daily
              together.   I have suggested periodically with them we need to be kept
              abreast of what is happening with the Summit and quite frankly I get
              the impression at times that those at the Corporation itself aren't
              always aware of what commitments are being received.   If you have
              ideas about what I should do differently let me know.   I think it is
         a
              bigger system problem than just America Reads being somewhat in the
              dark as I have heard other departments/agencies saying they are
              getting calls from folks with whom they work saying they are confused
              about the relationship of the Summit to ongoing relationships with
              various agencies and departments with which they work.
