TEXT:
I signed off for you on the scheduling request for the service summit --
hope that's ok, but we were in a hurry to get it in before the scheduling
meeting.  We asked for all of Sunday and half of Monday.  It will come
from you, Don, and Steve, as will the final version of the memo to Erskine
that you saw yesterday.

Today's activities include a public liaison briefing on the summit for
groups that were feeling left out, and our weekly Wednesday White House
update meeting. There is no need for you to attend these meetings on a
regular basis (and I hear you can't come anyway), because they are more
logistics and making sure other offices are up to speed.  I will let you
know if anything happens.

For the HS service scholarship event, how did you leave it with Lt. Gov
Townsend, in terms of selecting a site?

One idea that we were kicking around on the Federal commitment: we would
not only increase our adopt a school effort (maybe doubling it), but we
would take a more comprehensive approach and make sure kids at our adopted
schools had each of the 5 resources, perhaps by coordinating across
agencies.   (For instance, DOJ does a lot of ·safe place" stuff that we
could all take advantage of.)   Not sure I love it because it's somewhat
hard to summarize, it's not that service-y, and it plays off of their five
goals more than we might wish, but ....

FYI also yesterday: we met with Benjamin Barber to hear about his fears,
and we met with the Christmas in April people to try to structure a WH
activity. They do make it very easy.
