TEXT:
It's ridiculous to screw people who go directly to work without going
through training.

The second point raises another question -- do states get to count housing
in calculating hours and wages under FLSA, or is that excluded?

Subject:         Housing/Welfare Reform Meeting

Through recent discussions with HUD and OMB, two housing issues related to
welfare reform have surfaced that we need to discuss and resolve.  Right
now, we have scheduled a meeting on Wednesday, April 2 from 3:00 -4:30 in
room 211 to begin discussing the following issues.

First is the question of who should qualify for an income exclusion when
determining rent amounts.  Previously, the small population enrolled in
the JOBS program who moved into work qualified for such exclusions.


 However, now essentially all of those on TANF who go through training and
 into work will qualify.  Further, those who go from TANF directly into
 work without moving through training DO NOT qualify. Should all welfare
 recipients who receive housing subsidies and move from welfare to work
 receive an income exclusion? If not, how do we choose which populations
 are eligible? What are the ramifications on HUD's budget?

 Second, the Feds pay 100% of admin and capitol costs for public housing
 and serve over 1.4 million households, about 60% of whom are on AFDC.
 Several states in their TANF plans are creating a two-tiered welfare
 system--those who receive housing subsidies will receive less in TANF
 benefits, those who do not receive housing subsidies will receive a larger
 TANF check.  This has tremendous budgetary implications for HUD and
 particularly concerns OMB.

 Joining us for this meeting will be Olivia Golden and other staff from HHS
 and Michael Stegman and Paul Leonard from HUD.  please let me know via
 e-mail whether or not you'll be attending.  Thanks.
