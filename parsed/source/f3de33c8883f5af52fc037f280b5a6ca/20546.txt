               THE PRESIDENT CALLS FOR FULL FUNDING FOR FOOD
                       SAFETY INITIATIVE AND PASSAGE
                     OF VITAL FOOD SAFETY LEGISLATION
                                  July 4,1998

In his weekly radio address, the President will c!lll for full funding of the food safety initiative in
his FY99 budget and for passage of two vital pieces of legislation to improve the safety of this
nation's food supply into the 21 st Century.

Food Safety Initiative. The President's FY99 budget includes a request for $101 million to
improve the safety of the nation's food supply. These resources will support a variety of
measures including: hiring additional FDA inspectors to examine the safety of our nation's fruits
and vegetables, both domestic and imported; developing new ways for federal inspectors to
detect food-borne illnesses in meat and poultry and determine the source of contamination;
improving educational outreach on proper food handling; and expanding our early warning
system to help detect and respond to outbreaks of foodborne illnesses.

Congress has so far failed to provide the resources this important initiative requires. The
House-passed Agriculture Appropriations bill has provided only $16.8 million of the $95.6
million requested increase for USDA and FDA. The Senate Agriculture Appropriations
Committee-passed bill has provided even less resources, only $2.6 million of the $95.6
million requested increase, with no additional funding for FDA and $2.6 million for USDA.
 The President will call on Congress to meet his budget request for these measures critical
to the safety offood consumed by America's families.

Enhanced FDA Oversight for Imported Foods. The President will call on Congress to pass
food safety legislation, introduced by Senators Milkulski and Kennedy and Reps. Eshoo and
Pallone, that gives the FDA greater authority over imported foods. This legislation will ensure
that the FDA halts imports of fruits, vegetables, and other food products from any foreign
country with food safety systems that do not provide the same level of protection as is required
for U.S. products. The legislation also enables the FDA to halt imports from a country or
facility that refuses to allow FDA inspections. This legislation gives FDA authority that is
comparable to USDA's existing authority to prevent the importation of unsafe meat and poultry.

Mandatory Recall and Civil Penalties for Unsafe Meat and Poultry.       The President also
will call on Congress to pass the Food Safety Enforcement Enhancement Act, sponsored by
Senators Harkin, Daschle, Johnson, and Leahy, which gives USDA the ability to assess civil
fines and to order mandatory recalls of unsafe meat and poultry products. ' Currently, the
USDA can respond to food safety violations only by bringing criminal actions or
withdrawing inspections; all recalls are done on a voluntary basis and no civil penalties are
available. This new legislation will give USDA additional enforcement tools to prevent
consumers from ingesting and becoming ill from dangerous meat and poultry.
