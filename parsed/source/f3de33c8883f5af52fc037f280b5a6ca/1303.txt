TEXT:
Talked to Greg Frasier of USDA.  He said they weren't looking to make a
big splash with waiver press releases, and that this is a
misunderstanding; they just thought it was news, and that USDA hasn't
always taken advantage of news possibilities.  I said it made us nervous
since things were going pretty well on the waivers so far, and we didn't
want to gum it up.  I did leave it with him that they could send us a
draft press release for us to chew on if they felt they could write it in
a very boring straightforward way that didn't raise any red flags.  He
wasn't clear on whether he would do that, or just drop the whole idea.

I mentioned voluntary workfare to him; he had never heard of it, and
didn't believe there was anything slated for a speech tomorrow by
Glickman, but that he would check.
