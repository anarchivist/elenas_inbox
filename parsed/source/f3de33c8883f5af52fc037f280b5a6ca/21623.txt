 MANAGEMENT

SUBJECT:                   GUIDE FOR VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

        Domestic violence is one of the most serious public health issues and criminal justice
issues facing our Nation. About 30 percent of female murder victims are killed by intimates
each year. Women aged 16-24 experience the highest rates of intimate violence. In 1996,
women experienced an estimated 840,000 incidents of rape, sexual assault, robbery, and
aggravated assault at the hands of intimates. While this number has declined from 1.1 million
incidents in 1993, we must strive to completely eliminate domestic violence both for its effects
on the victim as well as on their children. Domestic violence does not discriminate -- it effects
individuals of every age, race, gender, class, and religion.

        My Administration is committed to fighting the scourge of domestic violence. As part of
the 1994 Crime Act, I fought for and signed the historic Violence Against Women Act (V AW A),
which provides a comprehensive approach to domestic violence, both through prosecuting
offenders and providing assistance to victims. Through this Act, my Administration has
provided almost half a billion dollars through STOP (Services, Training, Officers, and
Prosecutors) grants to the states for law enforcement, prosecution, and victim services to prevent
and respond to violence against women. The extension of the Brady Law prohibits anyone
convicted of a domestic violence offense from owning a firearm. The Interstate Stalking
Punishment and Prevention Act of 1996 makes it a federal crime to cross state lines intending to
injure or harass another person.

        In 1995, the Violence Against Women Office was established at the Department of
Justice, elevating the fight against domestic violence to the national level for the first time.
Since 1996, the 24-hour National Domestic Violence Hotline (1-800-799-SAFE) has provided
immediate crisis intervention, counseling, and referrals to those in need, responding to as many
as 10,000 calls each month.

        Domestic violence affects all aspects of our society -- the family, the community, and the
workplace. As the Nation's leading employer, my Administration has tried to set an example for
private employers to protect and provide assistance to workers who are victims of domestic
violence. In 1995, I signed an executive memorandum requiring all federal departments to begin
employee awareness efforts on domestic violence. Last year, the Vice President announced that
the Office of Personnel Management had developed a guide for dealing with workplace violence
that outlines a wide array of strategies for preventing violence at work and for helping
supervisors, security, and employee assistance staff to recognize the signs of violence, including
domestic violence, and to prevent this violence.

        Building upon these efforts, it is important to provide a resource guide to the thousands of
federal employees across the country, whether they are a victim of domestic violence or the
family member, neighbor, friend, or co-worker of someone who is being abused. I accordingly
direct you to prepare within 120 days a resource guide that will (1) assist federal employees


                                                                   Automated Records Management System
                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion
                                                                                   a
resources and outline strategies to ensure safety; and (2) help those who know federal employee
who is being abused to prevent and respond to the situation. This guide should list private as
well as public resources such as counseling, law enforcement, federal workplace leave policies,
and substance abuse programs. In developing this guidebook, you should consult with all
interested parties, including the private sector and other federal agencies and offices --
particularly, the Department of Justice and the Department of Health and Human Services.

        This guide, in addition to my Administration's continuing efforts to combat domestic
violence, will strive to ensure to the fullest extent possible the safety of all federal workers and
their families.
