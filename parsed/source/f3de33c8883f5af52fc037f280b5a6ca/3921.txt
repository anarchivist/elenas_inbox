     Here is an update on the complaints I mentioned this morning MIGHT be
     related to the North Carolina tests and children with disabilities.

     There is a recently received complaint that may indeed involve some
     the same issues that are in NAACP law suit. The complaint is against
     Lenoir County School District. The complainants allege a number of
     issues around the tests - such as that their daughter who has mental
     retardation (EMR) was kept out of EMR math and EMR reading classes
     because she had failed the state tests; and such as that all children
     with disabilities will automatically not be able to graduate because
     they will not be able to pass the State approved tests the District
is
     imposing at the high school level.

     The complaint is in the evaluation stage, and it is not yet clear how
     much has to do with the State complaints and State requirements, and
     how much has to do with the District's interpretation of the State
     requirements or the District's own standards.

     Please let me know if you need additional information.
