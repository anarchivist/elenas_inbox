Waiting Period on Handgun Sales

Q_    Can you elaborate on why the President supports making permanent the Brady
      waiting period prior to the sale of a handgun?

A.    Under the Brady Law, the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS)
      will take effect on November 30, 1998. NICS will allow access to a fuller set of records
      than is now available, and law enforcement officials will use it to conduct checks of all
      prospective gun purchases -- not just handgun purchasers. We are pleased with the
      significant progress this Administration has made over the last 5 years to assist states in
      improving the accessibility of their criminal records once the NICS takes effect. These
      improved records will go a long way in helping to stop even more ineligible purchasers
      from buying firearms.

      Once the NICS takes effect, the 5-day waiting period for handgun sales established in the
      Brady Law will sunset. And while NICS will allow access to a fuller set of records, a
      permanent waiting period will allow law enforcement officers to check additional,
      non-computerized records, as well as provide a cooling-offtime for handgun purchases.
      We believe that local law enforcement officials know best who in their community can or
      can't legally own a gun, and that they are uniquely positioned to provide the last, best
      check before a handgun purchase goes through


Q.    Can you give us more detail on the SchumerlDurbin waiting period legislation?

A.    Representative Schumer and Senator Durbin introduced legislation applying to all states
      to which the Brady Law now applies that will:

      (1)    Require a minimum 3-day waiting period for all handgun purchases. Under
             current law, while there is no minimum waiting period, local law enforcement
             officials have up to 5 days to reject a handgun purchase. The SchumerlDurbin
             legislation establishes a minimum wait time, even if NICS background check is
             completed well beforehand. The minimum wait period will give local law
             enforcement additional time to review other local records that may not be found in
             the NICS, helping to ensure that prohibited gun sales are not completed.

      (2)    Add up to an additional two days to the waiting period iflaw enforcement officers
             need more time to clarify arrest records. Under current law, when NICS takes
             effect, the system is given up to 3 days to complete the background check and
             determine whether an arrest resulted in a conviction that disqualifies the
                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion

            prospective purchaser from owning a gun. The Schumer-Durbin bill will extend
            this period to 5 days, making sure law enforcement has enough time to get the
            information they need to make a final decision.

     (3)    Require gun dealers to notify the local law enforcement official in the purchaser's
            place of residence prior to selling the gun. Under current law, after November
            30, 1998, guns dealers will no longer have to forward the names and addresses of
            prospective gun purchasers to designated local law enforcement officials -- only to
            the FBI or a NICS point of contact. The Schumer-Durbin bill requires gun
            dealers to keep notifying designated local law enforcement officials of handgun
            purchases.


Q.   Why are certain states exempt from Brady? What states are these?

A.   States may be exempted from the Brady Law if they have a qualifying alternative permit
     system or a state "instant check" system -- both of which require background checks.
     Currently, 27 states are exempt from Brady's requirements -- including 9 that were
     originally subject to the Brady Law, but which later enacted Brady-qualifying state
     systems.

     The states exempt from Brady are: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida,
     Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan,
     Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North
     Carolina, Oregon, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia, Washington, and Wisconsin.


Q.   Didn't the Supreme Court overturn Brady's requirements? Doesn't this decision
     impact your ability to impose a new waiting period?

A.   Last year's Supreme Court decision left the majority of the Brady Handgun Control Act
     intact. The Supreme Court ruled that the Federal government cannot require local police
     departments to conduct background checks, but left intact the 5-day waiting period.
     Nothing in the decision prohibits law enforcement from voluntarily enforcing the Brady
     Law checks. As we expected, after the Supreme Court's decision, the vast majority --
     over 90% -- of the nation's law enforcement agencies continued to conduct background
     checks on handgun purchasers. They did this because it is a common sense and good
     law enforcement -- not because it was required. The Schumer-Durbin legislation is
     consistent with the Court's decision and does not require state and local law enforcement
     to do background checks.


Q.   Isn't there a difference between the current waiting period and what you're
     proposing today? Why this change?
                                                                    Hex-Dump ConversIon

A.    Currently, Brady allows up to 5 days to conduct a background check in states without
      pennit systems. When NICS is implemented, there will generally be no waiting period,
      but law enforcement can take up to 3 days to clarify arrest records. Under the Brady
      extension legislation proposed by Senator Durbin and Rep. Schumer, there will be a
      minimum 3-day waiting period, and law enforcement can take as many as 5 days to
      clarify arrest records. While the NICS will allow access to a fuller set of records, this
      minimum 3-day and expanded 5-day waiting period ensures that law enforcement will
      have the time it needs to check all available records, as well as provide a cooling-off time
      for handgun purchases.

Q.    How many and which states currently have their own waiting periods?

A.   According to a 1996 Justice Department survey, 11 states have waiting periods pursuant
     to their own laws. These waiting periods vary in duration and may apply to different types
     of firearms. The states with waiting periods are: Alabama, California, Hawaii, Indiana,
     Iowa, Kentucky, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, and
     Washington.


Anti-Brady Senate Amendment

Q.   What are the Congressional efforts to "gut" Brady that the President referred to in
     his remarks?

A.   A recent amendment to the Senate Commerce- Justice-State appropriations bill would
     undermine implementation of the NICS. The Administration strongly opposes this
     anti-Brady amendment. Specifically, the Senate amendment does the following three
     things:

      1)     Prohibits the FBI from charging gun dealers a fee for background checks even
             though the FBI currently charges school districts, day care providers, and many
             others for similar background checks. States and local law enforcement agencies
             generally charge dealers for the costs of background checks they complete.
             Without these resources, the FBI will either have to forego processing millions of
             background checks, or transfer resources from other crime fighting efforts.

     (2)     Requires FBI to immediately destroy certain records obtained from clean
             background checks, substantially undercutting the reliability of the background
             check process by making it impossible to catch fraudulent submissions. The FBI
             does intend to destroy such records, but after a reasonable period that allows them
             to audit their records to protect against fraud.

     (3)     Establishes a federal right to sue if records are not immediately destroyed.
             Creating a federal cause of action with punitive damages for person aggrieved by
             the provisions of this amendment are -- pure and simple -- just another attempt to



                                           Automated Records Management System
    undermine the operation of the NICS.           Hex-Dump Conversion
