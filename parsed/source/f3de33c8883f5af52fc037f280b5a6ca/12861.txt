TEXT:
She doesn't really care either way.  The only concern is that if the
President actually has a question about the EO, no one in the briefing
will have really worked on it specifically. Although Chris has been
talking to the press about it today, so I assume he would probably be
fine.  So should I have Courtney take Cynthia off?
