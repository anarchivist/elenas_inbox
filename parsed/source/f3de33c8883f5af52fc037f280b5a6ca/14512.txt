         Here's some opportunity for while Governors in town next week.  I just
         heard from the Dept of Labor that they are about to approve Oregon's
         waiver request under Job Training Partnership Act -- and are looking
         for opportunities on how to best say YES. Here are some facts:

         Oregon is the FIRST state to get a JTPA waiver; others states are
         invited to come forward for similar waivers.

         The waivers are for improved performance of workforce systems and
         outcomes through more flexibility to states/locals to make decisions
         about serving their customers. Removes administrative barriers to
         achieving results.

         This is new statutory waiver authority for the Secy of Labor, which
         resulted in part from the Oregon Option partnership

         President or VP could announce waiver approval at NGA meeting as part
         of points of providing greater flexibilty; and invite other Govs to
         come forward.

         Or, given VP's involvement in Oregon Option, he could meet separately
         with Gov or some other event to make announcement.

     I'll be glad to help in any way.
