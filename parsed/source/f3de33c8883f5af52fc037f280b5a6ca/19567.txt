    Q:   What is your response to the fact that Medicare is losing about $20 billion last year
         to the fraud, waste and simple errors?

    A:   The Administration is proud of our record in fighting fraud and abuse and is
         committed to doing more. Any report that suggests any problem in this area does cause
         concern. It is important to note, however, that this report does not take into account
         many of the actions that the Department has taken on fraud and abuse.

         The Administration has a strong record of fighting fraud and abuse. In fact, since
         1993, we have assigned more federal prosecutors and FBI agents to fight health care
         fraud than ever before. In this time, convictions have gone up a full 240 percent
         and we have saved some $20 billion in health care claims. The
         Kassebaum-Kennedy legislation the President signed into law created -- for the first
         time ever -- a stable funding source to fight fraud and abuse. This law authorized
         our extremely successful Operation Restore Trust initiative, a nationwide program to
         fight abuse and fraud that has identified $23 for every one dollar invested in fines,
         recoveries, settlements, audit disallowances, and civil monetary penalties owed to the
         Federal Government.

         We welcome the Inspector General's report, but point out that it does not reflect
         numerous initiatives to fight waste and fraud that are underway or that the
         President has asked the Congress to pass. There are more than sixteen legislative or
         administrative actions that HCF A has taken that this report does not reflect. These include
         implementing the first ever home health moratorium, doubling the number of medical
         review audits, expanding on-site visits, tightening enrollment standards, and requiring
         home health agencies to post surety bonds. We have also proposed a number of new
         legislative initiatives to fight waste and abuse, such as doubling audits to ensure that
         Medicare only reimburses for appropriate provider costs and eliminating wasteful
         excessive Medicare reimbursement for drugs.

         Moreover, it is important to note that last year's report did not include a review of
         Durable Medical Equipment, an area that is fraught with waste and fraud. Despite
         the fact that this year's audit did include a review of this, the audit shows less fraud and
         waste than in last year's report.

         Our anti-waste and fraud efforts are already paying new dividends. Earlier this
         year, the Medicare actuary reported that the home health baseline spending has been
         reduced from 25 percent to 5.4 percent. These successes are at least partially attributable
         to our efforts.                                    .
