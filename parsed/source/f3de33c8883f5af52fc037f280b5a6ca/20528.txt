 TEXT:
 In China tea is the most corrunon nonalcoholic beverage on sale, although
 Coca-Cola (both original and
 bogus) is making inroads.   Beer is by far the most popular alcoholic
 drink, while'wine'
 is a loose term which can cover oxidised and herb-soaked concoctions, rice
 wine and wine
 containing lizards, .bees or pickled snakes.   Another favourite is maotai,
 a spirit made from
 sorghum which smells like rubbing alcohol and makes a. good substitute for
 petrol or
 paint thinner.

 Does this make you thirsty?

 Just think of what you can be drinking when you turn in your bullets for
 the daily report by 3:00 pm.
