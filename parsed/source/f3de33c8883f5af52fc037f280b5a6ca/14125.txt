TEXT:
I hear that Judith Havemann of the Wash. Post is poking around
today on the implementation date of the food stamp cut-off for
legal immigrants. She has spoken to USDA about this in general;
and to HHS about the fact that Virginia is stating that they are
implementing the cuts.
Here is some background: As of the date of enactment, legal
immigrants applying for food stamps were no longer eligible. USOA
gave states a 30-day grace period to get this up and running. But
the 30 days are just about up, and so states are starting to
implement this for new applicants.
For legal immigrants currently on the rolls, we have allowed
states to use a waiver that could extend the cut-off by several
months, but not all states benefit from this waiver. As you
probably know, we have told California they do not have to
implement this change for current recipients while we figure out
if we can give them some relief.
