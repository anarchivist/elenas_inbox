TEXT:
Good news: Treasury is ready to issue tax guidance making clear that
smoking cessation costs are a medical expense, and are thus tax deductible
(up to the existing limits in law, e.g. to the extent medical expenses
exceed 7.5% of income).   This is a reversal of an opinion from 1979 based
on the new evidence that smoking is addictive and harmful -- yet another
sign that even mainstream institutions like the IRS recognize these cold
hard facts.  As with other medicines or drugs, only those prescribed by a
physician are deductible.

I don't think this is worth holding for an event.  I'd recommend we either
        a) put out a written VP or Surgeon General statement
        b) leak it
