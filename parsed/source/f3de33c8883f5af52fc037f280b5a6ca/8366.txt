THatch, Feinstein want tobacco bill similar to states' agreement

     WASHINGTON (AP)   Two senators added their bill to a growing
tobacco policy revival effort Tuesday, saying Congress should not
waste election-year momentum by ignoring legislation that would
support anti-smoking research.
     --I think we'd be stupid not to grab that"  opportunity, said
Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch of Utah, who is
cosponsoring the legislation with Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.
     --If this fails, then both sides deserve the blame, " Hatch
said.
     The proposal was instantly panned from opposite sides of the
political spectrum.
     Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., said the bill's price tag is still
too high to comport with the GOP's promise to lower taxes and
shrink government.
     --I don't see the Senate getting bogged down in any bill that
spends hundreds of billions of dollars, " he told reporters.
     Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass, one of Congress' foremost
anti-smoking activists, said the bill didn't do enough to
discourage kids from smoking.
     --It's totally and completely inadequate,"  he said.
     Feinstein acknowledged the difficulties the bill faces.
     --I think there's a lot of involvement of people's egos in the
issue and some don't want to see anybody else come along with any
kind of a solution, " Feinstein said.
     Hatch and Feinstein have not formally introduced the bill, and
neither congressional leaders nor the White House have endorsed it.


Still, it draws more attention to the pile of suggestions for how
to revive the anti-smoking legislation that was shelved by the
Senate last week.
     Senate Democrats have promised to offer the rejected bill    a
sweeping measure sponsored by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.    as an
amendment to virtually every measure that comes to the Senate
floor. A group of conservative Senate leaders are crafting a more
narrow approach that would address teen smoking and drug use.
     House leaders are expected this week to rollout their own bill,
a measure that would fund an anti-smoking advertising campaign,
limit vending machine placement and address teen drug abuse.
     Hatch and Feinstein, meanwhile, said the only model that would
significantly reduce teen smoking and crack down on tobacco
companies is their bill, modeled on the $368 billion settlement
struck last June between the industry and the dozens of states
suing them.
     Under the measure they described, the bill would charge tobacco
companies $428 billion over 25 years, about $88 billion less than
the price tag of McCain's bill.
     Also unlike McCain's bill, the measure would not require tobacco
companies to raise cigarette prices, mandating only that the
industry make their payments on time, regardless of how the money
is raised. Hatch acknowledged, however, that the industry likely
would pass on that burden by raising pack prices by as much as
$1.00 a pack over 10 years.
     The Hatch-Feinstein bill would ban class action lawsuits against
the tobacco industry and cap the damages companies could be forced
to pay at $5.5 billion a year and $1 million a year per plaintiff.
     Like McCain's bill, Hatch and Feinstein's measure would fund
anti-smoking research, settle state lawsuits and approve new
authority for the Food and Drug Administration.
     The funding would provide:           .
     -$100 billion biomedical research into addiction and
smoking-related diseases, funds that could not be diverted for
other purposes.
     -$92 billion for public health programs such as smoking
cessation and public education.
     -$18.7 billion for tobacco farmers, also phasing out the price
support system.
     -$9.4 billion to beef up law enforcement.
     -$204 billion to states to settle their lawsuits against the
industry.
     In addition, the tobacco companies would be fined up to $10
billion if teen smoking rates do not sufficiently drop. The bill
also would establish a three-member panel to decide attorneys'
fees, which tobacco companies would pay in addition to the money
required by the bill.
     --That's not peanuts,"  Hatch said.
