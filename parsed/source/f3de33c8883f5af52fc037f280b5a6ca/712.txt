TEXT:
Communications is asking me for a welfare number for the state of the
union that I thought you should know about (if you don't already).  They
asked for the number of welfare recipients who are able-bodied, with no
children under 1. They said the underlying goal is to get a measure of
who is able to work, because they aren't disabled or don't have very small
kids at home. Olivia says she doubts that exact number is available, but
was checking.  She also had concerns about what the context would be.   Let
me know if you have any insight/concerns.
