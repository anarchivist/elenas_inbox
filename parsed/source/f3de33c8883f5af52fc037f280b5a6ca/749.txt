Thanks. This Q&A works perfectly and I will let Melanne know.   I had left
her a message based on our conversation last night so she knew the likely
outcome.  Pls let me know if you hear anything mroe definitive from DOJ.

AS an aside, I was disturbed by the discussion of a "flexible fund" this
morning, but we can discuss this tomorrow.
