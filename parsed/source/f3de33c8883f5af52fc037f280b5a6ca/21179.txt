Subject: H2A -- update

Maria,
On July 30, Secretary Herman wrote Senator Coverdell indicating her
commitment to establish a bi-partisan working group to examine H2A
issues.  In the letter, the Secretary indicated that if these efforts lead
to a consensus on how best to address H2A r'eform issues, she would give
"serious consideration" to the proposals.    In August, DOL had discussions
with Senator Coverdell's legislative director outlining the
Administration'S plans for proceeding with the bi-partisan working group.
Senator Coverdell indicated that he wanted to respond to the Secretary's
letter in writing, with suggestions of how to move forward.

Soon after sending the Coverdell letter, DOL made contact with Senators
Wyden, Graham, Kennedy, Abraham, G. Smith and Feinstein and
Representatives L. Smith, Bishop, Becerra, Watt, and Berman reo the
establishment of this working group and their participation in it.
However, Senator Coverdell's office has been reluctant to set a date for
this first meeting (again indicating that the Senator wanted to respond to
the Secretary with process suggestions).  Because the committment to
establish this working group was to Senator Coverdell, his participation
is key. DOL's last contact with Coverdell's staff was yesterday (Tuesday
Sept. 8th). During that meeting, they again pressed for a committment to
meet next week. Coverdell's staffer is scheduled to call DOL back on
Thursday (the 10th) .

Our plan for the first meeting of this bi-partisan group is to focus on
process issues, principles for reform, and the framework for considering
policy options.  Subsequent meetings will address the substantive issues.

Last week, we (DPC, NEC and OMB) held two meetings with Labor and USDA in
an attempt to go through policy options for H2A reform and determine pros,


cons and recommendations.  Though we have made good progress in
understanding the issues, we have not made much progress toward reaching
consensus between the agencies. We have another inter-agency meeting
(this time, including INS) scheduled for Friday, September 11th at llam.
We hope to be able to make WH staff-level recommendations about what
reform should look like sometime in the next week to 10 days, and then
proceed with a Deputies and Principals meeting' as soon as we can.
