TEXT:
SSA has shared with us their draft report on children's SSI -- the 30-day
top to bottom review that Ken promised.   I am looking at it closely with
OMB and a guy from Sylvia's office (Nelson Reyneri, who comes to all our
meetings on this).  The content looks reasonable to us, but it is not
written as clearly as it might be.  So we are asking questions and giving
them suggestions.  I don't think we'll need another meeting with Ken and
us on this, but I'm not sure of that yet.

Ken Apfel wants to release it at the end of the week because he plans to
go to California next week, but I'm not sure that timetable is realistic.

Sylvia's person says she wants to give the President an
information/summary note on this right before it's released, so I plan to
write that tomorrow.  I'll send it to you.  Supposedly Sylvia has also
made the legitimate point that it would be preferable not to release this
immediately before the holidays.
