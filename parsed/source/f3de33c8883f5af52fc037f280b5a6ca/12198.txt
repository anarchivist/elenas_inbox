     Subject: Bilingual Education Comments (Title VII)




     The ED Branch has the following comments on Bilingual and Immigrant
     Education (Title VII) :

     1. Section 704. Comprehensive School Grants and Section 705. Systemwide
     Improvement Grants

     Edit section (b) (2) (A) regarding terminations to read as follows: "(A)
     after three years of the grant, a significant number of students in the
     program with limited English proficiency, who have been in United States
     schools for three consecutive years, have not attained English proficiency
     per the required annual assessment and made continuous progress in
     achieving challenging State content and performance standards;"

         The edits are intended to make it clear that terminations of
     unsatisfactory programs begin after three, not four, years.   "Continuous
     progress in learning English" is not a sufficient measure of success for
     the programs -- they should meet the test of students actually attaining
     English proficiency (per the annual assessment of English proficiency that
     the Act will require) after three years of being in U.S. schools.


2. Applications.   In order to take into account previous performance of
an applicant and prevent renewals or additional awards to previously
unsuccessful grantees, the following language should be added to Section
706 (h) Approval of Applications:

An application for a grant under this subpart may be approved only if the
Secretary determines that--

    (7) if an applicant has received funding previously under this Title,
that substantial numbers of students in the program with limited English
proficiency, who had been in the United States schools for three
consecutive years, attained English proficiency in accord with the
required annual assessment and made continous progress in achieving
challenging State content and performance standards.

3. Page 23: Training of All Teachers Program should be Training for All
Teachers Program.

4. If the "Training for all Teachers Program" is strictly for inservice
teachers who may not necessarily be Bilingual Ed or ESL teachers and the
"Bilingual Education Teachers and Personnel Grants" program is strictly
preservice, but ONLY for teachers who are planning to be Bilingual Ed or
ESL teachers (as stated in the purpose), where are we providing training
for all teachers, preservice, to help them teach LEP children who will
likely be in their classrooms? If it is supposed to be the "Bilingual
Education Teachers and Personnel Grants" program, then the purpose should
be changed to "support preservice professional development to improve the
preparation of all prospective teachers, in particular those who are
preparing to teach children and youth of limited English proficiency."

5. Add a priority section for all four professional development programs
to state that the Secretary will give priority to applicants whose
programs have been certified by the National Professional Development
Certification Board (created in Title II) .

6.   Section 721. Foreign Language Assistance Program.    How does this
program differ from the one being proposed in Title X?

      Why fund the Elementary School Foreign Language Incentive program
if FLAP funding exeeds $8 million, especially if only 25% of that funding
can be provided as incentive funds? That doesn't seem to be sufficient
funding to provide incentive payments for each fiscal year to each public
elementary school that provides to students attending such school a
program designed to lead to communicative competency in a foreign language
   especially when "communicative competency" is any program that provides
45 minutes of instruction at least 4 times a week.

7. Emergency Immigrant Education Program. We've been including language
in appropriations for the last few years to allow SEAs to compete the
Immigant Education money to LEAs rather than allocate in all in formula.
Don't we need to put that language in the reauthorization to make it
permanent?
