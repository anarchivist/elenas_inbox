TEXT:
Right now, we have room 450 OEOB reserved for Thursday, April 10 from
10:00 a.m. until noon for a meeting with the 120 non-cabinet agencies who
will be submitting welfare recipient hiring plans but will not be part of
the afternoon cabinet meeting. We also have a scheduling request in for
the VP and a verbal request into Sec. Shalala's office for them to speak
at the meeting.

Bruce and/or Elena, can you put this meeting on your schedule and attend
as well? One of you should probably make opening remarks and introduce
the VP and/or Sec.
