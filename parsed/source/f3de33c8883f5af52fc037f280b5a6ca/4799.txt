TEXT:
I talked to Karl.  He says that the EITC exemption in the balanced budget
makes him predict very, very strongly that the Service will rule workfare
is not subject to FICA. But he does not believe they are in any kind of
rush to rule. He believes that, if he wrote some kind of internal tome on
the subject, he could make it enough of a priority in his own office that
that would shake it loose and get a ruling issued.  (I'm not sure why, but
he was very definite on this point.) But he says he just hasn't had time
to get to it, since he is swamped on a million other high priority
matters. So maybe we need to let someone know at higher levels that
Karl's work on this is as high a priority as whatever else he is working
on.

By the way, he is also talking a lot to Center on Budget, which is
apparently urging them to act, and trying to figure out how the Service
would define work experience and community service.
