TEXT:
You asked me to check with Morley on the idea of moving inspections from
FDA to USDA and re-naming USDA. He likes the idea, particularly if it can
take care of the VP's problem with pesticides.   (It might, increased
inspections in fruit and veggies plants could conceivably decrease the
pesticide problem there -- I'll look into it).    He asked we put together
a short memo and hold a meeting with you and Neal Lane to figure whether
and how to break this to HHS.  I said sure.  I'd like to first set up a
Bruce, Elena, Neal Lane meeting for Friday to discuss this and the NAS
response. OK?

  I will collect any contributions OPC would like to make to this effort.
  Just drop them off in my office (OEOB 207) by 5:00pm on Friday.  Please
  let me know if you have any questions.  Thank you!

  On March 8th, the President will address the people of Posoltega,
  Nicaragua in an event to be held at the local high school.  Posoltega,
  along with much of Nicaragua, is still recovering from the devastation
  left behind by Hurricane Mitch in November of 1998. Posoltega suffered
  some of the worst damage when a massive mudslide from Las Casitas Volcano
  hit the town.  Two nearby villages were entirely destroyed by the slides.
  It was reported that only 92 of the estimated 2,000 area residents were
  found alive, some injured, and the remainder were listed as missing.

  Relief efforts have been great, but Posoltega is still lacking essential
  supplies. Over 600 students currently attend classes in makeshift tents.
  They are seriously in need of essential school supplies.  To help, we
  would like to send some supplies with the President to be distributed to
  these 4 "tent schools." Ory erase boards, different sizes/shades of
  paper, poster board, colored pencils, crayons, markers, tape, notebooks,
  scissors, rulers, world globes, basic first aid kits, blank cassettes, and
  cassette recorders are among the supplies needed.

  If you would like to donate some of these supplies please bring your
  donations to Room 184 OEOB by Sunday, March 7. Thank you for your
  generosity!

  Note:   These can be personal donations only. No government
  purchased supplies.  Please do not solicit outside donations.     Thank you!
