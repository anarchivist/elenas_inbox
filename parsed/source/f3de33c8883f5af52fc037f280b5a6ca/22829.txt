TEXT:
Thanks for your offer to help get timely guidance for Joe's briefing.
Sadly, it did not go well today.  We did not get guidance from DPC until
12:00 pm (asked for by 11:15 am).  Joe has a foreign policy call every day
from12:00 pm until 12:30 pm, so this left him with less than a half hour
to absorb all the domestic guidance (and there was a lot today).    He was
not too pleased. Would appreciate whatever you can do to help this along
-- it's a particularly important period for us now. Thanks.
