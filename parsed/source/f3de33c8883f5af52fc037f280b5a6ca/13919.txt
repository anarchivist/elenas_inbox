FYI, Lyons sent an informational memo to Harold Ickes on August
3rd about the China Left sale in Oregon, yet another controversial
318 sale w/protestors and law enf. issues. Jennifer asked Shelley
about any follow-up this afternoon, and attached is my response.
If you don't have the memo to Ickes and would like to have it,
i'll fax it to you.

Shelley said you inquired as to whether there was any update from
Jim Lyons' Aug. 3rd memo to Harold.  I just talked to Jim Lyons,
and he said he had heard nothing about China Left today and had
asked to be alerted if there was any news.  He is also working
with Jack to develop a list this week of problematic sales as a
start to develping an overall strategy for dealing with these
issues.
