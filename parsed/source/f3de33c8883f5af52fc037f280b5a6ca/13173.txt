Yes, I did pick up word of this.  Can you keep me posted on
anything you pick up on his reaction and/or any decision he makes?
Did you catch the mention at yesterday's meeting that the timber
industry is arguing the same construct on the Option 9 language in
the rescission bill as they did (successfully) on 318? I will
take a look at the legislative history on this, but if you also
have a chance and have any thoughts it would be worth talking.
