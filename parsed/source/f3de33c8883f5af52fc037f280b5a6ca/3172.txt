               TEXT:
               In his briefing today, McCurry had the following response to the issue of
               Flo-jo being removed from the President's Council on Physical Fitness to
               make way for Jack Steinfeld.

               McCurry stated that while the President wants Jack Steinfeld to join the
               PCPF, he also feels that Flo-jo should remain on the Council.  The goal is
               to have enthusiastic and dynamic members on the council, and they both
               exhibit these qualities.

               Our personnel office has attempted to reach her and has been having
               discussions with her husband in regard to her continuing service.

               The fu~l transcript will be distributed in McCurry's briefing.  Please let
               me know if you don't receive it, and I will forward a transcript to you.

               Thanks.
