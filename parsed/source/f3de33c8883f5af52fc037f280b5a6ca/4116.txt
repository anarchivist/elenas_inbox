  TEXT:
  I checked with Ron about a VP event on the national tests next week.  He
  would like to see if the VP could do a national standards event on
  Thursday, September 4,  rather than Wednesday the 3rd. This is mostly
. because the VP is already doing a "message" event on welfare-to-work
  Wednesday.

We will discuss it further later in the day, but I wanted to check and see
what you all thought -- given potential floor votes, etc.    of the
Thursday option.

Also ... yesterday, someone raised the benefits of including business
leaders and educators in the CEO national test endorsement event last
fall.    Do you think we should broaden any conference call/event next week
to include educators (e.g. superintendents, teachers, teacher unions) as
well as the CEOS?
