MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY
                 THE ATTORNEY GENERAL

SUBJECT:                      Deterring and Reducing Illegal Gun Crime


Since the start of our Administration, we have developed and implemented a number of effective
national strategies to reduce crime: we have helped over 11,000 communities hire and redeploy
more than 92,000 local law enforcement officers; we have prevented more than a quarter of a
million illegal handgun sales through Brady background checks; and we have developed a
coordinated attack on the illegal sources of crime guns. Additionally, through the leadership and
dedicated efforts of state and local police and prosecutors, Mayors, U.S. Attorneys, the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF), and other community leaders, dozens of smart, tough,
crime-fighting strategies have been put in place throughout the country.

During this period, the nation's crime rate has dropped by more than 20 percent, and crime
committed with guns has dropped 27 percent. In certain communities, where federal, state~ and
local law enforcement have been able to work together with other community leaders, violent
crime rates have been reduced dramatically. In Boston, Massachusetts, for example, when law
enforcement and community leaders worked together to reduce violence by youth gangs, they
were able to reduce the number of homicides among youth by 70 percent in just two years. In
Minneapolis, Minnesota, through unique public and private partnerships, effective law
enforcement and prevention efforts have reduced homicides by 30 percent, and summer
homicides by 75 percent. And in Richmond, Virginia, effective, coordinated law enforcement
has brought the homicide rate down dramatically.

But the number of people being killed with firearms remains unacceptably high: more than
14,000 people were murdered with guns in our nation in 1997. We must redouble our efforts to
deter and further reduce gun crime -- and work to make every neighborhood and community free
of serious gun crime.

I therefore direct you to develop an integrated firearms violence reduction strategy that draws on
the proven measures and other innovative approaches being demonstrated by communities
throughout the country. Because we know that gun violence issues in each community differ,
and that no single program or strategy will be right for every community, your strategy should be
based on close consultation with the U.S. Attorneys and ATF Division Directors/Special Agents
in Charge, as well as state and local law enforcement, officials, and other leaders. You should
consider the special needs oflocal communities and strike an appropriate balance between
federal and state law enforcement. I ask that your strategy specifically consider the following
elements:

       (1) Intensive investigation and prosecution of significant firearms violations, including
                           Automated Records Management System
                           Hex-Dump Conversion

           illegal possession, use, and trafficking of guns;

           (2) Comprehensive crime gun tracing, analysis and mapping, expanded use of ballistics
           identification technology, and coordinated use of crime gun information to identify illegal
           gun markets, gun "hot spots," and illegal gun traffickers;

           (3) Coordinated law and regulatory enforcement efforts to ensure strict compliance with
           all applicable laws by federally-licensed gun dealers and prospective gun purchasers;

           (4) Targeted deterrence of violent offenders through improved coordination with
           probation and parole officials; and

           (5) Innovative strategies to work more closely with the community to search for and seize
           more crime guns, to better identify gun criminals, to remove weapons illegally in the
           hands of juveniles, and to increase the public's knowledge of their community's
           gun-related crime and violence problem.

    Finally, as you develop this strategy, I ask that you make recommendations on how best to
    allocate federal resources to support the goals of the strategy.
