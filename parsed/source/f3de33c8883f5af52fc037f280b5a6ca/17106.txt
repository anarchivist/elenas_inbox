SUBJECT:       Initiative to Safeguard Imported Foods


Earlier this year, I directed my Administration to undertake a broad initiative to improve the
safety ofthe nation's food supply. That initiative is designed to address attention to a number of
steps at which the safety of food from farm to table can be rapidly improved. The initiative
focuses on opportunities in foodborne illness surveillance, enhanced coordination among federal
and state agencies with food-safety responsibilities, and enhanced inspection, research,
education, and risk assessment programs. I am now directing my Administration to direct
specific attention to ensuring the safety of imported foods.

My Administration will take actions to increase assurances that all foods, from farm to table, and
including imported foods, meet high standards of safety. Recognizing the increasing complexity
of food systems, from domestic to international, from production to retail and food service, and
the gaps in our knowledge about foodborne illness outbreaks, their causes and sources, we need
to take appropriate steps to maintain the safety of our food supply.

I hereby direct that you work together with the food industry and with our partners in trade to
ensure the safety of foods imported into the United States. Your actions should include
development of guidance to minimize microbial food safety risks from fresh fruits and vegetables
and enhanced oversight authority for imported foods. You should work with the food industry
and with consumers and the public to develop outreach and educational efforts to encourage
producers to adopt these guidance practices. You should also work to evaluate the potential for
food-safety problems in exporting countries, and to help those countries develop their own best
practices. You should accelerate food-safety research. You should report back to me in one
year with the status of your actions and your further recommendations.

Finally, I am directing the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and the
Secretary of Labor to commit staff resources to assist the Secretaries of Health and Human
Services and Agriculture in achieving these goals.
                                                                 Hwe-Dum" C

                              Initiative to Safeguard Imported Foods
                                        Summary of Initiative


The Clinton Administration proposes to increase assurances that all foods, from farm to table,
and including imported foods, meet high standards of safety. As we recognize the increasing
complexity of food systems, from domestic to international, from production to retail and food
service, and the gaps in our knowledge about foodbome illness outbreaks, their causes and
sources, we need to take the appropriate steps to maintain the safety of our food supply.
Therefore, the Administration is proposing the following steps.

Guidance for Fresh Fruits and Vegetables

FDA will develop "Guidance to Minimize Microbial Food Safety Risks for Fruits and
Vegetables" in collaboration with USDA and with the food industry. This guidance will include
such issues as sanitation in harvesting and production facilities, transportation, water quality, and
worker health and safety. FDA and USDA will convene a public meeting to discuss guidance
concepts by mid-November 1997. Information from the public meeting will be used to publish
this guidance for all fresh fruits and vegetables by January 1, 1998. Working with USDA and
the food industry, FDA will publish good agricultural practices (GAPs) and good manufacturing
practices (GMPs) guidance by the end of 1998 that will build on the broader guidance and be
further tailored to apply specifically to each of four to eight produce categories (representing a
significant proportion ofthe fresh produce consumed annually in the United States).

Enhanced FDA Oversight Authority for Imported Foods

The Administration will propose legislation to enable FDA to ensure that no food may be
imported into the United States unless it is produced under a system that provides the same level
of public-health protection provided by the U.S. food-safety system. (USDA already has such
authority for ensuring the safety of imported meat and poultry.) In addition, legislation will be
proposed that will allow FDA to refuse importation of a food that comes from a facility that
refused to permit FDA inspection. USDA and FDA will develop country profiles assessing the
food production, transportation, and handling practices in place in foreign countries. USDA and
FDA will also encourage the adoption of good practices overseas through technical assistance,
training, and cooperative research efforts. The agencies will target these activities and
assistance to suppliers of products being shipped to the United States.

New Resources to Oversee Imported Foods

The Administration will ask Congress to appropriate new funding, beginning in FY'99, to
implement these initiatives. These funds will allow the federal agencies responsible for food
safety to carry out such activities as hiring of new FDA inspectors to inspect foreign food
producers and to inspect food imported into this country, and to carry out research to develop
methods to detect disease-causing pathogens in food.
                                                                H~n.,,,,_ C       .Management SysteJn

Report to the President

FDA and USDA will report back to the President by October 1, 1998, with a status report on
progress toward the establishment of guidance to minimize microbial food-safety risks for fruits
and vegetables, the legislation to enhance FDA's authority to keep unsafe foods out of the United
States, and the testing, research, education, outreach and any other actions needed to implement
this initiative. For example, this report will detail needs for better understanding of how food
becomes contaminated--at every point in its production and distribution--and our needs for better
scientific methods to more rapidly identify and eliminate pathogens from our food supply.
