TEXT:
Maria, Craig and I have submitted a scheduling request for the President
to attend and give the keynote speech at the National Dinner of the Human
Rights Campaign in Washington on Saturday evening, November 8th.

It is my strong recommendation that we accept this invitation. All things
considered, this is the best opportunity we will get this year to address
a (extremely supportive) gay audience.    And as you know, the Human
Rights Campaign has been extremely supportive and we owe them.

Moreover, the PresidentD,s remarks could preview the Hate Crimes
Conference, which takes place the following Monday.
