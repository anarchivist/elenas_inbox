                                                Q&A
                                            July 15, 1998

    Q.   What is your reaction to the House vote (276-150) on the Child Custody Protection
         Act?

    A.   We are disappointed that the House chose to reject the changes that we proposed to this
         legislation. We have repeatedly stated that we would support properly crafted legislation
         that would make it illegal to transport minors across state lines in order to avoid parental
         involvement requirements.

         We asked the House to amend the bill to exclude close family members from criminal
         and civil liability. Under the legislation, grandmothers, aunts and siblings could face
         criminal prosecution for coming to the aid of a relative in distress. We also asked the
         House to amend the bill so that individuals who provide only information, counseling,
         referral, or medical services to the minor cannot be subject to liability. Finally, the
         Department of Justice recommended changes to address constitutional problems raised by
         the legislation.

         These proposed changes would preserve the goal of the legislation to prevent the
         circumvention of state parental involvement laws, while both ensuring that minors are not
         isolated from close family members and preserving healthy family communications.

    Q.   Would the President veto the bill if it is sent to him in its current form?

    A.   We strongly oppose the bill in its current form. If Congress is truly interested in passing
         legislation, and not creating another partisan political issue, it will amend the bill as we
         requested.
