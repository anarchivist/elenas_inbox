 One question:   Waldman wants to call the high school service scholarships
 "AmeriCorps scholarships."   Do you have a problem with that? Current
 draft doesn't say that, but Waldman may add.

                           PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
                         RADIO ADDRESS ON CITIZEN SERVICE
                                 THE WHITE HOUSE
                                   JULY 25, 1997

        Good morning. I am joined here at the White House by the young men of Boys Nation,
an outstanding organization that has inspired thousands of young people -- including myself -- to
serve their country by serving in their communities.

        I want to talk to you today about what we must do to make citizen service a part of every
American's life, for his or her entire lifetime. As I said at Independence Hall in Philadelphia at
the Presidents Service Summit this past April, the era of big government may be over, but the era
of big citizenship must now begin. At that summit, thousands of Americans pledged their
commitment to service. And as we prepare to go forward into the 21 st Century, every one of us
must join them, so we can meet our challenges and come together as one America.

       For the past four and a half years, my administration has worked to give every American
a chance to serve. We want to spark a renewed sense of obligation, a new sense of duty, and a
new season of service all across America.

        Of everything we have done to meet that challenge, I am proudest of AmeriCorps, our
national service organization that has helped more than 70,000 young Americans all over the
country to earn money for college while they serve their communities. AmeriCorps members do
real work to address critical problems -- from cleaning up the environment, to helping at-risk
children learn to read, to working with police to keep our streets safe, to helping our nation reach
record levels of child immunization.

        At the Service Summit I announced that our Administration would provide 50,000 new
AmeriCorps scholarships over the next five years to organizations that offer young people the
chance to serve. I am pleased to say today that 77 organizations have answered that challenge
by offering to sponsor 10,000 new AmeriCorps members. And I thank those organizations for
their commitment to promoting citizen service.

        The success of AmeriCorps proves that citizen service works. And it is only one of the
many things the national government is doing to work in partnership with citizens, businesses
and civic groups. My Administration is busy following up on the commitments we made in
Philadelphia at the Service Summit. This Fall, the Department of Agriculture will hold a food
recovery summit that will help organize volunteers to distribute food to the needy. The Justice
Department's new Mentoring Alliance will link children in need with volunteer mentors. And
the Department of Health and Human Services' new partnership with the Girl Scouts of America
will teach girls about the danger of drugs. In all these ways, we are committed to encouraging
service throughout American life.
                                                                               Hex·Dump Conversion

       Commitment to community should be an ethic that our children learn as early as
possible, so they carry it throughout their lives. That is why I have called on every state
to make service a part of the curriculum in high school or even middle school. There are
many creative ways to do this - including giving students credit for service, incorporating
service into course work, putting service on a student's transcript, or even requiring
service, as Maryland does.

       In addition to the AmeriCorps scholarship program we announced at the Service
Summit, last year we took additional steps to encourage our young people to serve their
communities in high school. We said we would offer $500 scholarships to high school juniors
and seniors with the best record of service in their class if communities and private service
organizations would match that amount.

        Just one year later, I am proud to say that some of our nation's most prominent service
organizations have answered that call. Today, I am pleased to announce that 1,600 high school
students will receive scholarships of up to $1,000 to pay for college, and many of them are here
with me today. The American Legion, the Kiwanis Club, the Rotary Club, the Elks Club, the
Lions Club, the Junior Leagues, and the Miss America Foundation -- community groups are the
glue that hold America together. And now they are giving our young people another reason to
give something back to our communities.

        This is just the first year of the National Service Scholars. program, and I know that next
year it will be even bigger. Our goal is to make this program available in every high school, so
that every high school principal in America can stand before a graduating class and announce the
name of a National Service Scholar. And with the support of groups like those who have
already committed to help, I am confident that we can make this happen.

       Something very important to our nation happened at the President's Service Summit --
people from all walks of life looked beyond their differences and came together around the
common goal of serving our country. This is the way we meet our challenges: business working
together with government, religious and community groups joining forces, and people lending a
hand to help one another. Today we are taking an important step to build on that progress.

       The spirit of the Service Summit is stronger than ever -- and it is up to us to keep it alive.

       Thanks for listening.
