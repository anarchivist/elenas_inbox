     Subject:         Senior Staff Holiday Coverage Reminder

     I am collecting information on senior staff coverage for the upcoming
     holidays (December 22 - January 2).  The Chief of Staff has requested a
     complete list of senior staff (Assistants to the President and Deputy
     Assistants to the President only) who will be working for the holidays, as
     well as the names of those senior staff on call and how they may be
     reached.

     Please submit your names and dates to me as soon as possible.  I will be
     submitting this information to the Chief of Staff on Friday afternoon.

     Remember to provide the WHCA Signal Switchboard with information on how
     senior staff may be contacted while away from the office.
