PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
RADIO ACTUALITY ON ED-FLEX AMENDMENT
February 25, 1999

        This year we have an opportunity to work together, across party
lines, to bring true progress to AmericaO,s public schools.   I welcome the
idea of greater flexibility for states and school districts; and I urge
the Senate to pass Ed-Flex legislation that provides for greater
flexibility and accountability.   But we must do more to give our children
a world-class education. That is why I strongly support the amendment
proposed by Senators Kennedy and Murray. We must make a national
commitment to hiring more teachers and reducing the size of classrooms aero
55 America.  Studies confirm what every parent already knows: smaller
classes make a big difference, from improved test scores to improved
discipline. The Senate should pass the Kennedy-Murray Amendment, and give
our nationO,s children the individual attention they deserve in the
classroom, and the better future that only a good education can bring.
