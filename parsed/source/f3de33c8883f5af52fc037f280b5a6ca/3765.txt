 MEETING WITH SENATORS McCAIN (R-AZ) AND FEINGOLD (D-WI) THE LEAD
                  SENATE SPONSORS OF BIPARTISAN
              CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM LEGISLATION


                          DATE:       August 1, 1997
                          LOCATION:   Oval Office
                          TIME:       9:45 a_m. to 10:15 a.m.
                          From:       John Hilley
                                      Peter Jacoby


I.        PURPOSE

     To conduct a working session with Senators McCain and
Feingold to discuss the legislative, political and public
relations strategies that will be necessary to enact comprehensive
campaign finance reform legislation.

II.       BACKGROUND

     This past Wednesday, Senators McCain and Feingold announced
on the Senate floor that they are committed to bringing campaign
finance reform legislation to the floor in September.
Subsequently, the Senators requested this meeting to discuss and
coordinate the strategy for passing their legislation when it
is considered. The two key issues for discussion will be: 1)
how can the Administration best work with the Senators to gain
support for their bill; and, 2) what changes to the legislation
will be necessary (and acceptable to you) for the measure to pass
the Senate.

     Early this year you met with Senators McCain and Feingold
[and Congressmen Shays (R-CT) and Meehan(D-MA)] and committed
your Administration to a serious effort to enact comprehensive
campaign finance reform legislation.   Since that time you have
announced a series of initiatives designed both to advance
substantive campaign finance reforms and to focus attention on
the need for legislation. Those initiatives include petitioning
the Federal Elections Commission to conduct a rulemaking
proceeding that would ban or limit soft money; announcing your
support for free television for political candidates; announcing
                                                            Hex·Dump Conversion
                                       2

the co-chairs of a Presidential commission tasked to study the
public interest requirements for the broadcasters that receive
digital spectrum; announcing that the Solicitor General will argue
in favor of court challenges to the Buckley v. Valeo decision
when, and if, those challenges are considered by the Supreme Court;
and naming former Senators Kassebaum-Baker and Mondale to lead
an effort to develop support for reform.    Finally, during their
floor announcement earlier this week, Senators McCain and Feingold
read a Presidential statement supporting their efforts to bring
the bill to the floor in September.

     While these Administration initiatives have helped
demonstrate your support for campaign finance reform, they - and
the efforts by outside groups to build support - have not resulted
in the addition of enough Republican cosponsors to the
McCain-Feingold bill to ensure Senate passage of the measure.
In fact, since January, only Senator Collins (R-ME) has joined
as a Republican cosponsor of the legislation.

      Consequently, the Senators will ask for a strong commitment
of White House resources during the weeks leading up to the bill's
floor consideration in September. Additionally, because there
has been so little support from Senate Republicans, Senator McCain
will indicate that he believes the comprehensive McCain-Feingold
billl, which includes public benefits such as free and reduced
rate television for a candidate who accepts spending limits,
should be scaled back to gain Republican votes.

     The scaled back bill that Senator McCain envisions would
include: 1) a ban on soft money; 2) provisions that would require
greater and more timely disclosure of contributions; 3) provisions
to enhance the FEC's enforcement capabilities; 4) provisions to
restrict issue advocacy expenditures designed to influence
elections; and, 5) the codification of the Supreme Court's
decision in the Beck case.    That case held that non-union
employees in closed shops were entitled to a refund on the portion
of their union dues spent on political activities.

      1 The current McCain-Feingold bill would: 1) ban PAC's - with lower PAC
limits if the ban is found unconstitutional; 2) provide incentives (such as free
and reduced rate television and radio time and low cost mailing) for candidates
who voluntarily agree to aggregate campaign spending limits; 3) ban political
contributions from individuals who are ineligible to vote; 4) ban soft money;
5) make it extremely difficult for political parties to run either independent
expenditure ads or express advocacy ads on behalf of their candidates for federal
office; 6)restrict express advocacy spending aimed as influencing elections; 7)
ban bundling of campaign contributions, and; 8)improve FEC enforcement
capabilities.

     Notably, Senator McCain's incremental bill does not include
spending limits - a key reform supported by Senator Daschle and
great majority of Senate Democrats.   In addition, the Beck
provisions, which many Republicans have said should be codified
to require all union members to affirmatively approve the use
of their dues for political activities, are strongly opposed by
Congressional Democrats.   For these reasons, Senator Feingold
has strongly resisted attempts to scale back the current
legislation.

    TALKING POINTS FOR MEETING WITH SENATORS McCAIN AND FEINGOLD


·      Thank you for your considerable efforts on this critical issue_ Your
       leadership on one of the most difficult issues in Washington is greatly
       admired and appreciated.

·      When we met last winter I promised to work closely with you on this issue to
       do what I could to move reform along. As you know, I have announced a
       number of initiatives during the past months to do just that -- the effort by
       Senators Mondale and Kassebaum-Baker, the FEC petition on soft money,
       my efforts on free television time for candidates and the announcement that
       the Solicitor General would join in on any challenge to Buckley v. Valeo.

·      I can assure you that I remain fully committed to seeing meaningful,
       significant campaign finance reform become a reality during this Congress
       and I want to do everything I can to make that happen.

·      Now that we have all agreed and announced that this is coming to the Senate
       floor in September, I want to discuss how you think we should approach this
       effort and what I can do to make all of our work result in good, strong
       campaign finance reform legislation.
