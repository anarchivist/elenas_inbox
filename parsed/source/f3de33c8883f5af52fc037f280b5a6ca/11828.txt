TEXT:
BR/EK:

Just got a copy of Hatch's press advisory for tomorrow.  He's planning a
press conference on his bill for 11:30 am in SROB 325, and will be joined
by Senators Nickles, Ashcroft, DeWine, Thurmond, Abraham, and unnamed "law
enforcement organizations." According to his advisory, the bill will;

-- preserve the Local Law Enforcement Block Grant zeroed out by the
Administration;

-- continue violent offender/truth-in-sentencing grants eliminated by the
Administration;

-- increase drug penalties for meth, powder cocaine, and funding for drug
interdiction and faith-based drug treatment (the Drug-Free Century Act,
S. 5) ;

   increase funding for the Juvenile Accountability Block Grant zeroed out
by the Administration;

   expands Project Exile in an effort to reverse the Administration's
dismal record on gun prosecutions (down nearly 50% between 1992 and 1997,
from 7,045 to 3,765);

-- reform Miranda to allow voluntary statements in evidence, add a
"good-faith" exception, and further reform the death penalty appeals
process;

-- calls for ratification of a constitutional amendment on victims rights,
reauthorizes VAWA, and makes improvements to mandatory restitution laws.

Stay tuned ... j c3
