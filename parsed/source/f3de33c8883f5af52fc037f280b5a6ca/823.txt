TEXT:
Per your request, a couple of sentences on the Ohio child welfare waiver:

Ohio will operate and test a "managed care" approach to the delivery of
child welfare services. The state will be allowed to use title IV-E
foster care funds flexibly to provide a fixed amount of funding for each
of five years to the twenty counties that will participate. Ohio hopes
this will result in greater efficiency and cost-effectiveness and the
creation of fiscal incentives more appropriate to the goals fo the child
welfare system.
