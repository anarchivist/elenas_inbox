TEXT:
You left me a message that Janet Yellen called about the issue of whether
BLS can do monthly unemployment data for people with disabilities.   Our
big meeting on this is tomorrow, so let me know if she said anything more
specific to you than "they're doing the best they can, and it can't be
done on the timeline the disabled appointees want."  FYI, CEA is sending
someone to our meeting tomorrow, which will include the head of BLS,
Katherine Abraham.
