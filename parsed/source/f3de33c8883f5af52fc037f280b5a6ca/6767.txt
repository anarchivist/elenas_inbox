RE:                    Possible VP Events for 3/22-4/3


       Education -- Address to the National PTA 3/23: The Vice President is scheduled to
speak to a national PTA conference (in Arlington VS). His message may focus on after-school
programs and on the need to protect kids from on-line smut. I will make a strong push for the
VP to plug the President's education agenda overall, and in particular to make the case for
national standards and tests with this group -- which has long opposed national tests, but which
shouldn't.

        Education -- Visit to a South Carolina Community College 3/24: The Vice President
and Secretary Riley will visit a community college in South Carolina, to address the
Administration's lifelong learning initiatives and to release state-by-state figures on the number
of students who will benefit from HOPE Scholarships, Lifetime Learning Tax Credits, and
possibly Pell Grants, and the level of benefits in each state.

       Education -- Child Care Conference in Iowa 4/1: The VP has been asked to speak to
an annual child care conference in Iowa, and is looking for news on child care or after-school.
His staff is interested in release state-by-state child care figures.

        Education -- On-line resources for math and science: Iftoday's announcement of
new online assistance for math and science does not get any coverage, the VP could do an event
demonstrating a new "Federal Resources for Educational Excellence" (FREE) web-site that
connects teachers, parents, and students to teaching and learning resources in math, science and
other subject areas form NASA, NSF, the Energy Department and other agencies. This
announcement could also include several other action steps to support on-line tutoring in math
and science.

        Education -- Urban EducationlReleasing Guide to Fixing Failing Schools: The
Education Department is completing work on a guide to turning around failing schools. If the
guide is ready, the VP could release this in an urban school district, and at the sarne time release
figures on how the Administration's initiatives help urban schools.

      Community Empowerment -- Reauthorization of the Community Development
Financial Institutions Fund (CDFI): Treasury has pushed through clearance of language to
                                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion

 reauthorize the CDFI Fund. The language is ready togo to the Hill at any time. This
 Presidential initiative is one of the core components of the Administration's community
 empowerment strategy. The Administration has proposed an increase in the Fund's FY98
 budget to $125 million, and the Fund will be making additional two additional rounds of grants
 this year.

        Treasury is working with the Vice' President's office on a possible event in which the
 VPOTUS would call for enactment of the reauthorization at a CDFI site. One possible twist
 could be for the VPOTUS to open a savings account at a CDFI.

           Welfare ~- Federal welfare-to-work hiring initiative: An event to mark the first year
 anniversary of the federal welfare-to-work hiring initiative is currently pending in the VP
 scheduling process. The event could include: release of the first annual report from the VP,
 announcement of the most recent hiring numbers, and a challenge to cabinet se~retaries to reach
 out to federal contractors to get more involved in hiring welfare recipients. The audience would
 include several hundred federal contractors from the Washington area, so we will need a little
 lead time for the agencies to invite them. This was originally submitted by NPR staff on
 2/13/98. Late last week, VP scheduling asked Susan Valaskovic to revise sligh~ly, so apparently
 it's still under consideration.

         Welfare -- Welfare Caseload Numbers_:_HHS is working on getting updated caseload
 data through December 1997 (last data released, with SOTU, was September 1997). They hope
 to have them to us early next week. The VP could announce these as part of the above event, or
 in a separate announcement. If separate, we could possibly combine with an announcement of
 DOL approval of more Welfare-to-Work formula grants to states. TN is one of those in the
 pipeline ~md I know the VP's office is interested in releasing that one. I hope to be able to
 confirm timing on caseloads and WTW approvals at our weekly welfare reform meeting w/
 agencies 3/17.

         Food Safety -- Possible Event on FORCG: The VP could announce an executive order
 that formalizes the Foodbome Outbreak Response Coordinating Group (FORCG). The purpose
 of FORCG is to improve the coordination and outbreak response to foodbome illness by all
 federal, state, and local agencies involved. HHS, USDA, and EPA have been developing an
 MOU on FORCG. The VP could either announce the MOU, or the MOU could be formalized
 into an executive order. We previously announced the FORCG concept, and the MOU sets forth
 that HHS, USDA, and EPA comprise the membership of the FORCG task force.

  Food Safety -- Possible Event on DNA Fingerprinting: The VP could tour a federal or state
  lab that is equipped with DNA fingerprinting technology. The technology works in the
  following way -- a laboratory isolates E.coli 0157:H7 from food, fingerprints it, and then the
  laboratory receives information on any similar fingerprints found. This technology can identify
  a potential outbreak in humans or the potential food source of an outbreak. This approach
  resembles the FBI national network and database for fingerprinting individuals throughout the
  United States and centrally generating a "rap" sheet where there is a match. The VP's tour
. would include a demonstration of this new technology .. The Administration has provided
 this technology, and USDA is working with them on a possible visit by Secretary Glickman to a
 USDA lab in Athens, Georgia, that is equipped with this DNA fingerprinting technology.

          Health Care -- Approval California's Children's Health Plan: The Vice President
 could announce the approval of new California's children's health program. This plan will
  likely be approved next week, as HHS's approval time line is running out and there are relatively
 few outstanding issues regarding this plan. Because this program is non-controversial and
 because of its size, this new state proposal would be well worth highlighting to underscore the
'early successes of the new children's health program. There are currently over twenty state
 plans being reviewed at HHS. The Vice President could also reiterate our commitment to
 children's health outreach to enroll the children who are eligible for health care coverage but are
 still uninsured. It is also important to note that in the next week, HHS will likely make a
 decision as to whether or not to approve New York's children's health proposal. New York's
 application has more controversial provisions which potentially will lead to either a disapproval
 of the state's plan or a contentious approval. Because ofthese"controversies, we are doubtful
 that it would be worthwhile to announce their plan even if it is approved.

         Crime -- Law Enforcement Technology: The Vice President could stand with the
 Secretaries of Energy and Treasury, and the Attorney General as they sign a statement of
 principles to transfer certain technologies from the Federal research labs to the Federal law
 enforcement bureaus (e.g., FBI, Customs). The Federal law enforcement agencies will in tum,
 agree to share the technologies with interested local law enforcement. Some of the technologies
 could be demonstrated at the signing event. The Department of Energy has been drafting the
 statement of principles, and it could potentially be ready over the next 10 days.

        Crime -- Chicago COPS Waiver: The Vice President could unveil with the Attorney
 General and Mayor Daley of Chicago a new COPS waiver pilot project that was recently
 approved by the Justice Department. This new pilot project will waive the 25% local match for
 new officers that are coordinated with existing Federal efforts for distressed areas, such as
 Empowerment Zones, Enterprise Communities, Weed and Seed sites, HIDTAs and other
 Administration initiatives. The pilot will allow cities and local law enforcement to target crime
 and drug "hot spots." Justice has set aside $60 million to fund this pilot.

                                                                             Hex-Dump Conversion
