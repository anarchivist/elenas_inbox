                 A cornerstone of President Clinton's economic strategy to strengthen the economy and
         ensure that every American can reap its rewards is investing in education and training. For more
         than five years, President Clinton has worked to widen the circle of opportunity and create a
         high-skilled workforce through HOPE Scholarship Tax Credits, the Lifetime Learning Tax
         Credit, the expansion ofPell Grants, a more than doubling of dislocated worker training funds, a
         new student-loan program that allows people to pay back their loans as a share of their income,
         and providing additional incentives to businesses to provide training for their workers. And to
         train American workers for the 21 st century, President Clinton believes we need a job-training
         system for the 21 st century. That is why he is working with Congress to pass the G.I. Bill for
         America's Workers this spring.

                  An issue that has received a lot of attention recently involves the shortage of trained
         workers in the information technology (IT) industry. The Clinton Administration believes that
         the first response to increasing the availability of IT workers must be increasing the skills of
         American workers and helping the labor market work better so there is a supply of skilled
         workers where there is a demand for skilled employees. While it may be necessary -- at least in
         the short-term '-- to increase the number of visas for temporary foreign workers (under the H loB
         program), this must only be done in conjunction with doing more to raise the skill level of
         American workers.

                In addition, the Administration believes that any temporary increase in the program
         should be limited to the minimum amount necessary, as demonstrated by empirical evidence.
         And expanding the number of visas, even temporarily, must be accompanied by needed
         improvements in the HI-B program. Since 1993, this Administration has sought reforms of the
         HI-B program, including requiring employers to "recruit and retain" U.S. workers before hiring
         temporary foreign workers, prohibiting lay-offs of U.S. workers to replace them with foreign
         temporary workers, and reducing the maximum stay for H loB workers from 6 to 3 years. These
         reforms, if enacted, would help target HI-B usage to industries and employers that are exhibiting
         genuine labor shortages.

                  Senator Kennedy's [bill/approach to this issue] addresses both the short-term and
         long-term implications of the apparent skills shortage we are now experiencing. And we believe
         that his bill is the appropriate vehicle to put American workers first and address the labor market
         needs of our rapidly changing economy.
