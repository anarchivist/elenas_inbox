Subject:         Treasury/Postal Letter language on Haitians

At the WH Immigration meeting today. Maria Eschevesta and Peter Jacoby
suggested the Treasury/Postal letter signal Administration support for
relief for Haitians contained in an amendment attached to T/P by Senator
Graham.  BRD informed me that the letter is in final clearance and changes
can only come from the 2nd floor.  Here is proposed language for inclusion


in the T/P letter:

"The Administration supports efforts by Congress to provide legislative
relief from deportation to Haitians. We believe the Haitians deserve the
same treatment Congress provided to other Central American last year.
Like Central Americans, Haitians for many years were forced to seek the
protection of the United States because of oppression, human rights abuses
and civil strife at home. This bill language supports our policy of
treating similarly situated people the same and we urge its adoption."

Here is further background the issue from an e-mail in July from Ingrid.
If you need anything further, please let me know.  Thanks.

Subject:         Justice call to the Director re: Relief from Deportation for
Haitians

Heads Up -

Justice advises that Deputy Attorney General Holder will be calling the
Director this afternoon to urge Administration support for a potential
Sen. Graham (D-FL) amendment to the Treasury Postal Appropriations Bill
which would provide relief from deportation for certain Haitians in the
United States.

Background

P.L. 105-100, District of Columbia Appropriations for FY 199B, contains a
provision, the "Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act,"
which provides relief from deportation for certain Central Americans.   The
President's signing statement for P.L. 105-100 stated that "similar relief
should be made available to Haitians and [I] will seek a legislative
solution for this group."

In November 1997, Sen. Graham (D-FL) introduced S. 1504 and Rep. Conyers
(D-MI) introduced H.R. 3049. These bills would provide relief from
deportation for certain Haitians.

On February 24, 199B, the President sent a letter to Sen. Graham stating
that "it is critical that Congress provide the most appropriate relief for
Haitian nationals as quickly as possible" and that the Administration
would work with Congress to achieve this goal.

According to the Department of Justice, Senator Graham intends to offer an
amendment to the Treasury Postal Appropriations bill which would provide
relief from deportation for certain Haitians and is almost identical to S.
1504.

Although the Administration has not taken an official position on S. 1504,
Justice (Furst), NSC (Busby), and DPC (Fernandes) advise that they do not
object to the bill.
