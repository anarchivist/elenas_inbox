                              REMARKS ON HUMAN CLONING,
                                  Tuesday, March 3, 1997

       In recent days, all Americans were startled to learn of the successful cloning of a sheep by
Scottish researchers. There is no question that this is a breakthrough of enormous consequence
for science, medicine, and agriculture -- one that could yield important benefits in the years to
come.

       It also raises a very troubling prospect -- that it might someday be possible to use these
techniques to clone human beings from our own genetic material.

        There is much about this discovery and its applications that we still do not know. But
this much we do know: any discovery that touches upon human creation is not simply a matter of
scientific inquiry. It is a matter of human morality and human decency as well.

        My own deeply-held view is that the prospect of human cloning is morally repugnant. It
violates our most cherished concepts of faith and humanity. Each human life is unique --
blessed by the spirit of a mother and a father, born of a miracle that reaches beyond laboratory
science. I believe that we must respect this profound gift, and resist the temptation to become
our own creators.

        That is why, one week ago today, I asked our National Bioethics Advisory Commission,
headed by Princeton University President Harold Shapiro, to conduct a thorough review of the
moral and ethical issues raised by this new cloning technology, and to recommend possible
actions to prevent its abuse. Their report, due back in 90 days, will give us a better
understanding of the scope and implications of this scientific breakthrough.

        But there are steps we can take right now to prevent the possibility of human cloning.
After reviewing the current restrictions on the use of federal funds for research involving human
embryos, we found loopholes that could allow human cloning. Today, I am issuing a directive
that bans the use of any federal funds for human cloning. Effective immediately, no federal
agency may support, fund, or undertake such activity.

        Of course, a great deal of research and activity in this area is supported by private funds.
That is why I am urging the entire scientific community -- and every foundation, university, and
industry that supports work in this area -- to heed the federal government's example. I am
asking for a voluntary moratorium on all efforts to pursue or undertake human cloning, until our
Bioethics Advisory Commission and our entire nation have had a chance to understand and
debate the profound ethical implications.

       Until we leam more about the potential uses and abuses of cloning, the sensible course is
to proceed not just with caution, but with conscience as well. By insisting that not a single
taxpayers' dollar supports human cloning -- and by urging a moratorium on all private efforts to
pursue human cloning -- we can ensure that as we move forward on this issue, we weigh the
concerns of faith and family, and not just oflaboratory science alone.
