DATE:          December 5, 1997

RE: .          INS Reform Meetings


       The following is a summary of the meetings that we have held with various groups and .
agencies conceming our review of the final recommendations of the Commission on Immigration
Reform ("ClR") and other reform proposals.                .

1.      The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS)
        November 13, 1997

         INS generally supports reform that would split enforcement functions from service
functions at the field level, though they are in favor of keeping the functions integrated at the
regional office level. Their proposal is heavily focused on improving the customer services
orientation of non-enforcement employees. They also favor putting the Border Patrol in the
chain of command, to address the issue of the increasing alienation of the Border Patrol from the
rest of INS. The INS is also looking into ways to create pay parity between INS inspectors and
inspectors with Customs as the disparity creates negative tension between officers that need to
work together on the Border.

        At that same meeting, OMB outlined their proposal of a higher level division between
enforcement and services. OMB's view is that there is insufficient attention given to either of
the two parts, so a more significant split would be a good remedy. OMB also advocates for the
establishment of one enforcement officer for the border instead of the current organization of
Border Patrol agents, inspectors and investigators.

2.      The Department of State
        November 19, 1997

        The eIR recommended the creation of an Undersecretary for Migration at the State
Department who would head an office in charge of virtually all immigration services -- visas,
adjustment of status, naturalization, labor certification, etc. The CIR has also recommended
that the State Department perform all of the refugee applications overseas. Under the current
system, State's immigration role is limited to: (1) issuance of passports; (2) staffing consular


                                                 I
                                                                         HexcDump Ccnv~~.Qn

offices abroad; (3) the processing of approximately 6.5 million visas overseas (including six
million non-immigrant and Y2 million immigrant visas) in conjunction with the INS; (4) an
advisory role re: asylum cases adjudicated in the U.S.; and (5) advising the President about world
conditions to assist him in determining the annual nUmber of refugees the United States will
accept from various regions of the world.

        The State Department representatives expressed some interest in exploring the possibility
of assuming full responsibility for refugee processing. They seemed to view this as a way to
control a fee-based process, and thus boost their consular offices (which are now, according to
them, understaffed -- partiCUlarly in high growth countries). They also acknowledged the value
of "one-stop shopping" for benefits and the consolidation of enforcement. This, in their view,
would assist quality control -- primarily reducing fraud. State also agreed that the visa process
needs to be more streamlined to reduce some of the duplication between agencies and greater
clarification is needed regarding ultimate responsibility for certain decisions where more than
one agency plays a role. To this end, State and INS have been involved in an effort called
Data-Share, that would create a shared database b~tween agencies. This effort started
aggressively, but has stalled.

        On the other hand, the State representatives voiced significant skepticism of their ability
to assume the responsibilities of a large part of the INS -- particularly since they are in the
process of absorbing both the USIA and ACTA. They were also very opposed to the CIR
recommendation to make consular decisions reviewable (as part of their assuming greater,
system-wide responsibility for the visa process). Finally, though they were in favor of the
Administration having an immigration policy that recognized both the domestic and foreign
policy aspects of this issue, they expressed a general philosophical view that immigration was
more of a domestic issue, and thus was mis-matched with State.

3.      Advocacy Groups (e.g., MALDEF, ABA, AILA, etc.)
        November 21, 1997 (enforcement) and December 4,1997 (services)

         In general, the advocates believe that the most important reforms we could make would
 be in the areas of standards and accountability. Specifically, they are concerned that no direct
 line of authority exists between Headquarters and the District offices, leaving the District
.Directors as final decision makers on significant matters -- including interpretation of
 regulations. Further, many of those present advocated for a high level DOJ official to handle
 immigration (e.g., an Assistant Attorney General for Immigration). Their view is that without
 such a person, the DOJ is less institutionally responsive to immigration issues. In addition, there
 was support for the creation of a permanent office at the White House to handle the various
 migration issues on a more global policy level.

        None of the advocates endorsed the CIR recommendations; in fact, they primarily
criticized them. However, they did acknowledge some need to separate enforcement functions
from services functions. According to the representative from AILA, this ·needs to be done, at a


                                                  2
                                                                        Hex-Dump' Conversipn
minimum, at the district level, but the problem of mixing enforcement and services (to the
detriment of services) exists throughout the agency. However, they expressed concern that
complete separation between enforcement and services (as in the Reyes bill) may result in even
less accountability by enforcement agents who are perceived as fairly independent. There is
some belief that the fact that INS workers train in both enforcement and services mitigates the
harshness of enforcement. However, there is also concern that promotions are generally only
made from the enforcement side (most District Directors are former investigators), and thus that
final services-related decisions are being made by enforcement officers.

        On the general issue of State's role, the advocates were more comfortable with allowing
the Department of Justice to retain control of the service process because of Justice's greater
familiarity with and dedication to due process rights -- in contrast to State which frequently
opposes administrative review of field decisions. Finally, all were opposed to giving State any
enhanced authority in the area of refugees. Apparently, it has been a long fight to get State out
of this process, because of years ofpoliticization (see, e.g., Central Americans).

        On the issue of streamlining, the advocates suggested scaling back the Depa:rtffient's role
in the processing of petitions for non-immigrant visas. Under the current system, State often
re-adjudicates the application instead of just checking Interpol and possible foreign policy
concems, which is simply duplicating processes. It was proposed that INS control the process,
but consult with State for the limited purpose of international checks.

        On the labor issues, the advocates seemed to generally favor permitting the DOL to
sanction employers who fail to check whether their employees are authorized to work.
However, they voiced concern about protections for undocumented workers who report labor
violations. Also, the advocates expressed the view that the labor certification process for
immigrant visas does not work well because it takes way too long, and is not responsive to rapid
changes in the labor market. Though they expressed a preference for moving the process out of
the Labor Department, they did not present a substantive reform proposal. However, according
to Maria and others, there have been a couple of studies on this issue over the past couple of
years.

       Finally, on the issue of administrative review, the advocates favor a consolidation that
would place all review at the INS, but ultimately favor a return to greater federal court review of
BIA (or Attorney General) decisions.

4.     Department of Labor
       November 24, 1997

       Currently, Labor performs three basic immigration-related functions: (1) adjudication of
applications by employers for employment-based visa categories (both temporary and
permanent); (2) enforcement of labor standards which are part of the criteria for some
employment-based visa categories (temporary and permanent); and (3) referral of findings ofI-9


                                                 3
                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion


non-compliance (verification of employee work eligibility) to the INS. The CIR recommends
empowering Labor to sanction employers for 1-9 violations (rather than just referring them to
INS, where there is often no follow-up). The CIR also recommended eliminating Labor's role in
the labor certification part of the visa process.

        Labor has strong reservations about moving the labor certification process out of their
agency (either to State or to INS). Though many criticize Labor for taking too long to process a
labor certification (and thus forcing employers to hire workers with temporary visas until the
paperwork is completed), they believe that the link between employment-based immigration and
the labor market supports the continued use of a some sort of labor market test in deciding
whether an employer is permitted to import a foreign worker. Labor believes that if this test is
to have any meaning, it must be conducted by the Dept. of Labor.

        Labor also believes that adjudication and compliance should be in the same agency.
Thus, that Labor should have the authority to impose sanctions on employers for the wide range
of violations related to labor standards -- including whether the employer adequately tested the
labor market before hiring a foreign worker. Labor also favors consolidating all non-immigrant
programs and giving them all a set oflabor standards that the Department could enforce. In
addition, Labor is in favor of their being permitted to sanction employers for failure to verify
whether their employees are authorized to work in the U.S., though they do not want to be
responsible for turning over employees who are possibly working illegally to the INS. They are
concerned that a fear of deportation could chill the reporting of poor labor standards, which
adversely affects all workers. Finally, in the area of employment-based immigration, Labor is in
favor of moving from a three-step to a two-step process, which would include removing INS
from the process entirely.

5.    . Michael Meyers
        Chief Democratic Counsel, Senate Judiciary Committee
        November 25,1997

        According to Meyers, there is little known support on the Hill for the CIR
recommendations. Chairman Abraham has stated that he favors a split between enforcement
and services, without expanding on what this means. Also, Meyers has received indications
from Lamar Smith's staff that though they may be interested in changes to the INS, they are not
likely to be interested in dispersing INS functions into different agencies. Meyers also believes
that INS is not "mature enough" to be a separate agency, and it is unlikely that there would be
much potential support for this type of option. He believes that the functions would best be kept
within INS, but acknowledges that any "reform" proposal would need to be sold as dramatic
change.

       Meyers suggested that a possible option would be a split between enforcement and
services within INS that goes all the way up -- would create two Deputy Commissioners, with
two separate chains of command: one with responsibility for enforcement and the other for


                                               4
                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion

services. He also favors moving INS law enforcement up to the level (training; pay; etc.) of
other law enforcement agencies within the DOJ. Meyers suggested that the enforcement side
could be organized like a police department: start as a border patrol agent (beat cop), move up to
an investigator (detective) and further potential to move up to Deputy Commissioner. Under the
current INS structure, the Border Patrol is almost completely set apart from the rest of the
enforcement staff. Thus, the career ladder ends at a fairly early point, which causes the Border
Patrol to loose a lot of good people. Also, they are generally isolated from the rest of
enforcement, creating a perception oflack of accountability.

        Meyers is very much in favor of the change that would allow the Department of Labor to
sanction employers for failing to verify the work eligibility of employees. Though this would
likely be disfavored by some Republicans (who tend to prefer the current, impotent system) it
might be a good principled stand for us to take, even if the Republicans knock it down. Finally,
Meyers also expressed support for the CIR's proposed consolidation of administrative review.

6;     Commission on hnmigration Reform
       November 25, 1997

        Several members of the CIR met with us to clarify some of the positions taken in their
final report, and to answer our questions. In general, the CIR wanted to propose reforms that
eliminated both perceived conflicting responsibilities within the existing structure, that made a
greater distinction between legal and illegal immigration, and that made the system more
efficient and easier to run and access.

        On the enforcement side, the CIR recommended folding INS enforcement functions into
Main Justice and upgrading it to a Division, which would require costly changes in salary
structure. The CIR also recommended that the inspection function be re-cast as an enforcement
function. On the services side, the CIR recommended that State assume responsibility for most
of the service functions, with Labor left to enforce labor standards, including non-compliance
with 1-9 process.

        The CIR believes that State has the capacity to handle all of the service functions now
performed by the INS. In addition, the CIR views immigration policy ("international
migration") increasingly becoming more of a foreign policy issue, thus more compatible with
State's mission. They found attractive the idea of State building on its domestic capacity
(passport offices). The CIR concluded that moving immigration services to State (a global
fee-generating service) would allow them to save their consular offices abroad, which are at risk
of being further devalued and de-funded.

       The CIR looked at Canada and Australia to determine howthis issue is handled in other
countries. Both Canada and Australia have a Cabinet-level office that is in charge of migration
generally. Their focus, however, is less on enforcement and more on facilitation of the process.



                                                 5
                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion

       The CIR also recommended an independent appeals process, not located within DOJ or
State. In the context of fewer issues being appealable to federal court, this would provide the
needed integrity for the administrative procedure. However, under their proposed system, this
would also likely require review of consular decisions, to which State is very opposed.

       When asked to recommend changes within the existing system, the CIR suggested that an
interim step could be to upgrade of the Commissioner's position within the DOJ, and to create
two deputies (one for services, one for enforcement), each with a separate line of authority. This
would go a long way toward solving ''mission overload," but would not address the problem of
duplication of effort and dispersion of responsibility between agencies. Next, they suggested
that Labor should be removed of their responsibility for labor certification. Though it is an open
question how some other agency or entity would handle this, it is clear that the present system
does not work well. Finally, they reiterated their support for allowing Labor to sanction
employers for failure to comply with 1-9 requirements, and possibly making the hiring of
authorized workers a labor standard, enforced by the DOL.


7.     Carnegie Endowment
       December 1, 1997

        The Carnegie Endowment is currently in the process of drafting a report on INS reform
that will likely be ready in February 1998. Carnegie was not in favor of the CIR
recommendations. However, they do think that more reform is needed, and attention on the CIR
report may fuel the ability to make such reforms. In general, they favor reducing the
redundancies in the processes, making it smarter, more transparent and more logical. They
recognize that a more dramatic proposal that they might favor (possibly creating an independent
agency) is not likely to get support on the Hill, and is thus no more realistic than the CIR
recommendation.

        There are, however, a set of reforms that Carnegie supports. On the labor front, Carnegie
would like to see the DOL with the authority to sanction employers for failing to verifY whether
their employees are authorized to work (1-9 failures), but would like Justice to continue to
prosecute employers for knowingly hiring unauthorized workers. They are also in favor of
taking the labor certification process from DOL -- possibly to privatize it, which they believe
would be more efficient and cheaper. Finally, they expressed interest in making legal hiring a
labor standard, enforced by DOL as part of their general review of employers for compliance
with other labor standards (minimum wage laws; equal pay for equal work; etc.)

        On creating a more streamlined process, Carnegie is interested in looking at how to
eliminate unnecessary steps in the visa process. They have called for more cooperation between
agencies, that could possibly include data sharing -- with the appropriate privacy protections.
Also, they are concerned that there continues to be a lack of high level policy coordination on the
larger immigration questions. This could be rectified through elevating the Commissioner (to an

                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion
AAG}, or through the creation of a more permanent immigration or international migration office
somewhere else in the Executive branch, including possibly the White House. .
8.    Department of Justice -- John Morton
      December 2, 1997

        The Attorney General is concerned with accountability within the existing system.
Justice has thought about proposing a programmatic and policy split between services and
enforcement within the INS that might create better lines of authority, and thus greater
accountability. An open question remains as to how the split between enforcement and serviCes
would be structured. They seem at this stage to be inclined to consider a split that is more
aggressive than the INS proposal to split at the district office level. Justice is also interested in
proposals that better integrate the Border Patrol within the rest of the INS enforcement structure,
in a way that upgrades the other components (though they have not thought about the police
department model). In conjunction with a service/enforcement split, Justice is looking at
breaking out of the district model, to (I) a more regional model for enforcement (including
detention); and (2) a more community-based model for services (along the lines of the service
centers now being piloted by INS).

       Though Justice has not seriously considered moving enforcement out of INS and into
Main, they are reluctant to create another law enforcement sub-agency within the Department.
Also, DOJ is opposed to the creation of an independent agency for administrative review. They
do not want to diminish the Executive's adjudicative and policy-making role.

       Justice is interested in coordinating, to the extent possible, the DPC review with the
Booze-Allen study that has been authorized. Ifwe decide that internal restructuring is where we
want to go, we should let INS and DOJ know our suggestions as soon as possible, so that they
can use this study to look at areas of reform that we identify, rather than wasting time on those
that we clearly oppose.
