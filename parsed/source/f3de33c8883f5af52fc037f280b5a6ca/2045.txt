Here's my attempted redraft.   Bruce and Elena -- I think we should talk
about both substance and strategy prior to 5:45. Why doesn't Bruce call
me -- 65359 -- once you've had a chance to read it, and them we'll get
Elena on.the phone. My understanding is Kathy is on the Hill.    If that's
not right, please let me know.   ellen==================== ATTACHMENT    1 ===========

     S. 543 - Volunteer Protection Act of 1997
     (Coverdell (R) Georgia and 7 cosponsors)

     Although the Administration strongly supports community service and volunteerism, it opposes
     S. 543, the "Volunteer Protection Act of 1997," as written, for several reasons.

     Tort law has traditionally been left to the States, and this tradition is particularly strong with
     respect to volunteers, nonprofit organizations and governmental entities. S.543 overrides state
     law concerning the liability of volunteers for negligence; and of volunteers, nonprofit
     organizations and governmental entities for punitive damages and joint and several responsibility
     for non-economic damages arising out of the actions of volunteers. The extremely broad
     definitions of "nonprofit organization" and of "volunteer" give this bill -- notwithstanding some
     of its limitations and the right of states to opt out -- a breadth of impact that is potentially very
     troublesome. In the absence of hearings, there has been no showing of the existence, nature or
     extent of any problem in the recruitment or placement of volunteers arising from provisions of
     state tort law, and thus no justification for this sweeping a preemption of state law.

     The Administration is also particularly troubled by the legislation's one-way preemption -- state
     laws would be preempted if they favor plaintiffs, but not if they favor defendants -- and by
     Section 5 of the Bill, which would abolish joint-and-severalliability for noneconomic damages
     (e.g., pain and suffering). This provision would unfairly discriminate against the most
     vulnerable members of our society -- the elderly, the poor, children, and nonworking
     women -- whose injuries often involve mostly noneconomic losses. Noneconomic damages are
     as important to victims as economic damages and must not be relegated to second-class status.
