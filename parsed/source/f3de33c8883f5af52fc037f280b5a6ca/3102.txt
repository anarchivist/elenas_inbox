TEXT:
The National Council on Alcoholism would like to bring a couple of folks
in to meet with you to share information on their strategy and findings
regarding alcohol advertising.   FYI, they recently filed a petition with
the FCC asking them to consider implementing a process by which
broadcasters would be required to produce and air counter ads to alcohol
advertisements.

I told her that I would be happy to request a meeting on their behalf.   I
believe we should do a meeting with them and hear them out.  They are not
planning to request that POTUS convene a meeting on the issue of alcohol
advertising at this point in time.  They do not believe that all parties
would be prepared to come to the table and come up with a constructive
approach and recommendation on the issue.

Are you available to do such a meeting the week of July 7th? That would
work for them.  The other group she mentioned was MADD ... I'll get
additional information on the groups from them to prepare for the meeting
i f we do it.

Please advise regarding your availability and willingness to do the
meeting. Thanks.
