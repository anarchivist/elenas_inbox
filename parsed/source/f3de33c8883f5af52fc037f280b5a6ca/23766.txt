    PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
    OPENING REMARKS
    AT THE WHITE HOUSE STRATEGY SESSION
    ON CHILDREN, VIOLENCE AND RESPONSIBILITY
    THE EAST ROOM
    May 10, 1999

            Acknowledgments: TBD

             I want to welcome everyone here to the White House, and to thank
    you for coming to our Strategy Session on Children, Violence, and
    Responsibility. This is a diverse and impressive group:    parents and
    children, teachers and religious leaders, law enforcement and government
    officials, gun manufacturers and sportsmen, and representatives of the
    entertainment industry.   The Vice President, Tipper, Hillary and I wanted
    to bring together so many sectors of society for a simple reason: because
    there is nothing more important than the safety of our children.

            On Friday, I announced that we would launch a National Campaign to
    Reduce Youth Violence -- a grass-roots effort to involve all Americans,
    from every community and all walks of life, in protecting our children
    from violence.  I hope the ideas generated here will lay the groundwork
    for that campaign, and help us to find common ground and concrete
    solutions.

            WeD,re not here to debate who takes the blame, but to show who
    takes responsibility.   I want to be sure that the government continues to
    do its part.  In the weeks to come, I hope to work with Congress to pass
    legislation that makes our schools and streets safer, and keeps guns out
    of the wrong hands.   Today, I am also directing the Surgeon General to
    conduct a ground-breaking study -- the first report in more than a decade
    on youth violence and its causes.   This report will infuse our efforts
    with a new urgency and understanding.

            But we all know government cannot do it alone.  So, already, even
    before we sat down here today, many of you stepped forward and stepped up
    to your responsibility.  I am pleased, first of all, that the gun
    manufacturers and sportsmen represented here today have issued a statement
    of support for several important gun measures we proposed here at the
    White House two weeks ago.  Together, we have found common ground on these
    common-sense measures: banning violent juveniles from buying guns for
    life; raising the age for handgun ownership from 18 to 21; closing the gun


   show loophole so criminals canD,t buy guns; holding reckless parents
   responsible for giving children access to guns; and reducing illegal gun
   trafficking by helping law enforcement trace weapons used in crimes.  I
   commend the gun manufacturers and sportsmen here today for taking
   responsibility.

          Others have agreed to do their part. A few years ago, through the
  Vice PresidentD,s leadership, we were able to put in place a voluntary
  ratings system for television.   Les Moonves, the head of CBS, and Bob Iger
  , the head of ABC, have led the way by putting their networks behind this
  effort; and they are here today.   This year, half the new TV sets sold in
  America will contain the V-Chip, which parents can use to protect their
  children from violent programming. Today, the FCC is announcing a V-Chip
  Task Force to make sure every new set contains the V-Chip by the beginning
  of next year; and the Kaiser Family Foundation is announcing a massive new
  public education campaign to make sure parents know about it and how to
  use it. Also, following this meeting, Kaiser and the Ad Council will
  produce a campaign of anti-violent ads called D&Talking with Kids About
  Tough Issues.DB

          I am encouraged by all these efforts; and I hope that the rest of
  you will tell us today what you are doing -- or will be doing -- to give
  our children the safe futures they deserve.  ID,m looking forward to
  hearing your ideas.  ID,m especially interested to hear what these young
  people have to say.
