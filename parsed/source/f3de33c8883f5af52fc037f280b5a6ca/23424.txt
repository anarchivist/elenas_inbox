TEXT:
Is the memo to president outlining the plan here and options ready to go
as we discussed last week? I think DOJ's plan for a convening of law
enforcement and civil rights 1eadersin mid-April as Elena described this
am sounds great.  real progress here.  By the way, I thought I should pass
on that both of you and Riley are getting high marks for the willingness
and openness to work with the civil rights groups on esea--suggests to me
that progress can still be made even if there's not full agreement.
