TEXT:
The idea below -- many e-mails below (smile) is very good. Can someone
provide Ben with some direction in terms of whether or not pursuing would
be good.  I do believe it would be an excellent way for the President to
reach thousands of young people.  He could certainly speak from the
perspective of a Father and President. Thanks!

Why don't you raise it with Loretta and If she doesn't respond in a
positive way, I'll raise it and get the team to raise it.   I just think as
the Weekly Reader folks do, that this is a golden opportunity to reach out
to a large group of young people in the aftermath of littleton.

ben, my best guess is that this is a speechwriting assignment.  they could
probably take the text of some speech they've done, shorten it and rewrite
it in appropriate language.  the other possibility would be dpc doing a
draft that speechwriting then approves.  great idea! bb
