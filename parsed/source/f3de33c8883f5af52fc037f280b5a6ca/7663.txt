TEXT:
The House Democrats are introducing a Democratic child care bill which
includes the President's initiative, with some additions such as a
stay-at-home piece.  They are planning to announce their bill on Wednesday
at 10:00 am, and would like some Administration presence, like Secretary
Shalala. At this point, we plan to say- very supportive things about this
bill, but not to embrace it as our own.
