                                                 February 7, 1997


    MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

    FROM:                 Bruce Reed

    SUBJECT:              Domestic Policy Council Weekly Report


            1. Reaction to Education Plan: The education agenda you laid out in the State of the
    Union is getting high praise from across the political spectrum. In the latest USA Today poll,
    83% supported your proposal for national tests in 4th-grade reading and 8th-grade math. All the
    major education groups have been supportive; the NEA said your overall plan was
    "extraordinary". Checker Finn, Diane Ravitch, and Chris Cross have spoken out publicly in
    favor of the tests, and Engler will as well. The only grumbling has come from some
    conservatives who don't understand the proposal or think it's a stalking horse for something else.
     Ralph Reed said he opposes "mandatory national standards"; Tommy Thompson complained
    about federal involvement in education. Mike Cohen is briefing the NGA staff next week, and
    expects most of the governors to come around once they hear the details.

             2. NEA and Teacher Standards: In a National Press Club speech on Wednesday, Bob
    Chase pledged to transform the NEA into a force for school reform instead of an obstacle. For
    the first time, he endorsed the policy you spelled out at last year's NGA Education summit on
    getting teachers who don't measure up out of the classroom. "The fact is that in some instances,
    we have used our power to block uncomfortable changes -- to protect the narrow interest of our
    members, and not to advance the interests of students and schools. There are indeed some bad
    teachers in America's schools, and it is our job as a union to improve those teachers or -- that
    failing -- to get them out of the classroom." Al Shanker has supported our policy on this all
    along.

            3. Service Summit: We're keeping close tabs on the summit. We meet regularly with
    Wofford, and check in weekly with Cisneros. They continue to line up impressive
    commitments; this week, Newsweek began a weekly feature called Commitment Watch,
    patterned after the Conventional Wisdom box. To make sure that the summit remains identified
    as your deal, we would like to plan one more White House event between now and April 28 in
    which you would announce another round of commitments, and perhaps launch AmeriCorps'
    high school scholarship matching program, which you called for at Penn State last year. We'll
    have some other proposals ready for your speech to the summit as well.
