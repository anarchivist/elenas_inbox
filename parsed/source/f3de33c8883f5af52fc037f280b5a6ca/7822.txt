TEXT:
FYI: Last month, Slater and co. announced to all agencies that Saturday,
June 13 will be a day of volunteering for federal employees.  Several
parties expressed unhappiness with this:  The Corporation thought it was
silly to organize something like this outside of preexisting volunteer
days like MLK Day; OPM feared it would appear coercive to the
unions/employees; and folks here were mad it got announced without our OK
and fear that, if it fizzles, we will look bad.

But we are trying to make the best of it.  It is now called "volunteer
awareness day" and we are stressing that it's to recognize the year-round
efforts of federal employees. DOT expects to be able to confirm only a
few thousand participants that day, but we hope this approach will take
the pressure off the day's numbers.  Press will come out of DOT, not here.
