TEXT:
 Child s'afety lock announcement/update on President's directve:

While all FBI and ATF agents have received their safety locks for their
guns since the President's directive March 5, we want to announce at the
Memorial on Thursday that all federal law enforcement will have the safety
locks by October 15.   Justice and Treasury are completely on board with
this deadline-- and they comprise about 90% of all federal law enforcement.

This deadline was mentioned on a safety lock conference call with other
federal agencies back in late March.   To my knowledge no agency
complained about this deadline.  Cabinet Affairs is sending out a short
memo today reminding federal agencies of the directive and the October 15
deadline.    Any agency that does not think it can comply is required to
contact me by tomorrow morning.

I will let you know if we hit any stumbling blocks.   Thanks.
