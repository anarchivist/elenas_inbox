OFFICE OF THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR

     May Advisory Board Meeting on Administration of Justice. We continue to work
     with White House staff, Department of Justice staff, and others to plan the May 19th
     Advisory Board meeting, to be held in Washington, D.C., which will focus on race,
     crime, and the administration of justice. The May Advisory Board meeting provides an
     opportunity to address several questions in this area: What are the facts concerning race,
     crime, and the administration of justice? How do different perceptions of crime and the
     administration of justice affect efforts to build One America? What strategies can help
     promote a criminal justice system that serves and treats Americans of all races fully and
     equally? Likely topics include racial profiling and community policing.

     American Council on Education (ACE) to support efforts of higher education leaders to
     launch a coordinated campaign to promote the values of access and diversity in higher

     university presidents who will lead a public education campaign on access and diversity.

     Religious Leaders Forums. We will hold the first religious forum with religious
     leaders in New Orleans on May 21; the second will be held in Louisville on June 1.
