Elena--

Just left you a voice mail -- I hope we (or at least you and others within
DPC) can connect on this so we can get some feedback to the race
initiative folks soon, and probably that ought to be Monday.  Julie F. and
I have talked about this and it looks to us like they still have a ways to
go before some pieces of this will make sense.

Thanks.

Attached is the latest version of the memo I sent to you yesterday
concerning the possible agenda for the November 19 Meeting of the

that I sent to you yesterday, but I wanted to keep you all informed.  I
also wanted to urge each of you to let me know of any comments or
suggestions that you have as soon as possible. We are getting very close
to the time when we have to move forward.  Also, feel free to give me a
call at X5-1047 if you have any questions. Thanks.

        While it is still a work in progress, this memorandum attempts to present our latest
thinking on the November 19 Advisory Board meeting, which will focus primarily on the value
of diversity in higher education. It presents suggested messages that we intend will emerge from
the Advisory Board meeting, a proposed agenda for the meeting, possible presenters, and other
ideas for your consideration. An asterisk beside the name of a potential participant indicates a
top choice; an italicized name indicate·s that the potential participant has been contacted to see if
he/she would be available if the agenda develops in a certain way and he/she is invited to address
the Board; a redlined name indicates that the potential participant is available. Please provide
me with any comments or suggestions as soon as possible.

L      Messages to Emerge From Advisory Board Meeting

       A.      Primary Message: "The Value of Diversity in Higher Education"

        Colleges and universities that promote diversity can greatly contribute to improving race
relations in the 21st Century and to creating a stronger, more just, and more united American
community.
        Minority participation in higher education has increased dramatically in the last
several decades. Studies indicate that this increased racial diversity can yield substantial
educational benefits for all students. By bringing together students of different
backgrounds, colleges and universities are teaching students critical lessons about how to
live and work together, and they are exposing students to new perspectives that enrich the
learning environment. Increased minority participation in higher education can also help
