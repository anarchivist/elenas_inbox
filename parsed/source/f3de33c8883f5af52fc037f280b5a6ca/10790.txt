Feds To Sue Tobacco Firms

                            By SANDRA SOBIERAJ Associated Press Writer

                            WASHINGTON (AP)   -- President Clinton's promised
federal
                            suit seeking hundreds of billions of dollars
from the tobacco
                            companies will not put to rest his fight for a
share of the $246
                            billion states already have won from cigarette
makers.

                            "We still believe we are entitled to a portion
of the state
                            settlement under the law . . . . That is separate
and apart from this
                            suit, "   an administration official told The
Associated Press after
                            Clinton announced the suit in his State of the
union address
                            Tuesday night.

                            Earlier Tuesday, Sen. George Voinovich, R-Ohio,
introduced a
                            bill that would forbid the federal government
from grabbing a
                            share of the settlement money states negotiated
from tobacco
                            companies.

                            The administration official, speaking on
condition of anonymity,
                            said a task force from the Justice Department's
civil division
                            would decide on the timing and best legal
arguments for the suit.

                            It will claim that tobacco companies owe the
government for tax
                            dollars spent on treating smoking-related
illnesses through


                               Medicare, the Defense Department, Veterans
     Affairs, federal
                               employee health benefits and other federal
     programs

                               "We feel it's more important this be done right
     than be done
                               quickly, "    this official said.

                               Clinton cast the litigation as an effort to
     combat youth smoking:
                               "Our children are targets of a massive media
     campaign to hook
                               them on cigarettes."

                               He   tol~   Congress that "the states have been
     right about this.
                               Taxpayers shouldn't pay for the cost of lung
     cancer, emphysema
                               and other smoking-related illnesses; the tobacco
     companies
                               should. ' ,

                               Justice Department lawyers, he said, were
     "preparing a litigation
                               plan to take the tobacco companies to court and,
     with the funds
                               we recover, to strengthen Medicare. ' ,

                               Tobacco-state lawmakers of both parties were not
     pleased.
                               Rep. Ron Lewis, R-Ky., called Clinton's plan
     "another blow
                               that's probably going to be the end of tobacco
     if he's not already
                               accomplished that."

                               Kentucky Democratic Rep. Ken Lucas agreed.
     "What's bad
                               for the tobacco companies is bad for the farmer,
     so I have some
                               heartburn about that.' ,

                               Through Medicare, the federal government pays
     for health care
                               for 35 million elderly and disabled Americans.
     The Defense
                               Department, Veterans Affairs programs and
     federal employee
                               health benefit programs also use federal funds
     to pay for
                               individuals' health treatment. The states and
     the federal
                               government jointly pay for Medicaid insurance
     for the poor.

                               The Medical Care Recovery Act gives the
     government the right
                               to recover the costs of treating people if a
     third party's


                             negligence is to blame for their illnesses. In a
fact sheet on
                             planned suit, the Justice Department also cited
the Medicare
                             Secondary Payer Act, which permits the
government to recover
                             costs for injury done to Medicare recipients
under certain
                             circumstances.

                             Scott williams, a tobacco industry spokesman,
called Clinton's
                             announcement --a blatantly political act, ' ,
saying the Justice
                             Department had looked at the issue in the past
and decided not
                             to act on it.

                             He said the federal government will have a more
difficult time
                             arguing its case than the states did because the
Office of the
                             Surgeon General has been filing reports for
decades on the
                             dangers of smoking.   --The federal government
cannot claim
                             ignorance to the health risks associated with
tobacco use, ' ,
                             williams said.

                             Some workers at the Philip Morris plant outside
Richmond, Va.,
                             said today it is unfair for the federal
government to target the
                             tobacco industry. --I think it's a case of
double jeopardy, "    said
                             Tony Easter.    --First the states sue the tobacco
companies, now
                             the federal government. --I think the federal
government knew
                             about the hazards of smoking when they put
warning labels on
                             cigarettes in the 1960s."

                             Justice Department spokesman Myron Marlin said
Attorney
                             General Janet Reno decided at the end of
December to draw up
                             the suit --after reviewing the relevant facts
and the law and after
                             deciding that there are appropriate bases on
which to recover
                             funds from the tobacco industry."     Four states
reached
                             independent deals last year with the tobacco
industry worth a
                             total of $40 billion, and the 46 others signed a
separate $206
                             billion deal to recover the cost of treating
Medicaid-eligible


                          smokers.

                          For Clinton, who was stung by the failure of his
     much-hyped
                          anti-youth-smoking campaign last year, a federal
     lawsuit held out
                          the political benefit of pressuring the tobacco
     industry back to
                          the negotiating table.

                          As part of his proposed budget for fiscal year
     2000, Clinton also
                          will seek an increase of 55 cents pack in the
     federal tax on
                          cigarettes. A similar proposal last year failed
     with the tobacco
                          bill. Clinton would use the increase to pay for
     some of his
                          domestic spending plans.
