Message Creation Date was at 21-MAY-1997 23:15:00

TO:   DIRECTOR FRANK RAINES

  DEPUTY DIRECTOR JOHN KOSKINEN

FROM: OMB LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS

DATE: MAY 21, 1997

SUBJECT:   LEGISLATIVE REPORT


The Bosnia/Disaster Supplemental Conferees met again today.  They did not reach
full agreement, and expect to continue their work on Thursday.  Conferees did
not resolve major issues such as the automatic continuing resolution, census
sampling, or RS2477 (wilderness right-of-way).  In addition, the DC section
remains open, and there are discussions of adopting numerous micro-management


provisions.

It is expected that the House Republicans will offer a "compromise" on the
census sampling issue on Thursday morning.  If progress is not made on the
supplemental, they may move a smaller supplemental providing partial funding
for Bosnia, various disaster accounts, and VA compensation and pension.

CONGRESS TODAY (5/21):

SENATE
The Senate continued consideration of S.Con.Res. 27, the Budget Resolution and
took the following action:
o Adopted (98-2) the Domenici amendment to clarify the use of funds for health
coverage for eligible children.
o Adopted (UC) Kerrey Amendment to express the sense of the Senate on the need
for long-term entitlement reforms
o Adopted (UC) Brownback/Kohl Amendment to express the sense of the Senate on
enforcement of the bipartisan budget amendment
o Tabled (55-45) the Kennedy/Hatch amendment to increase the excise taxes on
tobacco products for the purpose of providing affordable health    coverage for
low- and moderate-income uninsured children and for additional deficit
reduction.
o Adopted (UC) Gramm amendment to express the Sense of the Senate on national
disaster relief.
o Tabled (68-31) Gramm amendment to hold non-defense discretionary    spending
for FY98 through FY2002 to the same levels proposed in the    PresidentD,s FY97
budget request.
o Adopted (98-0) Mack Amendment to express the sense of the Senate that the
federal commitment to biomedical research should be doubled over the next five
years.

The Senate expects to complete action on the Resolution late on Thursday.

HOUSE
Passed the following bills (5) under suspension of the rule:
(Voice vote) H.R. 1377 - Savings are Vital to EveryoneD,s Retirement Act of 1997
  [SAP sent, 5/21: The goal is laudable, but the Administration believes   the
bill is unnecessary. )
