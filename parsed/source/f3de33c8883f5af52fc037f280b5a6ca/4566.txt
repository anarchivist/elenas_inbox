TEXT:
Here is what I've learned about the lines of attack trade foes are likely
to try:

1. Requiring foreign countries have "equivalent" systems rather than the
same systems. One way we could bypass this debate is by insisting upon
the same safety standard.

2. The guidance we are directing the Secretaries to issue will be
voluntary when it should be mandatory.

3.   We should be calling for country-of-origin labeling.

4. Fast-track has language that specifically forbids inclusion of
food-safety and environment standards for the next 8 years.
