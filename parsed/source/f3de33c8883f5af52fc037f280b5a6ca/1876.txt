TEXT:
We're hearing that late-term is likely to come up within the next two
weeks in the Senate -- after chemical weapons and comp/flex time -- which
would put it on the floor about the first week of May.  The President's
comments on our memo went to trying to get Catholic support for the
Daschle approach.  I've been talking to Daschle's folks about this and
they're happy to help us with ide.as. John (Hart) I told Caroline
Fredrickson you may call (224-9531).  In any case, we need some feedback
from this process as we go forward on the hill.  Let me know ...
