TEXT:
I've been working with a small group from NPR, OVP, and HHS to figure out
where we are on these issues (all women I would point out) and wanted to
give you a quick update to see if you think we're on the right track.
Kevin Thurm is now very involved and will be spearheading HHS' fatherhood
activities. Lisa Gilmore is his special assistant working on the issue.
HHS has actually been pretty dedicated to this--they've done more in
response to the 1995 Exec'Memorandum than other agencies.    DOL has recent I
y gotten very interested--Herman was inspired after visiting the Parents
Fair Share demo in Los Angeles as part of her WtW tour.   Just to remind
you, the 6/95 Exec Memo asked agencies to review'and modify programs,
policies and initiatives to promote father involvement--in terms of
programs, personnel practices, and research.  It charged NPR and DPC to
recommend further action based on review of what agencies had done.   I
believe NPR held two follow up meetings, but there's been lots of staff
turnover since then and momentum has fizzled in most cases.

To raise the visibility and momentum on the issue     Kevin has gotten 15
minutes at the June 3rd Presidential Mgmt Council meeting.     The VP is
sending out a letter to each PMC member asking them to submit to NPR a 1-2
summary of what they've been doing in response to the Exec Memorandum, 3
specific steps they plan to continue working on, and a high level contact
on the issue. The plan is for NPR/HHS to compile and send back out so Dep
Secs have it in hand on 6/3.   At this point, the focus is on what's h
appening w/in each agency, and the importance of inte~agency discussions
since many fatherhood issues are cross-cutting.   It's not clear yet
whether any of this merits POTUS or VP involvement.

This renewed look at fatherhood issues is partly inspired by several
external events:
1. VP has confirmed he will participate in the 6/15 National Fatherhood
Institute summit , which will include bipartisan involvement of Governors,
Hill, comunity based groups, media etc.  We thought it would be good to
know what the Administration/agencies have accomplished on fatherhood
before the event.
2. Shaw's fatherhood bill--while this is going nowhere for the moment, we
thought it would be helpful to at least prepare talking points on the
Administration's possible position on the bill--this may get raised at the
6/15 event. HHS has drafted some pretty generic points which need to be
run through more review. I will forward next version to you.
