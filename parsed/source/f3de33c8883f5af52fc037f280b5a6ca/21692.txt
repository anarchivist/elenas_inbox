TEXT:
Chris/Elena/Paul -- after you left today's 1:00 p.m. meeting, this letter
was fly-specked, and a few minor changes were made.    The phrase " ... part
human and part cow ... " stays in, and NIH concurs with this. All of your
other changes have been incorporated.


11/13/98 DRAFT



November 13, 1998




Dr. Harold Shapiro
Chair
National Bioethics Advisory Commission
Suite 3COl
6100 Executive Boulevard
Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7508

Dear Dr. Shapiro,

In recent days, Americans have learned of major new technological advances
in human embryonic stem cell research.  The report of the creation of an
embryonic stem cell that is part human and part cow raises the most
serious moral, ethical, medical, and legal concerns.  I am deeply troubled
by this report, and I am directing that the National Bioethics Advisory
Commission consider the implications of such research involving the


mingling of species at its meeting next week, and report back to me
immediately thereafter.

Four years ago, I issued a ban on the use of federal funds to create human
embryos solely for research purposes; the ban was subsequently broadened
by Congress to prohibit any embryo research in the public sector. At that
time, the benefits of human embryo research were hypothetical, while the
ethical concerns were immediate. Although other recent reported advances
in human embryonic stem cell research bring into sharper focus the
potential medical benefits such research holds for dramatic breakthroughs i
n treating many devastating human conditions, the ethical issues have not
diminished.

Therefore, I also direct that the National Bioethics Advisory Commission
undertake a thorough review of all of the issues associated with human
embryonic stem cell research, balancing the potential benefit to the
public good with the need to respect individual beliefs.

I look forward to receiving your report on this important issue.

Sincerely,
