TEXT:
My understanding is that the Sentencing Commission is going to make an
announcement on the 29th that they are recommending a "pinch" in the
disparity between crack and powder cocaine sentences.

Unlike last time, they are not amending the guidelines, which created a
situation where Congress had to affirmatively disapprove the guidelines or
they became operative.  They are just announcing their position (at least,
that is my understanding at this point) .

Under current law, a defendant in possession of 5 grams of crack cocaine
receives a 5 year mandatory minimum. However, it takes 500 grams of
powder cocaine for a defendant to receive a 5 year mandatory. Thus,
current law has a 100-1 disparity in penalties between a crack defendant
and a powder cocaine defendant.

The Sentencing Commission is supposedly going to recommend a "pinch" - -
Powder penalties would be a range 125-375 grams for a 5 year mandatory and
crack would be 25-75 grams.

The Criminal Division is recommending to the AG that the powder level be
250 grams for a 5 year mandatory and a 25-50 range for crack.

Senators Hatch and Abraham have a bill that would have a 5 year mandatory
for 100 grams of powder and keep current law for crack - - 5 grams,   5
years.  In other words, Hatch just increases the penalties for powder
cocaine so the that disparity is 20-1 instead of current law, which is
100-1.

In summation:
A defendant will receive a 5 year mandatory minimum for the following
amount of grams:


                           Current Law       Sent. Com.     Crm Div.         Hatch

Powder                          500
125-375                250                            100

Crack                                 5
25-75                 25-50                           5


Current law also has what is referred to as a "safety valve." If the
defendant has not priors, no gun was used, etc. then the 5 year can be
waived.
