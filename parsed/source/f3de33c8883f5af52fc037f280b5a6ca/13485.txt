Thanks. No thanks to our fax machines!
In terms of the Hatfield letter, the last thing I heard was from
Barbara Chow via Katie around 8:30ish.   To Barbara's apparent
surprise, the Rs were "studying" the letter and hadn't rejected it
yet. Except they were cranky about one thing - that the Murray
language that I was told to attach to the letter carried a fax
line from ~ gasp - Patty Murray's office.   I am not making this
up.   I wish I were.
Yes, I heard about the meeting on the House side. Didn't go well,
I gather.   I'm not confident I've heard eveyrthing, but there was
a good deal of screaming about contract cancellation (with Members
stating that they thought it would be fine if some of us exec.
branch types went to jail (so much for my overly academic thoughts
about the distinctions between the two branches of govern.!). As
you may imagine, Peter C. was less than enthused about this
notion.   They were also adamant that those Trees Had To Stop
Falling, Period. They pushed us hard to enter into negotiations
on the premise that alternative timber "substantially comply" with
the Forest Plan standards and guidelines.   Indeed, USDA has now
directed the Forest Service to come up with a package deal by next
Wed. that wouldn't necessarily meet standards and guidelines and
full compliance w/env. law but that would be better than 1st and
Last.
I gather the finer legal points were not analyzed or debated.
