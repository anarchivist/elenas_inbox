TEXT:
I think that we have resolved all the kids e.o. issues among WH
offices--thanks to your investment of time, thought and energy.

At three this morning one more issue was keeping me thinking, and I want
to ask for your thoughts on it before we put a WH draft of the e.o. into
review.

As currently drafted the application of the analytical requirements is
only to rules initiated after signature.  I am concerned that the
Administration could be criticized for taking away with one hand what it
is giving with the other because so many rules take years and years to
complete.  In addition, it seems to me that 5 years down the road this
could get to be a stumbling block from both an implementation perspective
and a political one.

I suggest you consider a phase-in in addition to the current 2-202.   One
good approach would be to expand application of the analytical requirement
to rules for which a proposal is published after two years from the date
of signature.  I think that two years is enough time for agencies to begin
the kind of analysis we have discussed, and this change would ensure that
we are well on the way to implementation within this term.

I know that we are planning to circulate a final around noon, so please
get back to me before then with your thoughts.
