TEXT:
here's my shot at it. Not sure if my attempt to be a bit provocative by
terming this "reopening" the law works.

Question:       Would the Administration support or oppose legislation on
the Hill to fix this?

Answer: The Administration believes strongly in the minimum wage.
In determining exactly how the minimum wage law applies to workfare
arrangements, the Administration has had to address a number of technical
issues that Congress did not deal with when they wrote the welfare law.
If Congress chooses to reopen the welfare law to address these issues, the
Administration will obviously want to be a part of that discussion.  We
would expect any final agreement to reflect our position that people who
work should be paid the minimum wage.
