TEXT:
For the weekly, can we give the President updates on congressional action
on health care, congressional action on welfare, where we are on
juveniles, what we did on AIDS treatment guidelines (and what's coming
from mayors on needles), what he's doing Monday on urban policy
announcements, what we're doing Wed. at family conference, and where we
are (ha ha) on tobacco talks?

Anything else we want to float or bring up?

Thanks.
