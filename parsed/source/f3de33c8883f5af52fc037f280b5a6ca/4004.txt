                                          DRAFT -- August 16, 1997

              We must make the thirteenth and fourteenth years of education -- at least two years of college --
             just as universal in America by the 21st Century as a high school education is today, and we must
             open the doors to all Americans.
                                                        -- President Bill Clinton
                                                            State of the Union Address, February 4, 1997

      Today, as students prepare to head back to school, President Clinton encouraged families to take
      advantage of the new higher education opportunities contained in the historic balanced budget legislation.
      He also urged students and their parents to accept responsibility for preparing for college early, by
      choosing tough courses and working hard in school, beginning in students' middle school and junior high
      school years. To help families map out a bright future, the President released a new handbook on getting
      ready for college early, and a parents' guide to the new education tax cuts.

      WHILE MORE STUDENTS ARE GOING TO COLLEGE, TOO MANY OTHERS MISS THE
      BENEFITS OF A POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION. In 1996, sixty-five percent of high school
      graduates were attending college by the following fall, an all-time high. Yet far too many of our young
      people still lack a college education or advanced training, limiting their ability to prosper in the 21st
      Century knowledge economy. College graduates are half as likely to be unemployed as high school
      graduates. Moreover, on average, a college graduate will earn $600,000 more over the course of a
      lifetime than a high school graduate -- and this gap is widening. Someone with an associate degree
      from a two year college earns more than a high school graduate, as well.

      THE NEW TAX CUTS SIGNED BY THE PRESIDENT WILL HELP MAKE COLLEGE MORE
      AFFORDABLE FOR STUDENTS AND FAMILIES. President Clinton's new Hope Scholarship
      makes the fust two years of college universally available, providing students with a tax credit of up to
      $1,500 -- about the same as the average tuition at a local community college. Moreover, college juniors
      and seniors, as well as graduate and professional students, and adults who want to go back to school, will
      be eligible for a lifetime learning tax credit worth 20% of the fust $5,000 of tuition and fees through the
      year 2002 (and 20% of the fust $10,000 beginning in 2003). The new law also allows parents and
      grandparents to make penalty-free withdrawals from their IRAs to pay for higher education expenses, and
      enables them to open a new education IRA where they can invest $500 per child every year to build up
      money, tax free, for college. In addition to the tax cuts, the balanced budget agreement also provides the
      largest Pell Grant increase in two decades, as sought by the President; Congress must fulfill this promise
      next month.

      STUDENTS SHOULD BEGIN PREPARING FOR COLLEGE EARLY BY TAKING TOUGH
      COURSES IN MIDDLE SCHOOL AND HIGH SCHOOL. Students who take algebra and geometry
      by the end of eighth and ninth grades are much more likely to go on to college than students who don't;
      in a national study, only 26 percent of low-income students who did not take geometry went on to
      college, compared with 71 percent of those who did. Back to School is an ideal time for parents to talk
      with teachers, principals, and guidance counselors to make sure students sign up for a rigorous classes
      that will keep them on track for college. A new handbook, Getting Ready for College Early, will help
      parents of students in middle school and junior high with choosing courses and other basics of college
      planning -- like where to fmd out how much college really costs and what resources are available make
      college affordable. Getting Ready for College Early, plus A Families' Guide to the 1997 Education Tax
      Cuts, are both available free of charge from the U.S. Department of Education by calling
      1-800-USA-LEARN.
