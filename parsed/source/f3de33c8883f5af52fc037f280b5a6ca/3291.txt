TEXT:
You asked what I thought of DOJ's idea of the President doing an ADA PSA
with Bob Dole.  It's a cute idea, and certainly bipartisan, so I kind of
like it, although I don't know what sensitivities would be raised around
here by something so unusual. Dole would have to agree, which he probably
would, I suspect.

  In terms of making sure we have something on the calendar for the ADA 7th,
  Public Liaison has put in a scheduling request for a conference on youth
  with disabilities and employment which is the officially sanctioned
. anniversary event of the disabled appointees, and would certainly fit with
  the announcements we are working on. So, I don't know if you'd want to do
  the DOJ idea in addition to the event'. The PSA alone would not be
  sufficient in the eyes of the disability community.
