           AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION ENDORSES NEEDLE EXCHANGE PROGRAMS,
                   PUTS PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY FIRST, HRC SAYS



           ABA Joins Growing Consensus Recognizing Such Programs
      Help Curb HIV/AIDS While Complementing Fight Against Drug Abuse

WASHINGTON -- The American Bar Association endorsed the use of needle
exchange programs today as an effective way to help stem the spread of
HIV/AIDS while complementing the fight against drug abuse, and encouraged
the removal of legal barriers to such efforts.

        "The ABA has joined public health experts in recognizing the
scientific evidence that needle exchange and drug treatment efforts
complement each other and save lives," said Seth Kilbourn, senior health
policy advocate for the Human Rights Campaign. "Needle exchange programs
help meet an urgent public health need in communities combating the dual
epidemics of AIDS and illegal drug use."

        Needle exchange programs provide intravenous drug users with
sterile syringes in exchange for used ones. Such programs have been
implemented in more than 100 communities around the country, and have been
shown to stem the spread of HIV and other blood-borne diseases transmitted
through the sharing of injection equipment.

        In February, the Department of Health and Human Services released a
report concluding that needle exchange programs are effective in slowing
the spread of HIV and AIDS.

        The Human Rights Campaign continues to call on the secretary of
Health and Human Services to act on the scientific evidence demonstrating
the necessity and effectiveness of needle exchange programs·. HRC is
encouraging her to remove current restrictions preventing local
communities from using federal funds for these life-saving programs.

        The ABA's resolution states that "in order to further
scientifically based public health objectives to reduce HIV infection and
other blood-borne diseases, and in support of our long-standing opposition
to substance abuse, the American Bar Association supports the removal of
legal barriers to the establishment and operation of approved needle
exchange programs that include a component of drug counseling and drug
treatment referrals."

        Approximately one-third of reported AIDS cases are related to
injection drug use. Sixty-six percent of all AIDS cases among women -- and
more than half of such cases among children -- are related to injection
drug use.

        With the adoption of its resolution today, the ABA has joined a
growing consensus in favor of needle exchange programs. Groups supporting
such HIV prevention efforts include the American Medical Association, the
American Public Health Association, the Association of State and
Territorial Health Officials, the National Academy of Sciences, the
National Black Caucus of State Legislators and the United States Conference
of Mayors.

        The ABA cited evidence that needle exchange programs reduce the
spread of HIV and hepatitis among injection drug users and their families;
reduce the number of contaminated needles on the street that pose a risk to
public safety; do not increase -- and may actually reduce -- illegal drug
use; and are vastly more cost-effective than treating the additional people
who would otherwise become HIV-positive.


                "It's all too rare that saving lives and 'saving money end up on the
        same side of the public health equation," noted HRC's Kilbourn. "So
        ignoring the mountain of scientific evidence in favor of needle exchange
        efforts would be both morally and fiscally irresponsible."

                Beyond the support from public health, scientific and legal
        experts, needle exchange programs are earning favor with the majority of
        Americans. Fifty-five percent of voters support such programs, according to
        a bipartisan poll commissioned by HRC and conducted April 8-10 by the
        Tarrance Group, a Republican firm, and Lake Sosin Snell and Associates, a
        Democratic polling company. The overall margin of error is plus or minus
        3.1 percent.

                In addition, a March 1996 survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation
        found that 66 percent of Americans favor "having clinics make clean needles
        available to IV drug users to help stop the spread of AIDS."

                The Human Rights Campaign is the largest national lesbian and gay
        political organization, with members throughout the country. It effectively
        lobbies Congress, provides campaign support and educates the public to
        ensure that lesbian and gay Americans can be open, honest and safe at home,
        at work and in the community.
