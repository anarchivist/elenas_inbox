                                     July 20, 1998


Q:    Aren't you just announcing this new initiative to preempt an upcoming report from
      the General Accounting Office that will sharply criticize your record on enforcing
      nursing home quality?

A:'   No. From the moment we received a report late last year about problems in California
      nursing homes, the President asked the incoming HCF A Administrator, Nancy-Ann
      DeParle, to review these problems and to make recommendations on how the Federal
      Government could best respond. Administrator DeParle has since made improving the
      quality of nursing homes one of her top priorities.

      In the course ofHCFA's review, it learned more about the nature of the problems in
      nursing home care and developed recommendations to address them. Today, we are
      announcing these new recommendations.

Q:    If this is a priority for your Administration, how come these problems are still
      occurring five years after you have taken office?

A:    Taking action to help ensure that nursing homes are delivering high quality care has
      always been a high priority for this Administration. When the Republicans threatened to
      eliminate Federal standards for nursing homes in 1995, the President stood strong against
      these proposals. In 1995, the President also implemented the strongest regulations on
      nursing home enforcement in history, including stepping up on-site inspections and
      helping nursing homes find and fix problems. The President is taking tough new actions
      again today to improve the quality of our nursing homes further and is committed to
      taking even stronger actions in the future if they are needed.

Q:    Isn't a big part of the problem the fact that nursing homes are not adequately
      reimbursed? In fact, last year's Balanced Budget Act cut reimbursement rates and
      eliminated the Boren Amendment, which explicitly required adequate
      reimbursement.

A:    While reimbursement no doubt plays some role in the quality of care, we believe that
      nursing homes are being adequately compensated. In fact, the new Medicare payment
      policies give nursing homes greater flexibility to provide the treatment that residents
      need. It creates financial incentives for nursing homes to provide high-quality care and
      become better managers, and holds them more accountable for the care they provide.

      Under the old, cost-based system, there was no incentive for efficiency or careful
      management. The payment changes in the Balanced Budget Act are similar to those
      adopted for hospitals in the 1980s, which have resulted in quality care and better
      management. Having said this, we will be closely monitoring reimbursement levels to
      ensure they are adequate to deliver high quality services.
Q:    Aren't you thwarting the traditional legislative process tiy consistently issuing

A:   As you will note, today we are not only taking administrative actions, but also sending up
     a legislative proposal to provide HCF A with additional needed authority over nursing
     homes. The best way to make progress in this area, as in so many others, is to do so in
     partnership with Congress. But where we can take executive action to improve the
     health and well-being of Americans, this President offers no apologies and will continue
     to act where appropriate to achieve that end.

                            NURSING HOMES
                              July 21, 1998

Today, the President announced tough new legislative and administrative actions to improve the quality
of nursing homes. These actions include: ensuring swift and strong penalties for nursing homes
failing to comply with standards, strengthening oversight of state enforcement mechanisms, developing
a national registry to track and identify individuals with a record of abusing residents, and
implementing unprecedented efforts to improve nutrition and prevent bed sores.

Background on Nursing Homes. About 1.6 million older Americans and people with disabilities
receive care in approximately 16,700 nursing homes. Since the Health Care Financing Administration
(HCF A) put new regulations in place in 1995, the health and safety of nursing homes has improved.
For example, the inappropriate use of physical restraints has been cut by more than half and the number
of nursing home residents receiving hearing aids is up 30 percent. But HCFA's ongoing review, as
well as the report that HHS is transmitting to Congress today, shows that tougher enforcement is
needed to ensure high quality care in all nursing homes. In response, the President is announcing a
tough new initiative to crack down on poor quality nursing homes and ensure high quality care.

The President Is Sending Legislation to Congress This Week That Calls for:

·      New Criminal Background Checks. An important way to improve the quality of nursing
       homes is to prevent personnel who have a history of resident and abuse from entering the
       system in the first place. The legislation the President is proposing would require nursing
       homes to conduct criminal background checks on all potential personnel.

·      National Abuse Registry. Once inadequate personnel have been identified, they should be
       kept out of the system for good. The new legislation would establish a national registry of
       nursing home employees convicted of abusing residents.

·      Improved Nutrition and Hydration. Currently, too few nursing home staff are available to
       help feed residents. To improve nutrition in nursing homes, this legislation would allow more
       categories of nursing home employees to receive training in and then to perform crucial
       nutrition and hydration functions.

·      Reauthorization of the Nursing Home Ombudsman Program. The President also called on
       Congress to reauthorize the nursing home ombudsman program run by the Administration on
       Aging, which provides consumers with critical information on poor-quality nursing homes,
       including records of abuse and neglect.




                                                              Automated Records Management System
                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion
Homes. Today, the President announced a series of new penalties, new inspections, and tougher
oversight that HCFA will implement immediately, including:

·     Immediate Civil Monetary Penalties on Nursing Homes That Violate Federal Standards.
      To crack down on inadequate providers, HCF A will direct enforcement authorities to impose
      civil monetary penalties immediately upon finding that a nursing home has committed a serious
      or chronic violation. Under current practice, enforcement officials often give nursing homes
      numerous opportunities to come into compliance, rather than imposing immediate sanctions.

·     Tougher Nursing Home Inspections. Starting today, HCFA will take several steps to
      strengthen states' inspection of nursing homes, such as:

             Staggering survey times: The report that HCF A is transmitting to Congress finds that
             nursing home inspections are too predictable, allowing inadequate nursing homes to
             prepare for inspections. Enforcement officials will now stagger survey times and
             conduct some surveys on weekends and evenings.

             Targeting chains with bad records: Federal and State officials will target nursing home
             chains that have a poor record of compliance with quality standards, to ensure these
             nursing homes receive frequent inspections.

             Prosecuting egregious violations: HCF A also will work with the HHS Office of
             Inspector General and Department of Justice to refer egregious violations of quality of
             care standards for criminal or civil investigation and prosecution when appropriate.

·     Stronger Federal Oversight of State Nursing Home Enforcement Mechanisms. HCFA
      will increase its oversight of state surveyors and take new tough actions against states that are
      failing to enforce standards adequately. It will:

             Terminate Federal nursing home inspection funding to states with continual poor
             records. The report being released by HCFA finds that some states have cited few or
             no nursing homes for substandard care. In states where oversight is clearly inadequate,
             HCF A will terminate state contracts and contract with other entities to conduct
             Federally-required inspections.

             Increase oversight of state inspections. HCF A will increase its review of the surveys
             conducted by the states to ensure thorough oversight, as well as provide additional
             training and assistance to state enforcement officials.

             Ensure that nursing homes are in compliance with standards before lifting sanctions.
             HCF A will increase oversight of state enforcement officials to ensure that they will not
             lift sanctions until after an on-site visit has verified compliance.




·     Preventing Bed Sores, Dehydration, and Malnutrition. HCF A will implement new oversight

                                                                    Automated Records Management SysteJ11
                                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion
    State surveyors will be required to monitor these activities and to sanction nursing homes with
    patterns of violations. HCFA also will work with the Administration on Aging, the American
    Dieticians Association, clinicians, consumers, and nursing homes to develop best practice
    guidelines to prevent malnutrition, dehydration, and bedsores.

·   Publishing Survey Results on the Internet. To increase accountability and flag repeat
    offenders for families and the public, HCF A will, for the first time, post individual nursing
    home survey results on the Internet.

·   Implementing New Efforts to Measure and Monitor Nursing Home Quality. In June
    1998, HCF A began collecting information on resident care through a national automated data
    system, known as the Minimum Data Set. This information will be analyzed to identify
    potential areas of inadequate care in nursing homes and to assess performance in critical areas,
    such as nutrition, avoidable bed sores, loss of mobility, and use of restraints. This assessment
    will help HCF A and state surveyors to conduct thorough evaluations of nursing homes and
    detect problems early.
