American Indian Education Foundation. Today the First Lady will announce the
Administration's support for legislation to create a nonprofit entity called the American Indian
Education Foundation, similar to the National Park Foundation, in order to help leverage
private resources for the education of Native American children. This Foundation will accept
and administer private gifts of real and personal property to support the goal of improving the
educational opportunities of American Indian and Alaska Native students from early childhood
through high school. This Foundation would be able to fund projects such as teacher training
and development programs; family literacy programs; the provision of materials and equipment;
model programs to advance the educational opportunities of Native American students; and the
development of American Indian cultural programs for use in schools.

                     American Indian Education Foundation Q&A
                                    May 4,1999

Q:   What did the First Lady announce today?

A:   Today the First Lady announced the Administration's support for legislation to create a
     nonprofit entity called the American Indian Education Foundation, similar to the National
     Park Foundation, in order to help leverage private resources for the education of Native .
     American children. This Foundation will accept and administer private gifts of real and
     personal property to support the goal of improving the educational opportunities of
     American Indian and Alaska Native students from early childhood through high school.
     This Foundation would be able to fund projects such as teacher training and development
     programs; family literacy programs; the provision of materials and equipment; model
     programs to advance the educational opportunities of Native American students; and the
     development of American Indian cultural programs for use in schools.

Q:   Why is such a Foundation needed?

A:   Currently, the Bureau ofIndian Affairs (BIA) at the Department of the Interior provides
     for the advancement of Native American education. Specifically, the BIA funds 185
     elementary and secondary schools and provides operating grants to about 30 tribally
     controlled community colleges. While there is an American Indian College Fund, there is
     no national non-profit that focuses on the education of Native American children before
     they reach college age. Currently, the BIA cannot legally solicit private funds in order to
     leverage resources to improve the educational opportunities of Native American students.
      This Foundation will be able to solicit private funds.

Q:   What types of projects would the Foundation fund?

A:   The Foundation would support various education projects that benefit Native American
     children from early childhood through high school. This Foundation would be able to
     fund projects such as teacher training and development programs; family literacy
     programs; the provision of materials and equipment; model programs to advance the
     educational opportunities of Native American students; and the development of American
     Indian cultural programs for use in schools.

Q:   Who are the sponsors of this legislation, and when will it be introduced?

A:   will find out today

Q:   Does the Foundation require any additional appropriations in order to operate?

A:   No, the legislation does not provide for any additional funding. The Foundation will use
     a maximum of 10 percent of the funds that it receives to support its operation. In
     addition, the legislation provides that the Department ofthe Interior may supply existing

                                                                     Automated Records Management System
                                                                             Hex-Dump Conversion

         personnel, facilities, and other administrative services to assist the Foundation in its
         start-up activities for a period of up to five years following passage of the legislation.

    Q:   How much does the Foundation expect to receive in donations?

    A:   Since there has never been a Foundation to leverage private resources to support the goal
         of providing educational opportunities for Native American children before they reach
         college age, it is difficult to estimate any particular amount. The Administration,
         however, is encouraged by the response it has received from this legislation, and expects
         that the Foundation, after an initial start-up period, will contribute significantly to
         improving the educational opportunities of Native American children.

    Q:   Will the Foundation have a Board of Directors?

    A:   Yes, the Foundation will have 11 board members, including the Secretary of the Interior
                                                                          and the Assistant
