              Question and Answer on Tobacco Settlement Proposal Review Process
                                   June 27, 1997 -- draft --


     Q:   Can you explain in more detail how the Administration's review is proceeding?

     A:   Bruce Reed, the President's Domestic Policy Advisor, and HHS Secretary Shalala, are
          leading the review. They have established four groups made up of fairly senior White
          House staff and staff from a number of federal departments including HHS, Justice,
          Labor, EPA, and Treasury. There is a regulatory group, a program and budget group, a
          legal group, and an industry performance and accountability group. These groups will
          subject the proposed agreement to the strictest scrutiny, focusing particularly on its affect
          on the public health and stopping children from smoking, as the President requested.

          Mr. Reed and Secretary Shalala will also be seeking the advice of leaders in the public
          health community, including the major public health organizations, Drs Koop and
          Kessler, and the community-level tobacco control advocates.

          (more detailed descriptions of groups below)

     Q:   Will you be consulting with Congress?

     A:   We will also be consulting extensively with Congressional leaders, including the Chairs
          and Ranking Members of the relevant Committees, and many other members of Congress
          who care a great deal about tobacco-related matters. The President is obviously aware of
          the important role Congress will play. To advance the public health, Congress would
          need to conduct a thorough debate of the issues and translate the agreement into detailed
          legislation.


     Q:   Can you say anymore about the President's reaction to the settlement now that he
          has had a week to study it?

     A:   First, he is looking at this in the context of the significant accomplishments his
          administration has already achieved in the fight to reduce death and illness caused by
          tobacco. He views the proposed settlement as an opportunity to advance the public
          health even further. He believes we should make the most of this historic chance to do
          everything we can to protect our children and our country from the dangers of tobacco.
          He expects it will take us some time to make a serious, informed judgment on the terms
          of this settlement, but he is delighted that the actions of his administration and the
          steadfast efforts of the attorneys general have permanently changed the tobacco
          landscape.


     Q:   Can you tell us whether the President has any comment on the sharp criticisms of


                                                                    Automated Reoords Management System
                                                                    H~~1lffil' Canvmlon
     committee?

A:   The President has said from the very beginning that he intends to consider very closely
     the views of the public health community, including Drs. Koop and Kessler, before
     rendering and judgment on the proposed settlement. The President shares some of the
     same questions. As the President noted last weekend, in light of the important role FDA
     jurisdiction played in advancing this issue, he was concerned by the changes in FDA
     jurisdiction that were contained in the proposed settlement. Drs. Koop and Kessler have
     voiced their concerns about this and other issues, and we will certainly be looking closely
     at their committee's report.

Q.   President Clinton has said the review will be done in 30 days. Are you going to
     meet that deadline?

A.   We are certainly trying to work within that time frame, but we will be sure to conduct a
     careful and thorough analysis.

Q.   Who will lead the HHS team?

A.   Secretary Shalala and Deputy Secretary Kevin Thurm.

Q.   Who will lead the DPC team?

A.   Bruce Reed, and Deputy Assistants to the President Elena Kagan and Chris Jennings.

Q.   Have any of the panels met?

A.   All of them have met at least once.

Q.   Why is this taking so long?

A.   This is a critical public health issue and the agreement is complex, so we are going to do
     an expeditious but careful and thorough review. As the President has said, protecting the
     public health -- and particularly our children's health -- is our primary concern. We
     know that nearly 3,000 young people become regular smokers each day, and nearly 1,000
     of these children and adolescents will die early from their use of tobacco products. We
     must ensure the agreement is in the best interest of public health and children's health.

Q.   How many agencies are involved in the review?

A.   12 agencies (HHS, DOl, Treasury, EPA, Interior, VA, DOD, USDA, DOL, GSA, State,
     and USTR), and 8 White House offices (DPC, NEC, CEA, OVP, Leg Affairs, Counsel,
     OMB, and OSTP)
     Q.   How many people are involved?
     A.   TBD

     Q.   Can you explain what each of the four groups will cover and which agencies will
          participate?

     A.   The Regulatory Issues group will look at FDA regulation of product content, access,
          advertising, and labeling, and proposed restrictions on environmental tobacco smoke in
          public buildings and workplace settings. Participating White House offices are DPC,
          OMB, OVP, NEC, and OSTP. Participating agencies are HHS, DOl, DOL, GSA, EPA,
          and Treasury.

          The Program and Budget Issues group will examine proposed uses of settlement funds,
          including spending on programs to reduce smoking and expand children's health care
          coverage, smoking cessation programs, and investments in health research, including
          nicotine research. Participating White House offices are DPC, OMB, NEC, OVP, and
          OSTP. Participating agencies are HHS, Treasury, DOL, USDA, Interior, VA, and DOD.

          The legal Issues group will examine, among other things, issues around liability,
          enforcement, compliance, and the disposition of industry documents. Participating
          White House offices' are DPC, OVP, NEC, and Counsel. Participating agencies are DOl,
          HHS, Treasury, EPA, and Interior.

          The Industry group will analyze the economic effects of a settlement, examine the
          proposed smoking reduction targets, penalties, and incentives, and evaluate the potential
          international impacts of the settlement. White House offices are DPC, NEC, CEA, OVP,
          OMB, and OSTP; participating agencies are: HHS, Treasury, DOL, USDA, USTR, State,
          and DOD.
