TEXT:
I got a call from DOL this morning giving me a heads-up on Gov. Engler's
efforts to privatize employemnt services in Michigan.  I assume you all
know that the employment serive office is not just where you get your
unemployment check, but also does job counseling, one stop shop, etc.
Governor Engler proceeded to privatize without submitting a state plan to
DOL (as required) and in fact notified the localities that they need to
get RFP's out because they will be required to privatize in their areas
starting 2/1/98. DOL has been fussing with the state for quite some time
(months) reo process/where is the state plan without really dealing with
the policy question (or notifying the White House). Engler submitted a
state plan two weeks ago requesting privatiation--so now the issue must be
resolved. DOL says they must give the state an answer by 1/5/97.

I understand that Karen is recused from this becuase of her SEIU
connection.  Karen tells me that Kitty Higgins has talked to John Podesta
about this directly. How do you want to proceed? Seems like we need to
resolve this quickly.
