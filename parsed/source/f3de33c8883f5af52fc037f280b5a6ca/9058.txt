COPS grants:  I double-checked on the COPS grants and all of them are
ready to go anytime from Friday on.   This includes the $30 million in
Police Corps grants, nearly $75 million in COPS hiring, and $10 million in
4th year extensions for small cities.   I understand that COPS and
scheduling think that Lawrence, MA (20 cops, $1.5 million) would make a
good site; Christa and I think that's fine, too.

Household Survey:  I had no luck in trying to see if the Drug-Free
Communities grants could be moved up to next.  They will definitely not be
ready until the first week in September. Without the grants, HHS and
ONDCP expect to release the findings of the Household survey this Friday
-- and I don't see any reason for the President to be involved or for us
to ask that they be held. Generally, the Survey has bad news -- youth
drug use is up, wiping out the gains we made the previous year, especially
w/respect to marijuana.  We should just have McCaffrey and Shalala get the
news out in the dog days of August ...
