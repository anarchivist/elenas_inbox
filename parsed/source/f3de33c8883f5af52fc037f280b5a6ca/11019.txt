  TEXT:
  I spoke to Mary Elizabeth Teasley this afternoon about Ed-Flex. They're
  not planning to oppose it this year -- they share our view that it doesn't
  really amount to much one way or another.   I told her the Dems' strategy
  of using it for amendments on class size and accountability.   I asked her
  not to put the NEA out front in public in favor of the issue, because that
. would play into the Republicans' hands.   She agreed -- but Karen, you may
  want to reinforce with Bob the next time you talk to him that while we
  don't have substantive problems with Ed-Flex, we want to slow this down,
  not speed it up.
