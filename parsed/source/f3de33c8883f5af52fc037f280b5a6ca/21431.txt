TEXT:
I wanted to call your attention to a conference that will be taking place
in Washington, DC
beginning Oct. 8th - 11th. The Society for the Advancement of Chicanos
and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS) will be celebrating their 25th
Anniversary.  SACNAS's mission throughout its entire history has been to
encourage Chicano/Latino and Native American students nationwide to pursue
graduate education (advanced degrees) in research careers and science
teaching professions.  Their ongoing mission has been to level the playing
field of education among these communities.   The VP was invited to speak a


t this conference by Congressman Bensten. Unfortunately his schedule will
not provide and through a series of calls, we are still working to find
the appropriate speaker.

I raise this conference because we too, will be dealing with Higher
Education this week.  If anyone has any ideas on who could and would be
an appropriate speaker for the conference that would be great. The higher
profile, the better ---. this could be a great continuation of his
message.
