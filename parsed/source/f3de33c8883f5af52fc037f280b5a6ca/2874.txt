     FYI

     The advance team in San Diego has made me aware of the fact that the
     Provost of the Thurgood Marshal College, Cecil Lytle, resigned (effective
     immediately) late last night due to a University decision to r~ject the
     idea of having a charter high school on campus.

     To quote the Union Tribune article, "Lytle said it is important to see the
     charter proposal in the context of the UC Board of Regents 1995 decision
     to end affirmative action in the undergraduate admissions, effective next
     spring. "


I am forwarding the Union Tribune article to you all asap.

Further - Ward Connolly has decided to attend the UCSD commencement
exercises.  Due to his high position in the University system he will be
speaking at the commencement and attending the lunch.
