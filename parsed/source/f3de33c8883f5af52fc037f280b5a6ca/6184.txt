                            President's Advisory Board On Race
                          Northern California, February 10-11, 1998


Theme: Race and Poverty in America

The purpose of this meeting is to examine the relationship between race, poverty, and public policy in
both urban and rural America. While whites are over 45% of the poverty population in the United
States, larger percentages of the minority population are poor. We will examine the racial
characteristics of the poor, the persistence of poverty, its causes including the role of discrimination,
and we will assess the nature of concentrated poverty in "ghettos" or "barrios."

Further, we will examine the need for and effectiveness of public and private sector responses to the
persistence and concentration of race-based poverty, including breaking the well-documented cycle of
poverty. Recommendations made thirty years ago by the Kerner Commission in addressing race will
be reviewed for their relevance. We will identify some promising practices aimed at reducing
poverty in minority communities including SBA, housing and community development projects.

Key Questions:

·   To what extent are poverty and race related? Is there a link between race and concentrated
    poverty?

·   What are the main causes of continuing and concentrated poverty among whites and minorities?
    Does discrimination continue to affect opportunities for minorities to move out of poor,
    segregated neighborhoods? What are the connections between racial isolation and poverty and
    how can we alter the negative aspects of these connections?

·   What governmental and non-governmental programs and policies are most effective in addressing
    minority group poverty and racial segregation? Should such policies and programs differ in
    order to address the distinctive position and needs of different racial/ethnic groups? How should
    they do this?

9:35 am - II :45 am: Poverty and Race: Facts, Causes, and National Issues

HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo has been invited to participate in the morning panel with the
Advisory Board. This round table discussion will bring together national experts to discuss if there is
a link between race and poverty, as well as the status and causes of continuous and concentrated
poverty in urban and rural communities. Economic inequality and race will be assessed as Will the
role of housing discrimination and how it limits opportunities to move out of "ghetto" neighborhoods.
The key controversies have been the extent to which the causes are racial or non-racial and the extent
to which the poor themselves bear responsibility for the continued impoverishment. The focus will be
on national policies, programs, and legislative issues.
