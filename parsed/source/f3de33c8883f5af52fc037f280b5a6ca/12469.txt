TEXT:
Edley is ready to revise the crime and education sections of the book to
address the concerns you've all raised; to do so he needs a detailed
understanding of the nuts and bolts of the proposals for ESEA and crime
bill--needs more than the one pager, talking points--how do we get him
this, so we can wrap this project up.  Don't forget we've also asked DPC
to provide language to square ESEA with Edley's current draft that
focused on the compact so that we can compare language and get this
done---your draft, I assume, would delete reference to the compact but
would attempt to make the case that the reform efforts on ESEA accomplish
the same goal for reducing racial disparities.  I think the crux of the
problem is that some of us want to talk about quality education for all
children and others want to focus on addressing racial disparities in
achievement.
