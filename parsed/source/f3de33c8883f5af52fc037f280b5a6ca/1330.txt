TEXT:
I think we should have the agency draft the language to fix the problem
and transmit it to the Hill with a letter saying Congressional intent was
clearly to allow states to use their own dollars to assist legal
immigrants, the state of Oregon has an innovative proposal to do this, and
we need this technical fix to make it happen.  Then the state of Oregon
and NGA should lobby the Hill to try to get it added to the welfare
technicals package when House Ways and Means marks up on March 20th or
when the Senate does so at a later date in the Senate. This would require
Ag Cmte and Ways and Means/Finance sign off.   We need to move very fast
to get this added to the technicals but that's the best vehicle (only
thing likely to be signed into law anytime soon) .

I would note that legal counsel seems to be missing one point about
Congressional intent -- yes, the law bans most legal immigrants from' the
food stamp program, but it also expressly says na State is authorized to
determine the eligibility for any State public benefits ... n (section
412) .   I believe we view the proposal as Oregon wanting to provide a
state benefit that use food stamps as a mechanism to delivert that state
benefit.   Since Congress allowed states to spend their own funds on legal
immigrants but expressly forbid receipt of most federal benefits, wouldn't
we need to have the state reimburse the feds for the cost of producing the
food stamps? Is that part of Oregon's proposal?

The opinion seems too definitive to change.   What do you recommend now?
