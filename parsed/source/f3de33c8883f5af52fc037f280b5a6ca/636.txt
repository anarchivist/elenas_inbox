SUBJECT:   NGA: Housing Amendments

READ: UNKNOWN

TEXT:
1) Amendment 14.2:   30% Cap On Rental Payments -- Governors are opposed
to Administration efforts to increase the requirement that 30% of income
be paid as rent.  They claim this is counter to welfare to work
principles. We have propose an increase to the 30% requirement (Brook
Rule), but so have the Republicans.  We have proposed to increase the
figure for budgetary purposes.

2) Amendment 14.3: Existing Programs -- Governors want to maintain
permancy of Low-Income Housing Tax Credit and Mortgage Revenue Bond
Program. The Administration concurs with the NGA position and would
underscore that the President fought to make both of these incentives part
of the permanent tax code back in 1993. He signed them into law as
permanent features of the Code as part of OBRA '93.

3) 14.4:   Federal Housing Efforts -- Generally concur with NGA position.

4) 14.5: Section B Project-Based Assistance -- The Administration has
called for going to a "mark to market" system which should make the
Section B program more efficient. The Governors are very concerned and
want us to preserve the existing system. This however is not financially
feasible.  We of course are open to working with them in insuring the best
possible transition.
