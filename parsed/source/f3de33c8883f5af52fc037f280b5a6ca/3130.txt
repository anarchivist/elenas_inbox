TEXT:
No, I feel pretty good about the block grant $ for background checks.
Everybody likes it so far and we should be able to add it to the Juvie
bill (Feinstein wants to authorize the R's block grant as part of the
bill). None of the cops are willing to support Schumer yet, but they're
okay with this.
