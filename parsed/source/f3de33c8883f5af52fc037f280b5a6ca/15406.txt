  Gay couples get medical benefits
  By Joe Burchell
     The City Council agreed to extend medical insurance benefits to gay and
  lesbian "domestic partners"    of city employees yesterday but refused to do
  the same for unmarried straight couples.
     The council voted 6-0 to approve the measure, which is expected to cost
  about $27,000.
     Councilman Steve Leal walked out of the room when the vote was taken.
  Leal
  said he didn't want to vote against the proposal, but wasn't prepared to
  support it yet because he said it didn't include adequate criteria for who
  is
  eligible for city insurance coverage and didn't include heterosexual
  couples.
     Employees who want to add same-sex domestic partners to their insurance
  need only sign an affidavit that they are committed to a long-term
  monogamous
  relationship.
     Leal said the city needs to require more of a commitment "than just
  having
  the same mailing address."   He said the city should study the policies of
  other governments that offer insurance to unmarried couples. Last month the
  Board of Supervisors agreed to extend insurance benefits to all unmarried
  domestic partners, but delayed final action until eligibility criteria are
  devised.
      Leal said he feels limiting insurance benefits to homosexual couples
  discriminates against other unmarried couples.
     Mayor George Miller supported City Manager Luis Gutierrez's position that
  heterosexual couples have the option of getting married to qualify for
  dependent insurance coverage, which is an option homosexual couples don't


enjoy.
  Miller said the city should approve the proposal because the amount of
money is --insignificant"  and the city later can adopt strict criteria for
who is eligible.
  Extending coverage to all unmarried --domestic partners"  would cost an
estimated $127,000. At the request of Councilman Michael Crawford, the city
will continue to investigate that possibility.
  Beverly Gin, a leader of the group of employees who asked the council to
consider extending insurance benefits to same-sex domestic partners, said
her
group has no position on whether straight couples should get the same
consideration.
  But she urged the council to act quickly on the proposal for same-sex
partners so they can sign up during the next open enrollment period for
city
insurance plans ...
