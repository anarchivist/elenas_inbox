TEXT:
In preparation for the one-year anniversary of the federal welfare-to-work
hiring initiative, Susan Valaskovic has drafted a letter from the
President to each Cabinet secretary thanking him/her for leadership on
this issue and encouraging them to "continue generating enthusiasm and
support for this initiative whithin your agency, stakeholder groups, and
contractor community." The letter is customized to: cite each agency's
goal and hires to date,   highlight one or two activities which have
"served as a model for the rest of the federal government" on this
initiative (e. g. DOE reaching out. to contractors, FEMA partnering with
community-based organizations), and thank several agency staff by name who
have played a key role.   Susan has run this past Cabinet Affairs who
thinks it is a good idea.   She thinks it will help keep momentum going at
the Cabinet level and provide ongoing motivation to the teams working in
each agency.   FYI, the letter for DOL recognizes Secretary Herman's tour
to promote movement of people from welfare to work, in addition to DOL's
specific contributions to the federal hiring initiative.

NPR staff is also putting finishing touches on a 1st Anniversary Report
from VP on the initiative, including a brief statement from the President,
recognizing the VP, cabinet, federal employees and the new hires
themselves for contributing to the success of the effort.   It's a brief,
attractive brochure format based on a "key" theme: "unlocking human
potential", "keys to success" etc.  It's supposed to go to printer on
Monday, with WH graphics prepared to produce copies quickly in case OVP
decides to move on the scheduling request that's been pending.
