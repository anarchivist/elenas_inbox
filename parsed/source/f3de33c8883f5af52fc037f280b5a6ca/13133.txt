TEXT:
Finally spoke to Karen Guss again. The AMA Board meets today
through Friday. The late term/"partial birth" abortion issue is
not on the official agenda, but people expect it to come up as
part of the AMA Legislative Committee's report. NARAL has
received no response to its letter (the one I shared with you) .
As for ACOG (ob/gyns), they have indicated that they have
expressed their unhappiness about AMA taking a position on this
"privately" to the AMA Board. ACOG is not taking a position on
the bill but if asked they say they have "serious reservations"
about the bill because of the criminal penalties it imposes.   (But
apparently, they are not willing to argue this is a "recognized"
or legitimate medical procedure) .
