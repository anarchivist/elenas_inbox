Subject: Follow-up on Medicaid "bucket" meeting

This e-mail 1) notifies you that the Health Division communicated your
guidance
to HCFA on the three Medicaid "welfare reform" issues and 2) outlines
HCFA's
response to your guidance.

1) SSI One-Month Gap -- We communicated to HCFA that the one-month gap
policy
should be made administratively through an All States Letter to the
Medicaid
Directors as well.  HCFA will send over the All States Letter for OMB
clearance
later this week.
·


     2) Medically-Needy -- We communicated to HCFA that the medically needy
     policy
     should be made administratively through an All States Letter to the
     Medicaid
     Directors as opposed to promulgating a regulation.  HCFA said that they
     would
     discuss this option with their Office of General Counsel and notify us if
     they
     had any legal concerns.  If not, HCFA will send over the All States Letter
     for
     OMB clearance. HCFA mentioned that they would like to distribute one All
     States Letter that would include both the medically needy policy and the
     delay
     regulation.

     3) Delay Regulation -- We communicated to HCFA that you approved of
     announcing
     HCFA's intention to promulgate this regulation, since the NPRM process
     could
     delay the impact of qualified aliens losing SSI.  HCFA wants to send out
     on All
     States Letter to the Medicaid Directors announcing this policy and to
     advise
     that States could retain Medicaid coverage for SSI recipients in the
     meantime.

     First, we will schedule a meeting early next week with HCFA, OIRA, and the
     Health Division to discuss this regulation.  Second, HCFA will send over
     the
     All States Letter for OMB clearance.  This letter will include both the
     medically needy policy and the announcement of HCFA's intention to
     promulgate
     the delay regulation.

     We also noted to HCFA that these policies should be handled
     administratively
     with little pUblicity. HCFA agreed.   To ensure a consolidated process,
     OMB
     policy officials need to coordinate with other EXOP officials in order to
     convey that these policies should be handled with minimal publicity.
