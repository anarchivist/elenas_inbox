MEMORANDUM FOR:               PHIL LEVINE, MICHELE JOLIN

SUBJECT:                      WHITEP APER ON WELFARE CASELOADS

CC:                           BRUCE REED, ELENA KAGAN, LYN HOGAN

         We appreciate the opportunity to comment on the draft whitepaper on welfare caseloads.
Below are comments, both general and specific. Please let me know if more detailed comments,
in the text itself, would be helpful.

Release of Report

        Since caseload numbers for January 1997 will soon be available, we would like you to
hold the release of the whitepaper so the two can be released together. The January 1997
numbers, which will show the caseload change during the Administration's first four years, will
probably generate a fair amount of interest, and it seems to us to make sense to release the
explanation of why caseloads have declined along with the latest data.

Model

        We believe that the model, as constructed, may exaggerate the effect of the economy
relative to policy initiatives. Specifically, the model leaves out certain policy initiatives which
may correlate with a good economy or which could help explain some of the "unexplained" 26%.
  For example, there have been large increases in Earned Income Tax Credit, child support
collections, and overall (federal plus state) child care spending since 1993, all of which helped
encourage people to leave the welfare rolls.

       In general, the paper doesn't explain well why there is a 26% "unexplained" portion.
Could the fact that you counted only state-wide waivers have increased the "noise" in the model?
 We think the paper should discuss some obvious suspects, like public attention to welfare
reform because of national and state debates, EITC, child care, etc.




                                                              Automated Records Management System
Description                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion

        The discussion of "advanced responses" of the waivers (p. 5 and 10) misses an important
point -- in order to apply for and obtain a waiver, states had to have a plan endorsed by their
legislatures. Thus, a state like New Jersey had already passed a state law calling for the changes
before it obtained the necessary waivers. The debate and passage of the new laws usually would
get a lot of publicity, and there was little public recognition that the laws would not be
implemented until the federal government gave permission. Thus the "advance response" isn't
as much of a mystery as you imply. Similarly, the attention to welfare reform given during and
immediately after the welfare bill signing seems to in and of itself contributed to a decrease in
caseloads.

        Also, speculating about the effects of the new law ("Implications for Welfare Reform"
section) is outside the scope of the analysis and does not fit comfortably in an Administration
document. It should be dropped.

Data Used in Report

         Because of the parameters of the analysis, the whitepaper uses some data that is different
than those commonly cited by the Administration. For example, the paper examines only 35
statewide waivers, while the Administration has repeatedly cited the fact that it has given waivers
to 43 states. Also, the whitepaper uses decline in the percentage of the population on welfare
through September 1996, while we are about to release data re: the percentage decline in the
case load through January 1997. I think the paper should refer to the more commonly used
statistics at least once to help claritY potential confusion.

        Also, rounding is applied inconsistently, making 42% into "almost half" but 32% into
"almost a third." 42% seems a lot closer to two-fifth than to one-half. Also, page 5 says "45
percent" of caseload decline can be attributed to economic growth, and "roughly 30 percent" to
federal welfare waivers.
