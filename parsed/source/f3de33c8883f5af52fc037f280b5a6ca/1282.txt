TEXT:
One more thought on the notion of more agencies adopting schools or
embarking on other volunteer activities, after a meeting we just had with
counsel's office:

We know that Federal employees can't be required to do volunteer work.
They cautioned us also that when supervisors encourage employees to
volunteer, they must not go over the line into coercing them.  They say
that encouragement from a supervisor can sometimes appear as coercion to
the employee.

Their suggestions include having the impetus for the effort come not only
from the top of the organization; and perhaps having a letter from the
President that would make it clear that this desire comes from him, rather
than from individual supervisors, and that it is entirely voluntary.
