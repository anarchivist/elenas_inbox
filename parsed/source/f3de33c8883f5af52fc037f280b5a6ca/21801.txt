Q:   What did the President announce in his radio address?

A:   Today President Clinton outlined steps he is taking to help our neediest citizens share in
     the blessings of the holiday season. He will announce nearly $130 million in new
     housing vouchers to help people with disabilities in over 200 communities obtain
     affordable housing. These funds, combined with nearly $700 million in grants released
     earlier this month to non-profit groups to create new subsidized apartments in 48 states,
     will help nearly 30,000 low income senior citizens and people with disabilities have a
     home to call their own. The grants from the Department of Housing and Urban
     Development are part of President Clinton's on-going strategy to create safe, affordable
     housing for those who need it most.

Q:   What did the President announce in his radio address about housing vouchers and
     certificates for people with disabilities?

A:   The President announced nearly $130 million to help over 17,000 people with disabilities
     in over 200 communities obtain affordable housing under the Department of Housing and
     Urban Development's (HUD) Section 8 Mainstream Program. This program provides
     rental assistance to low-income disabled families in the form of Section 8 rental vouchers
     and certificates issued by local public housing authorities. The families generally pay no
     more than 30 percent of their adjusted income for rent with the balance paid by the local
     public housing authority using either Section 8 rental vouchers or certificate funds.

Q:   What is the difference between a certificate and a voucher?

A:   The primary difference between a Section 8 rental voucher and a rental certificate is that a
     family with a certificate is limited to renting a unit that is within the fair market rent
     (FMR). A family with a voucher may rent a unit that exceeds the FMR, but, in addition
     to paying 30 percent of its adjusted income toward rent, must also pay that portion of the
     rent that exceeds the payment standard established by the local public housing authority.

Q:   What are the housing grants for disabled and elderly persons that the President
     highligh ted?

A:   The President highlighted that earlier this month, HUD unveiled $696 million in grants to
     non-profit groups in 48 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico to provide
     housing for low-income elderly and disabled persons. Under the Section 202 program,
     HUD will award $563 million in grants to fund the construction and rehabilitation of over
     6500 units for almost 10,000 low-income elderly persons. Since 1993, approximately

     been constructed or rehabilitated. Under the Section 811 Supportive Housing for
     Persons with Disabilities program, HUD will award $133 million to fund the construction
     and rehabilitation of 1650 units for about 2,500 disabled persons. Since 1993, this
     program has served over 18,000 disabled persons in approximately 12,500 units.

Q:   What are the housing needs for the elderly and disabled?

A:   HUD's 1997 Report on the Nation's Worst Case Housing Needs states that the elderly
     make up 12 percent of the 12.5 million persons in households with worst case housing
     needs. Approximately 1.5 million elderly persons pay more than 50 percent of their
     income in rent or live in substandard housing. The number of adults with disabilities
     living in households with worse case needs (persons that pay more than 50 percent of
     their income in rent or live in substandard housing) is estimated between 1.1 and 1.4
     million.

Q:   How does today's announcement relate to the President's overall housing agenda?

A:   These steps are just a few of President Clinton's efforts to promote affordable housing and
     homeowners hip. This year's balanced budget included the first new housing vouchers in
     five years, with 50,000 specifically targeted to help people moving from welfare to work
     move closer to jobs. The President has increased funding to help homeless people move
     from the streets to self-sufficiency and will continue to fight to expand the Low-Income
     Housing Tax Credit to help America's most hard-pressed families afford decent housing.
     Under the President's leadership, over 7 million more Americans have become
     homeowners, raising the homeownership rate to 66.8 percent, the highest rate in our
     history.

          NEARLY 30,000 SENIOR CITIZENS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES
                                November 28, 1998

Today President Clinton will outline steps he is taking to help our neediest citizens share in the
blessings of the holiday season. He will announce nearly $130 million in new housing vouchers
to help people with disabilities in over 200 communities obtain affordable housing. These
funds, combined with nearly $700 million in grants released earlier this month to non-profit
groups to create new subsidized apartments in 48 states, will help nearly 30,000 low income
senior citizens and people with disabilities have a home to call their own. The grants from the
Department of Housing and Urban Development are part of President Clinton's ongoing strategy
to create safe, affordable housing for those who need it most.

New Housing Funds for People with Disabilities

Today, the President will announce nearly $130 million in new housing vouchers to help over
17,000 people with disabilities obtain affordable rental housing. These funds will help subsidize
rents in the private marketplace, providing new affordable housing choices for people with
disabilities. These vouchers and certificates will be provided to people with disabilities in over
200 communities across America through local housing authorities and will ensure that low
income people with disabilities won't have to pay more than 30 percent of their income in rent.

New Grants to Create Affordable Housing for Senior Citizens and People with Disabilities

Earlier this month, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Cuomo unveiled $696 million in
grants to non-profit groups in 48 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico to create
8,213 subsidized apartments for over 12,000 very low-income senior citizens and people with
disabilities. These funds will be used to create new affordable rental housing (through new
construction or rehabilitation of existing housing) and to subsidize the rents of the housing
tenants. The funds will provide over 6,500 apartments for about 9,900 senior citizens and
1,650 apartments for about 2,500 people with disabilities. Funds will be provided to over 200
non-profit organizations, including local chapters of the YMCA, Salvation Army, B'nai B'rith,
Goodwill, and Catholic Charities.

Promoting Affordable Housing and Homeownership

These steps are just a few of President Clinton's efforts to promote affordable housing and
homeow~ership. This year's balanced budget included the first new housing vouchers in five
years, with 50,000 specifically targeted to help people moving from welfare to work find housing
closer to jobs. The President has increased funding to help homeless people move from the
streets to self-sufficiency and will continue to fight to expand the Low-Income Housing Tax
President's leadership, over 7 million more Americans have become homeowners, raising the
homeowners hip rate to 66.8 percent, ~he highest rate in our history.
