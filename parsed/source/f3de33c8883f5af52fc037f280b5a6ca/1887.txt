TEXT:
We're making good progress! Elizabeth agrees that it would be helpful if
you were willing to approach Sally Katzen about this rather than waiting
until it actually comes to Sally or she hears about it from someone
strongly opposed to it.

Tim Westmoreland, who represents the Pediatric AIDS Foundation, used to
work for Waxman and is excellent, offered to meet with Sally at any time.
That is premature as of yet, but would ultimately be helpful.  It would
probably need to be facilitated by someone (Chris J?) as Sally does not
know Tim.

Let us know if you want to talk with Sally and want to see some of the
briefing materials again.

Pauline
