        Patients' Bill of Rights Update. Following the introduction of the Democratic patients' bill of
        rights legislation, this Wednesday the American Medical Association board unanimously
        endorsed the Democratic bill and committed to working for its enactment this year. Unlike the
        tobacco legislation, the patients' bill of rights has much greater support in the House than in the
        Senate. Despite this fact, the House Republican Leadership is sending signals that they want to
        delay this legislation as long as possible. We are developing a legislative and communications
        strategy to try and expedite their action to introduce a bill sometime in May. We will work with
        the AMA and Congressman Ganske (who has indicated he will cosponsor the Democratic bill) to
        attract as many Republicans co-sponsors as possible to the Democratic legislation. While we
        are hopeful that we can attract Republican co-sponsors, we believe that it may be necessary to do
        more public events to apply additional pressure to the House. Weare trying to target
        Representative Hastert, the Gingrich-appointed chair of the House Republican Task Force on
        Quality, to encourage him to expedite the Republican House bill. He is planning to travel with
        you in South America next week. If an appropriate opportunity arises, you may want to let him
        know that you will not let this issue go away and want a cooperative not a confrontational
        relationship as we move forward on it.

        Medicare Fraud Update. In response to unprecedented efforts at the Justice Department and
        HHS to crack down on fraud and abuse, health care providers, and in particular hospitals, are
        raising major objections to what they believe to be overly aggressive enforcement activities. To
        address these concerns, the Justice Department has agreed to stop letters that hospitals find
        threatening. However, they are rejecting the American Hospital Association's request to slow
        down their enforcement activities in this area. Ironically, some of the same Hill members who
        complained a few years ago that the Administration was not doing enough fight fraud and abuse,
        are now complaining that we are acting too tough in this area. That being said, an Inspector
        General's report to be released later this month will cite that, while the Administration is doing a
        better job of fighting fraud and abuse, there are still significant overpayments in the Medicare
        program. In response to the report, we hope to highlight the Administration's strong record on
        fraud and abuse. We are working to see if we can release a regulation around the time of the
        report that rewards Medicare beneficiaries who report fraud and abuse. While we do not intend
        to back down with regard to enforcement activities, we will indicate that we will be sensitive to
        concerns about process.

        Missouri Medicaid/Children's Update. As you know, Governor Carnahan has expressed his
        frustration that HHS is not moving fast enough on both Missouri's children's health insurance
        program and 1115 Medicaid waiver. In fact, he has been asking for meetings with the Vice
        President on this issue. These negotiations have been complicated by the fact the Missouri has
        continued to rely on what appear to be illegal provider taxes. We believe that we are close to
        resolving the provider tax issue as well as a host of other outstanding issues. Governor
        Carnahan is scheduled to meet with Secretary Shalala next week and at that meeting, or before,
        we hope to have all of these issues surrounding their application resolved.
