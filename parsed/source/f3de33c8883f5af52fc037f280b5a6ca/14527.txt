TEXT:
Elena, the scheduling proposals (for taping a segment of the ABC special
and holding the Conference) are already in.  I thought that in our last
meeting we had decided that we should send in proposals as placeholders
for possible dates. Also, Melanne mentioned that there was some
discussion early on about having the date for the Conference set before
the SOTU, so we sent the proposals in about two weeks ago.  Ooops.  I
could pull them if you'd like.

I had heard that there was some discussion about putting off the
Conference until later in the Spring, and I'm sure that Stephanie, et. aI,
will look to you and Bruce for guidance. Our initial thinking had been
that holding the Conference earlier enables us to help frame the
discussion and "annouce" events to come, such as the Reiner special. We
should make sure that we don't look like johnny-corne-lately.

On the other note, I'll be sure to go to Carol's meetings.
