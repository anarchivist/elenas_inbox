The one thing we forgot to discuss today is whether we want the President
to sign the cover memorandum announcing the issuance of the Guidelines.   I
have no preference on this subject, we just need to decide it.   Thanks.

TEXT:
Mar9]r Waller from PPI called me to say she and Will Marshall have drafted
an op-ed praising the success of welfare reform after one year and
praising the President. Their communications staff are trying to place
it.   It does mention as "undone" restoring food stamps for legal
immigrants.
