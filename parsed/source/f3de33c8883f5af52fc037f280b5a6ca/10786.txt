TEXT:
If it's not too late, I'd suggest the following changes to what Cynthia
sent over on Friday to reflect what's now in the speech and the $1 billion
WTW amount released to the Post.   I've mentioned these to Ruby for her
talking points as well.

Welfare Rolls Decline as More Recipients go to Work

The President announced that the percentage of the U.S. population on
welfare is at its welfare rolls are at their lowest level in 30 years and
the welfare rolls have fallen by nearly half since the president.he took
office.  The percent of welfare recipients working has tripled since 1992
and all states met the first work participation rates required under the
welfare reform law.  Two years ago the President challenged the business
community to create jobs so that people can move from welfare to work.
Today, 10,000 companies of all sizes, industries, and from all regions
have joined the Welfare to Work Partnership and are successfully hiring
and retaining hundreds of thousands of former welfare recipients.

Additional Welfare-to-Work Assistance for Those Who Need it Most

The President announced that he will propose $1 billion in additional
funding for his Welfare-to-Work program to ensure those remaining on the
welfare rolls who face the greatest challenges can succeed in the
workforce and to increase the employment of low-income fathers so they can
better support their children. This funding will help 200,000 people move
from welfare to work and will help increase child support collections,
which have gone up 80 percent since 1992.
