ray (nga) gave marcia and i an earful on our favorite subject--welfare and
minimum wage. he is claiming it will derail the whole welfare to work
process. he is insisting on a white house meeting to discuss before we
decide. he knows that we met with labor to discuss and are close to an
answer.  i don't think we have a choice. bruce/ken/elena--could you stand
to do this on monday?
