TEXT:
The reason HHS is not asking for case loads from states every month is that
states are reporting this data quarterly as part of their regular TANF
data reporting, but that is the information that HHS and the states are
still working out glitches on.  In the meantime, I see no reason HHS can't
continue calling states for the numbers -- the states certainly have the
information.
