TEXT:
FYI: The.U.S. Conference of Mayors has sent us paper saying
"reauthorization of Welfare-to-Work is essential in the FY 2000 Budget"
and the LA County Board of Supervisors has written to the President urging
him to include $1.5 billion in FY 2000 for Welfare to Work as well as
expanded financial support for projects which provide employment-related
services to non-custodial parents of children on welfare.   The letter from
LA notes that LA county has more TANF recipients than any state except New
York and California.

The Mayors also urge us to fund Access to Jobs welfare to work
transportation at the full $150 million in FY 2000 (currently the passback
has $75).
