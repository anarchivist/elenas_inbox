TEXT:
If the bill does come up, it will be on very short notice, i.e. it
can be brought up as soon as an agreement is reached among
interested Senators. Therefore, we should be clearing a SAP
today.  please make sure that all of the interested players have
actually looked at this bill; it's not clear to me that our
opposition to the Product Liability bill should necessarily
translate into opposition to this bill.
