         ADMINISTRATION STATEMENT ON CONGRESSIONAL CONSIDERATION
            OF LEGISLATION TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF H-tB VISAS


            The Administration generally supports legislative efforts to address shortages of skilled
     workers within certain sectors of our economy. We believe that the first response for increasing
     the availability of skilled workers must be helping the labor market work better to match
     employers with US. workers and increasing the skills of US. workers. Thus, while it may be
     necessary in the short-term to increase the number of visas for temporary foreign workers, this
     must only be done in conjunction with additional efforts to increase the skill level of U.S.
     workers and meaningful reforms to the H-IB program. We look forward to working with the
     Congress to achieve a balance between protecting U.S. workers and providing flexibility for
     employers.

             If the President is presented with a bill that increases the cap on H -1 B visas, but does not
     contain a significant training component and meaningful reform to the H -I B program that
     requires employers to recruit US. workers before applying for an H-I B worker and to not lay-off
     a US. worker in order to hire an H-IB worker, the President's senior advisors will recommend
     that he veto the bilL
