TEXT:
USDA called with the rumor that Phillip Morris early next month will
announce that it is buying 200 million pounds of flue-cured tobacco from
from farmers, but not through the cooperatives. The effect would be to
deny USDA the revenues it uses to run its program, hire graders, etc.
USDA says it is a move to kill the program.  I inquired whether USDA felt
this was legal, they believe it is, but will keep checking, and provide a
list of options for response. They think the other companies are less
than pleased about this move.  It is worth noting that USDA rumors have
not always turned out to be accurate.
