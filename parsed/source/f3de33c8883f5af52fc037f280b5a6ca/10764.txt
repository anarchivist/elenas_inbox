    Clinton Seeks Child Care Credit

                        By Sonya Ross
                        Associated Press Writer
                        Sunday, January 17, 1999; 8:01 p.m. EST

                           WASHINGTON (AP)   -- President Clinton's fiscal 2000
    budget will
                        propose a $500 child care tax credit for stay-at-home
    parents, an idea
                      pushed last year by congressional Republicans,
    administrations sources
                      said Sunday.

                       Clinton's proposal would allow a tax credit of up to
    $500 for families with
                       a child aged 1 or younger, according to a White House
    official who spoke
                       on condition of anonymity.

                      The sliding-scale credit, pegged to family income, is
    expected to cost $1.3
                      billion over five years, allowing for an average tax
    credit of $178, the
                      official said.

                           Clinton is expected to outline the proposal in his State
    of the Union
                           address Tuesday night before a joint session of
    Congress.

                      The tax credit is expected to benefit 1.7 million
    families. A family earning
                      $30,000 per year with one working parent would be able
    to claim the full
                      $500 in child care expenses, rather than the $250 they
    are allowed under
                      current law.


                    The proposal is part of a larger child care package that
seeks a total of
                  $18 billion over five years to aid working poor and
middle class families.

                   That broader package -- absent the staY-at-home-mom
credit -- is similar
                   to what Clinton sought last year: $7.5 billion for
expanding child care
                   subsidies to serve an extra. 1.15 million children; $5 bil
lion in tax credits
                   for non-parental care of a child younger than 13, or a
disabled dependent
                   or spouse; $3 bil·lion for grants for preschool programs;
a $500 million tax
                   credit for businesses that provide child care services
for their employees;
                   $600 million for after-school programs and $173 million
for inspections,
                   training and o.ther efforts to improve child care.

                   Last year, Clinton put forth a $22 billion proposal,
tied to revenue from
                   the proposed tobacco settlement, but it went nowhere on
Capitol Hill, in
                  part because Republicans said it failed to address pare
nts who do not
                   work outside the home.

                        with the revamped plan, the White House was hoping to
take some steam
                        out of that argument, giving GOP leaders what amounts to
a political dare.
                        "There's no excuse for Congress not acting on child care
 now, "   the
                        official said.

                        However, the official declined to reveal how the tax
credit would be
                        financed, other than to say it would be through " a host
of options"     being
                        exercised in Clinton's budget and would not be tied to a
tobacco tax
                        increase.

                        White House officials said Clinton's specific tax credit
                                                                               /
for stay-at-home
                        parents is patterned after one offered last year by Sen.
Christopher Dodd,
                        D-Conn. The rest of Clinton's package incorporates el
ements of a Senate
                        proposal offered by Sens. Orrin Hatch and John Chafee,
they said.

                  The Chafee-Hatch bill called for $15 billion to $16
billion over five years,
                  including a dependent-care tax credit for stay-at-home
parents of up to
                  $900 per year per family.
