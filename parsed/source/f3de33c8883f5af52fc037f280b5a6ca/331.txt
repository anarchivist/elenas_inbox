Ken shared with me your draft language on the HHS waiver issue.  I wouldn't
fomulate it quite that way, I'd suggest something along the following lines:

The Administration believes that waivers should not    exempt people from work
requirements and time limits. We hope that States     (and the Congress?) will
share this view, but if it becomes apparent that is    not the case, the
Administration will seek legislation to clarify the    issue.
