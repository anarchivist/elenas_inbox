TEXT:
Federal welfare-to-work hiring initiative
An event to mark the first year anniversary of the federal welfare-to-work
hiring initiative is currently pending in the VP scheduling process.   The
event could include: release of the first annual report from the VP,
announcement of the most recent hiring numbers, and a challenge to cabinet
secretaries to reach out to federal contractors to get more involved in
hiring welfare recipients. The audience would include several hundred
federal contractors from the Washington area, so we will need a little
lead time for the agencies to invite them. This was originally submitted
by NPR staff on 2/13/98. Late last week, VP scheduling asked Susan
Valaskovic to revise slightly, so apparently it's still under
consideration.

Welfare Case load Numbers
HHS is working on getting updated caseload data through December 1997
 (last data released, with SOTU, was September 1997). They hope to have
them to us early next week.   The VP could announce these as part of the
above event, or in a separate announcement.   If separate, we could
possibly combine with an announcement of DOL approval of more
Welfare-to-Work formula grants to states.   TN is one of those in the
pipeline and I know the VP's office is interested in releasing that one.
I hope to be able to confirm timing on case10ads and WTW approvals at our
weekly welfare reform meeting w/ agencies 3/17.
