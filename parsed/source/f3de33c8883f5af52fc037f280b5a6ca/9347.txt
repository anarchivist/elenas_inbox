        MEMORANDUM FOR ELENA KAGAN AND SALLY KATZEN

        FROM:          JULIE FERNANDES and CECILIA ROUSE

        RE:            AMENDED WYDEN-GRAHAM AGRICULTURAL GUESTWORKERS BILL

                 As you know, Senators Wyden and Graham have put forward a series of changes to their
        bill to refonn the H-2A agricultural guestworker program. On Friday morning, you will be
        meeting with staff of Senators Ron Wyden (D-OR), Bob Graham (D-FL), Edward Kennedy
        (D-MA), and Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), and Representatives Howard Berman (D-CA), Sanford
        Bishop (D-GA), and Xavier Becerra (D-CA), to discuss where we are.

                Though their new proposal does move in our direction in a few areas (M., it restores the
        requirement that growers reimburse workers for transportation; eliminates the provision that
        would have required reducing workers wages by 20% as an incentive to repatriate; adds a
        requirement that growers make a "good faith" effort to assist workers in utilizing the housing
        voucher), fundamental substantive objections remain. The following is a list of the most
        significant problems with the new Wyden-Graham proposal.

        1.     The bill would eliminate the current requirement that growers must conduct private
               market recruitment for workers, substituting a simple requirement to check a new and
               untested government-run "job registry".

                The core of the Wyden-Graham bill remains the creation of a new "job registry"
        administered by the government. Under their bill, growers would need only to check this
        registry before employing H-2A workers. Thus, all responsibility for the recruitment of
        domestic farmworkers would shift to a new, untried, process for which the government and
        low-wage workers are entirely responsible. In addition, although this registry would take years
        to create and implement effectively, employers could begin to hire H-2A workers within 6
        months of the enactment of the bill.

                At last week's meeting, there was some discussion about extending the start date for the
        use of the registry from six months to one year after the enactment of the bill. However, even if
        this change is made, it would not address the fundamental problems with the proposed registry:
        (1) that use of the registry would relieve the growers of any obligation to do positive recruitment;
        and (2) that the bill would require wholesale reliance on a method of recruitment that has not
        been shown to be effective.


                                                                              Automated Records Management System
                                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion

     2.     The bill would erode U.S. worker wages.

             The wage provisions of the Wyden-Graham bill have not changed. Under the current
     program, growers who employ H-2A workers are required to pay all their farrnworkers the higher
     of the prevailing wage (equal to the average local wage for the crop) or an "adverse effect wage
     rate" (AEWR) (equal to the average statewide wage). The use of the AEWR reflects the fact
     that foreign workers (both undocumented and H-2A guestworkers) can sometimes dominate a
     local labor market and depress the local prevailing wage: in such a case, using a statewide
     calculation (the AEWR) may be more appropriate. The Wyden-Graham bill caps the AEWR at
     105% ofthe local prevailing wage. We continue to believe that this cap is not set high enough
     to compensate for the depression of wages in areas where there is a heavy reliance on foreign
     workers and not sufficiently high to attract new U.S. workers into agricultural employment.

            In addition, the current proposal from Sens. Wyden and Graham does not include the
     much-discussed "user fee" (equal to 8Y2 percent of the H-2A worker's wage). Without this fee,
     the wage cost of hiring a U.S. workers remains 8 Y2 percent higher than hiring an H-2A worker.

     3.     The bill does not provide an adequate mechanism for housing foreign guestworkers.

             Though the proposal continues to replace the requirement that growers provide housing
     with a requirelllent that the growers provide workers with a housing voucher, it now includes a
     requirement that growers make a "good faith" effort to locate housing for the worker. Though
     this minimal assistance obligation is an improvement, the fundamental obligation that the grower
     assure that workers are adequately housed would be eliminated. Also, though the
     Wyden-Graham proposal permits States to certify that there is inadequate housing for
     farrnworkers (within one year of enactment of the bill), there is no requirement that States make
     an assessment of their rural housing stock and no incentive for them to do so. Further, even if
     such a certification is made by a State, the growers may still provide vouchers instead of housing
     for up to four additional years.

             There are many areas (particularly in the West) where there simply is not an adequate
     supply of rural housing to meet the needs of farrnworkers. This proposal does not address that.
     Rather, it gives a grower a minimum of five years after enactment of the bill to continue to use
     vouchers, regardless ofthe availability of adequate housing. Moreover, even with the "good
     faith" assistance by growers, it remains umealistic to expect low-wage foreign migrant
     farrnworkers to be able to secure housing using a federal voucher. Thus, many workers will
     likely end up without housing, or will overcrowd any available rental housing.

     4.     The bill would eliminate the requirement that growers guarantee part of the work offered
            to recruit U.S. and foreign workers.

           This proposal continues to eliminate the requirement that growers guarantee 3/4 of the
     work offered to recruit U.S. and foreign farmworkers. Under current law, H-2A workers must


                                                      2             Automated Records Management System
                                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion

        be paid for at least 75% of the work contract period for which they were recruited, except when
        there is an "act of God." This "three-fourths guarantee" gives migrant workers some indication
        of their potential earnings and discourages employers from over-recruiting to secure a labor
        surplus and drive down wages. Though Wyden's staff discussed trying to include a modified
        version ofthis requirement in their bill, their most recent proposal does not restore this
        protection. The elimination of the 3/4 guarantee would encourage growers to lure workers from
        hundreds or thousands of miles away with the promise of potentially high earnings without any
        obligation to fulfill any part of that promise. The change also could encourage growers to
        recruit more workers than they actually need to hedge against uncertainties.

                 The Wyden-Graham proposal would require H-2A workers to be covered under the
        Migrant and Seasonal Worker Protection Act (MSPA). Under MSPA, U.S. migrant
        farmworkers appear to enjoy a guarantee of 100% ofthe work contract period for which they
        were recruited. There is some internal dispute as to whether Wyden's proposal to cover H-2A
        workers under MSPA would mean that H-2A workers would enjoy a 100% work guarantee. No
        one on either Sen. Wyden's or Sen. Graham's staff has claimed that this change would provide
        such a guarantee.

                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion
