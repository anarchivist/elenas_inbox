with HHS.
I will resend to you the list of potential regs that HHS supplied
a few weeks ago.  It would be helpful if people could look at it
in advance.
OIRA staff is welcome.
We are checking as to whether someone higher level than Maddy
Mocko should come from ACF.

I invited Bruce. He may actually come.     DKC: Elena, Emily and
Ken are coming, right?
I think staff should be welcome.  That's my general principle.
On the agenda: we need to start the meeting by having HHS walk
through (1) the list of areas they propose regulating in and (2)
the timetable and process they propose. We need to then provide
initial feedback from all of us - and based on how the proposals
are received agree on next steps. Next steps have to include what
to present to the intergov'l groups at Carol's meeting as a
prop~ed process - and what the process with labor and the
nonprofit community will be as well.
Sound good? If you agree, should we actually do an agenda?
