TEXT:
The Lowey amendment to the Treasury Postal Appropriations bill on
contraceptive coverage passed by a vote of 28-26 in Committee.   (The
amendment says that FEHB plans covering prescription drugs must cover
prescription contraceptives.)  The victory came as something of a
surprise to the women's groups. Of course, now they will have ~o fight to
protect the amendment on the floor.  They could very well face a motion to
strike or an amendment to add a conscience cYause exempting religious
plans.

In addition to the thanks we received yesterday from the women's groups
for our assistance with OPM during the markup, Nita Lowey'S office called
today to express their sincere gratitude as well.,

FYI    these are the facts the women's groups are circulating:

10% of FEHB plans provide no coverage of contraceptives.
81% of FEHB plans do not cover all five leading reversible methods of
contraceptives (oral contraceptives, diaphragm, IUD, Depo-Provera, and
Norplant). And coverage of specific types of contraceptives varies widely
among FEHB plans -- 88% cover oral contraceptives, but only 28% cover the
IUD.
FEHB plans provide near universal coverage of sterilization. They exclude
coverage of abortion.
CBO said that the cost to the federal government of the Lowey amendment
would be zero.
