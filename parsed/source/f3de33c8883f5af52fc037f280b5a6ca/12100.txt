 MEMORANDUM FOR                 THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
                                THE SECRETARY OF EDUCATION


 SUBJECT:               ANNUAL REPORTS ON HATE CRIMES IN SCHOOLS AND
                        COLLEGE CAMPUSES

         One of the greatest challenges facing this country in the 21st century is to create a vision
 of One America where the American Dream is alive and well for every citizen responsible
 enough to work for it. We all must work together to ensure that all Americans share the same
 opportunities, regardless of their race, color, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, gender,
 or disability.

         Tragically, however, our nation has witnessed a number of heinous and cowardly hate
 crimes, particularly in the past year. These shameful acts of violence are attacks not only against
 individuals, but against America and our shared values. Violence motivated by prejudice and
 hatred hurts us all.

         We have a responsibility to ensure that our nation's laws fully protect all its citizens.
 That is why I support legislation which would strengthen existing federal hate crimes laws to
 remove needless barriers to prosecuting violent crimes based on race, color, religion, or national
 origin; and to expand the law to cover acts of violence committed because of a person's sexual
 orientation, gender, or disability.

          However, we must not focus only on acts of intolerance and hate once they rise to the
  level of a crime. We can only fight prejudice by fighting the misunderstanding and the
  ignorance that produce it. This type of insidious hate is learned behavior. We must reach out
  to children and young people in order to teach them about the harmful effects of intolerance .
. Often intolerance begins with a bigoted remark or a lack of sensitivity toward individual
  differences. It begins with the taunting of children and young people because of their skin color,
  religion, sexual orientation, or disabilities. Parents and teachers must create an ongoing
  dialogue to change attitudes and to highlight positive ways in which to deal with diversity. Just
  as hate is not learned in only one day, attitudes about tolerance cannot be created with one lesson
  or discussion -- they must be interwoven into young people's daily lives.

        In order to better understand the problem of hate crimes and intolerance among young
 people, I call on the Departments of Justice and Education to include in their annual report card
 on school safety a section on hate crimes and intolerant behavior among young people, both at
 school and away from school. In addition, I direct the Department of Education, with
 appropriate assistance from the Department of Justice, to collect data and produce a report on
 incidents of hate crime and attitudes of bias for college on college campuses.

        These steps, taken together and in coordination with our pending legislation, will help to
create One America for all of America's families. I appreciate your commitment to improving
the enforcement ofthis nation's laws and to working to teach tolerance among young people, and

                                                                    Automated Records Management System
     I look forward to your continuing leadership in these areas.           Hex-Dump Conversion
