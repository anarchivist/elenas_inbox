                   Philip Morris Cos. marks
                        $300 million for growers'
                        fund

                        By David Rice

                        JOURNAL REPORTER

                        Philip Morris Cos. Inc., the nation's largest
cigarette-maker,
                        announced yesterday that it will contribute $300
million to a trust
                        fund to help tobacco growers, making it the first of
the large
                        tobacco companies to formally put up money for
growers.

                       The move comes as cigarette companies and governors
from
                        tobacco states prepare for more meetings next week
to discuss a
                        $5 billion trust fund to compensate growers and
allotment holders.
                       Demand for their crop is subsiding in the wake of a
nationwide,
                        $206 bil-

                        See TRUST FUND, Page A5

                        lion settlement that places new restrictions on
tobacco.

                        , 'They are saying that to go ahead and provide some
immediate
                       help, they will go ahead and contribute their 50
percent of the first


                       year's payment,"   said Phil Carlton, the former N.C.
Supreme
                       Court justice who has represented the industry in
the talks.

                       Philip Morris' contribution alone will mean almost
$120 million for
                       North Carolina, which produces more tobacco than any
other
                       state and accounts for about 40 percent of the
domestic-tobacco
                       market.

                       Based on the buying intentions of tobacco companies,
federal
                       officials have announced an 18 percent cut for this
year in
                       allotments for flue-cured tobacco, the main form of
leaf grown in
                       North Carolina.

                       The companies told the government yesterday that
they also intend
                       to buy 31 percent less mountain-grown burley tobacco
next year
                       than they will this year.

                       with the exception of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. --
which
                       contends that it would rather buy more tobacco from
domestic
                       growers than contribute money to a bureaucratic
trust fund
                       other major tobacco companies have endorsed the
trust-fund
                       concept.

                       Carlton will outline how the trust fund will work at
the meeting
                       scheduled to begin Wednesday in Durham.

                       If all the major companies agree to contribute to
the growers' trust
                       fund over the next 10 years, the first year's
payments would total
                       $600 million, Carlton said. If the other companies
follow the same
                       formula that Philip Morris has, he said,   "you could
pay every
                       grower the average profit per pound and every quota
holder the
                       average rent per pound. ' ,

                       OFFICIALS IN EACH tobacco-growing state, however,
will
                       decide how the money is allocated among growers and
allotment
                       holders, Carlton said.

                       N.C. Attorney General Mike Easley, who with seven
.,
     other state
                               attorneys general helped negotiate the $206 billion
     settlement,
                               called Philip Morris' action' 'a good first step in
     the right direction.' ,

                               Easley attributed Philip Morris' action, at least in
     part,   to a
                               resolution signed by the leaders of various grower
     groups last
                               week in support of the trust-fund approach. One
     group had held
                               out for $12 billion in aid for tobacco growers, but
     Easley said that
                               Reynolds' stance helped unite the growers.

                           " I don't think this is designed to pressure
     Reynolds as much as it is
                           a recognition of the necessity of a trust fund,
     given the fact that
                           both burley and flue-cured tobacco have had a cut of
     more than
                           30 percent over the last two years. ' ,

                               Graham Boyd, the executive vice president of the
     Tobacco
                               Growers Association of North Carolina, said he
     expects a
                               favorable reaction from growers.   " I think Philip
     Morris is
                               acknowledging that there is some real legitimate
     need out there for
                               the growers, "   Boyd said.
