TEXT:
Hi there.

So what is the status of the meeting with Erskine, McCaffrey, Shalala, et
al regarding the party line on needle exchange? I have heard through the
grape vine that the General and Shalala have a "principals only" meeting
scheduled for early next week.   If indeed that is true, I wondered if
that would impact the other meeting ..

The AIDS community is absolutely ballistic over ONDCP's comments on the
Family Research Council's press conference last week. They have crawled up
one side of us and down the other and have sent a letter requesting a
meeting with Erskine.

To make bad matters worse, it now appears that Dr. Coburn intends to offer
a negative amendment to the Labor HHS bill next week that either rescinds
the Secretary's waiver authority or bans federal funding for needle
exchange programs altogether. We are checking out the seriousness of that
threat. It is interesting to note, by the way, that the new director of
legislative affairs at FRC is none other than Mrs. Coburn.

If all this good news is true, this little issue of needle exchange might
erupt on us sooner than we had hoped ...... I just thought I ought to give
you and Bruce a heads up.

Am I having fun yet?

Sandy
