TEXT:
HHS is planning to approve TANF plans in Conn, Nevada, Kentucky,
and New Hampshire. They sent me the draft approval letters. Only
Connecticut has any issue raised in it at all. Here's the Conn.
issue as written in the letter:
"You should note that section 415 authority to delay
implementation applies to any waiver 'which relates to the
provision of assistance under a state plan under this part,' i.e.,
title IV-A. Thus, section 415 is not applicable to your title
IV-D waiver regarding the distribution of child support
collections. We will be in touch with you shortly to begin
discussion on achieving a mutually agreed-upon strategy as
described in section 1.2 of your waiver terms and conditions."
I am going to tell John M. we obviously have no comment on the 3
state w/o issues. Elena, let me know how you want to handle
Connecticut.  I will tell Monahan that we need to hear from you on
that.
