     Attached is a comprehensive table on abortion provisions in appropriations
     language that will require policy decisions in order to print the FY 1999
     Budget Appendix. Traditionally, the Budget shows the prior year's (i.e., FY
     1998 enacted) appropriations language, brackets language proposed for deletion,
     and italicizes any new or revised language.

     One issue we need to consider is whether, in light of recent history, again to
     propose deletion of the AID abortion language in the Foreign Ops bill (see page
     4 of the file below). AID is now suggesting we not do so. We would appreciate
     your views, either directly to me or to Ann Kendrall of the Health Division
     staff (who prepared the table).

     Due to the FY 1999 Budget print schedule, we are requesting your views/comments
     on these provisions by noon, Friday, January 9th.  Please let me know by then
     whether or not you agree with the recommendations in the attached file or if
     you think we need to meet on any of these provisions.

     Thanks.

     [Please note:   the file labeled "abortion.wpd" is Corel WordPerfect 7, legal
     size.   In case you have problems with your Core17, I have attached the file
     (abort6.wpd) as a WordPerfect6.1, also legal size.]
