TEXT:
Elena,
I just talked to Peter re: H1B.  He advises that we should be hard one way
or the other on the issue of whether we would agree to raise the cap. He
further advises that if we want to come down hard against it, we should do
it quickly.  In part, as a signal to Dems and to help to kill some of the
momentum for raising the cap, while trying to fo"cus the discussion on the
reforms that we want to push. Peter does not detect a lot of gray on this
issue -- folks are either for or against raising the cap.   However, he had
not heard any intelligence on the Kennedy-Feinstein alternative that will
likely represent a middle position (with reforms and an increase in the
cap.)  He is going to find out what he can about Kennedy and get back to
us.

Also, Tom Kalil has scheduled our meeting with high tech industry for the
week of the 16th of March.  That seems like an eternity.  Should I inquire
more about getting an earlier date?
