TEXT:
As you may know, the VP is speaking to the metro Detroit chapter of the
NAACP this Sunday ... does anyone know of any good and appropriate
deliverables that might be floating around for this one?    (For one thing,
I heard that there might be some good details about our efforts to turn
around failing schools as part of the education accountability plan ... )

Many thanks ...
