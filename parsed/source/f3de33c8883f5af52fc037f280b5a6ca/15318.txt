TEXT:
There will be a short conference call TODAY at 3:45 p.m. to review tobacco
press strategy for tomorrow.  Others on the call will be Melissa
Skolfield, Jim O'Hara, and George Phillips.

Due to the amount of traffic today on the conference lines, I'm still
working with the switchboard to work out the conference lines/codes.  I'll
be sending you another e-mail message to notify you of the code/number you
will use.

Thanks.
