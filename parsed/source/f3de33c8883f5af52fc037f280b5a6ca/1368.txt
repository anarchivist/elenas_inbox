TEXT:
Citing the President's directive to federal agencies, Congresswoman
Eleanor Holmes Norton introduced a bill March 12th which would encourage
Members of the House of Representatives to hire at least one welfare
recipients.  It would do by by allowing Members with now with the maximum
22 staff to hire one more (using the same office budget).  Lyn, I'll give
you a copy of the materials I was sent.
