        Yes, the event is done and it went well;  Chris Cerf did an awesome job
on this one.
        Unfortunately, I have to do some background research for the State of
the Union and Bruce Reed is about to fire me if I don't get it done immediately.
I have to give a speech out of town and my flight leaves at 5:30 -- looks like I
might be cancelling it.
        Do you have anytime on Monday? This thing can't move until you have
everything you need on it, anyways, so I am going to have to tell Rahm that we
are backed up because of me.

        I sent this info to Cathy Russell, too.  She claims that some guy on the
Deputy's staff says that Jurith is right but she was distracted and didn't
remember much about her conversation w/ him.
