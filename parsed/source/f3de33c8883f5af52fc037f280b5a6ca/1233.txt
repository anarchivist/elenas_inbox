TEXT:
I was reading Gov. Whitman's letter more carefully today, and noticed that
all the calculations are based on counting ONLY cash assistance towards
the minimum wage. She says paying the minimum wage for 30 hours a week
will cost NJ $333 per participant more per month.   The HHS data I got
from Elena's files say that if food stamps are counted in paying the
minimum wage:

           NJ could SAVE $67/month for a family of 3
           NJ would SAVE $197/month for a family of 4
           NJ would lose $152/month for a family of 2

Depending on the distribution of the population, New Jersey may not have
to spend more after all. Of course, the state could only make up the loss
for two person families if it cut cash benefits for larger families, .so
those families (even with the subsequent rise in food stamps) would be
worse off.

In any case, we should get ASPE to run numbers based on the actual family
sizes in each state, shouldn't we? Then we can have a total savings or
loss number for each state which we can release if we so chose.   What do
you think?

P.S. Ken -- Bruce asked if someone would check our '94 and '96 bills
requirements re: Fair Labor Standards Act so we can be prepared to answer
the question "Have we changed our policy?"   Could someone on your staff
do that or should I call HHS?
