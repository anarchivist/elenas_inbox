Mike - Joe Lockhart is making remarks on Friday to the NAtional
Association of Independent Colleges and Universities. They are interested
in particular in what this adminitsration is proposing for the coming year
- ie: SOTU/budget issues - to better higher education. Do you have any
fact sheets/materials that you could send to me so i can prepare his
remarks? Are there any items in particular that you feel he should
highlight/emphasize? Thanks
