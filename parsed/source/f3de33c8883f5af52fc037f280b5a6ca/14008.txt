Hi Elena,
I was told that you deal with this issue. Following is a draft (I have faxed
you the incoming) that has been cleared through Jack Klenk, Non-pub. Ed DoEd for
your edits/approval. The language comes from a Sec. Riley speech to a private
education group.  thanks!
Thank you so much for writing to me.  I appreciate your support
on behalf of the Council For American Private Education, and I
have shared your letter with Department of Education Secretary
Riley.
Over the years, our efforts to involve the nation's many
religious groups in the education of children has greatly
expanded. Please be assured that students in public as well as
private and religious colleges are eligible for the tax credits
and deductions for college expenses that my Administration has
proposed. And, as you may know, private school students are
eligible for the Presidential Honors Scholarships.
I firmly believe that we should encourage all our students to
strive for academic excellence. As we continue our efforts to
enhance their educational opportunities, I look forward to your
continued involvement.
