TEXT:

The Ninth Circuit denied our motion for a stay of the district
court's order. Oral argument was extremely harsh and very
problematic; many of the questions directed towards the government
attorney were irrelevant and argumentative (does that sound like
an objection!) and directed towards the Senate's attack on Jim
Lyons and issues already decided (in favor of the government)
related to the contempt motion.
Argument on the appeal is set for the week of Jan. 8th.
The consensus of everyone at Justice is that there is no point in
pursuing a rehearing request. Lois Schiffer is working on a
statement for the press and I'll obviously fax it to you when I
get it.
The consequences of this are that we will begin releasing nearly
230 million board feet of old growth tommorrow morning.  There
will be a dramatic increase in protests, press, criticism of the
administration for signing the bill, etc.

Sorry I don't have better news!
