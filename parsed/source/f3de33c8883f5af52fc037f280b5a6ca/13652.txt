TEXT:
Negotiations between House and Senate conferees on S. 1004, the
Coast Guard Authorization Bill for FY 1996, have been stalled for
several months over a liability provision included in the House
version of the bill.
On March 27 the Department of Transportation sent a letter to
conferees "strongly recommending" that the provision be deleted.
Since then, there has been a lot of activity regarding liability
limitation provisions in other legislation. The Department has
asked us to provide (hopefully, this afternoon) a current reading
on whether the provision would tolerable, even though
objectionable, in an enrolled Coast Guard authorization bill, or
whether it is so objectionable that the President would feel
required to veto the bill.
I will fax the provision to you separately, and will be grateful
for any guidance you can provide. Thanks.
