     DRAFT


     1. Incarceration of juveniles with adults in the federal system

     Under the Administration's proposed legislation, the "Anti-Gang and Youth Violence Act of
     1997", juveniles prosecuted as juveniles could not be housed with adults until they reach age
     18, regardless of the offense. Moreover, no juvenile under age 16 who has been charged or
     convicted as an adult can be housed with an adult under the proposed bill. Juveniles prosecuted
     as adults can be housed with adults after they reach the age of 16, at the discretion of the Bureau
     of Prisons.

     As juveniles have become increasingly violent, housing dangerous juveniles with other juveniles
     can endanger younger, and sometimes more vulnerable, delinquents. The Administration
     believes it is more appropriate to give federal prison authorities the ability to be flexible
     depending upon the needs of the individual defendant.


     II. Prosecution of more juveniles as adults

     The current process for determining whether a juvenile will be prosecuted as an adult or as a
     juvenile is often highly unpredictable and fraught with delay. This is unduly burdensome on
     victims, witnesses and the court system.

     Whereas the Administration's bill does not add any new offenses for which a juvenile can be
     charged in federal court, it does expand the circumstances where a juvenile can be charged as an
     adult by giving federal prosecutors the discretion to transfer juvenile offenders to adult criminal
     court. It should be noted that except for the most serious juvenile offenders, age 16 and older,
     juveniles charged as adults may petition the court to be tried as juveniles rather than adults.


     III. More mandatory minimum sentences for juveniles

     The Administration's legislation increases mandatory minimum sentences from one year to three
     years for three narrowly targeted crimes: selling drugs to minors; using minors to distribute
     drugs; and trafficking drugs in or near a school or other protected location. The Administration
     believes that the proposed increases are necessary to punish persons who endanger children by
     selling illegal drugs to them, or employ or otherwise use them in their drug trade, and to deter
     others from engaging in such reprehensible and dangerous conduct.

     Under the Administration's proposal, judges sentencing youths aged 13 to IS-years old who are
     convicted in adult court and do not have previous serious violent felony or serious drug offense
     convictions may sentence them as juveniles-- avoiding mandatory minimum penalties entirely.

     IV. Availability of public records
The Administration's bill contains important protections for the rights of victims, including the
victims of crimes committed by juvenile offenders. The bill clarifies current law by extending
to victims of juvenile offenders the right to information about the juvenile proceeding that they
might need or be entitled to under state or federal law. For example, victims would be able find
out about the status of the proceedings, or the release status of the offender. Fingerprints and
photographs of adjudicated delinquents found to have committed the equivalent of an adult
felony offense or a federal gun offense would be sent to the FBI and made available in the same
manner as those of adult defendants.

The Administration believes these changes represent a fair balance between maintaining
important protections for juveniles and expanding the information available to their victims.
