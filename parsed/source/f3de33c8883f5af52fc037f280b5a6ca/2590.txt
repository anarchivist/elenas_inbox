    Additional Questions on the Test

    Q: Will children with disabilities and limited English proficiency be induded in these tests?

    A: Yes. We want to make sure that students with disabilities and students with limited English
    will be able to take the test whenever possible. This means that we will provide the math test in
    Spanish. It also means that when the tests are administered, schools would provide
    accommodations that students need such as extended response time for students with disabilities
    or access to an English dictionary for the math test for students with limited English
    proficiency.

    Q: Why is the math test being given in English and Spanish but the reading test is only being given
    in English?

    A: Developing the ability to read in English is a basic skill that every child must have to succeed
    in American schools and society. However, there are many recent immigrants at the 8th grade
    level who may not speak English well but who can do advanced math and should be asked to
    show what math they know. We are providing a bilingual math test in Spanish and English
    because Spanish is the most common language other than English among students.

    Q: Will you allow kids to use calculators on the new tests? Shouldn't kids know their multiplication
    tables on their own and not rely on calculators?

    A: Kids should learn the basics. They should know how to add, subtract, multiply and divide
    without using a calculator. However, after a child has mastered the basics, calculators can be a
    useful tool for solving complicated math problemslearning more difficult mathematics. After a
    child has mastered arithmetic, hopefully by the end of fourth or fifth grade, calculators can be
    useful for solving complicated math problems. As part of the test development process, an
    advisory committe of outstanding math teachers and other experts will be considering this issue.
