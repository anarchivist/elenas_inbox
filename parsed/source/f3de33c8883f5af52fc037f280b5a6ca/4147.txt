TEXT:
Elena: At the August 25 senior staff meeting you mentioned (according to
the OSTP rep. at the meeting) that a second draft of a memo on educational
standards is currently circulating to certain offices and people in the
EOP. As you may know, we have been working closely with NSF and Do Ed on
science and math standards and therefore would be very interested in what
this memo is all about.  Can you fill me in on this? Can I see a copy of
the memo, if appropriate? Thanks, Cliff
