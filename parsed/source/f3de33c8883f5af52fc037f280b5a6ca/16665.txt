TEXT:
Mary Bourdette and Janet Murguia want to get together to look at the list
of members of Congress who have been very involved in child care and see
how big a list it is and brainstorm about how to involve them and/or
prioritize who to invite.  Janet's assistant will call us about a Monday
or Tuesday meeting.
