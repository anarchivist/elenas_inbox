TEXT:
The President's Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS will be meeting at the
Madison Hotel from Sunday, March 15 - Wednesday, March 18, 1998.  If you
need to get a hold of me, you can do so several ways:

632-1204 - office voice mail - I will be checking regularly
632-1090 - office receptionist - I will check often
