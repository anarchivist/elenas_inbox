TEXT:
One annoucement we could think about is having the President set up an
adivsory group to coordinate federal, state, & local programs and farm
organizations as tobacco legislation is implemented.    Glickman could
chair it, and request the various Governors to designate local leaders who
could meet in DC and help implement whatever legislation is passed.  The
bill will obviously have a tremendous effect on some communities and he
might send a message that the communities will not be left powerless, but
have a role in how transition money is spent.

As we think about what the President could do in KY it may be of interest
that he has previously been invited to come to KY by an activist group
for a farm summit with tobacco farmers.   (clinton met with the group as
part of his small farmers meetings -- they are a little lefty).  I've left
their material with Cynthia.
