As most of you know, the President is returning to Jupiter, Florida on
October 31 to visit the Elementary School he was supposed to go to when he
broke his knee. We need to determine what message event we will do at the
school. Originally we were going.to do school construction. After our
meeting yesterday with Erskine, it seems unlikely that we are going to be
ready to endorse any kind of school construction proposal by 10/31 -- so I
guess we need another message. Everyone should be aware, however, that
the school is overcrowded with many students attending classes in
trailers, so school construction is likely to be raised as an issue
whether we like it or not.

NEC -- is it clear that school construction is not an option?

DPC/NEC -- if so, do you have other suggestions?

Thanks.
