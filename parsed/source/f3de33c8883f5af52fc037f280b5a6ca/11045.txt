We are on top of this.   This has gone through Bruce, Larry Stein, and John
Podesta.

We are advising Mississippi that we may have a small amount of flexibility
on the crowd out issue, but will not change the timeframe that kids have
to be without insurance to be eligible.  Preliminary feedback was that the
state might find this to be acceptable; if they do not, however, we have
decided that we cannot move anymore without needing to change the
crowd-out policy that every CHIP program to date has had to comply with.
(For this reason, we have decided not to give everything the state wants.)

HHS, Leg Affairs, and OMB seem fine with this.   I am assuming that HHS has
their interegovernmental affairs people well integrated. However, as is
obviously the case, this is more of a Lott problem than anything else and
Rich T. is on top of it.  I asked Jeanne Lambrew to notify Fred D. of
these facts.  If he has any other questions, perhaps he might want to call
me directly.
