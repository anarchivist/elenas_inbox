TEXT:
I take the following implications:

 1. the more we tell people about what the President wants, the more
popular the legislation,
 2. people want us actively engaged in trying to get a deal-- their
argument that we are playing politics has some effect,
 3. over the long haul, they are at an important disadvantage on who is
in the pocket of the industry.

am I misinterpreting?
