Tobacco Legislative Developments

        Chainnan Bliley released 834 previously secret documents this week detailing
communications between tobacco industry lawyers and scientists. The documents span several
decades, and while no smoking gun has been found, they detail extraordinary efforts by the
industry to create scientific data to blur the connection between smoking and disease. Critics like
Rep. Waxman have said the documents will make it more difficult for Congress to give the
industry immunity from lawsuits. Senator McCain has announced his intention to seek more
secret documents.
        DPC has been working with members of Congress to encourage the development of
comprehensive tobacco legislation, meeting with Rep. Bliley, Rep. Waxman, Senator Kennedy,
Senator Hatch and staff from Senators Nickles, Comad and Daschle. We have offered agency
technical assistance to members involved in the drafting oflegislation. Among others, Treasury
has provided assistance in financial projections, HHS and FDA have briefed staff on issues of
FDA jurisdiction, and OSHA has briefed Senate staff on questions of second-hand smoke.
Senator Nickles has asked committees involved in tobacco legislation to have work completed by
March 16, 1998. Senators Comad and Daschle are attempting to create a bill which could have
support from the entire Democratic caucus. Republicans have urged that the State of the Union
speech strike a bi-partisan tone as regards tobacco legislation, noting Republican fears that the
Administration is not interested in passing a bill but simply in using the issue as a political
weapon. Some Democratic members continue to argue for a hard-line in order to improve
bargaining position. In particular, Democrats urge the Administration not promise immunity for
the industry until all other significant issues have been resolved. We believe that a middle
approach continues to be appropriate, stressing our genuine commitment to passing bipartisan
legislation, but reminding the American people of your leadership on this issue and the urgent
need for legislation with tough measures to force the industry to reduce teen smoking.
