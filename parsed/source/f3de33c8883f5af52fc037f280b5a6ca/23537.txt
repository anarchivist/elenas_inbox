TEXT:
Here is the language that we (NEC, OMB, CEA, Commerce, EEOC, Labor, and
the VP's office) and the women's groups have signed off on.  Unless you
have a problem with it, I am going to give it to Daschle's office and let
them know they can put this in the bill. Thanks, Mary


Revised Pay Information Provision   (S.71 in 105th)

Sec. 4 COLLECTION OF PAY INFORMATION BY THE EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY
COMMISSION.

        Section 709 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e-4) is
amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:

        0&(1) The Commission shall, not more than 18 months following the
enactment into law of this subsection:


A. Complete a survey of data that is currently available to the federal
government relating to employee pay information for use in the enforcement
of the federal laws prohibiting pay discrimination and, and in
consultation with other relevant federal agencies, identify additional
data collections that will enhance enforcement of these laws, and

B. After consideration of this study and consultation with other relevant
federal agencies, by regulation provide for the collection of pay
information data from employers described by the sex, race, and national
origin of employees.

        (2) In implementing Section (1), the primary factor the Commission
shall consider is the most effective and efficient means for enhancing the
enforcement of the federal laws prohibiting pay discrimination.  The
Commission shall also consider other factors including:  imposition of
burden on employers; the frequency of reports including which employers
should be required to prepare reports; appropriate protections for
maintaining data confidentiality; and the most effective format of the
report for data collection.

        (3) There are authorized to be appropriated up to $2 million to
implement this section.
