TEXT:
We're re-instituting the process and want to ask people as we go along
what is most helpful. So far the goal is :
    Talking points 2x weekly (Monday and Thursday)
      One.pager (less rhetoric than previously)   with this info:
                What the President is doing;
                 What policies/actions he inititates;
                 The talking points/message for the policy or action.

    As for distribution: I am told that "Angus has the program on his
computer " that got it out and we have been using that system. I  hope to
have more details about this soon.
