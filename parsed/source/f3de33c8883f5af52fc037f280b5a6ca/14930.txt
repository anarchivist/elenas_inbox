          Subject: IL Senate backs anti-gay partner measure

                  SPRINGFIELD, Ill., March 18 (UPI) -- The Illinois Senate supported
          a measure requiring municipalities that try to extend government employee
          health benefits to the domestic partners of homosexual city employees to
          provide them to the unmarried partners of heterosexual employees as well.

                  By a 40-10 vote, the Senate Tuesday gave final approval to a
          measure by state Sen. Walter Dudycz, R-Chicago, requiring all unmarried
          partners to get full benefits.

                  Dudycz' measure was inspired because Chicago city government is
          considering a measure extending the benefits to the gay partners of city
          employees. Chicago Mayor Richard Daley backs the measure.

                  But Dudycz does not. On Tuesday, he told his Senate colleagues he
          thinks it is illegal to provide medical benefits to only some 'unmarried
          partners of city employees.

                  Privately, Dudycz admits his measure is a reaction to Chicago city
          government, claiming he thinks their action -- which has yet to be voted
          on by the full City Council -- "undermines the sanctity of marriage. ' ,

                  Daley has said he opposes the state's action, saying that it would
          cost the city too much money to provide full benefits to all unmarried
          partners, although city officials cannot offer a specific dollar amount.

                  The measure, which now goes to the Illinois House where it faces
          an uncertain future, also is opposed by the American Civil Liberties
          Union.
