TEXT:
        The House Constitution Subcommittee reported out RLPA this
afternoon on a voice vote. Nadler offered an amendment, which would have
limited housing-related claims to small landlords and employment-related
claims to religious organizations and very small employers. It would also
have created an exception for claims relating to laws barring
discrimination in a public accommodation. His amendment was defeated on a
voice vote. All the D's appeared to vote for the Nadler amendment and
against final passage, and all the R's appeared to do the opposite. It
will probably go to the full committee after next week's recess.
