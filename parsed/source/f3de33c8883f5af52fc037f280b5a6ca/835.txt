Elena -

I just spoke with Jack Gibbons about this morning's meeting and, in doing
so, mentioned that you had read a list of combined DPC/NEC issue areas for
cabinet agency consideration in advance of the DPC and NEC meetings later
this week.

Jack said he would like to see a copy of the list as we move in the
direction of a unified list per yesterday's 5pm meeting.  I had jotted
down the issues that were directly relevant to us (i.e., science and
technology), but I did not take down the whole list. Accordingly, I would
appreciate it if you would fax, e-mail, or send the whole list my way.  My
fax number is 66049, my room number is 428.5, or call me at 62735 and I'll
send someone over to pick up a copy.

Thanks.

                                                Jon
