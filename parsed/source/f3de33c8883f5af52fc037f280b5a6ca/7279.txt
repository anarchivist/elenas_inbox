TEXT:
Jim O'Hara recommended that we use a quote in the President's speech from
a 1980s RJR document which states that they should begin targeting
young-adult Blacks and Hispanics through aggressive advertising
campaigns. We found at least one good quote, and we could probably find
others, (ie, "Younger adult Hispanic and Black smokers should be key RJR
targets ... [and] heavy-up advertising in selected media are likely to be
beneficial against younger adult Black smokers, based on Newport/Kook
history." )

The problem is that the document clearly states that it targets young
adults age 18 and older.   Even if a younger market is implied, CR and I
believe that under these circumstances we should not use the quote,
because the pitfalls outweigh the benefits. Do you agree?
