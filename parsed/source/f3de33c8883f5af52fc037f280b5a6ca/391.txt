TEXT:
This is a note to explain what you'll be walking into at 11
on Tuesday w/HHS and HCFA. The issue in question is very heavily
legal -- and a big deal politically.   I have told HHS that I see
this meeting as a chance for us (me, OMB, and particularly you} to
get up to speed on this issue, prior to HHS making a decision on a
legal interpretation.
Here's the issue:   one of our proudest achievements in welfare
reform was protecting Medicaid.   That protection is contained in
section 1931 (a) and (b) of the bill, and it says that states have
to 'continue to do eligibility as they did in July 1996 for
Medicaid purposes, and not continue to link Medicaid to welfare.
A provision was added that was supposedly intended to give states
a bit more flexibility -- section 1931(d). But the fear is that
through what mayor may not be faulty drafting, that provision
could essentially gut the Medicaid protection, at least in certain
states.
1931(d} was supposedly intended, according to the advocates, to
let states deviate sl·ightly from eligibility standards by
continuing parts of their waivers.   But it can also be read as a
SUBSTITUTE for 1931(b}, which creates the issue.
