Penalties

       The settlement sets ambitious targets for reductions in teen smoking of 30% in 5 years,
50% in 7 years, and 60% in 10 years. The most recent data show underage prevalence at 18.2%
in 1996, which means approximately 3.5 million youths aged 13-17 are daily smokers.
Because the settlement targets are based on youth prevalence over the past decade, which has
averaged 15.2%, the declines from current levels necessary to comply with the agreement would
have to be 42% over 5 years, 58% over 7, and 67% over 10.

        It is extremely difficult to predict how much teen smoking would decline under the
settlement. While teen smokers are particularly sensitive to price -- Treasury has assumed that a
price increase of 10% will reduce youth prevalence by 7% (compared to 2.6% for adults), and
some studies suggest youth smoking will drop as much as 12% for every 10% increase in price--
we have never had a price shock of this magnitude. The Treasury Department estimates that the
combined price rise from the current settlement and the 15-cent excise tax increase in the budget
agreement would be about 80 cents by year 5, resulting in a 20-25% decrease from current youth
smoking levels -- still well short of the settlement targets. Restrictions on access and advertising
should reduce youth smoking still further, but no one can say how much.

        Under the settlement, companies would have to pay $80 million for each percentage point
they fall short, which is supposed to recapture the industry'S projected profits from hooking that
many young smokers. (The Treasury Department says a more accurate projection of profits
would be $60 million a point, which is roughly equal to $80 million after taxes.) Public health
groups have praised the idea of targets and penalties, but complain that the current scheme does
not give companies sufficient incentive to stop hooking teenagers. The major criticisms against
the current penalties are that they are tax-deductible, abatable, capped at $2 billion in a given
year, and too small to serve as a deterrent.

       The companies might accept penalties of$80 million a point that were not tax-deductible
and could not be abated. They say they are unwilling to increase the price per point or to
eliminate the $2 billion annual cap.

         We recommend a two-tier system, with graduated penalties that get stiffer ifthe industry
misses the targets by a substantial margin. For example, the first tier of penalties could require
companies to pay $80 million per point if the industry missed the targets by less than 5 points in
year 5, less than 10 points in year 7, and less than 15 points in year 10. This penalty would be
non-deductible, could not be abated, and would reflect a company's share of the youth market.
If the industry missed by a greater margin, companies would pay the full first-tier penalty, and a
non-deductible second-tier penalty that represented a larger multiple of profits and rose over time
-- e.g., $ _ million a point in year 5, $ _ million a point in year 7, $ _ million a point in year
10. Companies could be required to lock in this second-tier penalty as a permanent price
increase that would help further reduce smoking by youth (and adults). Under this approach, the
penalties could reach as high as _ cents a pack by year 10 if youth smoking failed to decline.
                                                                           Hex-tlump Conversion
Farmers

       We have made clear that tobacco farmers should receive protection in any legislative
settlement, and that the Administration will work closely with members of Congress from
tobacco states to forge a consensus. Secretary Glickman has traveled to tobacco markets in
Virginia and North Carolina to express this commitment directly to farmers.

        Farmers are primarily interested in continuation of the governmental tobacco program,
guaranteed purchase at set levels of tobacco crops by cigarette companies, and some provision
for buyout and transition to other crops, on a voluntary basis. Farm groups and tobacco state
members have not yet coalesced around a consensus proposal. One plan put forward this month
by Senators Ford and McConnell would require companies to buy a minimum amount of
domestic tobacco over 25 years and would install penalties on companies that do not meet the
stated goals for tobacco buying. The proposal would also create a "Tobacco Community
Revitalization Fund" administered by USDA, but not subject to the appropriation process, which
could spend up to $1 billion a year for 25 years from the settlement fund. This Revitalization
Fund would cover costs related to the tobacco program such as administration and crop
insurance, make supplemental payments of up to $500 million to producers whose income from
tobacco drops substantially below the 1996 level, .pay up to $100 million in benefits for displaced
cigarette factory workers, and provide up to $250 million a year for rural economic development
grants.

       The best way to address this issue is to secure an agreement from the companies to
maintain current purchases of domestic leaf, even if domestic consumption declines. Because of
GATT, Congress cannot require companies to purchase a set level of domestic tobacco.
However, a private contract between growers and the industry would probably not trigger a
GATT violation.


Funding

         Although the settlement is advertised at $368.5 billion, a variety of factors conspire to
leave us with considerably less than that to spend on any new initiatives. The $368 billion is a
25-year number, and must be adjusted downward to reflect a projected drop in cigarette
consumption of about 15%. For scoring purposes, OMB adjusts the amount down still further to
reflect lost business tax revenue and lost federal excise tax revenue from decreased consumption.
 Most of the rest of the money in the settlement is already spoken for, to pay for civil suits,
cessation programs, counteradvertising, and the states' Medicaid claims.

        At current funding levels, the main decision to be made is how best to spend the $25
billion research trust fund, which could serve as a 21 st Century Research Fund dedicated to
cancer and other tobacco-related research.

       Additional funds could be raised by:
                                                                            Hex-Uurnp Conversion

         1) Eliminating the $50 billion tax credit in the budget agreement. This would increase
the 25-year number from $368 billion to $430 billion, and free up about $2 billion a year for new
initiatives. That money could be used to double tobacco-related illness research ($1.3 billion per
year) and make targeted investments in tobacco-related public health initiatives such as
school-based clincis, Healthy Start programs, cancer prevention, and substance abuse treatment.
All your advisers support this option.

         2) Strengthening the penalties for failing to reduce teen smoking. The current penalties
generate about $25 <ck> billion over 25 years, all of which goes to the states to expand
anti-smoking efforts. A graduated penalty scheme could increase the 25-year number to $ _
billion, which could be evenly divided between the states and the federal government. This
would generate $_ billion a year beginning in year 5, which could be dedicated to additional
research and/or coverage expansions, such as allowing people between ages 55 and 65 to buy
into Medicare ($2-4 billion per year); covering workers between jobs ($2-3 billion per year) and
Medicaid outreach ($500 million to $1 billion per year). DPC, HHS, NEC, and Treasury all
support this approach.

        3) Increasing the industry's upfront one-time payment, from $10 billion to $30 billion,
and indexing the inflation adjuster to GDP rather than CPI (since GDP is more in line with
medical cost growth). This would increase the 25-year number to $ _ billion, and generate $_
billion a year, which could be used for any of the initiatives outlined above, other investments
such as child care ($500 million to $1 billion per year) or medical education for doctors training
in children's hospitals ($300 million per year), or deficit reduction (offsetting lost federal excise
tax revenue from declining cigarette sales). Treasury supports this approach.

        The industry will vehemently resist any effort to move beyond current funding levels.
The most outspoken tobacco opponents, such as Senator Kennedy and Skip Humphrey, have
called for a 25-year number in the range of$600-800 billion. Rep. Waxman and David Kessler
would like to see a $1.50 a pack increase, which would require $900 billion over 25 years
(although it could also be achieved by combining current base payments with enhanced penalties
of about 90 cents a pack).
