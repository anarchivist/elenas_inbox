     Attached is a first cut at report language explaining the essence of what
     we've agreed to, trying to make it acceptable to Goodling. I'm still
     working on language for the caucuses.   What do you think?==================== ATTACH

National Testing                                                     Automated Records Management System
                                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion

        Managers (Goodling???) and the Administration agree that it is important to have high,
voluntary national standards in the basic skills of reading and math, and to measure whether
                                                                                                           )
students are meeting these standards, and to provide that information to students, parents and
teachers.. The Administration has proposed voluntary national tests in order to measure student
achievement related to national standards. However, every state already administers a number
oftests, and many are concerned that an additional, national, test would be an unnecessary
burden ..

         To address this concern, the National Academy of Sciences will be commissioned to
conduct a study of the feasibility of equating existing state and commercially available tests with
each other and with the National Assessment of Educational Progress. The purpose of this study
is to determine whether it will be possible to use existing tests administered by states and local
school districts, to compare individual student performance with existing, challenging national
content and performance standards. The purpose is also to determine if the same tests can be
used to compare the performance of students in different states and communities, on different
tests, to each other. The NAS shall report the results of this study to (          ) no later than
June 30, 1997.

        The NAS will conduct this study in consultation with the National Governors'
Association (NGA), the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL), NAGB, the
Congress and the White House. While the NAS study is being conducted, NAGB will oversee
the development of voluntary national tests in 4th grade reading and 8th grade math, which will
be based on the same content and performance standards as are used for NAEP, and which are
linked to NAEP to the maximum extent possible. However, no pilot testing of items for the
national test may be conducted until the NAS report is delivered as scheduled on June 30, 1997.

        The Administration and the Congress (House Committee???) will work together to
incorporate the findings from the NAS study into the reauthorization ofNAEP and NAGB. The
Administration agrees that, where it is feasible and practical to validly and reliably equate test
scores and link performance levels on State assessments and commercially available standardized
tests with the National Assessment of Education Progress, than these tests are a suitable
substitute for its proposed national test. To the extent that NAS study demonstrates ways in
which existing tests can be equated with each other and with NAEP, or ways in which existing
tests can be modified in order to facilitate such equating, the Administration and (the House
Committee?) intend to work together to implement these recommendations through the
reauthorization ofNAEP.

       [Do we want/need to say something about Goodling's point that the committee will give
President opportunity to have our testing proposal considered during the NAEP reauthorization?}
