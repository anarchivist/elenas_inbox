TEXT:
I am leaving tonight to go to New York for part of the weekend.  I will
have a skypager with me, and SIGNAL has both that number and the number
where I will be staying.  I am planning to return to DC between 2:00pm and
3:00pm on Sunday afternoon.

Our current plan for paper on Monday's Firefighter's Event is this:
Devorah has the complete briefing paper, minus the background info. that
will come from the press paper. She will page you on Sunday morning when
she has the completed draft of both the press paper and the briefing
paper. You can page either me or Devorah when you have the edits, and we
will make them so the briefing paper can be turned into Staff Secretary by
4:00PM on Sunday and so we can distribute the press paper.

please feel free to page me if you have ANY questions, or if you would
like us to do this differently.

Thank you.
