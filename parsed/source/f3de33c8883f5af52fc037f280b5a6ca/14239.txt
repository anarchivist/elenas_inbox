TEXT:
Looks like I have roped HCFA (Sally Richardson) into coming over
here this Tuesday 10/15 at 11am in room 211 to talk about this
waiver issue (1931 b vs d). This is a major issue Hcfa is still
working on, but the implications are so great that I have told
them they must talk to us DURING their deliberation process, not
after.
I really hope you guys can make it at that time.  If I can't have
Elena and enough OMB representation, I will have to reschedule.
By the way, HCFA's concern that 1931{d) reads out of existence the
protection of the Medicaid program that we thought we had secured
is so great that they are already talking to the Hill and some
advocates on this.  I was talking to Chafee's person today on
something else, and she bent my ear on this. She said she was
appalled that HCFA's lawyers were even considering reading the law
in such a way.
I have told HHS not to spread alarm and panic on this until we
know more; they say they are fairly certain there is a major issue
here and they need to be talking to the Hill about Congressional
intent. However, we agreed that they should not be giving any
interpretation of the law to outsiders at this time.
