I think the adoption bill is finalized, with change in the language to
make more broad the use of the bonus dollars, as discussed on today's
conference call.

I have alerted the Department of the Interior that OMB does not plan to
address its concerns with the adoption bonus language that is included in
the balanced budget bill.  Interior will not appeal the OMB decision.
