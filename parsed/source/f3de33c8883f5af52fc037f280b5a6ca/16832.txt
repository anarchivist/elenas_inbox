     TEXT:
     Bill White of Public Liaison is trying to get OMB to agree to a big
     increase in ADA enforcement in advance of the budget -- I doubt he'll
     succeed. The attached talking points were done by Liz Savage at DOJ as a
     first draft for the meeting; I have some concerns/questions about them
     that I have to figure out.

     We should catch up on the status of this meeting -- I don't know how
     involved you want to be. The topics are Medicaid home and community-based
     services, the ADA, IDEA, children's SSI, and employment. Most of the work
     is centered on Medicaid, and Chris J. and I are having a meeting on that
     this morning (I mentioned this to Laura). But the other 4 topics also
     need work; I am pushing for a premeeting on those 4 in addition to the
     Medicaid meeting we are having this morning.

     On the disability executive order, we are meeting on Thursday, by the way,
     but I don't think it can come up at the President meeting.

     Subject:         POTUS Meeting - ADA Enforcement

     Thanks for listening to my plea this morning.  It would make a great
     impact if the President could state at this Wednesday's disability meeting
     that we will call for a 19% (which is only $2 million) increase in funding
     for ADA Enforcement in our FY99 DOJ Budget request.  Please see the
     attached proposed talking points.  Thanks.

     ADA ENFORCEMENT

     o       Vigorous enforcement of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)
     has been a top priority of my Administration.  The Justice Department, the
     EEOC and other federal agencies have established aggressive enforcement
     programs. We have emphasized voluntary compliance, but have not been
     afraid to litigate when entities fail to comply with the law.

o       Although we have been quite successful, we all know we have a
long way to go. All of you are all too familiar with the backlogs at the
Justice Department and the EEOC. We all know that our resources are not
sufficient to address the majority of meritorious complaints
received.

o       My budgets have consistently called for an increase for ADA
enforcement at the Department of Justice. However, the.Congress has failed
to approve these increases.

                       FY 1998: 5%  ($477,000)
                               FY 1997: 3.9% ($361,000)

(MICHAEL, THE NEXT TALKING POINT IS THE ONE WE WOULD LIKE TO MAKE
STRONGER. )

o       We are considering a proposal to significantly increase ADA
enforcement resources in the FY 1999 budget I will submit to Congress
early next year. (DOJ*s OMB request calls for a 19% increase ($2,173,000).

o        Members of both houses of Congress have said they will never
weaken the ADA.   (As Senator Hutchinson (R-AR) recently told a reporter
* [P)oliticians see it as political nitroglycerin ... They*re afraid to
handle it, afraid to touch it.*)

o       By failing to adopt my proposals for very limited increases to
already limited enforcement budgets, they have indirectly weakened the law.

o       The ADA became law because your organizations, both nationally
and at the grassroots level, worked together to educate the Congress on
why the law was urgently needed.  You won because you were well-organized
and persistent.   Obtaining increases for ADA enforcement will require a
similar effort.
