FYI.  I don't know if this is helpful or not, but Olsen at USDA just left
me a message saying two things: he thought CSPI (the consumer group) was
suspicious about HACCP for fruits and veggies because they weren't ready
and that farmers would be nervous about it too. If you are getting
pressure for a very rigorous program this would argue for some caution
because of domestic concerns.  Hope things are going fine. Tom
