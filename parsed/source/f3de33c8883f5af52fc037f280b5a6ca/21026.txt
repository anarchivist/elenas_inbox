TEXT:
(1) What does the INS think? The INS participated in earlier conference
calls on this issue, and said they would be unlikely to use the
information reported to them because of other priorities (such as tracking
undocumented criminals) but would not be able to say this publicly. Thus
they would be comfortable not receiving this information.

 (2) Do the Medicaid applications ask immigration status? Yes.   I now have
a bad fax of the county's application form which is used for Cal-WORKS
(TANF) , General Relief, Food Stamps, and Medi-Cal (Medicaid).

(3) Could the form be re-done to make the immigration questions optional
for those applying only on behalf of children but still requiring them for
other applicants? USDA staff think yes -- they had been thinking more
broadly (about having the question dropped for all) but think on the staff
level the more narrow approach would be fine.

 (4) How is a Food Stamp household defined? What happens when some family
members are ineligible? A household is a group of people that "purchase
and prepare food together." More than one such household could live under
one roof (if a border prepares his own food or two separate families live
together but purchase food separately). To determine eligibility, the
Food Stamp program obtains income information on the entire household and
then excludes a pro-rated amount for ineligible members.  For example, if
a family had $1,000 monthly income and 5 family members, two of whom were
ineligible, then USDA would base Food Stamp eligibility on 3/5 of $1,000
or $600 in monthly income available to the three eligible family members.

(5) Can an illegal immigrant whose deportation be stayed get benefits?
This was true before the 1996 law, but is no longer.

(6) How quickly could a regulation be developed? A very narrow proposed
regulation, addressing this particular problem, could be done in a month,
if there was high level commitment to move forward.

 (7) Are there other jurisdictions asking for this information? Not that
USDA knows.   I will check with advocates if you think appropriate, and
with the INS.   Advocates have said in the past they've heard rumours that
Massachusetts, Minnesota, and the Carolinas may take action akin to San
Diego's, but that does not answer the question of which jurisdictions are
collecting immigrant status information and which are reporting it to the
INS.

      (8) Where is Sect. Glickman? He supports sending a letter and developing
     a regulation to prevent the chilling effect that this action may have on
     citizen children's obtaining of benefits.
