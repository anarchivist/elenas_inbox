Elena--

On the outside chance that you're checking your e-mail this fine Memorial
Day, I want to make sure we get the FTC letter as soon as possible.  The
event is tomorrow at 11:30; if you want the letter to be ready by then, we
need to get it soon.

I'll page you later today if I don't hear from you.

--David
