 I need your input on several areas of child support enforcement:

 1.      Raines Child Support Idea

 I've spoken with OMB at greater length about this issue. Attached is an
 analysis of the options and what I see as their advantages and
 disadvantages.  My questions are:

 a.)  Do you agree that we should oppose including these options in the
 budget?
 I do oppose converting to a block grant    but I do think a version Keith
 and I devised
 ("revised match") may be worth pursuing    see attached.

 b.) Should we should have a broader process to consider them i.e., a
 DPC-OMB-IGA-NEC mtg? I do, because I fear that unless people understand
 what these policies do, they will be tempted simply by the prospect of a
 $1.8 to $3.0 billion saver.

 2.       Child Support Computer Systems Penalty Legislation

 As you know; I have brought NEC, HHS, and OMB together several times since
 September to discuss the child support computer systems situation and
 possible solutions. Many of the issues are analogous to the penalty
 issues we discussed in the TANF regulations. With some pushing from me
 and from OMB, HHS now agrees that a new penalty structure should include:

         1) Penalties that are simple to adminster and automatic, with
 little HHS discretion.
         2) An up-front penalty imposed immediately upon failure, which
 should be large enough to motivate states to improve their systems
 development, but not so large as to severely disrupt states' child support
 efforts or to lead states to believe the penalty would never be imposed.
         3)  The penalties should include an incentive for early
 completion, either by providing an earn-back of the initial penalty or by
 imposing subsequent incremental penalties, or both.


        4) A "system completion plan" should be signed by the governor.
        5) HHS should retain the ability to disapprove the state child
support plan and withhold all federal child support funds.

HHS has prepared several, more detailed options based on these
principles. We have not authorized HHS to share any of these options with
the Hill because 1) we hadn't run them up the flagpole; 2) Haskins offered
to take a first cut at drafting and to send it to us for our reaction.
Monahan and others from HHS have met with Haskins and company to provide
background information on the problem and to share our general principles
(mainly to tell Ron -- much to his surprise -- that we think giving HHS a
lot of discretion is a bad idea) .

Do you think we should be taking a more pro-active approach?   Any
comments/ suggestions?

You should know that we will have a delicate line to walk in our budget,
even without including the new Raines idea. Here's why.    If the budget
assumes we will withhold all federal child support funds from states
without computer systems, it will show child support savings, giving any
legislative fix a cost -- not what we want.  If the budget assumes no
savings from denying funds to states without computer systems, then we
have to explain why this doesn't fit with our "get tough" rhetoric.   The
answer will have to hinge on the length of the administrative and judicial
appeal process (up to three years) with an assumption that by the end of
those three years all states will have in place the required state wide
computer systems.

3.   Response to Senator Feinstein

As you may recall, Senator Feinstein raised the idea of a six month
moratorium on child support penalties when she met with the President on
crime issues in September, and then she subsequently sent him a letter.   I
wanted to wait until the end of the session to reply to her .... and
finally I've drafted the attached.  I think similar language can be used
in replies to Rep. Clay Shaw (who sent a letter to the President arguing
against Feinstein) and to the LA County Board of Supervisors (who sent a
letter making the same arguments as Feinstein).  please comment on this
version, and then I will send·a revised copy with the incoming letters to
you via Cathy.


4.   California Letter

On November 20th, California and Lockheed Martin mutually decided to
cancel their child support computer systems contract due to operational
problems and cost overruns. This puts the state out of compliance with
what is called the Advance Planning Document -- the plan that the state
submits to HHS for approval in order to get federal funds to help pay for
the computer systems costs.   HHS has drafted a letter from one of their
OCSE staff to the state saying that the feds will not pay for any more
computer systems development until the state submits, and has approved, a
new Advanced Planning Document.  (The rest of federal financial support
for child support enforcement will continue to be provided.) Although this
letter is from a mid-level staffer, I reviewed it for content and tone and
plan to show it to Emily, before telling HHS they can send it.  It is in
unquotable bureaucratize.   Should I do anything else? I need to respond
to HHS Monday.

Keep in mind that this letter is particular to California, because of its


problems with its contractor.  However, after January 1, HHS will need to
send to all the states that do not have operating statewide computer
systems a notice of intent to disapprove their child support enforcement
plans. As you know, states without approved state plans get no federal
child support dollars of any kind.  However, states will continue to
receive federal funds until the appeal process is concluded, which could
last until 1999 (longer for judicial appeals) .

5.   Thompson Idea

What did you think of Gov. Thompson's idea that he and Carper and you
should barnstorm the country on child support enforcement? I kind of like
the idea .... I think we do need to pump up the volume on this issue.
Should I t~y to flesh out an idea for a campaign that could be a
bipartisan State of the Union announcement? ==================== ATTACHMENT       1

Senator Dianne Feinstein
United States Senate
Washington, DC 20510

Dear Senator Feinstein,

         Thank you for sharing your proposal for a six month moratorium on the penalties for
states that failed to have effective child support enforcement automated systems in place by
October 1st.

        States have had nine years to develop these computer systems, and although some states
have not met the current deadline, we do not plan to extend it further. Having statewide child
support computer systems in every state is essential for the implementation of the tough, new
child support enforcement rules enacted last year as part of welfare reform.

        We do, however, believe that the current law, which requires us to withhold all federal
child support funds when a state misses the deadline, will undermine efforts to collect child
support for needy families. Thus, we plan to accept Congressman Clay Shaw's invitation to
work to devise new legislation which will create an additional set of penalties for states that have
not put in place these critical statewide computer systems. This will ensure that states have
strong financial incentives to get their computer systems in place while not hurting overall child
support collection efforts by denying all federal funds unless absolutely necessary. We expect
new legislation to be enacted before any state completes the appeals process.

       We look forward to working with you to improve our child support enforcement program.

                                             Sincerely,



                                             Bruce Reed

There are two separable questions involved here:

·         Should we cut federal spending on child support enforcement?

·         Should we restructure the current system, in which the federal government shares in state
          costs of collecting child support by paying about two-thirds of costs, to one in which the
          states receive a federal block grant?

Should we cut federal spending for child support enforcement in the FY '99 budget?

Should we restructure the financial contribution to child support enforcement?

Current Structure: Currently, the federal government pays 66 percent of general child support
costs incurred by the states. States must provide the federal government with a share of child
support collections from non-custodial parents of welfare families (to recoup the costs of welfare
payments made to those families). The federal government also pays states incentive payments
based on performance. Overall, the federal government loses money on child support
enforcement and the state governments gain money.

Block Grant Proposal: Raines' proposal would provide states with a block grant for operating
expenses and require them to maintain their current spending in exchange for being able to keep
all the collections from welfare families. In addition, the feds would distribute incentive funds
based on peformance. The block grant amount could be set so that overall, the federal
government saves money compared to current spending (OMB has drafted two versions, one
which saves $1.8 billion, and the other which saves almost $3.0 billion, although a revenue
neutral proposal could be structured). OMB envisions that while this option would provide
states with less money to collect child support, they could easily make up the difference by add a
fee to the child support collected from non-custodial parents of non-welfare families.

Revised Match Proposal: Another alternative would allow states to keep all the collections from
welfare families, but reduce the federal match rate to a percentage lower than 66 percent to make
up the difference. In addition, the feds would distribute incentive funds based on peformance.
