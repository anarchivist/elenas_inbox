Thanks for the thanks -- and I guess I should say thank you for trusting
me enough to skip the prebriefing!  It was fun to get to do it.

I heard (wholly unsolicitied) from Sylvia that you did a spectacular job
briefing the President for the disabilities meeting. And as I told you,
the briefing materials were extremely high quality. Thanks for the great
work you did on this event.
