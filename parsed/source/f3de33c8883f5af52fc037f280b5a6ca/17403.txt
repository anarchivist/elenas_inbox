TEXT:
Sylvia had a couple of minor points about the policy memo that she wanted
me to pass on to you.  The following are suggested format changes to what
was reviewed during the last meeting with Erskine as well as some
additional questions that she raised:

-add timing of the proposed policy action items and put in bold
-separate big from small policy proposals
-consider separating policies that directly relate to race from those that
indirectly relate to it
-add a rural component to the education empowerment zones
-figure out how to answer/respond to crime questions
-consider whether the NPR is part of enhanced enforcement


please incorporate as many of these suggestions as possible into the
policy "memo" that you bring to today's meeting. Thank you.
