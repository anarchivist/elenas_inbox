Los Angeles Times, September 22, 1998

                             California voters appear ready to sanction
casino-type
                             gambling on the state's Indian lands and slap
more tax on
                         cigarettes to pay for early childhood development
programs,
                         according to a new Los Angeles Times poll.
                               At the same time, voters are less clear on
whether they will
                      grant themselves a utilities rate cut and force
utilities to bear the full
                       cost of debts associated with energy deregulation.
                             In partisan races, at least two incumbent
Republicans, Secretary
                      of State Bill Jones and Insurance Commissioner Chuck
                      Quackenbush, face potentially strong challenges by,
respectively,
                      Democrats Michela Alioto and Diane Martinez.
                             Two Democratic state officeholders, Controller
Kathleen
                       Connell and state schools chief Delaine Eastin, are
having an easier
                       time against, respectively, Republicans Ruben
Barrales and Gloria
                      Matta Tuchman.
                             Three other statewide contests--for lieutenant
governor,
                       attorney general and treasurer--are essentially dead


even.
                            However, typical for this stage of the
campaign, these so-called
                      down-ballot races are drawing little notice, as are
the other nine
                      largely uncontroversial and even arcane initiatives
on the Nov. 3
                      ballot.
                            Asked their motivation for going to the polls,
35% of registered
                      voters cited the assortment of statewide contests,
32% said there is
                      no one thing to spur them to vote and 18% cited the
closely
                      matched governor's race between Republican Dan
Lungren and
                      Democrat Gray Davis.
                            The highest-profile initiative on the ballot
and the one most
                      familiar to registered voters was Proposition 5,
dealing with Indian
                      gaming. The focus of tens of millions of dollars of
TV advertising,
                      the measure would amend California law to allow cas in
o-type
                      gambling on Nod totribal lands.
                            After hearing a description of the measure,
57% of registered
                      voters supported Proposition 5, 28% were opposed and
15%. were
                      undecided. Seventy-two percent of those who said
they have
                      visited an Indian casino supported the initiative,
as did 52% of those
                      who have never been.
                            Similarly, 71% of frequent gamblers and 63% of
occasional
                      gamblers backed the measure, as did 57% of those who
rarely
                      gamble and 51% who abstain.
                             "The pro-Proposition 5 forces, basing their
arguments on
                      economic development and Indian self-sufficiency,
have clearly
                      done the better job so far of making their case,"
said Susan Pinkus,
                      director of the Times Poll.
                            Also winning early voter support is
proposition 10, which
                      would raise cigarette taxes 50 cents a pack to
finance early
                      childhood development programs. After hearing a
description of the
                      measure, 54% of registered voters backed it, 35%
were opposed
                      and 11% were undecided.
                            Voters were more evenly divided on Proposition
9, the electric
                      utilities initiative. The measure would rewrite the
state's electricity


                        deregulation law to require a 20% rate cut and p
revent utilities from
                        charging customers $28 billion for the cost of
nuclear plants and
                        long-term purchase contracts.
                              After hearing a description of the measure,
36% of registered
                        voters supported Proposition 9, 21% were opposed and
43% were
                        undecided.
                              In the partisan contests, much seems to depend
on who turns
                        out on Nov. 3--an uncertain guess, given the current
unsettled
                        political climate. Moreover, most of the candidates
on both
                        sides--including incumbents--are largely a mystery
-to voters at this
                        point.
                                 In the race for lieutenant governor, state
Assemblyman Cruz
                        Bustamante (D-Fresno) leads state Sen. Tim Leslie
(R-Tahoe City)
                        29% to 22% among registered voters. Among likely
voters,
                        however, the race was a statistical tie, with Leslie
at 29% and
                        Bustamante at 28%.
                              Similarly, in the race for attorney general,
state Sen. Bill
                        Lockyer (D-Hayward)    leads Chief Deputy Atty. Gen.
Dave
                        Stirling, the GOP nominee,    31% to 25% among
registered voters,
                        but they are virtually tied, 31% to 30%, among
likely voters.
                                 In the race for treasurer,   the contest is even
among both
                        registered and likely voters. Among registered
voters, Democrat
                        Phil Angelides has 27% support to 25% for state
Assemblyman
                        Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove.) Pringle was slightly
ahead among
                        likely voters, 30% to 27%.
                              Two Republican incumbents could face tough
reelection fights,
                        depending on turnout.
                              Insurance Commissioner Quackenbush was
essentially tied with
                        state Assemblywoman Martinez (D-Monterey Park) among
                        registered voters, 36% to 35%, but led by 42% to 34%
among
                        likely voters.
                              At the same time, Secretary of State Jones
drew 28% to
                        Alioto's 30% among registered voters, but held a 34%
to 29% lead
                        among likely voters.
                              Two incumbent Democrats, Controller Connell


and Supt. of
                    Public Instruction Eastin, were more comfortably
ahead in their
                    reelection bids.
                          Connell led San Mateo County Supervisor
Barrales 38% to
                    22% among registered voters and 40% to 27% among
likely
                    voters. Eastin led Santa Ana teacher Matta Tuchman
24% to 10%
                    among registered voters and 27% to 11% in the race
for the
                    nonpartisan office.
                         The Times Poll interviewed 1,651 Californians,
including 1,270
                    registered voters, by telephone Sept. 12-17. Among
them, 684
                    were deemed likely to vote. The margin of sampling
error is plus or
                    minus 3 percentage points for registered voters and
4 percentage
                    points for likely voters.
