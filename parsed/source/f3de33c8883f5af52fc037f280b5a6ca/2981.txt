TEXT:
We sent a letter t.o ADAPT last night inviting them t.o participate in a
meeting with the President .on September 10, 1997. They said .only .one page
came thr.ough the fax.   Instead .of calling t.o ask t.o resend, they instead
are at the Department .of Lab.or demanding t.o meet with Alexis.    I've talked
with Lee Satterfield, sent her Maria's letter t.o ADAPT, and am w.orking t.o
get Maria t.o call them.
