                              WELFARE TO WORK EVENT

                         DATE:             August 12, 1997
                         LOCATION:         Mid.Tec Warehouse, St. Louis, Missouri
                         BRIEFING TIME: 10:00 am - 10:30 am
                         EVENT TIME:       10:40 am -12:00 am
                     FROM:          Bruce Reed


I.    PURPOSE

      To celebrate the one year anniversary ofthe welfare law by announcing a new decline in
      welfare caseloads and highlighting the success of the Welfare to Work Partnership in
      mobilizing businesses within St. Louis to hire welfare recipients into the workforce.

II.   BACKGROUND

      You will be making remarks in an old warehouse building that Mid.Tec is currently
      renovating into a training facility that will train unemployed people in high-skilled
      manufacturing jobs. Mid.Tec recently moved from the suburbs to this inner-city site (in
      a federal enterprise community) to help rebuild an inner-city neighborhood and move'
      closer to a pool of unemployed people who can be trained to fill job vacancies. Prior to
      your speech you will briefly tour the training facility.

      At this event you will announce that welfare caseloads have dropped by 3.4 million since
      you took office (a 24% decline) and 1.4 million since you signed the welfare law last
      year. The 3.4 million drop is the largest decrease in the welfare rolls in history. While
      you have been President, 48 out of 50 states have seen their caseloads decline, and ten
      states have reduced their rolls by more than 40%. As a result, the percentage of the total
      population on the welfare rolls is the lowest since 1970.

      You will also underscore the critical role of the private sector in welfare reform by
      praising the over 300 bi-state St. Louis region companies that are committing to hire
      and retain welfare recipients without displacing current workers. St. Louis is the
      first of 12 "City to City" challenges the Welfare to Work Partnership is launching.
      Over the next year, the Partnership will work closely with community and business
      leaders in 12 high- poverty cities to help promote innovative and effective welfare to
      work initiatives. Nationally, the Welfare-to-Work Partnership, has received
                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion
       pledges from over 800 companies since it was founded in May_

       Also at today's event, the Partnership will unveil several new tools to help
       companies that want to hire workers from the welfare rolls: a toll free hotline
       (1-888-USA-JOBl) and a web site (www.welfaretowork.org) to link companies to
       public and private sector welfare reform information; a guide for companies hiring
       welfare recipients, Blueprint/or Business: Reaching a New Work Force, prepared
       with the National Alliance of Business; and radio and print public service
       announcements that highlight the benefits to companies of hiring welfare recipients
       and encourage companies to join the Partnership.
