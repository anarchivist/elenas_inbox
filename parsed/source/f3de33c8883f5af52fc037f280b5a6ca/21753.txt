TEXT:
John Morton just called to let me know that he has reserved time on
December 11th for the AG to do a press announcement and q&a re: TPS for
Hondurans and Nicaraguans.

He also asked that we all make sure that we are comfortable with the AG
briefing the press on this (with State), rather than just doing a release,
witrr q&a provided to the respective press offices. John did not express a
view either way, but wanted to make sure that we were sure.
