TEXT:
Christa and I tried to figure out how to handle the issue of California's
participation in the testing initiative. We need to not back away from our
previous announcement, while not rekindling a battle in California, or
between us and Pete wilson.  Here's the approach:

1. the one-pager Christa sent has a carefully worded statement about
officials in WVA and MASS joining those in NC, Maryland, Michigan and
California in endorsing the testing initiative. That is an accurate
statement.

2.  In his remarks, the President should omit mentioning California; if
his remarks get picked up, that will most likely set things off in CA,
especially if he departs from a carefully prepared text.

3.   If the WH Press asks what happened to CA, we can point to the
statement in the 1-pager.

4. I will prepare a Q&A for McCurry and Toiv that will basically (1)
reiterate that Delaine Eastin endorsed the tests and pledged to work to
get CA to participate; (2) acknolwedge that they are having a dispute in
CA about who has the authority to decide what tests are given; (3) that we
are not part of their governance battle, but hope that they stop fighting
soon and focusing on helping kids reach national and international
standards in reading and math, and that our tests can help them do that.

What do you think?
