TEXT:
As you know, Michael Kharfen has staff calling states to get new case load
numbers for us.

Meanwhile, ACF has a notice they want to send to states on the data
collection transition rules which makes clear that only certain states are
now required to send us numbers monthly.  (The Balanced Budget Act
technicals said states not yet subject to TANF reporting requirements as
of June 1997 -- 7 states, D.C., and the territories -- have to report
monthly data until they become subject to TANF reporting. Once under TANF
reporting, states have to report monthly data in their quarterly reports.)

I don't think we can stop the notice, since it accurately describes the
law and provides necessary information about where to report data (due to
changes in HHS computer systems).  I've sat on it a couple of days to keep
it from arriving at the same time Michael is calling to get the
information, but I think we need.to let it go tomorrow. Any objections?
