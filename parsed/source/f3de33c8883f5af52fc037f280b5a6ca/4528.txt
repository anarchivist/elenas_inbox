     From:         Kevin Brown
     Date:         September 25, 1997
     Subject:      Tobacco settlement-Senate hearing


     Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, DSOB 430, 10:00 a.m.

     Senators in attendance: Jeffords (chair), DeWine, Hutchinson, Gregg, Harkin, Wellstone,
                     Frist, Murray, Reed

     Wimess: Donna Shalala, Secretary of Health and Human Services

     Shalala began by outlining the 5 principle parts of any tobacco legislation announced by the
     POTUS last week. She stressed that we must get national legislation right the first time, and
     also that government institutions/agencies may have to be strengthened in order to carry out the
     settlement. She also reiterated that current FDA guidelines regarding nicotine should be kept
     the same and included as part of the settlement in order to make them more clear. The Secretary
     stressed throughout the entire hearing, that the main purpose of this legislation should not be
     about money, but about reducing teen smoking. She announced that the Vice Presiden~ would
     take the lead in encouraging bipartisan support for the legislation.

     JEFFORDS: Questioned whether the POTUS's announcement should be viewed as a separate
     framework from the settlement and also questioned why the administration had not introduced
     legislation. Shelala reinforced the notion that the POTUS's 5 core principles HAD to be at the
     center of any legislation that the administration would support and that the administration did
     want to work with Congress on developing the legislation. Later in the hearing, Jeffords also
     questioned whether or not the agreement would fall through if changes were made and the
     companies pulled out. Secretary indicated that the companies are not fragile and she believed
     there would negotiate with Congress.

     WELLSTONE: Asked if the Secretary saw any way that the U.S. could take the lead in reducing
     youth smoking around the world. She indicated that any program abroad should reflect our
     domestic program and mentioned working with such groups as WHO and the World Bank.
     Wellstone also said that he had heard on NPR that rising cigarette prices results in inelastic
     demand and asked what the effect of a price increase would be. Shalala answered that studies
     have shown that a 10 rise in price will drop smoking by 7. She stressed, however, that this
     (price increase) was only one small part of the solution and is designed to work with all of the
     other initiatives to reduce teen smoking.
                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion
GREGG: Began by saying that he did not understand where the actual legislative language was
going to come from, and that it was certainly not going to come from the Hill. Went on to ask
whether the FDA currently has the authority to ban tobacco use altogether. Finally, Shalala
admitted that the FDA could currently ban tobacco/nicotine under current regulations and said
that those regulations must be kept in tact, but that there were no plans for such a ban.
Commented that the provision for farmers seemed to smell like politics and went on to ask if
convenient store owners should be compensated since they might also lose revenue. Shalala
stated that it was very important to consider the situation of the farmer and that their views
should be considered. Gregg stated that farmers are subsidized by the government and this was
inconsistent if we were also stating that people should quit smoking.

HARKIN: Reminded Gregg that tobacco farmers were not subsidized, and said that it is a no-net
cost program. Harkin asked why they could not get a copy of a treasury department audit that
showed if and how much tobacco companies profit from price increases. Harkin asked the
chair to obtain that document. Stated that we were in fact trying to eliminate tobacco use in this
country (in response to Shalala who said FDA was not trying to eliminate tobacco). Harkin
went on to say that our end goal was to eliminate its use. Stated that the $1.50 increase needs to
happen more quickly in order to have a greater effect.

REED: Asked if the $1.50 increase will be a windfall for companies. Shalala stated that this
should be looked at, however, the main point is to reduce youth smoking!

ENZI: Indicated that issues should be looked at such as the problem smoking causes
Medicare/Medicaid. Secretary Shalala stated that the number one priority was to reduce
smoking now, and then in the future associated medical costs will decrease.

MURRAY: Appreciated the POTUS's announcement last week. Asked how the settlement
would be carried out? Shalala stressed that FD.A should be given the resource to carry out,
however, other agencies such as CDC, NIH etc. should also have roles. Also stated that the
companies must have powerful economic incentives in order to have good reason to help reduce
youth smoking.

DEWINE: Stated that he was disappointed that the administration has not introduced a bill and
indicated that it was going to be very tough to create a bill without the administration due to its
complexity, etc. Shalala stressed that Congress WILL have the help of the administration in a
bipartisan way. DeWine asked about holding individual companies responsible if their brand
was being smoked more by youth. Shalala indicated that this could be done by brand and
company.

FRIST: Cited a CBS Poll that said the government does not have the ability to reduce teen
smoking. Asked what assurance(s) can be given to the public that the government can. The
Secretary said that it was not just the government's responsibility, but everyone else as well. It
                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion
takes all aspects of the settlement to accomplish the goal. Frist asked how far the FDA should
go to regulate nicotine. Shalala said that there were no plans to manipulate nicotine levels, but
there must be more research. She stated that as science changes, we must be able to make
changes to the current policy. Frist also praised the POTUS's inclusion of farmers in his
statement. The Secretary referred questions as to specific help for farmers to Sec. Glickman.
Shalala said it was time that everyone come together on this settlement: farmers, Congress etc.
Frist ended the hearing by asking if consumption of tobacco products would be referred to the
criminal world/black market. Shalala said that the settlement focuses on youth, therefore, it does
not have black market implications.

SUMMARY:
Three main issues were continually brought up during the hearing. The first was the lack of
specific legislation offered by the administration. Several Senators indicated that this was a
major stumbling block and made passing the settlement much more difficult. The second issue
was in regards to FDA These questions revolved around how much control FDA would have
and what its responsibilities would be. Secretary Shalala stressed that it was very important that
the legislation maintain FDA's current status in relation to the control of tobacco. The third
issue that got quite a bit of discussion was the proposed inclusion of farmers. Some Senators
questioned this and thought it might be sending the wrong message. The Secretary responded
that it was very important that the concerns of farmers be heard since they were not at the table
when the settlement was drafted. Throughout the entire hearing, Secretary Shalala reinforced
the idea that we are going to have legislation because of one reason, and that is to reduce teen
smoking.
