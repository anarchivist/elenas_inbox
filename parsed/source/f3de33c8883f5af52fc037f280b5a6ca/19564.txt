Q. What did USDA announce today with regard to bovine spongiform encephalopathy
(BSE)?


A.      The United States Department of Agriculture announced it has entered into a cooperative
agreement with Harvard University's School of Public Health to begin an analysis and evaluation
of the Department's current measures to prevent bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). The
two-year study will review current scientific information, assess the ways that BSE could
potentially enter the United States, and identify any additional measures that could be taken to
protect human and animal health.

        Initiating this study is the latest step in a ten-year record of aggressive measures USDA
has taken to prevent the entry ofBSE into the United States. In coordination with other
government agencies, the USDA BSE Working Group has been regularly reviewing the available
science and implementing appropriate regulatory measures to prevent SSE. These measures
include the 1989 ban of cattle and cattle products from countries where BSE has been reported,
as well as an active inspection, testing, and education program.

       No cases ofBSE have been diagnosed in the United States.
