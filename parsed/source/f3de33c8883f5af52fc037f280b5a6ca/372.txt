TEXT:
A late Friday recap of the work on the front burner in welfare
implementation:
1. HHS/TANF Completeness/45 days/guidance
The Florida fire is out. The plan will be found complete when
submitted in a letter to be sent either today or Monday.   This
allows Florida both to operate a TANF program and get TANF funds
as of October 1.
The need for HHS clarification to other states remains.   We have
asked HHS to send a letter to all states indicating the
process/rules for finding a plan complete, when operation of a
TANF program can begin, and when funding starts.   HHS is, again,
hesitant to send out such a clarification.   I have spoken to
Monahan and will reinforce with Thurm.
2. 40 Quarters
a) SSI: SSA has given their proposed procedure to Steve Warnath to
review - a very lengthy, detailed document.   He is reviewing and'
will let us know whether this represents an acceptable approach
for an interim system.   Hopefully, this guidance can be finalized
and gotten to the field early next week.
b) Food stamps: SSA and USDA met today and will meet with the WH
on Monday - 1:00 p.m. - to present their ideas.   I have made it
clear to USDA that guidance to the field must go out early next
week (I spoke to Martha Phipps, Diana was calling Yvette).    ELENA:
We'll need your read by Monday on the extent of USDA authority to
mandate state procedures in this area.
3. Medicaid fact sheets
DIANA is trying to slog through some issues with HCFA, and we hope
to meet with them again on Monday - particularly on the tricky
waiver issue.   The fact sheets should be cleared in time for the
State Medicaid directors meeting next week.


4.  Cost Neutrality and waivers
This is a CRITICAL area where we are looking to OMB (KEN) to call
an interagency meeting to discuss the cross agency (food stamps,
TANF, Medicaid) implications of cost neutrality post PROWA.
5.  881 Kids
A decision memo is going to Rasco and Raines as soon as possible.
DIANA needs a little more time to work through a couple of
options, but this memo should be done by midweek.
6. Means Tested Benefits
ELENA is taking the next steps here -- talking to the agency
counsels -- and she will let us know what the timing on the memo
we discussed will be.
Additional items
We are turning up the heat on U8DA to get the waiver guidance on
18-50 year olds done.
We need to answer the OIRA concern on finalizing the draft TANF·
guidance.   (I asked Monahan to have appropriate HH8 legal people
contact OIRA) .
We need to move forward on 40 quarters beyond F8 and 881, but
obviously not quite as fast.   IN8 and VA working on their pieces.
Thanks. Have a good weekend.    We'll follow up on Monday and of
course have a Tuesday implementation subgroup meeting.
