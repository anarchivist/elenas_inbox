        Ray, I agree with you that we are in our best position to
help get the right type of press coverage if Glickman, Babbitt
and McGinty are all in the region at or immediately after the
announcement.
        As you've seen from later emails today, we are working to
get the guidelines out tomorrow. We would like to have it a day
before the HCP announcement on Thursday, so we don't step on our
own story there.
        Glickman was reviewing the material himself late today.
We expect to have it around for review first thing tomorrow.
