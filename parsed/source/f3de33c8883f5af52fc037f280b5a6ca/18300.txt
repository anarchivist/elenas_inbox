TEXT:
I told the FOP today that it would take a little more time before giving
them an answer and they are furious. They think we are dragging our feet
and that we are not acting in good faith b/c we continue to break our word
on when we'll have an answer.
 They are having an Executive Board meeting in Alabama next Thursday,
January 15. At this meeting they will bring up the collective bargaining
issue.  One of there ideas is to picket outside of the White House.

Gil called Erskine today and would very much like to talk to Erskine
before this meeting. I think it is in our best interest to have Erskine
call him -- preferably with a decision -- before this meeting on the
15th. They would like for us to schedule a time that Gil and Erksine
could talk since Gil will be traveling and is difficult to reach.
