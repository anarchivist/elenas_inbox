        I am writing to urge you to pass quickly and without delay the critical legislation we need
to raise the quality ofteachers and teaching in our public schools. Recent news reports across
our country underscore what educators, parents and my Administration have been warning
Americans about all along -- there is a growing shortage of good teachers in America's
classrooms. It is a crisis in terms of both quality and quantity. In Massachusetts, 59 percent of
all prospective teachers failed the state's first teaching examination. School districts are having
trouble filling vacancies for math, science, special education and bilingual teachers. And one
school district -- desperate to fill teacher-less classrooms -- has even decided to allow people
with no more than high school diplomas serve as substitute teachers.

         Our children deserve better. A strong, world-class education is essential to every
child's success in the 21st Century. That is why strengthening public education must be our
top priority.

        We must begin by strengthening and expanding America's pool of teachers. Over the
next decade, we will need to hire more than two million new teachers to replace a generation of
retiring teachers and meet the needs ofthe largest school-age population since the Baby Boom
generation. Our poorest urban and rural communities, which already face tremendous
challenges in recruiting, supporting and retaining new teachers, will need more than 700,000
teachers in the next decade.

         I have sent to Congress a comprehensive education agenda to address these challenges --
to recruit more of our best and brightest to the teaching profession and to ensure that they are
well-prepared and well-qualified. I call on you to pass the Higher Education Act and other
critical legislation to improve our nation's teaching force before the end of this session.

       In particular, I ask you to support my Administration's efforts to recruit 35,000 teachers
over the next five years. We must support scholarships for teachers who commit to teaching in
underserved urban or rural schools. I also ask you to support "Lighthouse" partnerships between
schools and colleges to ensure new teachers are leaming what they need to meet the latest
challenges of teaching today's students. I strongly support holding institutions of higher
education accountable for preparing quality teachers -- and am encouraged by the accountability
measures for teacher education that are currently in the House and Senate HEA bills. I thank
Rep. Miller and Sen. Bingaman for their efforts on behalf of this provision.

        I urge Congress not to retreat from the progress we have made to raise standards for
teachers -- and to continue supporting the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards.
For more than a decade, the Board has set high standards for what teachers need to know and
certified teachers that met those standards. We must make sure it can continue to do so well into
the next century.

         And I urge Congress to reconsider its actions regarding my proposal to reduce class size
in the first, second, and third grades. On three occasions, the House and Senate have blocked
efforts to make this proposal law. I remain convinced that my plan to create smaller classes so
that teachers can spend more time with each student and to ensure that all teachers are trained to
improve elementary education in America. We must make it law.

       Finally, we cannot afford to reduce our commitment to Eisenhower Professional
Development program -- which helps train teachers in almost every school district in America.
Current versions of the House and Senate Bills would underfund this vital program. I ask
Congress to reconsider its actions.

        Every one of these proposals is essential to improving teacher recruitment, training and
development in America. By supporting them, we can strengthen public education and the
future of our children. I urge you to pass each of these proposals as soon as you return from your
August break this fall.
