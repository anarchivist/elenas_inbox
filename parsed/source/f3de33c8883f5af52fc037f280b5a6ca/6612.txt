TEXT:
BR/EK:

In case this comes up at tomorrow morn's senior staff:

Assaults -- Last I heard from EK, Treasury would not be ready Friday and
wanted two more weeks to work the process. EK was going to visit again
w/Rahm and talk to Ray Kelly.

Crime/Tobacco -- BR seems to have put the focus back on tobacco.

School Violence -- Education/DOJ is saying that they can't be ready
earlier than Monday, so they're out as a radio address back-up for this
Saturday, but they can definitely do the 19th and should be able to do the
21st radio address if that works.  They aren't wil'ling to hold one, of
their data sets past next week, however.  Rahm suggested to me that even
doing a Reno/Riley meeting w/POTUS followed by a WH brief would be good.
I agree.

Jose'
