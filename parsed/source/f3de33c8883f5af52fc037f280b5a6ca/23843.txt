TEXT:
Idea seems to be to get POTUS a new draft of book before he leaves on
vacation at beginning of next week.  I will send a memo along with it
outlining major disputed issues. This means that you've got to speak
rapidly (about anything you haven't spoken on yet, such as civil rights)
or hold your peace.  Same deal on the NEC side of life.  tds
