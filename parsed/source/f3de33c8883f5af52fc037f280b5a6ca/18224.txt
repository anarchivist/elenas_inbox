MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:         Bruce Reed
              Elena Kagan

RE:           DPC Weekly Report



        Welfare Reform -- Welfare to Work Competitive Grants: In early January, the
Department of Labor will release a notice seeking welfare to work competitive grant
applications. A total of $711 million of the $3 billion welfare to work funds will be awarded in
five rounds of competition, two in FY '98 and three in FY '99. Projects will be funded for up to
three years. Both public and private entities may apply, including state and local governments
and community and faith-based organizations. We worked with DOL to ensure the notice seeks
projects designed to place welfare recipients into jobs quickly and provide the support services
and skills training for them to succeed in the work force. Like efforts supported by welfare to
work formula funds, these projects must serve long-term welfare recipients with multiple barriers
to employment. DOL intends to award about 70 percent of funds to projects in cities with high
concentrations of poverty and 30 percent to rural areas. The first round of applications will be
due in March.

       Crime -- COPS: On December 11, the Justice Department announced grants for $47
million to fund an additional 800 police officers under the Clinton COPS Initiative. The grants
went to law enforcement agencies in 32 states, and included a grant to New York City to fund
300 additional officers. The announcement brings the total to 66,000 additional officers funded
under the Clinton COPS Program.

         Crime -- 3-1-1 Community Policing Number: On Wednesday, Dallas launched a new
citywide 3-1-1 non-emergency response system. Dallas residents will be able to call 3-1-1 and
request any city service 24-hours a day, seven days a week. The Dallas announcement is less
than a month after San Jose', California kicked off its own 3-1-1 initiative. On October 1,
Baltimore celebrated its one-year anniversary as the nation's first 3-1-1 project. The 3-1-1
initiative in Baltimore has helped reduce the volume of calls to 9-1-1 by 25 percent; has cut the
average response time to emergency calls by two-thirds; and has been credited as one of the
reasons for lower crime rates in the city.
                                                             Automated Records Management System
                                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion
            Crime -- Brady Handgun Checks: As reported earlier, Ohio has signed an agreement
    with the Justice and Treasury Departments to conduct background checks for all handgun sales.
    Arkansas remains the only state that is not currently conducting background checks. Despite an
    opinion issued by Arkansas Attorney General Winston Bryant that Arkansas has the necessary
    authority, the Governor continues to refuse background checks. As a result, Attorney General
    Bryant has asked the Treasury and Justice Departments to make him the designated chief law
    enforcement officer authorized to conduct background checks statewide. The proposal is
    currently under consideration by the both Departments.

             Tobacco -- Proposed Smoking Cessation Program as Part of the Tobacco
     Settlement: You inquired about a recent study in the Journal of the American Medical
    Association regarding the implementation of a smoking cessation guideline. The study
     found that full implementation of the HHS guideline to screen all patients for tobacco use
     and provide cessation assistance to all willing patients would cost $6.3 billion in the first
    ·year and would achieve approximately 1.7 million new quitters over and above a baseline
     quit rate. The study estimated that these results compare favorably with the costs of other
     preventative intervention programs such as mammography screening. On September 17,
    you listed expansion of smoking cessation programs as one of the elements that must be
    included in any national tobacco legislation. The tobacco settlement proposed that $1
     billion for the first 4 years and $1.5 billion thereafter would be used to assist individuals
    who want to quit using tobacco. With respect to the study's conclusions, HHS and OMB
     believe that there are other methods for implementing smoking cessation programs that
     might have lower costs such as providing incentives to managed-care plans to offer
    smoking cessation programs. As part of the legislative process, HHS is preparing a list of
    cessation resource allocation options and how many quitters each option may produce.
    They caution that this is a very inexact science.

           Education -- Single Sex School in New York City: After meeting with DPC and
    WHC staff, Secretary Riley has agreed to approach Chancellor Rudy Crew in an effort to
    explore ways they might work together to support the continuing operation of the
    Women's Leadership Academy in NYC, in the context of civil rights and Constitutional
    requirements. Riley has placed a call to Crew and expects to speak with him by the
    beginning of the new year. Our strategy is to engage NYC officials at the policy level
    rather than in an investigative and complaint context, to explore the issues around single
    sex schools and look for ways in which we can together achieve our mutual goal of enabling
    the Women's Leadership Academy to continue to operate.
