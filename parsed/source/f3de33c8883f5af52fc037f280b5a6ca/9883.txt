                                  New Education Initiatives

TEACHER AND PRINCIPAL QUALITY
1. Raising the quality of the current teaching force. ($1.5 billion). We propose a new,
formula grant program to states and school districts to improve the quality of the current
teaching force. To receive funding, states would have to develop strategies to upgrade
state licensure and certification requirements (including testing requirements for new
teachers) to align them to state academic standards for students, provide intensive support
for beginning teachers, ensure teachers meet high standards before entering the profession
and gaining tenure, improve professional development, reward outstanding teachers
(including teachers certified by the National Board), remove incompetent or burnt-out
teachers, and recruit new teachers inCluding through the expansion of high-quality
alternative routes to certification, States and districts would have considerable flexibility in
how the funds would be used to accomplish these purposes, though they would be held
accountable for measurable improvements such as reductions in the percentage of
uncertified and out-of-field teachers, particularly in high poverty schools. States would
distribute fund to local school districts who develop siniilar plans either competitively or by
formula, and increases or cuts in out-year funding could be tied to performance on these
measures and measures of student achievement. Funding would be targeted to high
poverty communities, in order to ensure that this program best supports our efforts to
strengthen public schools in those communities and to close the achievement gap between
majority and minority students

This new program would be proposed in the reauthorization of ESEA, and would replace
Goals 2000, the Eisenhower Professional Development program, and Title VI (Block
grant). At current (FY99) funding levels, these programs total $1.2 billion. We propose
that the new initiative incorporate an increase over the FY 1999 funding level.

2. Attracting more than 200,000 talented new teachers, especially into high-poverty
schools and shortage areas like math and science, and special education. More than 2
million teachers must be hired in the next ten years to accommodate record student
enrollments and an aging teaching force. This provides a challenge to recruit an adequate
number of teachers, but perhaps even more important is the opportunity to ensure a quality
teaching force for decades by attracting talented young people and mid-career
professionals into high-poverty schools and shortage subject areas. With 2/3 of teachers in
classrooms in the year 2006 still to be hired, there may be no better long-term strategy to
improve the quality of the teaching force. A $100 million increase in the newly enacted
"recruiting teachers for underserved areas" portion of Title II of the Higher Education Act
could help place an additional place an additional 70,000 talented young people into
high-need teaching positions over five years, and (with modest changes in the Higher
Education Act an additional 15,000 mid-career professionals from the military, academia,
math and science companies and elsewhere.

Other elements of an action plan to attract talented people into teaching include creating 1)
world-class high school academies for future teachers in every state educating 30,000 young
                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion


people interested in teaching over five years through a $50 million increase to the national
programs pieces of the Vocational Education Act or to a newly authorized program to
support the creation of high schools on the grounds of community colleges, 2) a national
service corps for 10,000 future teachers over five years through a $30 million annual
increase to the Vista or Americorps grants programs, 3) a $10 million marketing/public
relations campaign designed to persuade young people and mid-career professionals to
consider a career in teaching. This would focus partly on alternative routes to
certification and also highlight and honor outstanding teachers -- including those that have
left other professions to teach.

3. Principal Leadership Academies. ($150 million). While our primary emphasis must be on
imroving the quality of teachers, we can strengthen the effect of our teacher programs (including
our new initiatives in reading and class size reduction) by careful attention to strengthening the
quality of principals. Research has long shown that principal leadership is a key to school
effectiveness, yet little had been done at the national, state or local level to upgrade the skills of
principals. We propose a new initiative to upgrade the management and instructional leadership
skills of elementary school principals. This initiative would support the establishment of one or
more (in larger states) principal leadership academies. The academies, established competitively,
would involve partnerships among school districts, institutions of higher education, businesses
with particular expertise in management training, and state education agencies. The academies
would be responsible for providing high quality training and ongoing support to principals on
such topics as instructional leadership, effective reading instruction, teacher evaluation, keeping
schools safe and orderly, and overall management skills.



STRENGTHENING ACCOUNT ABILITY
1. Ending Social Promotions. ($300 million set-aside of a total request of $500 million for
the 21st Century Learning Centers). Districts that agree to end social promotion would be
eligible to compete for funding for summer-schools and after-school programs to provide
extra-help to children who need it so they can be promoted on time. Districts that compete
for funds will have to show how they are taking steps during the regular school day to help
children meet standards in the first place -- with early intervention, smaller classes, and
well-prepared teachers.

2. Fund for School Excellence and Accountability ($300-400 million). This program will
come on top of the accountability requirements that will be built into the major formal programs
of ESEA (i.e., Title 1, Teacher Quality, Safe and Drug Free Schools). While the accountability
provisions are not yet finalized and will vary somewhat from program to program, in each case
they will require (1) report cards focused on results; (2) intervention in low performing schools
or schools which are not making adequate progress; and (3) performance indicators at the state
and local school district level. We are still working to determine how best to link funding to
performance, so that some portion of continued funding (for schools, school districts or states) is
based on a demonstration of adequate progress.
                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion

        The Fund for School Excellence and Accountability is designed to provide incentives for states
        and school districts to go beyond these accountablility requjrements, and to push the
        state-of-the-art in the field. It will do this by (1) providing matching funds to states/districts
        that provide financial rewards to successful schools and aggressively intervene in failing schools,
        and to school districts that implement teacher evaluation systems that reward excellence and
        effectively remove low performing teachers; (2) establishing education "swat teams" that can be
        used to help tum around low-performing schools; (3) provide financial rewards to states and
        school districts that successfully reduce the achievement gap between minority students and
        white students; (4) developing model school report cards that provide clear and useable
        information to parents and taxpayers


        EXPANDING PUBLIC SCHOOL CHOICE
        1. Continuing to expand Charter Schools. We should continue to support charter schools, at
        current levels ($100 million).

        2. Public School Choice. We propose to broaden our efforts to expand public school choice
        through a demonstration program that would incorporate other innovative approaches, including:
        (1) Community college: expand Tech-Prep program to enable high school students to enroll in
        community colleges, for high school level and/or college level courses; (2) Work-Site schools:
        provide tax benefits to encourage employers to provide facilities on site for schools for children of
        their own employees, while the school district provides the teachers, curriculum, instructional
        materials; (4) Schools-within-schools: grants to transform large schools into several smaller ones
        at the same site; (5) Magnet schools: grants to develop high-quality special programs at schools
        with concentrated minority enrollments in order to reduce and prevent racial isolation. Cost:
        $50 -$70 milliion, plus cost of tax benefits (to be determined).
