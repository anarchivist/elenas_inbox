                                RECOMMENDED PHONE CALL

TO:                    Dr. C. Everett Koop

RECOMMENDED
BY:         Ron Klain

Prepared by:           Toby Donenfeld

PURPOSE:               You are returning Dr. Koop's phone call. We are not certain as to why
                       he called you but expect that it would be to discuss the McCain tobacco
                       bill.

                                     5 years 30                 25
                                     7 years 50                 35
                                     10 years          60             45

Administration Position Thus Far:

Today, Erskine delivered a speech to The Center for National Policy said this of the McCain bill:
that it will "lay a strong foundation for further action, but also has room for improvement."
                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion

Particularly, the Administration does not believe the McCain bill will impose strong enough
lookback penalties on companies and does not agree with the way the tobacco revenues are
spent. On the positive side, the McCain bill does include a substantial price increase on a pack
of cigarettes, gives the FDA full authority to regulate tobacco products and is expected to contain
a strong plan to protect tobacco farmers and their communities.

Kessler/Koop
David Kessler has been quoted as saying this about the McCain bill: "On the issue that matters
most, reducing the number of kids who smoke ... the bill does not measure up."
Dr. Koop has not said anything publicly on the McCain bill.

Coalition, which Dr. Koop chairs. You agreed to host this reception for him when you were

       Side-by-side analysis of the McCain bill.
       Q&A on the McCain bill.
       Summary of the McCain bill.




                                                                                  Clinton Library Photocopy

                                 Talking Points

·   I am returning your call. As you may know, I have been on vacation for the
    past week, so I am ·not current on all of the details of the tobacco legislative
    debate. I am interested in learning what your opinion is on the McCain bill.

·   The Administration believes that the McCain bill is a good foundation for further
    action, but we see room for significant improvement. We are pleased that the
    bill includes a substantial price increase on a pack of cigarettes and that it give full
    authority to the FDA to regulate tobacco. We are very interested in strengthening
    the lookback penalties provisions.

·   I know that Dr. Kessler has come out with some pretty strong language against
    the McCain bill. It is my hope that we can all work together in the next few
    days to push McCain for the changes we need to drastically reduce youth
    smoking.
