TEXT:
advocates believe the attached Medicaid reg offers the opportunity
to keep all legal immigrants who lose SSI on Medicaid
automatically, without the state having to take any action.
I am pretty sure HCFA doesn't buy this argument legally.  I am now
trying to hear why, although Laura Oliven has a guess in the
attached email.
What do you think? I would appreciate a read today;they are
pushing me to get out a fact sheet today and I am unclear as to
whether it would foreclose this interpretation.

"If an agency provides Medicaid· to aged, blind, or disabled individuals
receiving SSI or optional State supplements, it must provide Medicaid to
individuals who would be eligible for SSI or optional State supplements except
for an eligibility requirement used in those programs that is specifically
prohibited under title XIX."

We think that this means if a person is determined ineligible for SSI based on
an eligibility requirement that Medicaid specifically prohibits, those people
can be deemed as receiving SSI for the purposes of Medicaid eligibility.

The Medicaid Bureau listed two examples of this:  SSI deeming rules on alien
sponsors and essential persons.  So, for example, if an immigrant was found
ineligible for SSI because of the SSI deeming rules, then for the purposes of
Medicaid eligibility they would be considered as receiving cash, and therefore,
categorically eligible for Medicaid because Medicaid did not have deeming rules.

Advocates may beleive that the problem of immigrants currently in the country
being kicked off of SSI and not being able to get back on Medicaid in those
states that 1) did not decide to kick current immigrants off of Medicaid and 2)
do not have a non-cash SSI-related eligibility category that the immigrants
would fall under.


  There is one part that is subject to interpretation though:  the reg language
  refers to 55I eligibility requirements that are "specifically prohibited under
  title XIX." Kicking current immigrants off of Medicaid is not "specifically
  prohibited," instead it is a state option.   We suspect that this is why HCFA
  does not believe this provision retains eligibility for the population in
  question.
