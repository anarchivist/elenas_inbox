TEXT:
Folks--my apologies for having to walk out of this meeting for another
commitment (you know with respect to this subject I'd only leave if I had
to go down to the Oval). What did you all conclude? By the way, was
there any additional paper? The only paper I have is a draft of the
letter ag had proposed to send to San Diego county, and the draft of the
ag legal memo looking at the issue of "fair service"--so what is the
thinking here. Thanks.
