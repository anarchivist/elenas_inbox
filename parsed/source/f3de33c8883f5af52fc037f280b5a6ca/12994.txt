                             LOCATION:      Rose Garden
                             BRIEFING TIME: 12:1Spm -12:3Spm
                             EVENT TIME:    12:4Spm - 1:30pm
                             FROM:          Larry Stein, Bruce Reed


I.    PURPOSE

      To announce the findings of a Justice Department report showing that, since taking effect
      in 1994, the Brady Law has blocked over 400,000 illegal gun sales; and to challenge the
      House of Representatives to pass common-sense gun legislation.

II.   BACKGROUND

      The Justice Department's Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) will release a study showing
      that, under the interim provisions of the Brady Law, approximately 312,000 applications
      to buy handguns were rejected because background checks revealed the purchaser was
      prohibited by state or federal law from buying a handgun. The interim provisions ofthe
      Brady Law, which were in effect from 3/1/94 to 11/29/98, allowed designated state and
      local law enforcement officials up to five business days to conduct background checks of
      all prospective handgun purchasers.

      The Justice Department will also report today that, during its first six months of
      operation, the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) blocked an
      estimated 90,000 illegal gun sales. The NICS, which was mandated by the Brady Law
      and replaced its interim provisions last November, allows law enforcement officials
      access to a more inclusive set of records than was previously available, and applies not
      just to handguns but to all firearms.

      You will also call on the House to pass effective gun legislation that:

      1. Closes the Gun Show Loophole.

      2. Raises the Age of Handgun Ownership From 18 to 21.

      3. Includes the Same Common Sense Gun Measures Already Passed by the Senate.
       law enforcement has to complete a Brady background check at gun shows. Although
       more than 70 percent of background checks are completed within minutes, and nearly 95
       percent within a 2-hour period, the remaining 5 percent take longer for a reason: they are
       much more likely to tum up a problem and result in a denial. Ifproposals to shorten
       background checks at gun shows to between 24 and 72 hours were applied to the NICS,
       the FBI estimates that between 9,000 and 17,000 prohibited persons would have been
       able to buy guns over the past six months.
