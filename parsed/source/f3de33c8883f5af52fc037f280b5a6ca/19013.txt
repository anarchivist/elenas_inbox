   PRESIDENT CLINTON JOINS DEMOCRATS TO UNVEIL LEGISLATION GIVING
  AMERICANS AGES 55 TO 65 NEW HEALTH INSURANCE OPTIONS AND RELEASES
    STATE-BY-STATE STUDY WHICH UNDERSCORES NEED FOR THIS POLICY
                              March 17, 1998

Today, President Clinton joined Democrats on the Hill to unveil legislation that would provide
Americans ages 55 to 65 health insurance options and urged Congress to send it to him for enactment.
This targeted, paid-for proposal will give an estimated 300,000 to 400,000 vulnerable Americans new
choices for more affordable health care coverage. The President also released a state-by-state analysis
that documents the need for this policy.

RELEASED NEW STATE-BY-STATE STUDY THAT DEMONSTRATES THE DIFFICULTY
AMERICANS AGES 55 TO 65 HAVE ACCESSING HEALTH INSURANCE. The report the
President released today underscores the difficulty Americans ages 55 to 65 have accessing health
insurance. The new report, prepared by the Domestic Policy Council and the National Economic
Council, found that:

       Five million -- or twenty-two percent of Americans ages 55 to 65 -- are either uninsured or
       insured through the individual insurance market. In some states, such as North Dakota,
       Texas and Nebraska, the percentage of these individuals is as high as 30 percent.

              Three million are uninsured. Some Americans ages 55 to 65 lose their
              employer-based health insurance when their spouse (frequently the husband) becomes
              eligible for Medicare. Many lose their coverage because they lose their jobs due to
              company downsizing or plant closings. Still others lose insurance when their retiree
              health coverage is dropped unexpectedly.

              Many are left to buy into an unaffordable individual insurance market, where
              premiums can be as high as $1,000 per month. Individual insurance can be
              prohibitively expensive, particularly for those who have pre-existing conditions.

       In 38 states, individual insurance policies can be denied outright. Sixteen million
       Americans ages 55 to 65 -- 76 percent of this population --live in one of the 38 states where
       individual insurance can be outright denied. This often leaves these individuals no where else
       to tum for health care coverage.

       In twenty-one states there are no protections to assure pre-existing conditions are
       covered. In these states, where 8 million, or 36 percent, of 55 to 65 year olds live, there are no
       protections against pre-existing condition exclusions in the individual market. This means that
       individuals may not be able to get coverage for the care they need most, such as diabetes
       management or cancer treatment.

       There are no protections against exorbitant premiums in forty states. In these states, where
       16 million Americans ages 55 to 65 live, individuals have no protections against exorbitant
       premiums based on age or health status ..
    UNVEILED LEGISLATION THAT ALLOWS AMERICANS NEW CHOICES TO ACCESS
    HEALTH CARE COVERAGE. The legislation unveiled on the Hill today provides new health
    insurance options for Americans ages to 55 to 65. This legislation is being introduced by a numerous
    Democrats, including both Democratic leaders [Senator Daschle and Congressman Gephardt] as well
    as all the ranking Democrats on the Committees of Jurisdiction: Senators Moynihan and Rockefeller
    and Representatives Rangel, Stark, Dingell, and Brown. It:

           Enables Americans ages 62 to 65 to buy into Medicare, by paying a premium.

           Provides displaced workers over 55 access to Medicare by offering those who have
           involuntarily lost their jobs and their health care coverage a similar Medicare buy-in option.
           Such workers have a harder time finding new jobs: only 52 percent are reemployed compared to
           over 70 percent of younger workers.

           Allows retirees ages 55 and older whose employers dropped their health coverage access
           to former employers' health plan. This allows retirees whose employers dropped their
           health coverage after they have retired buy into the employer's health plan through "COBRA"
           coverage.

    CONFIRMED THIS IS A PRUDENT, TARGETED PROPOSAL THAT GIVES AMERICANS
    AGES 55 TO 65 NEW CHOICES WITHOUT HARMING MEDICARE. The Congressional
    Budget Office recently released estimates that validate that the Medicare buy-in proposal is a carefully
    targeted policy that will not burden the Medicare Trust Fund.

           Paid for by premiums and anti-fraud and overpayment savings. Under this proposal,
           participants would pay the premium in two parts: most up front (the base premium) and a part
           after they tum 65 years old (the risk portion ofthe premium that accounts for the fact that
           less-than-healthier beneficiaries may be likely to opt for this policy). Medicare would in effect
           "loan" participants the second part of the premium until they reach 65 when they would make a
           small payment as an add on their regular Medicare Part B premium. This means there will be
           temporary costs to the Medicare program, which is paid for, dollar-for-dollar,by a series of
           anti-fraud and anti-overpayment initiatives.

           Separate Trust Fund. The buy-in takes advantage of Medicare's low administrative costs and
           choice of providers and plans, but its financing is kept completely separate from the Medicare
           Trust Fund.
