                        DRAFT FOR DISCUSSION PURPOSES ONLY
                  Outline of Possible Changes in Federal Food Safety Structure

Note: Movement of functions from one agency to another would not require opening and
negotiating the terms of the underlying statutes. The Secretary that is authorized to implement
portions of these acts would be changed, including the delegations for implementation, and
USDA's food safety mission area and agency would be modified to ensure protection of public
health.

(1) The following functions would be moved from FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied
Nutrition (CSFAN) to USDA: Food inspection, enforcement, and standard-setting/regulation
for microbial, viral, and parasitic pathogens, including seafood, eggs, milk, fruits and vegetables.
 In addition, FDA/state boards on milk and seafood would be moved to USDA, as well as the
food code, which is a model food safety code developed by FDA, other Federal agencies, and the
states.

       The following functions would remain at CFSAN - food additives, dietary supplements,
       biotechnology, chemicallpesticide/drug residues/standards. In addition, it is possible that
       food labeling under the Nutrition Labeling Act would remain at CFSAN, including meat
       and poultry products which are currently under USDA's jurisdiction.

(2) FDA would be provided with funding and staffing increases to address functional foods (i.e.
new food products making special nutritional claims), food additives, dietary supplements, and
biotechnology. Industry believes FDA lacks resources for these items.

(3) Personnel Resources-- a relatively small number of FDA field personnel with special
expertise such as imports would be moved from FDA to USDA. All other inspection
personnel would remain for FDA inspections of drugs, medical devices etc. USDA would also
need a number of senior level managers and regulatory personnel from CSFAN or FDA to be
transferred to USDA in order to ensure a successful transition.

(4) USDAIFSIS would be provided with base increase of XX million to ensure a successful
transition of these new responsibilitIes. Pending full redeployment of USDA's inspection
resources, USDA would need increased funding in order to maintain at least the level of
inspection currently provided by FDA. As redeployment proceeds over the long term, the need
for these additional funds would likely decrease.

(5) To emphasize the commitment to food safety, the name of USDA would be changed to the
U.S. Department of Food and Agriculture, with the current Under Secretary for Food Safety
becoming the Under Secretary for Public Health and Food Safety. Given the increased
responsibilities, an additional Deputy Under Secretary would be desirable (there is currently one
Deputy). All subcabinet positions would require commensurate public health backgrounds.

(6)The underlying statutes governing FDA and USDA (FFDCA, FMIA etc) would remain intact,
although one could include a directive that the Administration should develop a proposal to unify
                             Automated Records Management System
                             Hex-Dump Conversion

    the statutes. This would (1) simplify the legislation, (2) provide general consistency for
    regulated industries, and (3) avoid possible legislative attempts to weaken any of the relevant
    statutes. One possible exception should be considered. Under current law, states that
    implement meat and poultry laws may not stray into contrary forms of regulation, so inclusion of
    preemption in this transfer may generate industry support. This may be opposed by the states
    and it is unclear where the consumer community would be on this issue.

    (7)While it may perhaps be unnecessary to address consumer concerns, one should consider
    whether to include additional measures to ensure the independence offood safety from USDA's
    role of promoting agricultural commodities. Examples include the creation of a statutory
    advisory board or statutory reaffirmations of this independence.

    (8) While this would not likely be included in legislation since it is a Congressional matter, the
    Administration would support having the Public Health and Agriculture Committees share full
    jurisdiction over food safety.

    (9) Given the increased responsibilities for USDA, there would also likely be a need for
    increased resources for USDA's Office of General Counsel (perhaps by transfer from FDA) and
    for USDA's Office of Risk Assessment and Cost Benefit Analysis.
