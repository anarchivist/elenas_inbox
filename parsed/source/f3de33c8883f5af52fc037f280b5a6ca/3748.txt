Florida ruling strips major defense from
                  tobacco case

                     By Reuters, 07/31/97

                     WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. - A Florida judge ruled yesterday
that tobacco
                     companies cannot use public knowledge of the dangers of
smoking as a
                     defense, stripping cigarette makers of a key defense two
days before the
                     trial of Florida's billion-dollar Medicaid lawsuit.

                  Lawyers for both sides said the ruling, issued by Palm
Beach Circuit Judge
                  Harold Cohen, would significantly impair the industry's
ability to defend itself
                  against the lawsuit, which seeks to recover the costs of
treating
                  smoking-related illnesses.

                  --It means they have no defenses, "    said W. C. Gentry, a
lawyer representing
                  the state.

                  --By this ruling the only thing they can try to prove is
that cigarettes don't
                  cause disease, the product wasn't defective, that they
couldn't make a safer
                  cigarette," he said.

                     Jury selection in the widely watched lawsuit was
scheduled to begin
                     tomorrow, with testimony expected to start in early
September.

                  Philip Morris attorney Peter Bleakley said Cohen's
ruling could be grounds
                  for reversible error should the case go to an appeals
court.

                  Cohen himself called the ruling one of the most
important he had made in the
                  case.


                       Earlier in a day of hearings meant to determine what
     evidence the jury will be
                       allowed to consider, Cohen made other rulings
     detrimental to the industry's
                       defenses.

                          He said the companies would not be allowed to argue the
     so-called
                          "premature death benefit"   - that Florida saved money
     in its Medicaid
                          program because smokers die earlier than nonsmokers - to
     mitigate potential
                          damages.

                       "If smokers cost less than non-smokers, then the jury
     should hear about it,"
                       argued Murray Garnick, an attorney for Philip Morris.
