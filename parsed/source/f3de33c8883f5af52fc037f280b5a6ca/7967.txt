TEXT:
 Update: Lautenberg has expressed interest in bringing up his .08
 amendment on appropriations. Begala and Stein both think this is a good
 idea. Leg affairs says our vote in the Senate Transportation approps
 committee isn't a sure thing and we may lose Byrd.  Jose' notes that a
·full Senate vote may be better than going through the committee process.
 On the House side, the chairman of the transportation approps subcommittee
 (Wolf) is a strong supporter, so we may be able to get it in
 subcommittee. However, it would be a challenge surviving full approps and
 the Rules Committee to get it to the House floor.  In any case, it
 shouldn't come up before the week of June 15th.

I'll be on a conference call with WH Leg, Lautenberg, and DOT in the next
two days to discuss strategy. Let me know if you all have any ideas.
Thanks!
