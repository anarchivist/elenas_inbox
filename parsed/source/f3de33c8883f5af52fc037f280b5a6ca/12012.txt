  TEXT:


  since Rep. LaFalce is traveling over the recess, Legislative Affairs
  strongly recommends postponing the Consumer Financial Event until Congress
  returns to Washington the week of April 12. LaFalce very much wants to be
  here when we have this event, and would be upset if we went ahead without
  him.  In any case, the event would be more effective if we wait until
  Members are back in town and able to attend.
