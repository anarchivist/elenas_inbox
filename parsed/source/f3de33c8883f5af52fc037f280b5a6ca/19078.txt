TEXT:
I'm sure you too got calls from Marcia, Judy etc today. Actually mine
began about 15mins after I left the meeting.  personally I wished our
collegues would work within our group, but that is another
conversation ........... .

Personally I think we should seriously consider getting behind Daschle.    I
spoke with Susan Liss and she and Ron I think concurr with this ...... I'm
sure they will talk to you about it.

Politically, we need to look for an announcement here.   I'd like for you
all to consider the consequences of endorsing Daschle.
