     TEXT:
     You asked about the status of the MOUs between the Department of Labor and
     the EEOC that were announced at the Equal Pay event on April 2 by the Vice
     President. The "damages" MOU (that permits the Office of Federal
     Contractor Compliance to serve as EEOC's agent for purposes of seeking
     damages within the context of their conciliation efforts) is almost
     completed.  This is the MOU that the women's groups are mostly concerned
     with.

     This MOU, which will go out for notice and comment, has been cleared by
     OMB and Labor. WH Legis Affairs is fine with us proceeding with the MOU
     now that the confirmation and appropriations process is over.  EEOC will
     have to vote on it, and then they will send it out for comment. Assuming
     that EEOC votes to proceed, they are planning on sending it out for
     comment soon.

     However, last May, Rep. Fawell sent letters to both the EEOC and OFCCP
     indicating that he thought the "damages" MOU would radically increase
     OFCCP's authority.  Both EEOC and OFCCP have responded to Fawell, either
     orally or in writing, and explained that the change would be narrow in
     scope and would further the efficient resolution of these cases.

     In order for the damages MOU to move forward, we need three things to
     happen: (1) the EEOC and OFCCP need to send the final version of the
     document to OMB for clearance (we understand that it is near completion);
      (2) for the agencies to make sure that Rep. Fawell has all of the
     information that he needs, to make sure that he understands the nature of
     the agreement; and (3) for us to be comfortable that the release of the
     MOU will not jeopardize either the EEOC or OFCCP appropriations process.

     I talked to Ellen Varygas about the timing tonight, and she agrees with
     the three things that still need to be done.  I am waiting to hear back
     from the Department of Labor regarding their sense of timing in order not
     to jeopardize the appropriations process. However, both EEOC (Ellen
     Vargyas) and Labor agree that we could not do this before the middle of
     August at the earliest.
