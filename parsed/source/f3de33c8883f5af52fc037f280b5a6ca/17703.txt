           PRESIDENT CLINTON ANNOUNCES NEW LAW ENFORCEMENT
           AND EDUCATIONAL INITIATIVES TO COMBAT HATE CRIMES
                             November 10,1997


            Today President Clinton convenes a White House Conference on Hate Crimes
designed to call national attention to the problem of hate crimes. The President will announce
initiatives to increase enforcement of hate crime laws and to promote educational strategies to
address the problem. The President will announce support for bipartisan legislation to expand
the principal federal hate crimes statute to include gender, sexual orientation, and disability.
Recognizing that much of the effort to prevent and combat hate crimes must occur at the
community level, the President will announce the creation of a nationwide network of local hate
crime working groups centered around the country's United State Attorney's offices.

Expansion of Federal Hate Crimes Law. The President will announce the Administration's
support for legislation to expand the principal federal hate crimes statute. This law currently
prohibits hate crimes only on the basis of race, color, religion, or national origin. The Clinton
Administration's proposed amendment would extend the law to prohibit hate crimes based on
gender, sexual orientation, and disability. The President has garnered bipartisan support for this
legislation, realizing that hate crimes are not a partisan issue. Senators Kennedy and Specter are
expected to introduce this legislation shortly after the Conference.

        Recognizing that most hate crimes are and should be prosecuted and investigated at the
local and state level, the Administration supports several limiting principles that would reduce
the number of cases actually investigated and prosecuted by the federal government. These
limiting principles will be contained in the legislative language itself and in internal guidance to
federal investigators and prosecutors.

Creation of a Network of Local Hate Crime Working Groups. The President will announce
that each U.S. Attorney will either establish a local hate crime working group in his or her
district, or if such a body already exists, actively participate in the group. These working
groups--essentially federal-state-local partnerships-- would include representation from the U.S.
Attorney's office, the FBI, state and local law enforcement, state and local prosecutors' offices,
and advocacy groups. In addition to addressing law enforcement strategies, the groups will seek
to educate the public about hate crimes. A National Hate Crimes Working Group, located at the
Main Justice, would coordinate the work of all the working groups across the country. As part
of this coordinating function, the National Hate Crimes Working Group would distribute, on an
ongoing basis, information on promising practices.

Additional FBI Agents for Hate Crimes Enforcement. The President will announce support
for the assignment of over 40 FBI agents and prosecutors to the task of hate crimes
                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion ·

enforcement. The allocation of this substantial number of federal investigators and prosecutors
reaffirms the Clinton's Administration's commitment to getting tough on hate crimes.

Hate Crimes Training for Law Enforcement. In addition to committing substantial resources
to hate crime law enforcement, the President will announce the development of a model law
enforcement training curriculum on hate crimes that can be incorporated into programs at local
and state law enforcement training centers. This curriculum includes three course segments --
one for law enforcement officers, one for investigators, and one for others in the law enforcement
field. This curriculum will be available for use across the country in 30 days.

Make 'em Pay Initiative. The President will announce an initiative to assist victims of hate
crimes and discrimination in housing to seek monetary damages from the perpetrators. The
Department of Housing and Urban Development has created a unit that will bring civil suits on
behalf of residents of public and private housing who have suffered hate crimes and other
discrimination. This initiative will be accomplished through the reallocation of existing
resources.

Improved Reporting of Hate Crimes Statistics. Recognizing the need for greater collection of
statistics on hate crimes, the President will announce the addition of questions about hate crimes
in the National Crime Victimization Survey, an annual survey conducted by the Department of
Justice's Bureau of Justice Statistics to measure levels of crime through a national sampling of
victims of crime. At present, this surv~y does not include questions about hate crimes.
Beginning in 1998, the Department of Justice will include questions related to hate crime in
NCVS. The survey will inquire whether the victim believes the incident was bias-motivated and
why. Expanded questioning regarding hate crimes will also be a part of a pilot project to take
place next spring to improve the NCVS.

Educational Initiatives Directed toward Children. The President will also announce two
new educational initiatives. First, the Departments of Justice and Education have proposed a
manual for educators on preventing youth hate crime that encourages schools to confront
hate-motivated behavior among students; promotes development of comprehensive,
programmatic responses to prejudice and violence; and makes educators aware of resources that
can be used for this purpose. The Departments intend to send this resource guide to every
school in the country. Second, the Department of Justice has created a new website, "Hateful
Acts Hurt Kids," addressing prejudice, discrimination, and related issues in an interactive,
graphic format designed for children in kindergarten through fifth grade, as well as their parents
and teachers. This site will be available for viewing at the Conference.

                           DRA WING A LINE AGAINST HATE CRIMES


                    The Clinton Administration:      rIghting Hate in Our Communities

         On October 22, 1997, a federal grand jury returned a one count indictment in United States v.
         Bybee, charging Greg Bybee with violating one count of federal civil rights statute. On
         December 27, 1996, the victims, a Native American and African American interracial couple,
         were assaulted and threatened with a firearm by the defendant at the home of the female victim's
         father on an Indian reservation in Boise, Idaho.

        In Richland, Mississippi, four members of a neo-Nazi skinhead organization, pled guilty to
        conspiracy and interfering with the housing rights of an interracial couple by throwing a
        molotov cocktail at their trailer home.

        Three defendants, one of whom is a racist skinhead and a member of the white supremacist
        group "South Bay Nazi Youth," were convicted of a civil rights conspiracy after they drove
        through the streets of Lubbock, Texas, hunting African-American men, luring them to the
        conspirators' car and shooting the men at close range with a short-barreled shotgun. One
        victim died, one was seriously wounded in the face and another had a finger blown off.

        In Livingston, Texas, six defendants pled guilty to civil rights charges for beating randomly
        selected African-American men with a rifle and a rodeo belt buckle, and punching them
        repeatedly as they tried to escape. The defendants had been angered at seeing other black men
        in the presence of white women. The adult defendants were given prison sentences ranging
        from 20 to 43 months.

        In Livermore Falls, Maine, two defendants were sentenced to almost 6 years and almost 7 years
        following their guilty pleas to civil rights charges after threatening four Latino victims, chasing
        them by car from the store, and firing shots at the victims' fleeing car, wounding one victim in
        the arm.

                       Fighting Hate Crimes Through Tough Law Enforcement

Vigorously Prosecuting Hate Crimes Under the Civil Rights Statutes.      Several distinct federal
statutes provide jurisdiction to prosecute hate crimes -- crimes where the perpetrator selects his
victim on the basis of certain characteristics such as race, color, religion, and national origin.
Since 1989, over 500 defendants in more than half of the 50 states have been convicted on
federal criminal civil rights charges for interfering with various federally protected rights of
minority VICtIms. Virtually all defendants charged in these cases have been convicted.
President Clinton's Justice Department has vigorously prosecuted hate crime incidents,
                                                                         Hex-Dump Conversion ·

particularly where the defendants were members of organized hate groups, such as the Ku Klux
Klan, The Order, and various skinhead gangs.

Enhanced Penalties For Hate Crimes. As part of the historic 1994 Crime Act, the President
signed the Hate Crimes Sentencing Enhancement which provides for longer sentences where the
offense is determined to be a hate crime. In 1996 alone, 27 cases received enhanced sentences.

The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) Provides Expertise in Arson and Explosives
Investigations to Help Fight Hate Crimes Throughout America. While enforcing explosives and
arson laws over which it has jurisdiction, ATF has participated in the investigations of bombing
and arson incidents at predominantly gay bars such as the incidents reported in Atlanta. For
example, in the bombing of the gay nightclub, which occurred on February 21,1997, the ATF
joined the FBI in a task force headed by the U.S. Attorney.

Gun Regulation Helps Stem the Flow Of Firearms that can Fuel Hate Group Activity. Many
organized hate groups use guns to carry out violent offenses covered by hate crime statutes.
Treasury bureaus work to intercept gun shipments into the U.S. and to regulate the illegal sale
and possession of firearms by potential perpetrators of hate crimes and other offenses.

Targeting Ignorance:

Focusing on Youth Attitudes that Create Hate Crimes.    The Department of Education is
supporting efforts at the local level to develop and implement innovative effective strategies for
preventing and reducing incidences of crimes and conflicts motivated by hate in localities directly
affected by hate crimes. The Department has funded programs aimed at reducing violent
behavior among youth motivated by hate or bias.

Understanding the Problem of Hate Crimes:

Gathering Information on the National Scope of the Problem. The FBI Uniform Crime Report
collects the only national data on hate crimes through the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR)
Program, and has established guidelines for the collection of such data, and criteria for a finding
of prejudice. In 1996, 11,355 law enforcement agencies across the country participated in the
data collection efforts, representing 84 of the nation's population. From these departments
alone, there were 8,734 reported incidents of hate cimes in 1996.[FBI, Uniform Crime Report --
Crime in the United States 1996, 1997]

Studying Anti-Gay Hate Crimes: The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) has funded
the first large-scale study of the mental health consequences of hate crimes. The preliminary
principal findings of this research are that hate crimes based on sexual orientation appear to have
more serious psychological effects on lesbian and gay men than do other non-bias motivated
cnmes. The study also provides information about the prevalence of anti-gay hate crimes, the
                                                                       Hex-Dump Conve:-sion · .

rate at which these crimes are reported to the police, and the prevalence of other harassment and
discrimination against gay men and lesbians.

Prosecuting Hate Crimes Aimed At Our Houses of Worship:

Fighting Hate Crimes Aimed at Houses o/Worship. The President fought for and signed the
Church Arson Protection Act of 1996, which facilitates prosecutions of racially motivated arsons
and other acts of desecration against houses of worship.

Creating the National Church Arson Task Force.   President Clinton established the National
Church Arson' Task Force in June 1996 to oversee the investigation and prosecution of these
cases, in response to an outpouring of national concern over arsons at houses of worship around
the country. The NCATF has brought together the FBI, ATF, Justice Department prosecutors,
and the Community Relations Service, in partnership with the state and local law enforcement
officers and prosecutors. Well over 200 ATF and FBI investigators have been deployed in these
investigations. In addition, the NCATF has coordinated with other agencies, such as the federal
Emergency Management Agency and the Department of Housing and Urban Development, in
the federal government's efforts to promote arson prevention and in providing resources for
church rebuilding.                             .

>      Many of the 508 incidents investigated have been solved, mainly by a combination of
       federal and state arrests and prosecutions. Since January 1995, arrests of 240 suspects
       have been made. The 240 arrests have led to over 100 convictions, including the first
       convictions under the 1995 Church Arson Prevention Act, 18 U.S.c. 247, as amended.
       This rate of arrest (35 ) for crimes that may have been motivated by hate or bias is more
       than double the 16 rate of arrestfor arsons in general. As of June 1997, Federal, state,
       and local prosecutors have successfully convicted no defendants in connection with fires
       at 77 houses of worship since January 1995. [Treasury]


Working with Communities Against Hate

Bringing Communities Together to Fight Hate. The Department of Justice's Gommunity Relations
Service often becomes involved when a hate crime incident threatens harmonious racial and
ethnic relations. When a hate crime takes place, the Service uses mediation to provide
representatives of community groups and local governments with an impartial forum to restore
stability through dialogue and discussion. It conducts training conferences on hate crime
prevention and response for state and local law enforcement and other governmental agencies,
academic institutions and civic, business and community organizations. The Community
Relations Service assists local government and organizations in appropriate contingency planning
to ensure that marches, demonstrations and similar events occur without exacerbating racial and
ethnic tensions.
                                                                     Hex-Dump Conve:-sion ·


Fighting Intolerance in our Schools and Communities. The Clinton Administration also supports
several desegregation centers. These centers have provided training and technical assistance on
hate and bias crimes, and have developed model programs and practices. The desegregation
centers and policies and have identified programs that are working in schools to prevent the
behavior that leads to hate crimes.[Department of Education, 10/97]

                 WHITE HOUSE CONFERENCE ON HATE CRIMES
                         QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
                            NOVEMBER 10, 1997

Q:   What is a hate crime?

A:   As a general matter, a hate crime, also known as a bias crime, is a crime that is
     committed against a person or property that is motivated, in whole or part, by the
     offender's bias against the victim's race, color, religion, gender, national origin, sexual
     orientation, disability, or familial status. However, it is important to understand that hate
     crimes are defined by various federal and state criminal statutes, and these statutory
     definitions differ in their particulars from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. The principal
     federal hate crimes statute, for example, is limited to crimes committed because of the
     victim's race, color, religion or national origin; it does not include crimes committed
     because of the victim's gender, sexual orientation, or disability.

Q:   Is the President supporting an expansion of the definition of a hate crime? Is he
     supporting changes to current federal law?

A:   I have called a conference on hate crimes for November 10, 1997. One of the issues that
     will be considered at the conference is whether the statutory definition ofthe principal
     federal hate crimes statute should be expanded.

Q:   What policy announcements will you make at the Hate Crimes Conference?

A:   I will make significant policy announcements regarding law enforcement and prevention,
     including initiatives regarding FBI resources, training for law enforcement officials, and
     statistical reporting.

Q:   Is the Hate Crimes Conference part of the Race Initiative?

A:   The Hate Crimes Conference addresses the same basic ideas behind the Race Initiative.
     In both cases, I would like to create a dialogue so that people can discuss the issue and
     learn about their differences. While the Hate Crimes Conference coincides with the Race
     Initiative in many ways, the Hate Crimes Conference encompasses more than racial
     differences but also differences in religious beliefs, sexual orientation, gender, and
     disability. Members of the President's Initiative on Race are actively participating in the
     Hate Crimes Conference as well as at some of the 45 or so satellite sites across the
     country.


Q:   Is the Oklahoma City bombing case a hate crime? Is the President speaking out on
     hate crimes now because of the McVeigh and Nichols trials?

A:   It would be inappropriate for me to comment about the Oklahoma City bombing case,
                                                                     Hex-DiJmp Conversion
     since Mr. McVeigh's case is on appeal and the Nichols trial is currently pemding.
     However, this is an issue I have always felt strongly about. I believe that hate crimes are
     a scourge on our society as a whole, and that we need to get tough on hate.

Q:   Is the bombing of an abortion clinic a hate crime?

A:   It depends on the circumstances. Ifthe bombing is motivated by the perpetrator's gender-
     based bias, then the crime could violate a hate crimes statute if the statute defines hate
     crimes to include this type of conduct when it is motivated by gender bias. The principal
     federal hate crimes statute currently does not prohibit conduct motivated by gender-based
     bias.


Q:   Why are there disparities in the hate crimes statistics reported? Why don't we know
     whether the number of hate crimes committed is going up or down?

A:   Hate crimes statistics vary widely because hate crimes are under reported. There are
             several reasons why this happens. First, hate crimes reporting by state and local
     law     enforcement agencies is voluntary under current law. Second, many of the most
     likely targets of hate crimes also are the least likely to report incidents to the police. For
             example, 60% of the victims of anti-gay incidents who reported their incidents to
     private         tracking groups did not report the incidents to the police, in many cases
     because of a fear       of mistreatment or unwanted exposure. Third, state and local
     jurisdictions often have        disincentives to classify and compile statistics relating to
     hate crimes. Tracking hate crimes      may require law enforcement agencies to do
     additional investigative work to determine the          motivation behind crimes.
     Nonetheless, the number of hate crimes actually reported to            the FBI has increased
     over the past several years, from 2,771 in 1991 to 7,947 in 1995.

                        HATE CRIMES -- BACKGROUND PAPER

Some Federal Statutes Relating to Hate Crimes

·     18 V.S.c. § 245, the principal federal hate crimes statute, prohibits the use of force or
      threats of force against individuals because oftheir race, color, religion or national origin
      and because of their participation in one of the following six "federally protected
      activities:" (1) enrolling in or attending public school or college, (2) participating in or
      enjoying any service, program, facility or activity provided or administered by any State
      or local governrnent, (3) applying for or enjoying employment, (4) serving as a juror in
      state court, (5) traveling in or using any facility of interstate commerce, and (6) enjoying
      the goods or services of a place of public accommodation.

             ·       Section 245 has significant limitations: (1) the statute does not prohibit
                     conduct that is based on gender, sexual orientation, or disability, and (2) it
                     does not apply unless the victim is engaged in one of the enumerated
                     federally protected rights at the time of the offense.

·     42 V.S.c. § 3631, enacted in 1968 as part of the Fair Housing Act, prohibits
      housing-related violence based on race, color, religion, national origin, gender, disability,
      or familial status.

·     The Hate Crimes Statistics Act directs the Attorney General to collect statistics on crimes
      based on race, religion, sexual orientation, disability, or ethnicity.

             ·       The Act contains no requirement that jurisdictions report hate crimes, nor
                     does it provide funding as an incentive to encourage reporting by state and
                     local jurisdictions. As a result, statistics collected pursuant to the Act are
                     incomplete.

             ·       In addition, the Act does not require the collection of gender-based hate
                     cnmes.

·     The Sentencing Enhancement Act, passed as part of the 1994 crime bill, authorizes the
      imposition of enhanced sentences for federal crimes found to have been motivated by
      race, color, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, or disability. The Act
      became effective in November 1995.
                                                                          Hex-Dump Conversion .

Hate Crimes Statistics

·     Hate crimes statistics are maintained by the FBI, by some state and local law enforcement
      agencies, and by several private organizations. The number of hate crimes reported to law
      enforcement officials has increased over the past several years, but because of
      under-reporting and other factors it remains uncertain whether the total number of hate
      crimes committed in the United States is going up or down. In any event, the numbers are
      large.

       ·      The FBI has released reports on hate crimes statistics, based on reporting from
              state and local agencies, each year since 1991. In 1991,2771 state and local
              agencies reported a total of 4,558 bias motivated incidents to the FBI. In 1995,
              95845 state and local agencies reported a total of 7947 such incidents to the FBI.
              The fact that many jurisdictions, including several large jurisdictions, report to the
              FBI that they have no hate crimes leads many to conclude that the FBI's statistics
             'present an incomplete picture of the national situation.

       ·     Several private groups track hate crimes. Some track all types of hate crimes,
             while others focus their efforts on tracking hate crimes against certain
                      constituencies, such as gays and lesbians, Jews, Arab-Americans,Muslim-
                      Americans, Asian-Americans, etc. Statistics kept by these groups tend to
             differ significantly from statistics kept by the FBI. First, some victims of hate
             crimes report their experiences to a group but not to the FBI. Second, several of
             the groups count incidents of verbal harassment as hate crimes even though such
             incidents do not constitute crimes in most states.

      ·      All of the reporting systems are plagued by under reporting, for which there are
             several reasons.

              ·      First, many ofthe most likely targets of hate crimes also are the least likely
                     to report incidents to the police. For example, 60% of the victims of
                     anti-gay incidents who reported their incidents to private groups did not
                     report the incidents to the police, in many cases because of a fear of
                     mistreatment or unwanted exposure. Similarly, many hate crimes victims
                     in immigrant communities do not report incidents to the police because
                     they fear reprisals or deportation.

             ·       Second, state and local jurisdiction often have disincentives to classify and
                     compile statistics relating to hate crimes. Tracking hate crimes may require
                     law enforcement agencies to perform additional investigative work to
                     determine the motivation behind crimes. In addition, some local political
                     leaders may believe that it would exacerbate racial tensions or harm their
                     jurisdictions' reputations to acknowledge that crimes committed in their
                     cities or towns were motivated by bias.
