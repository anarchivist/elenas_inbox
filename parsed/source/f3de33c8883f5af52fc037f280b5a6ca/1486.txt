TEXT:
1. Liquor letter
   2. Welfare Privatization

1. Liquor letter -- I ran into Sylvia last night who expressed
reservations about the liquor letter.   She wondered whether it was
defensible not to take on beer and wine as well as hard liquor.    I went
over the arguments, which part of the conversation I can recount to you if
you want.  She wanted t,o know whether anyone had checked wi th ATF, which
apparently has been sort of thinking about whether it makes sense to treat
beer and wine differently from other alcohol since you can now take a malt
product, add fruit flavoring, and make it taste like a mixed drink.    It's
fine to check, but I emphasized that the letter was in no way, shape or
form about substantive regulation -- only repeating the President's
position that dropping the voluntary ban was an undesirable thing.

Sylvia was going to talk to Bruce.  I don't know how strong her
reservations are, but if this is going to happen next week, you might need
to tack this down today.  Let me or Jon know if you want any help:

2. Welfare Privatization -- I saw Andy Stern last night who said that
there's a meeting with the President and union leaders on this subject on
Friday.
