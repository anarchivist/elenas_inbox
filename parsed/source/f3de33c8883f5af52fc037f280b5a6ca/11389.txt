TEXT:
Here is a draft --see what you think.      I have 2 additional q's on this:

1) Do we need to incorporate ed-flex into the letter? The current draft
focuses solely on class size.

2) Should we include more specific references to our accountability agenda?=========

This is an important turning point in American education. We have an historic
opportunity to work together to make the targeted investments needed to improve our
schools and help prepare all of our children for the 21st century.

This week, Senator Murray and others will offer a measure to build on our bipartisan
efforts begun last year to reduce class size and finish the job by authorizing the class size
reduction initiative for the next six years. Last year, I proposed this initiative to reduce class
size in the early grades -- when children learn to read and get a solid foundation in the
basics --by hiring 100,000 well-prepared teachers over seven years. Congress enacted a down
payment on this request with bipartisan support, providing a one-time $1.2 billion appropriation
to help communities hire approximately 30,000 teachers nationwide.

Under the initiative enacted into law last year, school districts will begin to receive funding this
July 1 in order to hire teachers to begin reducing class sizes this fall. While last year's one-year
appropriation provided an important start on our initiative, Senator Murray's measure would
authorize a total of $12.6 billion over seven years to help communities across the nation support
100,000 well-prepared teachers.

For the sake of our children and our schools, I am asking you to support this effort to
reduce class sizes across this nation for years to come.

This measure will give local school districts full confidence in our resolve to fund this initiative in
the coming years. It will support effective local planning by signalling our bipartisan
commitment just when school districts are beginning to make decisions about how to implement
this new initiative. Most importantly, it will help reduce class size and improve performance in
reading and basic skills in schools across the nation.

As parents and teachers across America understand, smaller classes can make a profound
difference for our children.    Studies show that smaller classes help teachers provide more
personal attention to students and spend less time on discipline; as a result students learn more
and get a stronger foundation in the basic skills. Students from smaller classes outperform their
peers in larger classes, and reduced class size can make the greatest difference for minority and
disadvantaged students.

There is no better way to prepare for the 21st century than investing in quality education for all of
our children. I look forward to working with you to seize this opportunity to improve education
by approving this important measure and, as the year progresses, on a broad agenda to strengthen
the quality of our public schools.
