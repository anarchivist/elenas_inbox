         Governor TBD makes 5 minute presentation on topic; POTUS/Cabinet
         responds        CLOSED
         Governor TBD makes 5 minute presentation on topic; POTUS/Cabinet
         responds        CLOSED

         NGA wants to raise the following as discussion topics:

                  Education (Ed-Flex & Accountability)
                  Tobacco Recoupment

         Our potential topics:

         Education (Class Size/Modernization): We could also consider taking the
         offensive on NGA concerns with our education agenda in the President's
         opening remarks ... propose legislation on Ed-Flex, address state concerns
         with our accountabilty initiative.

         Livability/Lands Legacy:     Huge initiative that the states have not fully
         comprehended.

         Social Security: A priority      issue for us, but Governors are not natural
         stakeholders.   The majority     of Governors, particularly those from the
         states most impacted (CA, MA,     LA,) are unified in their opposition to
         proposals mandating that new     state and local government workers contribute
         to Social Security.

         Long Term Care

         Welfare To Work: We could announce that we are taking back all the states
         unused welfare money and issue some new regulations and mandates.
