                  AMERICA HITS ALL-TIME HIGH HOMEOWNERSHIP RATE
                                           October 23, 1997

In 1994, President Clinton, along with the National Partners in Homeownership, set a goal for the nation
to achieve an all-time high homeownership rate by the year 2000. Today -- a full three years early -- the
Census Bureau reported that in the third quarter of1997 the homeownership rate dimbed to its highest
level ever. Here are some of the results fi-om the Census report, as well as other housing-sector statistics:

·   Highest Homeownership Rate in American History. In the third quarter of 1997, the
    homeowners hip rate climbed to 66.0 percent from 65.7 percent in the second quarter. The
    homeownership rate is now at its highest level ever. The previous record high was 65.8 percent
    in the third quarter of 1980.

·   Largest Increase in Homeownership on Record Mter falling from 65.6 percent in the first quarter
    of 1981 to 63.7 percent in the first quarter of 1993, homeownership is on the rise again. Since
    the first quarter of 1993, the homeowners hip rate has increased from 63.7 percent to 66.0 percent
    today -- that's the largest 4 1h-year rise in homeowners hip on record.

·   5.8 Million New Homeowners Under Clinton-Gore Administration. Since the beginning of 1993, the
    number of homeowners has increased by 5.8 million. In the third quarter of 1997 alone, there were
    462,000 new homeowners, and so far in 1997, there have been 1.3 million new homeowners.

·   Half a Million More African-American Homeowners. The National Partners in Homeownership is
    trying to increase housing opportunities for all Americans. Since established, there have been
    523,000 more Mrican-American homeowners. There is still work to be done: Mrican-American
    homeownership rate is still far below that of all households (45.8 percent vs. 66.0 percent).

·   Nearly Half a Million More Hispanic Homeowners. Since the end of 1994, the number of
    Hispanic homeowners has increased by 463,000, but the Hispanic homeownership rate is still just
    two-thirds of the overall homeownership rate.

·   1.2 Million More FamiliesLiving in Cities Own a Home. Since the fourth quarter of 1994, the
    homeownership rate for families living in cities has increased from 48.2 percent to 50.2 percent --
    that translates into 1.2 million more families living in cities who own their own home.

·   Record-High Home Sales. In August 1997, existing home sales were 16 percent higher than in
    January 1993 (4.3 million vs. 3.7 million at an annual rate) --existing home sales are now at their
    highest level on record. [Source: National Association of Realtors]

·   Housing Starts Are Up 24 Percent Since 1993. Housing starts have increased from an annual rate
    of 1.2 million in January 1993 to 1.5 million in August 1997 -- that's an increase of 24 percent.

·   1.1 Million New Construction Jobs -- Faster Rate of Growth Than Any Administration Since Truman.
    Mter losing 667,000 jobs in construction during the previous four years, l.l million new
    construction jobs have been added since January 1993 -- that's a faster annual rate than any other
    Statistics survey.)




PRESIDENT CLINTON'S ECONOMIC STRATEGY HAS HELPED MAKE THE AMERICAN DREAM
A REALITY FOR MILLIONS OF AMERICANS. In 1993, President Clinton put in place a three-part
economic strategy: reduce the deficit, invest in the people, and open markets. Lower deficits helped lead
to lower mortgage rates, more jobs, and higher family incomes, which -- along with the National
Homeownership Strategy -- has led to more affordable homes and the highest homeownership in
American history.

·   Homes More Affordable Under Clinton-Gore Administration. According to data from the National
    Association of Realtors, homes have been more affordable during the Clinton-Gore Administration
    than during any other Administration since Richard Nixon was President. [Source: Based on data from the
    National Association of Realtors)


·   Cut Dejiot 8796. In 1992, the deficit was $290 billion -- a record dollar high.                       This year, the
    deficit is projected to fall to $37 billion -- the lowest deficit in 24 years.            [Source: OMB)


·   Lowest Mortgage Rates in 30 Years. Experts -- such as Alan Greenspan, Business Week, and
    Fortune -- agree that the deficit reduction from the President's 1993 Economic Plan led to a drop
    in long-term interest rates. Mortgage rates have averaged just 7.8 under President Clinton --
    lower than under President Reagan (12.8 ), President Bush (9.5 ), or any Administration since
    Lyndon Johnson was President.        [Source: Depanment of Treasury, Office of Economic Policy.)

            Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve Board Chairman, 1131/94: 'The actions taken last year to reduce the federal
            budget deficit have been instrumental in creating the basis for declining inflation expectations and easing
            pressures on long-term interest rates."

             Business Week, 5/19/97: "Clinton's 1993 budget cuts, which reduced projected red ink by more than $400 billion
            over five years, sparked a major drop in interest rates that helped boost investment in all the equipment and
            systems that brought forth the New Age economy of technological innovation and rising productivity."

             Fortune, 1013/94: "[President Clinton's 1993] economic plan helped bring interest rates down, spurring the recovery."

·   Lower Mortgage Rates Saved Families Thousands. According to the New York Times and::r:: :>
    Money magazine, lower interest rates under the Clinton-Gore Administration have saved the 1
    million families who refinanced their home mortgages $1,000 to $2,000 per year, on average. 3l ;~

             HOMEOWNERSHIP EASIER AND MORE AFFORDABLE

·   National Homeownership Strategy. In 1995, at the request of President Clinton, the
    Administration convened the National Partners in Homeownership to carry out a National
    Homeownership Strategy. The Partnership, an unprecedented public-private effort, consists
    of 65 leading national organizations and 131 local partnerships. All of the key leaders in
    housing are a part of this partnership. These Partners have made significant strides in
    working together to increase housing production, reduce regulatory barriers, and expand
    homeownership opportunities for all Americans. A National Homeownership Summit
    attended by President Clinton attracted 1,400 people in June 1996; the Partnership launched
    a National Homeownership Week in June 1997; and this past year more than 600 events,
    such as homebuyer fairs, took place across the country.

·   Lowered Closing Costs By $1,200 for Qualified First-Time Home Buyers.       The Clinton
    Administration has cut FHA home mortgage insurance premiums four times. One
    reduction, applying to all first-time 'homebuyers with FHA-insured mortgages, will save
    homebuyers $200 in closing costs on the average FHA mortgage of $85,000. Another will
    save first-time homebuyers in central cities an additional $200. In all, cuts approved by
    President Clinton have cut average FHA closing costs fOr first-time homebuyers by $1,200
    around the country and will cut closing costs by $1,400 in central dties. Last year, FHA
    providedfinancingfor 800,000 homeowners, many ofwhom were first-time homebuyers--
    and many of these families would not be homeowners if it were not for the actions taken by
    the Clinton Administration.

·   Making It Easier to Qualify for Mortgage Loans. The FHA has eliminated unnecessary and
    overly strict requirements under its loan program that made it difficult for many families to
    qualify for mortgage loans. It has also given lenders greater flexibility to make
    homeownership possible for more nontraditional borrowers, and has clarified certain
    underwriting requirements so they are not applied in a discriminatory manner. With these
    improvements, thousands more families are eligible for FHA-insured home loans. It also
    streamlined its underwriting criteria, consolidated operations, and improved its performance.
     The cost savings from these improvements have resulted in cost savings to consumers.

·   Penalty-Free IRA Withdrawals for the Purchase of a First Home.   The Balanced Budget Act
    signed into law by President Clinton in August 1997 expands Individual Retirement
    Accounts (IRAs) to allow penalty-free withdrawals for first-time home purchases.

·   Capital Gains Exdusion for Homeowners. The tax cut President Clinton signed into law
    allows couples to exclude from tax up to $500,000 in capital gains from the sale of a home.
    (Single taxpayers could exclude up to $250,000.) This tax cut for homeowners exempts.
    over 99 percent of home sales from the capital-gains tax, dramatically simplifying taxes, and
    record keeping for more than 60 million homeowners.

·   Streamlined HOME Program to Help Home Buyers. HUD has streamlined the HOME
    Program, helping an additional 23,000 families become home owners in 1996 alone. The
    HOME program allocates funds to local jurisdictions and is an important resource for
    potential first-time home buyers who may need down-payment assistance or help carrying


·   . First-Time Homebuyer Tax Credit in Washington, DC. The Balanced Budget agreement
     President Clinton signed into law in August 1997 included a $5,000 tax credit for first-time
     homebuyers in the District of Columbia.

·   Helping Localities Convert Abandoned Properties into Homes for Low-Income Families. HUD
    redesigned its Single Family Home Sales program to allow pre-approved nonprofit
    organizations and government entities to purchase abandoned HUD-owned properties at
    discounted prices. Since the program was created in 1993, more than 6,200 properties have
    been sold to non-profits and localities ..

·    Reinventing HUD and the FHA The FHA has automated its functions, using new technology
     and streamlining to serve lenders and home owners more efficiently. Staff savings from this
     process have already exceeded $2.4 million, allowing HUD to function more efficiently with
     lower costs. The FHA has also cut from 6-8 weeks to a matter of hours, the length of time it
     takes to issue mortgage insurance.

·    Officer Next Door. In June 1997, the Clinton-Gore Administration established the Officer
     Next Door program to stabilize communities and create safe neighborhoods. This program
     will enable 2,000 police officers to buy HUD-owned inner-city homes at half price.

·    Homeownership Zones. The Clinton-Gore Administration has sponsored important
     initiatives to revitalize urban neighborhoods and empower residents. In April 1997, HUD
     announced that the Homeownership Zone Program will provide $90.8 million in grants and
     loan guarantees to six cities. The assistance will help about 2,000 families become owners
     of newly built or rehabilitated single-family homes, while attracting new businesses.


·     Revised Community Reinvestment Act To Emphasize Results, Instead of Paperwork.
      The gains under the revised Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) have been substantial.
      Since 1993, new commitments for low- and moderate-income loans totaling more than $175
      billion -- more than 80 percent of the total loan commitment under CRA since the law was
      enacted in 1977. Between 1993 and 1996 mortgage originations for Hispanic Americans
      and African-Americans increased 56 percent and 55 percent, respectively -- more than three
    . times the 14 percent increase for white borrowers. Since 1993, home loans in low- and
      moderate-income geographies increased 33 percent, while gaining only 21 percent in
      upper-income geographies.

·    Instituted Fair Lending Initiatives. The Department of Housing and Urban Development
     signed 141 "Fair Housing Best Practices" agreements with real estate industry leaders such as
     mortgage bankers and realtors. In these agreements, the industry leaders pledge to exceed their
     responsibilities under the Fair Housing Act. Moreover, HUD implemented goals for Fannie Mae
     and Freddie Mac, two government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs). Between 1993 and 1996,
     Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac purchased over one million mortgage made to low- and
     moderate-income homebuyers. Close to 450,000 of the GSE loan purchases were for first-time·
     homebuyers.
    receive rental vouchers from HUD under the Section 8 Program to convert rental vouchers into
    Empowerment Vouchers that will.enable them to buy a home under legislation expected to
    become law. Freddie Mac has announced a commitment to purchase up to 2,000 of the
    mortgages originated by private lenders.
