Subject: GOP Tries To Stop Clinton's Ban on Discrimination of Gays

Scripps Howard News Service, July 7, 1998
GOP Tries To Stop Clinton's Ban on Discrimination of Gays
By JOAN LOWY
      WASHINGTON -- Republican lawmakers will attempt next week to approve
legislation preventing President Clinton from implementing his recent
executive order barring discrimination against gays and lesbians in the
federal workplace.
      The Republican effort follows controversial remarks by several GOP
leaders regarding homosexuality and sets the stage for a showdown between
conservatives and the president over gay rights just four months before the
midterm election.
      Rep. Joel Hefley, R-Colo., with the backing of GOP leaders, plans to
offer an amendment to an annual spending bill that would prevent federal
agencies from spending any money to implement the anti-discrimination
policy.
The bill is expected to be one of the first measures the House takes up
when
lawmakers return to work.
      Clinton said in May that he was expanding an existing executive order
signed in 1969 by President Richard Nixon to include a ban on
discrimination
based on sexual orientation in the federal civilian workforce. Nixon's
order
already prohibited discrimination based on race, religion, color, sex,
national origin, handicap or age.
      Most federal agencies already have policies banning discrimination
against gays and lesbians in hiring, but Clinton said the executive order
would bring a uniformity to those policies.
      "There are all kinds of laws on the books to protect against
discrimination in employment, we shouldn't be creating a protected class,"
Hefley said. "When you do that, invariably you get quota systems and all
kinds
of things.' ,
      Rebecca Isaacs, political director of the National Gay and Lesbian
Task
Force, rejected the assertion that adding sexual orientation to federal
non-
discrimination policies creates a "special right"   for homosexuals, as
critics
of the policy contend.
      "There is nothing special about equal rights and being free from
discrimination, " Isaacs said. Nor would the policy create hiring quotas
for
gays and lesbians as critics claim, she said.
      "Have they noticed any other quotas? The brazen lying doesn't seem to
phase [sic] them at all. They are completely dishonest, " Isaacs said.
      Hefley also said he believes Clinton was misusing his power to issue
executive orders. He said he wasn't familiar enough with Nixon's order to
say
if that also was an inappropriate use of power.
      The debate arises at a time when Republican congressional leaders are
under pressure from Religious Right activists to more vigorously pursue a
conservative social agenda.


      Republican leaders are refusing to allow a vote to confirm
phil an throp i s t
James Hormel, who is gay, to be ambassador to Belgium, even though he
clearly
has the support of a majority of senators.
      Senate Republican leader Trent Lott of Mississippi provoked a national
controversy recently when he told a conservative radio talk-show host that
he
considers homosexuality to be a sin and likened it to psychological
illnesses
like kleptomania. Similar comments were made by other GOP leaders, in
cluding
Senate Republican Whip Don Nickles of Oklahoma and House Republican leader
Dick Armey of Texas.
      Lott was scolded for his comments by Democrats and some moderate
Republicans, but he was applauded by conservatives.
      "I believe the Bible defines this practice as a sin, " Lott explained
in
a recent column distributed to newspapers. "I know from the thousands of
calls
my office has received from Mississippians and others across the country
that
most Americans overwhelmingly share my view on this subject.
      "There is a philosophy in our society today that suggests individuals
can
define what is right and wrong for themselves, " Lott continued.    "But in
my
view right and wrong is ultimately outlined by our maker, not
individuals. ' ,
      Gay rights activists accuse GOP leaders of gay-bashing in order to
energize conservative Christian voters whom they need to turn out in strong
numbers on election day in order to retain control of the House.
      "This shows what a stranglehold the right wing has on the House and
Senate Republican leadership, " said Winnie Stachelberg, political
director of
the Human Rights Campaign, a leading gay rights group.
      Said Isaacs: "Gay people are not allowed to live in peace and work on
merit and live their lives without interference from these folks, who are
really scary.' ,
      The Family Research Council, a leading religious right lobbying group,
labeled the Hefley amendment an "urgent pro-family vote"    in a recent
flyer,
urging lawmakers to "oppose funding for special privileges for
homosexuals. ' ,
      "Why is there this constant drumbeat that the federal government, or
different levels of government, are supposed to put their seal of approval
on
a type of activity (homosexuality) when many people personally feel it is
wrong?"    said Marty Dannenfelser, the council's
chief lobbyist.
      A close vote is expected on the amendment. A majority of the House,
including 70 Republicans, have signed pledges not to discriminate against
gays
and lesbians in their congressional offices.
