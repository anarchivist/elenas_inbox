TEXT:
Bruce you asked for more detail on the excess profits options. We now
have three options. As I noted earlier, Treasury thinks we could credibly
argue that the industry's making $2.5 billion a year in excess profits
(the possible range is $1.5 billion a year (Gary Black's estimate) to $4
billion a year) .

Option 1: Tax on Profits.  Companies would be required to report 1)
receipts from tobacco sales and 2) costs of producing cigarettes (e.g.,
labor, equipment). A tax would be levied on the difference, or the
difference that is deemed to be excess profits. Companies could lower t
heir reported profits by shifting costs from the non-tobacco parts of the
company to tobacco.

option 2: Tax on Excess Receipts. An estimate would be made of how much
in excess receipts the companies were obtaining by raising their prices
above that needed to fund the settlement. For example, if the companies
increased price per pack by an extra $.20 an extra tax would be imposed on
that amount.  In practice, this would look a lot like an additional excise
tax.  This is the option Summers prefers.

Option 3: Surtax. The Treasury would determine what portion of company
profits can be attributed to tobacco, and a surtax would be imposed as
part of the corporate income tax on the tobacco-related profits.   Canada
is apparently currently doing this.

Treasury is working furiously through scoring an "A" list of
uncontroversial offsets for the budget, and they consider this to be the
top of the "B" list, and will probably get to it this weekend.  In
addition to talking directly to Treasury, I spoke to Chuck Marr who is
pushing Treasury along as well.
