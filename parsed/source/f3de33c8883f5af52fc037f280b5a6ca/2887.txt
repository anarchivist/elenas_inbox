TEXT:
Hate to stomp on a great crime speech, but I think should give some
update to the FOP on the collective bargaining issue.  Jim Pasco, FOP,
spoke with Ray Kelly at today's event who was more encouraging than usual
on the issue, and this could be a good time to talk to Treasury. Also,
now that there is a new Director of the Secret Service, Lew Merletti,
there is a reason to bring this up now.  Pasco is close to Merletti.
