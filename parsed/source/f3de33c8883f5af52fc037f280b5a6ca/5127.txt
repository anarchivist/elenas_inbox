     National Testing. On Wednesday, Obey proposed a compromise testing provision for the
     LaborlHHSlEducation Appropriations bill, with the agreement of Porter, Specter, and Harkin.
     The provision placed NAGB in charge oftest development, but prohibited implementation of the
     tests without specific authorization. It also prohibited the use of the tests for high stakes
     purposes, such as promotion decisions. We had indicated to Obey in advance that this would be
     unacceptable to us; the other conferees also knew of our objections.

     With help from Bingaman, Kennedy, and Dorgan, we have secured a letter with 37 signatures
     expressing support for a veto if you choose to exercise that option. We had hoped this
     demonstration of resolve would enable us to make changes to Obey's plan in order to create an
     acceptable compromise. However, the conferees have not been willing to entertain any such
     changes.

     At the same time, Goodling and his conservative supporters have denounced this proposal
     because it permits us to continue to develop the tests. Though the appropriations conferees
     completed their work Thursday night, Gingrich has not yet let them file the conference report.
     Goodling has advanced several alternative proposals, all of which block the continued
     development of the tests and are completely unacceptable.

     We are pursuing several strategies over the next several days. First, we will continue to try and
     make changes to the conference report to produce one that you can sign. We have been working
     with Lott's staff toward this end. If this is not possible because of pressure from Goodling, we
     would prefer that the conferees adopt one of Goodling's proposals, allowing the clearest rationale
     for a veto. Finally, we will be meeting with Lott and Gingrich's staffto explore compromises
     that they can support and which will meet our requirements, either to be included in the
     conference report or, more likely, to be put in play after a veto.
