TEXT:
Florida's concerns derive from the fact that their settlement (like TX and
MS's) has a clause saying it will superceded by "substantially similar"
federal legislation and such legislation now would provide them less than
their negotiated settlement.  Post-legislation, if the companies argue the
law is "substantially similar" and the state disagrees, they could of
course litigate the matter, but there really is no way to legislatively
fix this problem (except to provide more money per state in federal legisl
ation). As a result of these problems, Bryant Hall says Senator Graham
will probably vote against the bill in its current form.   (Minnesota,
whose settlement gives the companies an explicit credit against. federal
tobacco-related payments, does not have seem to have this problem.)

As I noted this morning, the Gregg amendment does change the opt-out
language, but DOJ doesn't think the change has an effect on this matter.
(The Gregg amendment allows both states and localities to opt-out, but it
adds the new clause which says those that have "resolved a tobacco
claim .... may not make an election .... if, as part of the resolution of such
claim, the State agreed that the enactment of any national tobacco
settlement legislation would supercede the provisio~s of the resolution."
This just puts in statute the issue that is already in the FL, TX, and MS
settlements. )
