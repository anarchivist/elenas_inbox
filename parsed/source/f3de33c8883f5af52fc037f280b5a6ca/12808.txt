GOP Celebrates Welfare Success

                                 By LAURA MECKLER Associated Press Writer

                                 WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rep. Bill Archer, a top House
                                 Republican, still remembers being called names
when he
                                 pushed the 1996 welfare overhaul, so he's
feeling more than a
                                 little vindicated by the good news so far.

                                 "Where are the children starving on the sewer
grates? "      he
                                 asked Thursday.

                                 Releasing a report on welfare reform, GOP
leaders celebrated
                                 the diminishing welfare rolls and rising work
rates, dismissing
                                 anything negative. Any problems are like
"cracks"        in the Sistine
                                 Chapel's ceiling, said Archer, R-Texas, chairman
of the House
                                 Ways and Means Committee.

                                 Rep. Clay Shaw, R-Fla., a lead author of the
welfare bill, said
                                 the new report proves the overhaul was
"undoubtedly the most
                                 successful piece of legislation in this half
century. ' ,

                                 The report, by the General Accounting Office,
reviews a
                                 handful of the state studies on people who have
left welfare and
                                 finds most people are working. But those same
studies suggest
                                 former welfare recipients have not escaped
poverty and are
                                 struggling to get by.


                         Archer and Shaw dismissed questions about those
findings.
                         They rejected warnings that things may get
tougher when the
                         economy worsens or when people use up their
five-year
                         lifetime limit on benefits.

                         Skepticism comes from the same people who
opposed welfare
                         reform in the first place, said a defiant
Archer. He seemed to
                         welcome the chance to swing back at them, saying
he feels
                         vindicated by welfare rolls that are at a
30-year low and little
                         evidence of severe hardships predicted by
advocates for the
                         poor and some Democrats.

                         "They called me a Nazi. They called me Hitler.
They called me
                         mean-spirited and said I wanted children
starving on the sewer
                         grates,"     he said.   "We had a job to do and we
plowed through
                         all that.

                         "You can pick at anything,"         he added. "Are we
better off now
                         that we were before? That's the question that's
got to be
                         asked. ' ,

                         But others -- even those who supported the
reforms -- say it's
                         too early to declare success.

                         "We haven't won yet,"        said Rep. Benjamin
Cardin, Ii-Md,
                         who voted for the welfare bill. He said
declaring victory is
                         "either naive or political"         given that many
questions remain.

                         "What I really regret is they give the public
the impression the
                         job's been done,"       he said.

                         Eli Segal, who heads the cheerleading Welfare to
Work
                         Partnership, agrees that there is more work to
do.

                         "We don't kid ourselves, "         he said. "Many
people, at best, are
                         going from welfare to the working poor. ' ,

                         Rep. Nancy Johnson, R-Conn., who chairs the Ways
and


                    Means welfare subcommittee, said she would
continue to work
                    on the issue. But she also dismissed critics who
say people
                    leaving the rolls are having trouble making it.

                    --It's very hard to live on welfare,"     she said.
And most people
                    leaving the rolls, even if they take minimum
wage jobs, make
                    more than they got on welfare.

                    House Speaker Dennis Hastert joined the
celebratory news
                    conference, though he was less gleeful. He said
he was
                    encouraged by Vice President Al Gore's
suggestion that
                    faith-based groups can be more involved in
social programs.
                    And he suggested that more work remains.
