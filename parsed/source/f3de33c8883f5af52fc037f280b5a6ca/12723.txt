TEXT:
Andrea and I attended the NEC deputies meeting yesterday to lend support
to efforts we've been working on with NEC, OMB, artd NPR to foster
interagency cooperation in implementing workforce one stops.

FYI -- also on the agenda was a report from the N~C-Ied interagency
working group on pensions, recommending the Administration put forth
legislation to require employers who are amending defined benefit pension
plans to provide more complete information to employees comparing the
benefits of the new vs. old plan.  This proposal ~ould be a compromise
between a Moynihan/Weller bill, which employers cc>nsider onerous, and a
Portman/Cardin bill which makes only minimal chansres to current law.    DOL
is the lead agency.
