TEXT:
Mary Kay, Governor Thompson's helpful staffer, spent the day telling
Democratic governors that you expressed an openness to considering
counting additional activities as work as part of
a FICA fix.

I thought you made very clear to Thompson that we endorse only the last
Shaw offer, the straight FICA fix, and he said that was what he would
circulate to his governors. At one point, you did say you might possibly
have some openness to the work activit~es question, but you said so in a
very general way (that we at the DPC know means you are willing to count
more kinds of activities as work above 20 hours a week, but apparently
Mary Kay took to mean something bigger).

Emily's question is -- besides telling Mary Kay that we are only
discussing a straight FICA exemption, can she/should she try to explain to
her and to the Dem governors what you mean by possibly some openness?
