MEMORANDUM FOR ERSKINE BOWLES

THROUGH:         Jack Lew

FROM:            Donald Arbuckle

SUBJECT:        Heads-up -- Department of TransportationO,s proposed rule
on Advanced Airbags

         We have just received the Department of TransportationO,s National
Highway Traffic
AdministrationO,s (NHTSA) proposed rule that requires the development of
advanced airbag
technology and their introduction in vehicles over a phase in period from
MY 2003-MY 2006.
This rule is part of the long-term solution NHTSA has designed to address
the adverse side
effects of airbag technology. Although airbags have saved 3,148 lives
since their introduction in
1986, they have also caused 105 known fatalities.   The proposed advanced
airbag standard is
flexible and allows auto manufactures a broad range of technological
possibilities, from weight
sensors to dual-stage airbags, which are estimated to cost between $4-$162
per vehicle. The
preliminary analysis indicates that the significant cost of the rule, up
to $2.5 billion annually
 (based on predicted costs of the high cost technological option and annual
sales of 15.5 million
vehicles) is balanced by substantial benefits - - the avoidance of
fatalities to the high risk
population -- infants, children under the age of 12, and small stature
adults - - and the avoidance
of property damage expenses due to unnecessary airbag deployment.

        The proposal also includes other noteworthy provisions that
require auto manufacturers
to: test using a 5th percentile (small stature) adult female, 12-month old
infant, and 3 and 6-year
old dummies, in addition to the 50th percentile male dummy currently
required;   add several new
crash tests, including a choice among three low-speed tests and a dynamic
offset crash test; and,
sunset the sled test option after advanced airbags are introduced by the
industry. These new
provisions should not surprise the interested public; in fact the American
Automobile
Manufacturers Association petitioned NHTSA to include additional dummies
in the test


requirements. However, sunsetting the sled test is controversial. The
auto companies favor the
sled test because it is cheap, repeatable, and as opposed to the barrier
crash test, a vehicle is not
 destroyed.  NHTSA is fearful that the safety benefits of airbags are
compromised by the sled test
because the test is a simulation of a crash, not an actual crash; and, as
manufactures change their
airbag design to optimize for the sled test, the consequence could be
smaller bags that protect
less surface area.

        NHTSA is anxious for the rule to be published to meet the
September 1st statutory
deadline.  We believe the agency has written a technology forcing proposed
rule that is focused
on the problems with current airbag technology and, at this proposed
stage, maintains a great
deal of flexibility for new developments in technology.
