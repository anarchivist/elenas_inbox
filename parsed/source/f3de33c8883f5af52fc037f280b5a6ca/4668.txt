            Subject:         Preliminary conference notes Labor/HHS

            The Labor/HHS principals and staff have been meeting over the past several
            days and reached some very preliminary conclusions on a number of issues.
            Another meeting is planned for Monday (without Specter) and a tentative
            conference is scheduled for Tuesday. Staff anticipate that Senator
            Murray's domestic violence amendment will be discussed on Tuesday.

            It does not appear likely that the conference will conclude next week but
            it is possible. The levels below represent first cut tentative conference
            outcomes and should be considered confidential and highly preliminary.

            Funding

            Goals 2000:  Currently carried at below 1997 levels ($491 million) but
            staff believe that it will ultimately be funded at a freeze.   House
            majority staff are concerned that any level above 1997 will make create
            problems with Republican conservatives. We have pushed for the Senate
            level of $530 million but should at some point signal our bottom line.

            Pell Grants:   $317 million above the Senate, $211 million below the
            House. House level was our minimum accepted level. No final decision on
            independent students but Democratic staff are toying with some formulation
            that would allow the Secretary of Education discretionary authority to
            raise the IPA (income protection allowance) to specified levels (this is
            how we address the independent students issue), if the Pell shortfall is
            lower than previously anticipated (or some such language) Another
            variation of this would provide the authorization committee a limited
            period of time to authorize the independent student policy but the
            authorization requirement would expire by 1/1/97 and default to the
            Secretary's discretionary authority. Will need to continue to look for
            offsets to pay for Pell to increase it above the current compromise. Also
            need to keep working with Democratic authoriz'ers to support our no auth
            orization position.

      America Reads:  $25 million for Education in 1998, $235 million advanced
      funded in 1999. Republicans believe that the $235 million is really $260
      million because the $25 million provided in 1998 will go into the base
      funding and therefore continue into 1999.  I have conveyed to both
      Democratic staff that the $25 million level is unacceptable. National
      Service numbers are not clear but the' Democrats know that they are
      supposed to come up to $25 million for National Service alone.    The 1998
      authority issues are still unresolved. We need to weigh in soon if we
      have a preference.

      Charter Schools:  $80 million (high split).    !997 level was $5l million,
      request was $lOO million.

      National Education Testing:    $l6 million for test is included.

      Office of civil Rights:    $58 million, 1997 level was $55 million, request
      was $62 million.

      Safe and Drug Free Schools:    $556 million, same as 1997, request was $620
      million.

      Adult Education State Grants: $340 million, request was $382 million, we
      asked for $355 million during our last discussions. We should continue to
      press for the additional $l5 million.

      Eisenhower Professional Development:    $3l0 million, same as 1997.

      After School Learning Centers:    $30 million, 1997 level was $l million,
      request was $50 million.

      Program Administration:    $334 million, request was $34l million.

      Education Technology:  $58l million, last year's level was $305 million,
      request was $545 million.

      Title I:  $l36 million below 1997, no $400 million targeted program.     New
      problem not previously contemplated.

      Welfare to work administration:    $4 million, request was $6 million.

      Youth Opportunity Areas:  $250 million in 1999, will change authorization
      date until July l. Staff indicated that monies would be made available
      October l, 1998 if the authorization is adopted. Authorization is
      currently moving in both Houses (passed House, Senate reported).

      Job Training Program Act (Disadvantaged Adult Training):  $900 million,
      1997 level is $895 million. Request was $l,064. Request was protected by
      the BBA. House level was $l,043 million, Senate was $955 million. New
      problem.

      Adoption initiative:    0, request was $2l million.   Staff think we can get
      $lO million.

      Welfare research:    $2l million, request was $44 million.


      Language


          National Test:  Porter interested in a compromise which would involve
          allowing the Administration to go forward with the development of the test
          but banning administration until a majority (or some number) of states
          have signed on to the test. Another variation could include allowing
          administration only in those states that have signed up for the test (this
          is not a Porter idea and has not been floated to or by him).  Specter is
          looking at some sort of requirement that would subject administration of
          the test to authorization.  I do not believe that Goodling has been part
          of any of these discussions so we should be very cautious about these
          proposals.

          Teamsters: Awaiting Administration letter clarifying legal requirements
          under the consent decree.

          Needle Exchange: Looking at some sort of compromise that would retain
          Secretarial certification but beef up the requirements (e.g. tighten drug
          abuse language).
