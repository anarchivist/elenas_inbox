MEMORANDUM FOR ERSKINE BOWLES
FROM:               KAREN A. TRAMONTANO
SUBJECT:          UNIFORMED DIVISION SECRET SERVICE
CC:                   JOHN D. PODESTA
                        SYLVIA MATTHEWS

I. ISSUE

       The issue is whether the non-managerial employees of the Uniformed Division of the
Secret Service (herein UD)should be afforded the statutory protections of 5 USC 7101 et.
seq--specifically, the right to engage in collective bargaining.

II. BACKGROUND

       This issue is not a new one: Jack Quinn in a December 1996 memo to the President
addressed this matter and concluded that there was no national security reason to exclude the UD
from participating in collective bargaining. No action had been taken on Quinn's memo until
you convened a meeting of all interested parties last month to discuss this matter.

        As a result of that meeting, Ed Knight, General Counsel Treasury submitted a
memorandum to you outlining the Agency's position which is opposed to allowing the UD
officers to engage in collective bargaining. I have discussed this issue with Counsel's office, ,the
DPC, the Treasury Department and the Uniformed Division. A memorandum was due to you by
October 23. As a result of the Amtrak negotiations which lasted two weeks, this memorandum
is two weeks late. I have spoken with the FOP and taken the weight for the time delay.

       The memo outlines my recommendation which is to identify the universe ofUD
employees who are not engaged in national security work and to modify the Executive Order to
address Treasury's concerns regarding management rights and access to information.

III. ANALYSIS

        Although a decision on this issue will not be made exclusively on statutory interpretation
it is important to layout the framework for analysis.
                                                                            Hex-Dump Conversion
        Section 7103(b)(1) of the Statute pennits the President to exclude any agency or
subdivision from coverage of the Statute ifhe detennines that the organization's "primary
function is intelligence, counterintelligence, investigative, or national security work, and that
the provisions of [the Statute] cannot be applied to that agency or subdivision in a manner
consistent with national security requirements and considerations."

       President Carter, in issuing Executive Order 12171, excluded the Unifonned Division of
the Secret Services presumably because the organization's primary function is national security
work, and the provisions of the Statute could not be applied consistent with national security
requirements.

       In reviewing President Carter's detennination we must review two points:

       1. whether the Unifonned Division of the Secret Service's primary function is
       "national security work"; and

       2. whether the Statute can be applied to afford employees the right to collective
       bargaining in a manner that is consistent with national security requirements.

       In answering the second question, we must resolve whether individual employees are
engaged in security work under section 7112(b)(6). By making this assessment, we will also
detennine whether the Statute can be applied in a manner consistent with national security
requirements.

IV. IS THE ORGANIZATION (UNIFORMED DIVISION) PRIMARILY ENGAGED IN
NATIONAL SECURITY WORK?

     The controlling legal opinion on this is Department of Energy, Oak Ridge Operations, 4
FLRA 744 (1980). The Authority in that opinion provided the following advice on this matter:

        Neither 'security work', 'directly affects,' nor 'national security' is defined in the
        Statute. One ordinary definition of 'security work' is a task, duty, function, or activity
related to securing, guarding, shielding, protection, or preserving something--in this case the
President and Vice-President. 'Security work' would also include the design, analysis, or
monitoring of security systems and procedures.

         Although there is a question as to whether every UD employee is engaged in the type of
national security work that would exclude them from coverage under the collective bargaining
statute, I believe it is reasonable to conclude that this first test has been made and conclude that
the organization's primary function is "security work." Having answered this first question
affinnative1y, we now must detennine whether the statute can be applied in a manner that is
consistent with national security.
                                                                                Hex-DiJmp ConveiSion ·

II. CAN THE STATUTE BE APPLIED TO THE AGENCY IN A MANNER
CONSISTENT WITH NATIONAL SECURITY REQUIREMENTS AND
CONSIDERATIONS?

        The following principles should be applied when answering this question: First,
exclusion from collective bargaining deprives employees of the opportunity under the Statute to
determine whether or not they wish to be represented by a labor organization. Second, exclusion
also deprives them of the opportunity to engage in collective bargaining with respect to
conditions of employment through labor organizations. Third, this Administration leans heavily
in favor of collective bargaining.

       Labor organizations and collective bargaining have been determined by Congress [and the
President] to be "in the public interest." 5 USC Section 71 Olea). Accordingly, the term
"national security" must be interpreted to include only those sensitive activities of the
government that are directly related to the protection and preservation of the military, economic
and productive strength of the United States, including the security of the Government in
domestic and foreign affairs, against or from espionage, sabotage, subversion, foreign aggression
and any other illegal actions which adversely affect the national defense. Id. @ 755-756

        After listing the tasks that members of the Uniformed Division engage in the Treasury
Department concluded that "the language of section 7ll2(b)(6) clearly applies to each member of
the Uniformed Division." See, Knight memo to EBB. Treasury did not define security work
"to include only those sensitive activities of the government that are directly related to the
protection and preservation of the military, economic and productive strength." Instead, the list
of activities seemed to cut broadly through what appears to be national security work without
applying the statutory test to the work performed or without indicating which employees, if any,
are performing the work. As a result, Treasury's memorandum did not address fully whether the
Statute could be applied consistent with national security requirements.

        To fully address whether the statute can be applied in this context, Treasury should make
a direct connection between the work performed by the officer/officers and the national security
requirements and/or considerations.

        Moreover, Treasury outlines two other concerns it has regarding the statutes application:
management's right to assign, reassign and schedule and withhold information. Under the
current statute, management continues to retain the right to assign, reassign and schedule. It is
unclear to me what impact Treasury believes collective bargaining would have on this unfettered
management right.

       However, to address Treasury's issues we could also deem assignments, reassignments
and scheduling to be non-negotiable under a modified Executive Order. Finally, Treasury's
concern that bargaining would compel the release of significant information that would
jeopardize national security can be addressed in a similar manner.
VI. CONCLUSION                                                          Hex-Dump Conve:-sion

        In addition to discussing this with a number of interested parties: Treasury, Domestic
Policy Counsel, Counsel's Office and the Office of the Chief of Staff, prior to my work on this
issue, other agencies were consulted to determine whether they would be concerned if the
Executive Order were modified to afford the UD collective bargaining rights. No other agency,
outside of Treasury, expressed any concern about this issue.

       It is clear, however, that Treasury has deep reservations and does not want to afford
collective bargaining rights to the members of the uniformed division. As a result, although I
disagree with the conclusion Treasury reached unless the Treasury is committed to making the
policy work, the operations of the Uniformed Division may be disrupted not because the
collective bargaining statute has been applied to the Agency but because the Agency has serious
concerns about this issue. Assuming this issue is addressed, my recommendation is outlined
below:

        1. Ask Treasury to determine which employees, branches, divisions etc. are not engaged
in security work and can be covered by the Statute;

        2. Based on Treasury's findings limit the universe of uniformed division employees that
will be covered by the Statute; and

        3. Modify the Executive Order to limit the scope of bargaining so that the "affects" test
is applied to the exercise of management rights rather than the "directly interferes with" test;

       4. Modify the Executive Order to ensure that access to information is restricted to that
which is directly relevant to collective bargaining.

       If you concur with this recommendation, after the Executive Order is modified, Treasury
should petition the FLRA for an election between the two competing unions. Collective
bargaining will not occur until an election is held to determine the exclusive collective
bargaining representation for the employees.

        I am prepared to answer any questions you may have and to meet at an appropriate time
to discuss this with you.
