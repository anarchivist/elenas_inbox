TEXT:
1. D.C. School Reform:  Disregard my previous comment on this; after
further checking, our position should clearly be to oppose this rider.  It
prevents ED from providing continuing funding to important DC school
refrom projects (to hire reading and math specialists , and to support
Obey/Porter type schoolwide reforms using effective practices). These
projects are important to keeping DC education reform moving in the right
direction.

DC Bill
1, Vouchers: We have to insist this be dropped, with no compromise.
I've heard the R's are prepared to drop this rather than fight.
