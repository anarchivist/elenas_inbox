MEMORANDUM FOR JOHN PODESTA

RE:                      MESSAGE PLAN FOR EDUCATION WEEK

DATE:                    OCTOBER 14, 1997

Strategic Context

      The Republicans intend to make the week of October 20 - 24 as "Education Week."
 They have not announced specific events yet, and, depending upon the House and Senate
schedules that week, it is possible that their events may spill over until the following week.
The purpose of this memo is to suggest a strategy to ensure that we win the battle of
"Education Week."

       The programmatic heart of the Republican approach is embodied in their support
for vouchers for DC students and/or the Coverdell bill to provide for a $2,500 IRA-type
deduction for private school tuition. Their fundamental message centers around choice
and individual empowerment.

       Our goal is to defme Republicans as seeking to abandon public schools in favor of
private academies, just when public schools need our attention the most, while we support
fundamental and far-reaching reforms to strengthen our public schools, from high national
standards to public school choice to charter schools to early education innovations like
child care and America Reads. Our fundamental message centers on strengthening public
education through change and reform.

Specific Events

        We know for certain that the Republicans will hold hearings in Pennsylvania,
perhaps in Chairman Goodling's district. The hearings will be chaired by Peter Hoekstra,
and will probably not get much national attention. We'll pass on further information as
we obtain it. But we should assume for planning purposes that the RepUblicans will focus
their efforts here in Washington and on the issue of choice.
                                                                    Automated Records Management System
                                                                    Hex-Dump COil version

          We propose the following nine message events to highlight the issue in a light
    favorable to the President:

    Friday, 10/17:       Vice President Gore decries House Republicans for holding the
                         America Reads program hostage to their attempt to kill national
                         standards. Under pressure from extreme conservatives, Chairman
                         Goodling has said, "Because of the administration's continued
                         attempts to forge ahead with federal testing despite the objections of
                         the US House of Representatives, I have stopped the committee's work
                         on any reading initiatives ....I (am doing) what any good chairman
                         would do - sleep on it." The VP's message: Because they are so
                         opposed to testing our students in reading, the Congressional
                         Republicans even oppose the President's plan to improve teaching our
                         students reading.

    Saturday, 10/18:     President's radio address is broadcast (taped the day before). Topic:
                         bipartisan cooperation on charter schools. The President should
                         embrace the charter. school proposal currently being advanced in the
                         GOP bill, and could also embrace the ObeylPorter comprehensive
                         school reform proposal in the appropriations bill, which provides for
                         schools to implement school-wide reforms based on effective, proven
                         models. Together, these two proposals provide compelling
                         approaches to dealing with failing schools: fIX them with proven
                         practices, and/or give kids the choice of going to charter schools.


    Sunday, 10/19:      Leak for Monday publication the Education Department study that
                        shows students who take 8th grade algebra and other advanced
                        courses are better prepared for college, which ties-in with our support
                        for 8th grade math tests.

    Monday,10/20:        Since the global climate change position is likely to be announced that
                         day, no education event as such is planned.

    Tuesday,10121:       The President and college Presidents announce that nearly 800
                         colleges (up from 165 in April), in aliSO states, have pledged to use
                         work-study students as tutors in support of America Reads.

    Wednesday, 10/22:    The President meets with high-tech and other business leaders. Pool
                         spray during meeting, stakeout after in which the CEO's announce
                         their support for public education reform as a pro-business,
                         pro-technology, pro-jobs issue.

    Thursday,10/23:      White House Conference on Child Care. Major event, and another


                                                         Automated Records Management System
                                                         Hex-Dump Conversion
                      aspect of our commitment to education.

     Friday, 10/24:   President and First Lady make brief remarks to the National Board
                      for Professional Teaching Standards (the "Master Teachers"
                      program). Announces new initiative for R&D on teaching. Should
                      be significant regional press; good opportunity to wrap-up Education
                      Week.
