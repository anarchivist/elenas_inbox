TEXT:
DOT reports that they are being pressed to respond to the two
remaining Rail Safety questions relating to liability caps. You
had indicated that you wanted to talk with the author of these
responses (Bill Fashouer, 366-0616). Sorry to bug you about
this--I realize you have a million other things to do.
