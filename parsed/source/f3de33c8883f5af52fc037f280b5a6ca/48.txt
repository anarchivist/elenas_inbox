TEXT:
Any interest in a constitutional law/federalism briefing from Cindy Lebow on
products on Thursday between 11 and I? She apparently did a fair piece of work
on this over the holidays/furlough, and is convinced that there's at least an
argument to be made if not a real possibility that much of the procedural
structure in the Senate bill would be declared unconstitutional.  Please e-mail
back your interest.  Kathy, do you think Bruce would be interested?
Ellen
