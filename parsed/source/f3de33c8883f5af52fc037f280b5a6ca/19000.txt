MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:          Bruce Reed
               Elena Kagan

RE:            DPC Weekly Report



        Tobacco -- Farmers and Tobacco State Legislators: The DPC, OPL, and USDA
have been working with tobacco state legislators and farmers to assure them that the
Administration will support tobacco legislation only if it protects tobacco farmers and their
communities. Bruce Reed and Erskine Bowles met Tuesday with House Democrats from
tobacco states -- Representatives Baesler (KY), Clayton (SC), Etheridge (NC), Goode (V A),
Price (NC), Spratt (SC) and McIntyre (NC), along with Congressmen Gephardt and Fazio -- to
discuss strategies for passing comprehensive tobacco legislation that could protect the interests of
tobacco farmers. The House members expect that if a compromise can be worked out by
Senators Ford and Robb regarding tobacco farmers, the same language would then be inserted
in comprehensive tobacco legislation that moves in the House. DPC and USDA have been
working with Senators Ford and Robb to encourage them to reach a compromise. The DPC,
OPL and USDA have also met with groups of tobacco farmers from North Carolina, South
Carolina and Tennessee, and will be meeting with the Georgia Farm Bureau this week, to
reinforce the Administration's commitment to protecting farmers. In addition, Secretary
Glickman is planning to travel to Kentucky on April 3, and will meet with tobacco farmers to
discuss tobacco legislation. Finally, the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids is holding a press
conference on Monday to announce a set of general principles they have agreed on with some
groups from the tobacco producer community. The goals of the coalition are "reducing disease
caused by tobacco products, and ensuring the future prosperity and stability of the American
tobacco farmer, the tobacco farm family, and tobacco farming communities." On Monday, the
press office will issue a statement from you commending the coalition's efforts to work towards
comprehensive tobacco control legislation that also protects the interests of farmers and their
communities.

       Tobacco -- Public Health Community Reaction to the Chafee-Harkin proposal:
Despite their strong views against granting immunity to tobacco companies, Drs. Koop and
Kessler sent Senators Chafee, Harkin, and Graham a very positive letter calling their new
proposal "tough medicine for a tough problem" and "a major step forward." They said they
particular the provisions that I) raise the price of cigarettes within two years to $1.50;
2) protect the FDA's authority -- and states' ability to enforce stronger measures if they so
choose; and 3) recognize the U.S. role in promoting public health around the world. Dr. Kessler
is appearing on Saturday with the Vice President at his tobacco roundtable in Boston.

        Children and Families -- New Report on the Decline of Domestic Violence During
the Clinton Administration: The number of female victims of non-lethal intimate violence has
declined from 1.1 million in 1993 to 840,000 in 1996 - a 23% decline, according to a new report
by the Department of Justice's Bureau of Justice Statistics that will be released Monday, March
16. This report, titled Violence by Intimates: Analysis of Data on Crimes by Current or Former
Spouses, Boyfriends, and Girlfriends, examines the characteristics and contexts of violence
between intimates based on information gathered from victims through the National Crime
Victimization Survey, from law enforcement agencies, hospital emergency departments, and
those convicted of crimes against intimates. Other key findings are that the number of victims
oflethal intimate violence has declined from 3,000 in 1976, to 1,800 in 1976. However, the
report also notes some evidence of a slight increase in the rate of white females killed by a
boyfriend. In terms of the cycle of violence, the report details that slightly more than half of
female victims of intimate violence live in households with children under the age of twelve.
This report supports the investments you have made and indicates that your efforts in this area --
particularly with the passage of the Violence Against Women Act and its increased funding for
prosecution of domestic violence, treatment and prevention -- have helped make a real dent in the
problem. The First Lady is highlighting the report during her speech at a child abuse center in
Texas on Monday.

        Immigration -- BtB Visas. Current U.S. law permits 65,000 HI-B visas each year for
skilled temporary foreign workers. The annual cap was reached for the first time last year, and
this year will likely be reached by May. The information technology (IT) industry strongly
supports raising the cap to address what they maintain is a shortage of U.S. workers with IT
skills. Others (including the Department of Labor) challenge industry's conclusions about a
shortage. Senator Abraham has introduced legislation that would permanently increase the cap
to 90,000 (plus, would allow up to 25,000 H2-B visas to be used for HI-B applicants). Senator
Kennedy has a draft bill that would temporarily increase the cap to 90,000, and includes a
moderate training package, a commissioned study on workforce shortages, and two HI-B
reforms previously endorsed by the Administration.

         A DPCINEC working group, including representatives from Labor, Commerce, State and
INS, has started to develop Administration policy on (I) steps that we can take to work with
industry and institutions of higher education to address the "shortage" ofV.S. workers with IT
skills; (2) possible reforms within the HI B program; and (3) whether we would agree to either
permanently or temporarily raise the cap. The working group is also conducting meetings with
the IT industry and hopes to reach agreement on a comprehensive approach for addressing their
workforce needs.

            Crime -- School Safety: Next week, the Department of Education and the National
    Center on Education Statistics will release a survey on school safety entitled, "Violence and
    Discipline Problems in U.S. Public Schools: 1997-97." We have spoken with Rahm about
    having you announce the results of this survey on Thursday morning, providing your schedule
    allows. The findings of the survey are based on a nationally representative sample of 1,234
    public elementary, middle, and secondary schools and include:

           - More than half, or 57%, of public schools reported experiencing at least one crime
           incident in the 1996-97 school year that was reported to law enforcement officials, and 1
           in 10 schools reported at least one serious violent crime during that year (i.e., murder,
           rape, other sexual battery, suicide, physical attack or fight with a weapon, or robbery).

           - Overall incidents of crime and violence include: 190,000 physical attacks or fights
           without a weapon; 116,000 thefts or larceny; 98,000 incidents of vandalism; 11,000
           physical attacks or· fights in which a weapon was used; 7,000 robberies; and 4,000 rapes
           or other forms of sexual battery.

           - 43% of schools reported no incidents of crime; 37% reported 1 to 5 crimes; and 20%
           reported 6 crimes or more.

           - Middle and High Schools were more likely to experience an incident of crime and
           violence than elementary schools (74% and 77%, as opposed to 45% for all violent
           incidents; 19% and 21 %, as opposed to 4% for serious violent crimes). Differences in
           robbery rates were not significant.

           - Schools that reported discipline problems were more likely to have experienced an
           incident of crime or violence, and were more likely to experience serious violent crime
           than those with less serious discipline problems.

           - Most public schools -- 79% to 94% -- reported having "zero tolerance" policies on
           violence, tobacco, alcohol, drugs, weapons other than firearms, and firearms.

           - Most schools -- or 84% -- employed only low levels of security to prevent violence
           (closed campuses, sign-in policies, or other measures to control access). 10% had
           moderate security (part- or full-time guard with restricted access to school, or metal
           detectors with no guards), and only 2% had stringent security (police or full-time guards
           and daily or random metal detector checks). 3% of schools reported that none of the
           security measures asked about in survey were used.

           - Most schools -- or 78% -- have some type of violence prevention or reduction program,
           and half the schools. And half the schools with violence prevention programs involve all
           or nearly all the students.

               Welfare Reform -- Transportation Funding: The ISTEA reauthorization passed by
        the Senate includes an amendment offered by Senators Specter, Santorum, and
        Moseley-Braun to increase the authorized funding level for the Access to Jobs initiative from
        $100 million -- the level we proposed, which Senator Moseley-Braun had achieved in committee
        -- to $150 million a year. Like our proposal, this provision would provide competitive grants to
        communities to design innovative transportation solutions for those moving from welfare for
        work and other low income individuals. The Senate amendment also authorizes $100 million a
        year for competitive grants to help transport workers -- irregardless of income -- from cities to
        jobs in the suburbs, a particular interest of the Pennsylvania Senators. Meanwhile, House
        appropriators have raised questions about whether additional funding is actually needed for this
        purpose. We are working with DOT to respond to these questions.
