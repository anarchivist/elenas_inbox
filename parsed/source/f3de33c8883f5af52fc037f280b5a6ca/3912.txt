TEXT:
The Program is a serious problem for this event b/c Hilley, Doug and
others are concerned about slighting Gephardt in any way, and if Gephardt
speaks the other electeds have to speak. Therefore, we do not have enough
room for more than 2 message speakers -- which means we need to cut two
off of this list of folks that have already been asked to speak:
1.      Eli Segal
2.      Robert Shapiro, Monsato
3.      Barry Corona, Pres. of small business and Chair of Bd. of
MidTech (who is hosting the      event).
4.      Former Welfare Recipient/Now Worker.

In my opinion, we should have the two business people speak b/c they have
already been promised a speaking role -- and we let communications fight
for a "real person." Then maybe we will end up with all three.
(Scheduling has asked that we cut one of the business people and Eli) .

Right now, I would like to call Kate Carr and ask the Partnership to
choose -- but I don't want to call them without checking with you all
first b/c I know they will explode and immediately phone bank you all.
They had already fought to have no elected officials speak, and right now
we are having three -- Gov. Carnahan, Sen. Bond, and Rep. Gephardt. Our
concession, however, is that we will offer 20 minutes following the event
for POTUS to meet with 25 people of the Partnership's choice. Shall I
call -- or does someone have a better solution?
