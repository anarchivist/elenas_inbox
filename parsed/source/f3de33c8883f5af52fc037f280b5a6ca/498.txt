TEXT:
We have movement on the technicals package.
OMB clearance is now nearly finalized.  The Cuban/Haitian fix will
be included. Hilley has agreed to allow the package to go to the
Hill on Monday.
HHS is sending over a rollout plan and talking points in the
morning.  I will circulate that to interested WH offices asap.
Thanks, everyone, for the help in moving this forward.
