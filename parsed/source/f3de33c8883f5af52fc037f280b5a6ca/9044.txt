RE:            DPC Weekly Report


        Tobacco -- Counteradvertising Event: We are planning a tobacco event for September
where you will announce a new national effort to promote tobacco counter-advertising. At the
event, you will direct HHS to: (1) designate the CDC's Media Campaign Resource Center as a
National Clearinghouse on Tobacco Counter-advertising; (2) collect and disseminate a package
of the "top-10" advertisements for preventing youth smoking, and make these available to states
and organizations for television placement free of charge; (3) work with the Department of
Education to make effective anti-tobacco curriculum available to every school; and (4) conduct
research on what media interventions are most effective for preventing youth smoking. While
some advocates are concerned that any effort on our part to launch a counter-advertising
campaign will take the heat off of the House to pass comprehensive legislation, we believe that
we need to take whatever action we can through executive action in order to reduce youth
smoking.

        At the event, you could also call on the entertainment industry to take a leadership role in
reducing youth smoking, by urging actors to serve as role models and speak out against youth
smoking, writers and directors to eliminate smoking from movies and television programming,
and broadcasters to air public service announcements targeting youth smoking. (In 1996, 77
percent of all major motion pictures portrayed the use of tobacco. In most of these movies, the
lead actor or actress smoked.) We could invite supermodel Kristy Turlington and musical group
"Boyz II Men" to participate in the event, both of whom have already demonstrated their
commitment to this effort by making public service announcements targeting youth smoking that
are available through the CDC.

        Crime -- Probation/Parole Study: On Sunday, the Justice Department will release a
survey of the nation's probation and parole population in 1997. Key findings include: (1) Total
number: A record 3.9 million adults were on probation or parole in 1997, though the 2.9%
increase from 1996 was consistent with the average annual increase of3.0% since 1990; (2)
Probation: Of the 3.26 million probationers, 54% were convicted felons, 28% were
misdemeanants, and 14% drunk or impaired drivers; (3) Parole: Of the 685,000 adults on parole,
nearly all (96%) had been convicted ofa felony; and (4) State Trends: CA (408,900) and TX
(538,500) had the most probationers and parolees, and NY, ME, NH and AZ had a more than
their parole populations.

        Crime -- COPS/Police Corps: We are preparing a possible event for you the week of
August 23, where you would announce the release of funds to hire and educate law enforcement
through the COPS Program. You could make the following three-part announcement: (1) Police
Corps: $30 million in state awards under the Police Corps program -- including $14.3 million for
scholarships to 330 new students, and 6 new participating states (CO, FL, IL, MA, OK, UT and
the Virgin Islands); (2) COPS Small Community Grants: Approximately $10 million to help 855
small and rural law enforcement agencies (serving populations under 50,000) defray the costs of
retaining current COPS-funded officers; and (3) COPS Universal Hiring: $74.8 million to hire
over 1,000 community police officers in 237 jurisdictions, including 12 school resource officers
for Jonesboro, AR.

         Crime -- Early Warning Guide: For your August 22nd radio address, we are working
to finalize the Early Warning Guide to school violence that you recently directed Secretary Riley
and the Attorney General to develop. The guide will be a user-friendly document with practical
suggestions to help principals, teachers, and parents identify what types of early signs to look for
before youths become violent; how to properly intervene once troubled youth have been
identified; and how to respond to crisis once violence occurs. The guide will be posted on the
Web the day of the radio address, and 250,000 will be mailed out to schools and communities
before the start of the school year.

        Crime -- Brady Law Statistic: We thought we should clarify a statistic on the
effectiveness of the Brady Law that you referred to in California. Background checks have
stopped nearly a quarter of a million (or 242,000) prohibited handgun purchases since the Brady
Law took effect in February of 1994. And last year, about 62 percent of the 69,000 rejections
that occurred were based on felony convictions or indictments. Thus, about 42,780 felons -- or
an estimated 18 per day -- were stopped from purchasing handguns in 1997.

         Drunk Driving -- Record Low in 1997: On Friday, the Transportation Department
announced that, in 1997, the rate and number of alcohol-related fatalities dropped to their
lowest levels since the Transportation Department began record-keeping in 1975. Last year, the
rate of alcohol-related crashes fell from nearly 41 % in 1996 to 38.6% in 1997 -- the first time that
the rate dropped below 40% -- and the fewest number of alcohol-related fatalities. Since 1982,
the number of alcohol-related fatalities has dropped by more than a third. The 1997
Transportation data also shows that alcohol-related deaths among 16 to 20 year-olds dropped 5%.
 The data is from DOT's Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS), which documents all
traffic-related fatalities in the 50 states and D.C. There was a very small decline in the overall
number of traffic-related fatalities, from 42,065 in 1996 to 41,967 in 1997. Sixty-three percent
of those killed on the highways were not wearing seat belts.

requested that we initiate a DPC policy process to review the feasibility and advisability of
administratively or legislatively turning over the administrative responsibilities of the
President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports to the United States Olympic
Committee (USOC). The Secretary believes that the chronic underfunding of the
Council inhibits its ability to adequately promote its physical fitness message, particularly
to children. Senator Stevens of the Appropriations Committee agrees that significant
enhancement of funding is unlikely in the future and therefore also supports this concept,
as long as current board appointment authority is retained for the Administration and
Congress. We agree that the Council is falling short on its mission and believe that this
proposal merits serious consideration. The counsel's office believes that it will take
legislation to retain your appointment authority while giving administrative responsibilities
to the USOC. We will submit options for your consideration after we hold meetings on this
issue.

        Health Care -- Patients' Bill of Rights Update: This week, Senator Lott sent you a
letter raising concerns about your veto message in Kentucky and requested that you
reiterate your commitment to work with Republicans and Democrats to pass a patients' bill
of rights this year. He also requested that you urge Senator Daschle to agree to limit debate
and amendments on this legislation. He is taking the position that the only reason he has
not brought this bill up is because he has been unable to get agreement from Senate
Democrats. We believe this letter presents a good opportunity to reiterate your concerns
about the serious shortcomings in the Republican Leadership bills, while stating your
continued commitment to working with the Senate to pass a strong bipartisan bill. We are
drafting a letter in response that reiterates your specific policy concerns with their
proposal that you outlined at your event in Kentucky. The letter also expresses your
disappointment with the fact that the Senate Republican bill was conceived and developed
through a purely partisan process, without any hearings or committee votes, and with no
consultation with hill Democrats or the White House. The letter will also underscore that
while you will work with Republicans and Democrats to pass a bill this year, it needs to be
strong legislation that gives patients the protections they need. We plan to release the
letter sometime next week.

       Welfare Reform -- New Caseload Numbers and Study to Mark Anniversary: At our
suggestion, HHS will release new welfare caseload numbers on Friday to coincide with the
two-year anniversary of the welfare reform law on August 22nd. We do not have the numbers
yet (HHS is still collecting them as we write this memo) but if trends continue the three
additional months of data (April-June 1998) should show reductions of several hundred
million from the 8.9 million level you announced in May. HHS will also announce $1.6
million in technical assistance grants to help states promote job retention and
advancement.

                                                               Automated Records Management System

an encouraging study of welfare reform in Los Angeles, funded in part by HHS. In 1995,
Los Angeles shifted to a job-focused welfare program, based largely on the positive results
from nearby Riverside county. The early results from Los Angeles are promising: after
six months, welfare recipients in the program were 34 percent more likely to be employed
and had 46 percent higher earnings. The program reduced welfare costs by just under 10
percent.

       The Los Angeles study adds to the multitude of evidence contained in the new
TANF report to Congress which shows welfare reform is working. The report shows that
two years after the signing, no race to the bottom has materialized -- nine states have
increased benefits, only eight have cut benefits. Almost every state requires personal
responsibility contracts and most states have adopted a work-first model, with 32 states
expecting clients to work within six months. For the first time, half of all low-income
single mothers with children under six -- the population most affected by welfare policy --
are working, a dramatic increase from 35% in 1992. State evaluations of welfare
programs show employment increases of 8 to 15 percentage points. So far, welfare
changes do not appear to have put nearly as much pressure on the foster care system as
some critics feared. For example, a Maryland study found that less than Y, of 1 percent of
families leaving welfare placed a child in foster care, and most of those families had already
been under investigation for abuse or neglect.

         Food Safety -- Food Safety Council: We expect the National Academy of Sciences to
release next week a highly anticipated report recommending that the government's food safety
structure be much better coordinated and that resources be more evenly allocated between FDA
and USDA. DPC staff will attend a briefing by the NAS on Tuesday regarding the contents of
the report. We have been working with the agencies and NPR to prepare an appropriate
response. All of the agencies agree that we should welcome the report, study it, and use the
opportunity to push for continued progress on food issues. We are preparing an executive order
setting up a Food Safety Council which will review the NAS study and report back to you with
recommendations for longer-range strategies. The Council would consist of the relevant
agencies, HHS, USDA, EPA, OSTP, and Commerce. DPC and the National Partnership for
Reinventing Government will also sit on the Council. In addition to preparing a long-term
report, the Council would serve as a coordinating body, charged with setting food safety
priorities and helping to produce a coordinated food safety budget each year. The agencies are
anxious about this approach, fearing it may lead to a single food agency or a diminution of their
ability to act unilaterally on budget issues. However, in light of on-going appropriate criticism
that the govemment's food safety efforts are too fragmented, we view the Council as a useful
coordinating mechanism that could also set the stage for preparing a thoughtful long-term
solution. You could announce the creation of the Council in early September.

        Campaign Finance Reform -- Free TV Time Commission: The co-chairs of the
Public Interest Advisory Commission on the Public Interest Obligations of Broadcasters in the

their report which was originally scheduled for October 1. The request is consistent with our
internal conclusions that with additional time and a less politically-charged environment, the
members of the commission will present a more meaningful set of recommendations. OVP,
DPC, OMB, and Commerce will continue to closely monitor the work of the Commission.

        Education -- Young Women's Leadership Academy in NYC: The Education
Department has been working for the past six months with NYC schools to develop a
rationale and evidence to support the continued operation of the Young Women's
Leadership Academy. DPC, WH Counsel, and the Education and Justice Departments
initially believed that the most promising approach, consistent with prevailing
interpretations of Title IX and the Equal Protection clause, would be to find evidence
supporting a "remedial" rationale for the school. However, DoEd has concluded that the
necessary evidence to support this approach does not exist for this school. Nonetheless,
DPC, WH Counsel, Education and Justice Department staff all agree that our policy goal is
to allow continued experimentation with single sex schools, and that no enforcement or
other steps should be taken to close the school, force it to admit boys, or force NYC to open
a boys school. Instead, our goal now is to work cooperatively with the NYC schools to
provide evidence that both boys and girls in coed schools are afforded learning
opportunities comparable to those in the all girls school, while at the same time continuing
to evaluate the effectiveness of the Leadership Academy.
