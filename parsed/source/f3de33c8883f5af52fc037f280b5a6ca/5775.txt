The First Lady cannot do the Child Care Event on Wednesday, so the best

As of this morning we are NOT going to be holding this work/family
meeting. It was decided that we will invite a few of these folks to go to
the leaders/thinkers dinner on the 7th instead. Thank you for your help
and I will let you know if things change.
