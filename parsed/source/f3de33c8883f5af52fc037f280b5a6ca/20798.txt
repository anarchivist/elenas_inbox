WE WERE JUST INFORMED THAT THE SENATE IS GOING TO DO DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
TONIGHT - NEED CLEARANCE WITHIN 30MINS (8:30).

S. 2333    DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA APPROPRIATIONS BILL, FY 1999
(Faircloth (R), North Carolina)


        This Statement of Administration Policy provides the
AdministrationD,s views on S. 2333, the District of Columbia
Appropriations Bill, FY 1999, as reported by the Senate Appropriations
Committee.

        The Administration appreciates the support of the Committee for
developing a bill that provides sufficient Federal funding to implement
successfully the National Capital Revitalization and Self-Government and
Improvement Act of 1997.    We are, however, deeply concerned about a
number of provisions of the Committee bill and a potential amendment, as
described below. We urge the Senate to approve a bill that addresses the
AdministrationD,s concerns.

        The Administration strongly supports improving public school
choice for the District of Columbia through such innovative and proven
approaches as charter schools. However, the Administration understands
that an amendment may be offered that would provide for the use of private
school vouchers in the District. The Administration would strongly oppose
any legislation allowing the use of Federal taxpayer funds for private
school vouchers.   Instead of investing additional resources in public
schools, vouchers would allow a few selected students to attend private
schools, and would draw resources and attention away from the hard work of
reforming public schools that serve the overwhelming majority of D.C.
students.  Establishing a private school voucher system in the NationD,s
Capital would set a dangerous precedent for using Federal taxpayer funds
for schools that are not accountable to the public.   If such an amendment
were adopted and included in the bill presented to the President, his
senior advisers would recommend that the President veto the bill.

Economic Development Initiative

        We appreciate the CommitteeD,s $25 million appropriation in
support of management reforms.  Nevertheless, the Administration strongly
urges the Senate to grant the $50 million requested in the FY 1999 Budget
to capitalize the National Capital Revitalization Corporation (NCRC). The
Administration believes that an independent economic development
corporation is essential in order to ensure effective management
coordination and oversight of projects in the District.  Further, we
believe that it is critical to the DistrictD,s economic future to
capitalize the NCRC in FY 1999.

        The Administration appreciates the CommitteeD,s support in
providing $1 million to establish a National Museum of American Music and
a City Museum and Visitors Center.

Adoption Services Improvements


        The Administration supports section 149 of the Committee bill, The
District of Columbia Adoption Improvement Act of 1998.   This Act would
provide much needed adrninistrative and management reforms in the D. C.
Child and Family Services Agency, including requiring Family Services to
contract with private service providers to perform adoption and
recruitment services and eliminating all administrative barriers to
adoption. The Administration understands that an ~nendment may be offered
that would prohibit unmarried couples from adopting children in the
District. We would strongly oppose such an amendment.

Abortion

        The Administration strongly opposes the abortion language of the
Committee bill, which would prohibit the use of both Federal and District
funds to pay for abortions except in those cases where the life of the
mother is endangered or in situations involving rape or incest. The
Administration continues to view the prohibition on the use of local funds
as an unwarranted intrusion into the affairs of the District and would
support an amendment, if offered, to strike this prohibition

Public Education System

        We are concerned that the bill does not provide sufficient funding
to support educational services for all the students who wish to attend
charter schools and other public schools in the District of Columbia. We
look forward to working with the Committee and with the D.C. Public
Schools to ensure that there is adequate flexibility to allow all eligible
charter schools and their students to receive sufficient funding.

        The Administration is committed to working with the Senate to
produce a bill that will assist the District in its continued efforts
toward financial recovery.
