PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
TALKING POINTS FOR HOUSE DEMOCRATIC RETREAT
GREENBRIAR, WEST VIRGINIA
February 9, 1999

        Tribute to Rep. Gephardt. Let me begin by thanking, and honoring, one of
the greatest leaders of our party and our nation D) Dick Gephardt.
DickD,s decision to stay in the Congress means we have an even better
chance of retaking the House.  It means that D) after decades in which
Democrats by habit eagerly formed a circular firing squad D) we will go to
the voters united and strong, a mature governing party. Most important of
all, it will give him a free hand to fight for the ideals for which we
stand. Thank you for the leadership you have shown D) waging what I
believe was a very important fight for the Constitution. And it goes
without saying that I am personally very grateful as well, to him and to
all of you.

        I want to talk to you   briefly about the opportunity now before our
nation and our party. On the    edge of the 21st Century, we have put
forward a new vision for this   new era. Our opponents have offered only
their old slogans -- old wine   in old bottles. We now have a chance for a
major debate on the future of   our country. And we are right.

        The Democratic Party has helped create a D+new dawn for America.D,       In
1992, the world had changed, but our government had not -- and our people
were falling behind. We put forward a new vision, based on our oldest
values -- opportunity, responsibility, community -- to renew our economy
and our nation.  It wasnD,t easy.  Thanks to the courage of this caucus,
we put in place a new economic plan. And look at the results.   If we had
gone before the American people and said: vote for us, adopt our economic
plan, and you will see: The longest peacetime recovery in history.  P
eacetime unemployment the lowest since 1957. Welfare rolls have cut
nearly in half. And the budget deficit, $290 billion in 19927 Now itO,s
a surplus.  People would have said we were crazy.

        And we should be proud of how we did it. We balanced the budget -- but
at the same time we nearly doubled investment in education and training.
We raised the minimum wage and guaranteed family leave. And now, this
expansion is at long last beginning to lift the hopes of those who have
been left behind. Wages are rising at more than twice the rate of
inflation.  Black and Hispanic unemployment are at the lowest levels ever
measured. Poverty is down.  Because of what you have done, this rising
tide is finally lifting all boats.

        Our party should be proud of what we did to bring about these good
times.   But our party and our nation cannot be complacent. We cannot
rest on old victories. We cannot go to the voters based on what we have
done -- but on what we must do now and in the future.  We have a duty to
see to it that prosperity is widely shared, that our values continue to be
supported in our schools and our communities; that our nation remains
strong.  If we are not willing to do it now, with our economy expanding,
when will we do it?

        The contrast between our two parties gave us an historic advance at the
polls in 1998. We were the party of new ideas; they were the party of old
slogans and tired notions that were shopworn in the 1920s. We were the
party of progress; they were the party of partisanship. We were rewarded
because we stood together. And I believe we are now seen as the party


that stands for the interest of ordinary people 0) that stands for getting
things done --that focuses not on the obsessions of Washington but the
challenges facing families in their daily lives.

        In 1999 and 2000, the best thing we can do is to continue to
advance our new vision and fight for our values 0) to be the party that
unhesitatingly tries to make progress for the people. We have a lot to
get done. And let me be clear: we will work with Republicans when and if
they are ready to support these key priorities.

        First and foremost, to prepare for the 21st Century we must prepare for
the D&senior boom.DB You all heard my proposal for what we should do with
the surplus. We must save Social Security now.   Now, I have put forward
my plan, a plan that was written in close consultation with the leaders of
this caucus.  I am determined to continue to work together.  The
Republicans have said they agree to use 62% of the surplus to save Social
Security. We should hold them to it.

        Then we must focus on Medicare.  I propose that we use 15% of the surplus
to strengthen Medicare, and extend its life for another 10 years, while we
work on longer term reforms that can improve quality and meet needs such
as prescription drugs.  As for the Republicans, if they agree to use 15%
of the surplus for Medicare, then we will be happy to work with them to do
so.

        I have proposed that we use 12% of the surplus for tax relief through USA
Accounts -- a universal savings plan in which the government will help the
hardest pressed working people to save.   ThatO,s the right kind of tax
relief -- targeted and responsible, after we save Social Security and
Medicare.

        Make no mistake: By standing together last year, we set the terms
of the budget. Now, with huge surpluses and a renewed Republican call for
massive across the board tax cuts, if we stand together again for fiscal
responsibility and the needs of our nation, we can set the agenda again.

         Second, we should act boldly on education. Last year, by fighting to
begin hiring 100,000 teachers, and refusing to agree to a budget until
progress was made on education, we won a substantive and a political
victory.

        We should press forward.  We should insist that this yearO,s
budget continue to hire teachers.

        We should pass the school construction bill that will modernize or
build 5000 schools [Rangel/Lowey]. Now, the Republicans have finally
concluded that itO,s simply not wise to be seen as against school
modernization, and for kids learning in trailers.  So now they say they
have a plan. Our plan will get the resources into the hands of the school
districts that truly need it; theirs will funnel the money to districts
that donD,t.  Ours will make sure that the money is actually used for
school construction; theirs doesnO,t.  If the Republicans will work on a
real school modernization bill -- not one that tries to slap a coat of
pain on the problem -- we will work with them. And if not, we will fight
for what we know our children need.

        And we should lead the way to strengthen our public schools. This year,
you will be called upon to reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary
Education Act. The federal government already invests $15 billion in K-12
education.  I will send to you what we are calling the Education


Accountability Act that will seek to dramatically change the way that
those funds are used. No child in America should be passed from grade to
grade if they have not mastered the material, we must end social promotion
-- and we must do it the right way, with after school and summer school to
help all students achieve.   I want to thank Reps. Clay, Lowey, Ford, Lynn
Woolsey in expanding the 21st Century After School program. No child in
America should be trapped in a failing school.   School districts must turn
their failing schools around, or shut them down 0) and we should provide
the help so they can do that. No child should be taught by an unqualified
teacher. Every parent should have access to information and choice. And
schools must· have and enforce discipline codes.

        The Republicans have challenged this approach; they say that this
amounts to an intrusive overreach from Washington.  I am eager for a
national debate on education.  If the Republicans are willing to agree to
end social promotion, expand afterschool, turn around failing schools, and
all the other elements of our accountability agenda, we should work with
them.

        Third, we must pass a strong and enforceable Patients Bill of
Rights.    [Dingell, Stark, and Sherrod Brown] Last year the differences
between our Bill of Rights and what I called their Bill of Goods were
plain. Many of you saw the chart that I toted around the country -- and
10,m ready to do it again. A real Patients Bill of Rights is enforceable,
guarantees continuity of care, the right to see a specialist, emergency
room treatment, and medical records privacy. And it covers many more
people than the Republican alternative.   I want to make bipartisan
progress on this again.   If Republicans want to work with us on a strong
and enforceable Patients Bill of Rights 0) the real deal, not a hollow
promise 0) we will work with them.

        I believe there are other important steps to take in health care
0) including the proposal for   a long term care tax credit.

        There are other areas in which we have a chance to act and a duty
to lead. We should raise the minimum wage. We should insist on what I
have called the New Markets Initiative to bring private capital into the
inner city, poor rural communities. [Rangel, LaFalce, Velasquez, Clyburn,
Roybal-Allard, and Waters]. We should push for the livability agenda I
outlined in the State of the Union 0) and we are working with the Livable
Communities Task Force. We should press for a strong Crime Bill for the
21st Century.   We should insist that the majority bring the bipartisan
campaign finance reform bill to a vote.

         Let me conclude with a word on what our vision must be.  For all the
vicissitudes of the moment, we are politically very well positioned for
the elections in the Year 2000.   I believe we can and will retake the
House and hold the White House 0) and I will do everything I can to make
that happen. But we should never lose sight of why we are in this
position. It is because we have stood before the public as one Party, a
united party that can govern, focused on the future.   If we keep our eyes
on the 21st Century, we will enter that century victorious.
