TEXT:
Someone asked about the outline of events in Cleveland to City Year for
Potus on wed for a possibie statement in his remarks on tobacco.  Right
now he is scheduled to do a round table on ~ational service with city year
volunteers and others before the pool where he could do this in his
opening remarks.  Also he is speaking to the City Year Convention later
for another possibility.  Thanks.
