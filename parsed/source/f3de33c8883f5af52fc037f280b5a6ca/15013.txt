  Sorry for the delay in getting this information to you.  I have attempted
  to contact the ethics officials at Education, HHS and National Service.
  Below I will identify what authority they have and who the policy folks
  you are dealing with at each of the agencies s~ould contact with their
  questions/to make arrangements for accepting gifts/co-sponsoring an event.

  Education
  Has gift authority, including solicitation authority. All
  gifts/solicitations have to be approved in advance (as early in the
  process as possible) through either Joan Bardee or Amy Comstock
  401-5309. Also, they routinely co-sponsor events/conferences.

  HHS
  I have been trading calls with the person I need to speak with at HHS.  I
  know that they regularly co-sponsorship events.  plans to co-sponsor must
  be discussed with Rick Thomas -- 690-7258.

 National Service
 My calls have not been returned, but I know they have gift authority.     I
 am assuming that all gifts must be approved in advance through Barry
 Stephens or Brit Rapp -- 606-5000, exts. 259, 258, respectively.

  I will update you with more specifics if/when I hear back from HHS and the
  Corporation.

  I hope this information will be helpful to the agency policy people as
  they are pursuing the options for getting the "kits" and the report.   Let
  me (or Ginny Canter -- 6-2144) know if you need additional information.
