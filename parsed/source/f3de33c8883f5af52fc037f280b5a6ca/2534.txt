Hi folks:     The Sec won't change his views on this.   We would lose more

than the

Mott resources. I thought we had a firm agreement       -- a small program for

21st

century schools focused on having the schools take the lead{governmentally

and

in terms of location) and a massive amount of money for other day care.

Mike

We will also lose our $10 million from Mott!       They are with us to USE THE

SCHOOL

BUILDING as a community school ... Then we'd lose the public-private

partnership.

What a shame!

        I just got a call from DPC staff to give us a heads up that the WH is

        being heavily lobbied by community groups    (HHS's constituencies) to

        let community groups get the expanded 21st Century Community Learning

        Center funds directly rather than through partnerships with schools.

        We had persuaded the WH that this was not the way to go, but DPC

staff

        tell me that it is likely that Bruce and others will ask the Dept.

        (possibly RWR) strongly to reconsider.



        I have a conf. call with DPC and HHS tomorrow to ask HHS to put

        together paper that makes the case that community groups get funds

        under the child development block grant for school-age care and will

        get even more under the expansion.   Unfortunately,   the word-on the

        street is that there will be "no school-age money for community

        groups."   This is not accurate even though there will not be an

        explicit pot of money going directly to community groups.



        Here are some quick points we can make:



        1.   1/3 of the HHS child development block grant funds go to

        school-age care, and the block grant will be expanded in the FY99

        Budget.    So there is a pot of money than community groups can tap



        directly for school-age care and it is being expanded.



        2.   We would require schools to partner with other community

        organizations in order to receive 21st Century funds, and we are

        proposing a match requirement which will empower the community

partners

        because the schools will not be the source of all the funds.      One of

        the models for 21st century program is the Virtual Y in which      the Y

        runs afterschool programs in the NYC public schools.



        3.   We will lose the premise of the 21st Century program -- that we

        are leveraging underutilized school facilities and resources -- if

        community groups are allowed to get the funds directly for programs

        not located at public schools.   If the premise of the program is·

lost,

        we are much more likely to end up in a divisive and unproductive

        voucher debate.



        4.   ED funds go through the schools -- we are the Dept. of ED!
