Subject:         Update on LAPD Police Officer

The officer is not expected to live. They are basically waiting for all
the family to come in before shutting off life support.  There are 10 - 12
suspects in custody. There were multiple shots fired at the officer's
car. Al Rutherford has asked his contact in LAPD and they say that we
should still come and do the event.  If he dies, the funeral would be
Friday or Saturday. The President should call the family so we will get
that information.  Thanks.
