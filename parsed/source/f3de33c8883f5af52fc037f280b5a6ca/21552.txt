        WIN IMPORT ANT VICTORIES FOR THE IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY
                             October 19, 1998


Reducing the Naturalization Backlog. The President's FY99 budget included $827
million in funding from the Examination Fee Account and $486 million from the User Fee
Account dedicated to providing immigration benefit and inspection services. A recent
estimate of INS fee receipts has resulted in a significant reduction in anticipated fee
revenue to support the Examination Fee Account and insufficient resources to address the
two-year backlog of pending naturalization applications at the INS. As a result, the
Administration sought an infusion of $171 million in new resources to support
naturalization activities. The Administration urged the conferees to ensure that
immigration fees are used to reduce the backlog of pending citizenship applications, as well
as to approve the reprogramming request. The final Omnibus appropriations package
includes approval of the full $171 million in reprogramming and does not divert any money
from the INS's Exams Fee account for unrelated expenses.

Protecting U.S. Farmworkers. The Administration strongly urged the conferees to delete
provisions in the Senate-passed CJS bill that would create a new agricultural guestworker
program. These provisions would likely increase illegal immigration to the U.S., reduce job
opportunities for legal U.S. farmworkers, and depress wages and work standards for U.S.
farmworkers. We fought hard, and were successful, at getting these provisions removed from
the Omnibus appropriations package.

Defeated Efforts to Dismantle the INS. Some Republicans in Congress made an effort to
attach legislation to the Omnibus appropriations bill that would drastically reorganize the INS
over the next six months. Though we support efforts to reform the INS and promote greater
effectiveness and efficiency, we opposed going forward with such a major reorganization of this
important agency without the benefit of hearings by the Judiciary Committee and consideration
by the House and Senate. We strongly opposed this legislation, and successfully defeated it.

Deportation Relief for Haitians. Last year we were disappointed that Haitians were
excluded from the relief granted Central Americans and Eastern Europeans in the
Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act (NACARA). Last December,
the President temporarily suspended deportation of certain Haitians for one year and
called on Congress to address, through legislation, the circumstances of this group. The
Haitian provisions included in the final appropriations bill will allow thousands of Haitians
who were paroled into this country after the 1991 overthrow of President Aristide or who
applied for asylum prior to 1996, to become legal residents of the U.S.

Visas for High-Tech Workers and Protection for U.S. Workers. The Administration and
Congress reached a compromise on legislation that temporarily increases the number ofH-lB
visas; reforms the H-IB program to ensure that employers do not replace U.S. workers with
temporary foreign workers and requires employers to recruit U.S. workers; and provides for a

         user fee that will generate approximately $250 million over three years in new investments for
         training and educational opportunities to U.S. workers.

         Enhancing Enforcement at the Border. The final budget agreement includes the
         Administration's request to hire 1,000 additional Border Patrol agents, as well as funds to provide
         improved technology to detect illegal aliens along the Southwest Border.
