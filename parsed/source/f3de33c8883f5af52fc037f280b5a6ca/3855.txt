TEXT:
I've sent over to you a draft from the Department of Education of a
possible piece of the Higher Education Reauthorization Act that has
positive implications for Hopwood/209 type problems. The "Urban Community
Partnership Program" is a new program that would establish partnerships
between "urban institutions of higher education and urban elementary and
secondary schools." It also encourages private-public partnerships. Two
problems that can be fixed:  1. the program is pretty vague as to goals--
I think it should be explicitly to help urban students prepare to go to
schools of higher education, not just to improve the urban schools. 2.
The money is undefined-- Bill K. says probably about $20 million.   I would
think it probably has to be larger, or at least a demonstration project,
if the idea is to take on a problem of this magnitude.

Kincaid sent it over to me. He assures me they will hold it until we have
a chance to comment some more.

II. Our giant meeting of the agencies that do civil rights legal and
administrative work is turning a little botched for this week.  I'd prefer
to be there physically for this one, but am gone for next week. Can it
wait till a week from 'Monday?   Alternatively, we can set the meeting up
for next week, and I will phone into it. That way they will get started
sooner ...

regards, Tom
