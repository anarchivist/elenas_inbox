TEXT:
The Problem:
*Alcohol-related injuries are the number one killer of young people under
the age of 24.

* There are approximately 4 million alcoholics or problem drinkers in our
country who are minors.

*78% oppose alcohol advertising that is shown on programs where at least
one-fourth of the audience is under the age of 21.

* More children recognize the Budweiser Frogs than any other cartoon
character except Bugs Bunny.

Some Options:

Push for legislative limits on alcohol advertising on TV, radio, magazines
and billboards that target young audiences. variations on this could
follow the tobacco example: e.g., call for keeping billboards away from
schools.

Require health warnings on all alcohol advertisements

Eliminate the tax deductibility of alcohol ads and promotions ($700
million)

Ban hard liquor ads on TV

Push for voluntary alcohol advertising standards. Call in the beer and
wine folks to get them to voluntarily agree to guidelines for their ads--
content that does not use cartoon characters when children are watching,
placing ads generally only on adult shows.  (There is legislation to
endorse to give them an anti-trust exemption to get together and do this.)

What About Tob~cco?
My gut reaction was that the issue would have to wait for tobacco to be
done, and even then everyone would be sensitive about seeming to be
against another legal product-- there would be a fear of appearing
puritanical and insincere.  It might be that is too Washington a fear.

The use of cartoon characters to reach children is just as wrong with
alcohol as it is with tobacco. Most people in the country would likely
agree.  If you tailor the issue to "kids and alcohol" I think it can avoid
'-

     seeming political and instead be part of a consistent message. protecting
     our children.    In any case, if the tobacco bill does happen early
     (April/May), it might be a good problem to tackle little later.

     Right now there are a few bills floating around, and a few prospects for
     activity. Joe Kennedy has reached out to the VP and asked if he wants to
     do a meeting with alcohol industry people. The FCC has the hard liquor
     and TV advertising issue it can consider.
