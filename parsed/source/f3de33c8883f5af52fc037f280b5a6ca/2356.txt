TEXT:
Bruce:     It is my understanding that you are contemplating have the POTUS

announce that he is putting the VP in charge of the effort to win

Congressional support for our tobacco position.        The VP would be very

happy if this could happen, and could be featured in the POTUS remarks

tomorrow.    This would give us a good boost at this time.



Then, we could sell his meeting on Thursday (Koop, Kessler, .et al.) as a

launching pad for this effort.



Let me know if there are any problems with this.        It is important to us,

and I did not want to bug you today with a phone call given how crazy

things are -- but it really matters.    Thanks.
