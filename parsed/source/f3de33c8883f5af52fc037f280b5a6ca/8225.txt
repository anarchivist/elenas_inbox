TEXT:
In· the course of meeting with Treasury, DOL, and OMB, and then also
meeting with Bill Signer, the issue came up about whether the
Administration should make a special push to extend WOTC, which expires
6/30. We proposed extending both WOTC and the WTW tax credit in our
budget, so we're on record. Treasury expects WOTC to be included in an
extenders package with other tax credits including R&C and Section 127.
though the vehicle and timing are unclear at this point.    Neither
Treasury nor OMB think we should single out WOTC, since the other credits
are also important to us. They also don't feel our help is really needed
at this point-- Republicans are supportive of WOTC. as is Rangel.    Signer
says Gingrich is working to get a letter from Archer and Roth saying WOTC
will be extended (probably retroactively) .    Do you think we should do
anything more aggressive at this point?

Signer, the consultants. and businesses are also concerned about what
happens during a 'hiatus' once the credit expires.  They want to keep the
momentum going from employers and want to make sure states don't just
trash the paperwork employers send in during this period.   DOL has met
with them and appears to be putting reasonable guidance in place to states
on how to proceed after 6/30.  (Their lawyers say they can't force states
to process a tax credit that has expired) t?
