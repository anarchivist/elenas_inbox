Here is my· first stab at a POTUS trip-book brief on HR 497: THe
National Gambling Impact and Policy Commission Act.   Please make
any edits/changes that you see fit -- this is not one of my issues
so I have had to piece together info from OMB and from articles.
Elizabeth -- please examine the paragraph talking about the Pres.
conversat~on with Miller and Carol's meeting with the CEOs.   I am
not sure I captured this quite right!

HR 497:
               -      -
         THE NATIONAL GAMBLING IMPACT AND POLICY COMMISSION ACT
HR 497, The National Gambling Impact and Policy Commission Act
(Wolf (R) VA and 143 cosponsors), would create a commission that
would be charged with conducting a comprehensive study of
gambling in the United States and Federal, State, and local
policy and practices regarding the legalization or prohibition of
gambling. The bill also authorizes the Commission to hold
hearings, to subpoena testimony and materials, and to seek
information from Federal agencies. This bill passed the House in
April of this year.   It's Senate companion bill, S704  (Simon, IL
and 24 cosponsors), has passed the Government Affairs Committee,
but has not yet been scheduled for a vote on the floor.
Hot Issue for Nevada
Senators Bryan and Reid (along wtih Governor Miller)   have
adamantly opposed any form of subpoena powers for the commission
and are unhappy with the House bill and the current version of
the Senate Bill.    Also, The American Gaming Association, while
publicly stating that it does not oppose a national study of
gambling, sees HR497 (and the current Senate version) as just the
first step in an effort by Congress to impose some federal rules
on an industry that has so far been largely regulated by the
states.
The Administration has taken no official position on the. specific
subpoena issues.
Administration position to Date
In late
o
-October, You wrote the bill?s sponsor (Rep. Wolf),
stating that he had ?long shared your view about the need to


consider carefully all of the effects     of gambling, and I support
the establishment of a commission for     that purpose.? In March of
this year, the Administration sent up     a Statement of
Administration position supporting HR     497.
This spring, You told Governor Miller     that You oppose the
subpoena power currently in the bill,     but did not indicate that
the bill would be vetoed if it passes     in its current form.  In
mid
o
-May, Carol Rasco met with a group of 6
o
-7 Gambling CEOs at
Governor Miller's request and gave them no further indication of
our position on the subpoena issue.
During hearings on the bill, the Justice Department voiced
concerns about the mandatory subpoena power of the Commission in
respect to federal law
o
-enforcement agencies.   In response to
these concerns, the Committee amended H.R. 497 to allow the head
of an agency to withhold sensitive law enforcement information

from the Commission.
Description of the Act
H.R. 497 would create a nine
o
-member National Gambling Impact and
Policy Commission, with three each appointed by the President,
Speaker of the House, and the Majority Leader of the Senate,   to
study the impact of gambling in the United States. The principal
issues the bill directs the Commission to study include:
?       the economic impact, both positive and negative, of gambling
at the local, State and Federal levels and on Indian tribes;
?       a review and assessment of political contributions and their
effect on development of public policy regulating gambling;
?       the relationship between gambling and crime;
?       an assessment of problem gambling on individuals, families,
social institutions, criminal activity, and the economy;
?       the effectiveness of existing law enforcement, judicial
administration, and corrections to deter illegal gambling;
?       gambling that uses interactive technology, including the
Internet; and
?       the extent to which casino gambling provides economic
opportunity to residents of economically depressed regions
and to Indian tribes.
The Commission is required to report to the President and the
Congress, within two years of its first meeting, on its findings
and conclusions and any recommendations for legislative or
administrative actions it considers appropriate.
