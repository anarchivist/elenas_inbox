                     DRAFf PUBLIC STATEMENT ON PUBLIC CHARGE


    Today, the [Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of
    Agriculture] made public an Administration decision that past or current use of Medicaid,
    the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and/or Food Stamps will not be
    considered in determining whether a legal immigrant is a "public charge," except where an
    individual has received institutionalized care funded by Medicaid. Guidance will be
    issued by the Department of Justice and the State Department Clarifying that health
    insurance and nutritional benefits are cost effective, important to public health, and do not
    provide any unique, additional information that would lead to a public charge
    determination.

    Determination as a "public charge" has significant consequences for an immigrant -- it can
    cause them to be denied admission to or permanent residency in the United States.
    Concern about public charge determinations has prevented legal immigrants from
    enrolling themselves or their children in the Medicaid. Law-abiding immigrants who are
    eligible for Medicaid often worry that receiving these benefits could result in INS action
    against them or their families. This fear has not only interfered with the goal of signing up
    eligible children for health insurance, but in some cases has caused sick or injured people
    to unnecessarily forego health care. This has created uncompensated health care costs for
    hospitals, other providers, and states. It also poses a risk to the public health since the
    lack of treatment of uninsured legal immigrants for communicable diseases could endanger
    citizens at large.

    Concern over the public charge rules has also discouraged legal immigrants who are
    working at low-wage jobs from applying for Food Stamps for themselves and their
    children. Food Stamps provides a nutritional safety net for both the working and
    non-working poor. This Spring, Congress enacted the Administration proposal to restore
    Food Stamp benefits to 240,000 legal immigrants beginning November 1, 1998. The policy
    being announced today will remove any concerns that the use of Food Stamps and other
    nutrition assistance programs, such as nutrition assistance to Women, Infants, and
    Children (WIC), by these immigrants would result in a public charge determination.

    The detailed DOJ and State Department guidance containing this Clarification, which will
    be issued shortly, will comprehensively address policies on public charge determinations.
    We look forward to working with immigration officials, state health officials, and others to
    ensure that misunderstanding and fear do not stand in the way of legal immigrants
    receiving important benefits.
