TEXT:
We had a major meeting of the working group on Community Empowerment
yesterday to discuss tax ideas. Treasury made their argument against most
proposals. On the housing front, we have the LIHTC expansion and we are
working through some ideas on the homeownership end for low-income
individuals. On the capital and credit side, everyone is in favor of the
CDFI tax credit. On the employment side, there is some discussion of
proposing to make WOTC and WTW permanent.  I think we would be interested
in what your thoughts are on that.  As a policy matter, Treasury believes
the EITC is much more effective in bringing people out of poverty, but
they, the NEC, and OMB don't want to increase the EITC because they
believe Republicans would turn around and cut the credit.   We have also
asked Treasury to work on the Environmental Bond proposal for distressed
urban areas.  EPA did another redraft but it needs work.   I don't think
Treasury favors this idea but Orszag and I believe it is good and Dimond
has made me aware of a big Michigan ballot initiative to use bonds to
finance urban cleanup.  The proposal is backed by all the leading
Republicans in the state. One area we still have not been able to make
any headway is developing a tax incentive to promote commercial dev
elopment directly. While the enviro bond and the CDFI tax credit would
encourage commercial development indirectly or through intermediaries,
some believe we should provide a tax incentive targeted to developers who
would buildsupermarkets, drug stores, and other commercial properties in
distressed communities.

Next week, Orszag and I will meet with Deich (OMB) to discuss agency
submissions and the new ideas process.
