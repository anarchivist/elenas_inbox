TEXT:
Just wanted to confirm that I have worked with the librarians to continue
searching on statements on school busing and nothing has come up. We have
searched for just the word bus in all of his speeches and newspaper
articles. Lots of articles on integration, but nothing on busing. I have
also called the Little Rock office and they are checking statements from
when he was governor.  I left this message with the press office
yesterday, but if there is anything else you think I should do, please let
me know.
