New technology raises the potential of enormous scientific breakthroughs, but the new
technology also raises profound ethical issues, particularly with respect to its possible use to
clone humans. President Clinton has proposed legislation banning the use of new technology to
clone human beings. The President's legislative proposal prohibits for five years the use of
somatic cell nuclear technology to create a human being. The legislation directs the National
Bioethics Advisory Commission to report to the President in four and half years on whether to
continue the ban. The proposal is carefully worded to ensure that it will not interfere with
beneficial biomedical and agricultural activities. In March 1997, the President imposed a ban on
the use of federal money for cloning human beings.
