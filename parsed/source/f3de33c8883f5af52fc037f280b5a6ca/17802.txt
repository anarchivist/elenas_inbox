       On February 4, 1997, President Clinton laid out an ambitious "call to action" in the first State of the
Union of his second tenn. As Congress adjourns this November, the record is clear. President Clinton
drove the Congressional agenda this year, accomplishing most everything he set out to do ten months ago.

BALANCED BUDGET & TAX CUTS:
    First Balanced Budget In A Generation: After cutting the deficit by 63 percent in his first tenn,
    from $290 billion to $107 billion, President Clinton promised in his 1997 State of the Union speech
    to "propose a detailed plan to balance the budget by 2002." On August 5, 1997, the President
    signed an historic, bipartisan bill to balance the budget for the first time since 1969.

       Middle Class Tax Cuts For 27 Million Families With Children: In addition to balancing the
       budget, President Clinton promised in his State of the Union speech to "provide middle class tax
       relief .. to help raise a child." On August 5, 1997, the President signed into law a $500 per-child tax
       credit that will benefit approximately 27 million families with 45 million children under 17. For the
       typical American family with two kids, this child tax credit will mean $1,000 more per year in
       take-home pay.

EDUCATION:
    Largest Investment In Education In 30 Years: In his February State ofthe Union speech, the
    President said his "number one priority" was to ensure that "all Americans have the best education
    in the world." The President said his balanced budget would reflect this commitment. Now, that
    commitment is the law. The Balanced Budget Act the President signed on August 5, 1997 includes
    the largest investment in education in 30 years -- and the largest investment in higher education since
    the G.l. Bill.

       HOPE Scholarship Makes 13th & 14th Grades As Universal As A High School Diploma: In his
       February 1997 State of the Union, President Clinton called for passage of his America's HOPE
       Scholarship proposal in order to "make the 13th and 14th years of education .. just as universal in
       America by the 21st century as a high school education is today." Today, the HOPE Scholarship is
       law, providing a 100 percent tax credit on the first $1,000 of tuition and .fees and 50 percent on the
       second $1,000 -- enough to pay for the typical community college.

       20% Tuition Tax Credit for College Juniors, Seniors, Graduate Students And Working
       Americans Pursuing Lifelong Learning To Upgrade Their Skills: The President's State of the
       Union address included a proposed "tax deduction of up to $10,000 a year" for post high school
       tuition. The President's proposal is now law. The 20 percent tuition tax credit will be applied to the
       first $5,000 of qualified education expenses through 2002, and to the first $10,000 thereafter.

       Largest Increase In Pell Grants In 20 Years: President Clinton pledged during the State ofthe
       Union that his balanced budget would include "the largest increase in Pell Grant Scholarship in 20
       years." Now, that commitment is the law. On November 13, 1997, the President signed the
       Labor-HHS-Education Appropriations Bill which included his proposal to increase the maximum Pell
       Grant to $3,000 -- the largest increase in two decades. Approximately 3.7 million students will
       receive the $300 increase, and an additional 220,000 low- and moderate-income families that were
       not previously eligible will receive Pell Grants.

      America Reads Initiative To Ensure Every Child Can Read By The 3rd Grade: limp l-onversion nt SYstem
      Noting that "we must do more to help all our children read" during his 1997 State of the Union,
      President Clinton called on Congress to pass his America Reads Initiative. The
      Labor-HHS-Education Appropriations Bill the President signed on November 13, 1997, included
      nearly $300 million in new funding towards the President's comprehensive literacy strategy. As a
      result: 3000 new Americorps members and thousands of senior volunteers will recruit more than
      100,000 volunteer reading tutors; state teacher training and family literacy efforts receive an
      additional $41 million; and an advance appropriation of $21 0 million is provided for pending
      legislation based on the President's America Reads Initiative.

      In addition, more than 800 colleges have answered the President's State of the Union call, pledging to
      have thousands of their work-study students "serve for one year as reading tutors. "

      On Track For First-Ever National Test Of 4th Grade Reading, 8th Grade Math: President
      Clinton issued a "challenge to the nation" during his State of the Union speech, calling on every state
      to "adopt high national standards" and "test every fourth grader in reading and every eighth grader
      in math to make sure these standards are met." The Labor-HHS-Education Appropriations Bill the
      President signed on November 13, 1997, fully funds ($16 million) the Administration's voluntary
      national testing program and allows for development and pilot testing of the first-ever national 4th
      grade reading and 8th grade math tests.

      57% Increase For Public Charter Schools: Continuing his lifelong commitment to improving and
      reforming America's public schools, President Clinton called for a dramatic increase in the number of
      public charter schools in his 1997 State of the Union "so that parents will have even more choices in
      sending their children to the best schools." The Labor-HHS-Education Appropriations Bill the
      President signed on November 13, 1997, increases funding for charter schools by 57 percent, from
      $51 million to $80 million. And while there was only one charter school in the nation when
      President Clinton took office, there will be nearly 1,000 locally-designed charter schools supported by
      the Department of Education by the end of 1998 -- accelerating progress towards the President's goal
      of 3,000 by early next century.

      Head Start Expanded Toward Goal Of 1 Million Children By 2002: Stating that "we already
      know we should start teaching children before they start school. " President Clinton proposed a
      balanced budget that "expands Head Start to one million children by 2002" in his 1997 State of the
      Union address. The Labor-HHS-Education Appropriations Bill the President signed on November
      13, 1997 includes $4.4 billion for Head Start, a $374 million increase -- and a 57 percent increase
      since 1993. Head Start will serve 836,000 children and their families in 1998 and is on track
      meeting the President's goal of reaching one million by 2002.

HEALTH CARE:
    Single Largest Investment In Children's Health Care Since 1965: President Clinton pledged in
    his 1997 State of the Union that his balanced budget would "extend health coverage to up to five
    mil/ion... children." Now, that commitment is law. The Balanced Budget that President Clinton
    signed into law on August 5, 1997 included $24 billion for the President's Children's Health
    Initiative -- the single largest investment in health care for children since passage of Medicaid in
    1965. The $24 billion will provide meaningful health care coverage to up to five million currently
    uninsured children -- including prescription drugs, vision, hearing, and mental health services.
        -                                                                      He .~ords Mana e
        Medicare Protected, Modernized And Trust Fund Extended At Least A Deca~e:iJmpConlll;fentSystern
        President Clinton promised during his 1997 State of the Union that his balanced budget plan w~nuld
        modernize Medicare and increase the life of the Medicare Trust Fund to ten years. These promises
        are now law. The bipartisan Balanced Budget extended the life ofthe Medicare Trust Fund at least a
        decade -- saving $115 billion over five years and $400-$450 billion over ten years. The President
        fought to prevent any damaging changes that would have undermined Medicare, and instead worked
        to enact structural reforms to prepare it for the 21 st century. These reforms included more choices
        among health care plans, changes to the annual Medigap enrollment and restructuring specific
        payment systems so that rates are set in advance. Also included is $4 billion over five years for new
        Medicare preventive benefits -- expanded coverage for mammograms, colorectal screening, and
        improved self management of diseases like diabetes .

. WELFARE:
      Restored Basic Health And Disability Benefits To Legal, Law-Abiding Immigrants: When the
      President signed the 1996 Welfare Reform Law, he pledged to go back and change provisions he
      opposed regarding the cutting off of benefits to legal, law abiding immigrants. Many criticized the
      President and said changes would never be made to the bill. However, in 1997, the President
      followed through on his pledge -- and won most of the changes he sought in the 1996 law. The
      President fought for and won $11.5 billion in SSI and Medicaid benefits for legal immigrants. He
      fought for and won changes that protect those immigrants now receiving assistance, ensuring that
      they will not be turned out of their apartments or nursing homes or otherwise left destitute. And
      immigrants in this country as of August 22, 1996 but not receiving benefits who subsequently become
      disabled will be eligible for SSI and Medicaid.

        New Incentives And Community Efforts To Move 2 Million More People Off Welfare: During
        his first term, President Clinton's lifetime of experience and innovative approach to welfare .reform
        lead to the largest decline in welfare rolls in history. In his 1997 State of the Union, the President set
        out a plan including government incentives and private sector challenges to reach another goal: "two
        million more people off the welfare rolls by the year 2000. "

       Expanded Work Opportunity Tax Credit and Created the $3 Billion Welfare To Work Job
       Challenge Fund: The Balanced Budget Law includes a tax credit for employers who hire long-term
       welfare recipients equal to 35 percent of the first $10,000 in wages in the first year of employment
       and 50 percent of the first $10,000 in the second year to encourage retention. The President also
       succeeded in including $3 billion to create his Welfare to Work Job Challenge Fund -- to assist states
       and communities in moving long-term welfare recipients into lasting, unsubsidized jobs.

       Challenging Communities to Move People from Welfare to Work: The President challenged "every
       religious congregation, every community nonprofit, every business to hire someone off welfare."
       Responding to the President's challenge, the Welfare to Work Partnership was launched to lead a
       private sector effort to move people from welfare to work. Begun with 100 businesses, the
       Partnership is aiming for 1,000 businesses within six months. Vice President Gore also reached out,
       creating the Welfare to Work Coalition to Sustain Success -- a coalition of civic groups committed to
       helping former welfare recipients stay in the workforce and succeed.




 URBAN AGENDA:
      ·                                                                            Hex-Dump, Conver:jion
      Tripled The Number Of Empowerment Zones: President Clinton called for doubling tne number
      of empowerment zones and enterprise communities in his 1998 budget. The Balanced Budget Law
      the President Clinton signed actually triples the number of EZs, adding 20 new EZs (15 urban and 5
      rural second round zones and 2 more first-round zones) -- bringing the total number created to 31.

      63% Expansion of Community Development Banks: President Clinton called for an expansion of
      Community Development Banks in his State of the Union speech. The Balanced Budget Law the
      President signed in August included $80 million for Community Development Financial Institutions
      in FY 1998 -- a 63 % increase over FY 1997. These entities make investment capital and other
      financial products and services available in low- and moderate-income communities.

      Brownfields Tax Incentive Will Redevelop 14,000 Contaminated Sites: The President called for
      restoring "contaminated urban land and buildings to constructive use" through his Brownfields tax
      incentive program. Brownfields were part of the Balanced Budget Law the President signed. The
      tax incentives will leverage more than $6 billion for private sector cleanups nationwide according to
      the Treasury Department -- and allow for the redevelopment of 14,000 contaminated, abandoned
      sites in economically distressed urban areas.

FOREIGN POLICY:
     Ratification Of The Chemical Weapons Convention: President Clinton challenged Congress
     during his State of the Union speech to "rise to a new test of leadership" and "pass the Chemical
     Weapons Convention." And after an intense lobbying effort by the President, the Senate ratified the
     Convention on April 24, 1997.

      Secured Passage Of China MFN, Hosted First US--Sino Summit In 8 Years: President Clinton
      challenged the country to "pursue a deeper dialogue with China for the sake of our interests and our
      ideals." The President successfully lobbied Congress to extend normal trading relations with China
      on June 24, 1997. And the first U.S.-- Sino State Visit in eight years, hosted by President Clinton at
      the White House in October, resulted in agreements on a broad range of security, economic,

      NATO Expansion: President Clinton called for expanding NATO membership by 1999 "so that
      countries that were once our adversaries can become our allies." On July 8, 1997, at the Madrid
      NATO Summit, three nations -- Poland, Czech Republic and Hungary -- were offered membership in
      NATO. President Clinton has pledged to lobby the Senate to ratify these changes "so that we can
      bring in the new members by the 50th anniversary ofNATO in 1999. "

o     Renewal Of Fast Track Authority: President Clinton's lobbying efforts on behalf of renewed "fast
      track" trade authority resulted in majority support in the United States Senate. A clear majority of
      Democratic governors and mayors supported the President's position. In the House of
      Representatives, however, the vote had to be postponed when it became clear that opposition by
      Democratic lawmakers -- and the linking of the trade vote to international family planning by House
      Republicans -- would derail the legislation.

o .Passage Of Campaign Finance Reform: Despite intense lobbying efforts by President Clinton,
      Republican Congressional leaders killed the McCain-Feingold/Meehan-Shays campaign finance
      reform legislation this year. Campaign finance reform enjoyed universal Democratic support in the
      Senate and strong Democratic support in the House. The President continues to support passage of
      the bill and is encouraged that Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle was able to extract a pledge
      from Majority Leader Trent Lott to have a clean up-or-down vote on the measure before March 6,
      1998. Speaker Gingrich has also promised to hold a March campaign finance reform vote.

o     Enactment Of The Juvenile Justice Proposal: The President's Juvenile Justice legislation did not
      get far on Capitol Hill this year. However, the President used his executive power to make progress
      on some of the central initiatives in his legislation. For example, the President's legislation called
      for handguns to be sold with a child safety lock. President Clinton signed a directive to all Federal
      agencies requiring child safety locks be issued with every handgun. And the Administration reached
      an agreement with 8 major handgun manufacturers who agreed to provide child safety locks with
      each handgun sold.

o     Enactment Of School Construction Proposal: President Clinton proposed an initiative to invest $5
      billion over four years to finance $20 billion in school construction projects. The initiative was not
      included in the Balanced Budget the President signed.
