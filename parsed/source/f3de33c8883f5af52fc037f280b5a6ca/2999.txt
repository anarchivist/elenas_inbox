 TEXT:
 TO:                DIRECTOR FRANK RAINES
                    DEPUTY DIRECTOR JACK LEW
                    DEPUTY DIRECTOR JOHN KOSKINEN

 FROM:      OMB LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS

 DATE:      JUNE 17, 1997

 SUBJECT:           LEGISLATIVE REPORT


 John A. Koskinen, Deputy Director for Management, testifies tomorrow
 before the Senate Subcommittee on Oversight of Government Management,
 Restructuring, and the District of Columbia of the Governmental Affairs
 Committee regarding S. 314, "The Freedom from Government Competition Act"
 and competitive contracting within the Federal government.

 Jacob J. Lew, Deputy Director, will testify Thursday, June 19, before the
 House Subcommittee on Public Buildings and Economic Development of the
 Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure regarding budget scoring
 rules as they apply to real estate transactions.

 RECONCILIATION:
 The Senate Finance Committee continues to meet late into the night on
 Tuesday to markup the spending provisions in the bill.  They plan to
 finish the spending provisions on Wednesday, and go to the tax provisions


 on Thursday.

 The House Budget Committee plans to convene late   this week or even
 possibly early next week.  Chairman Kasich hopes   to resolve outstanding
 issues before the bill goes to the House floor.    The Senate Budget
 Committee aims to meet on Friday, and to proceed   to the floor on Monday.

 The Senate Commerce Committee completed its markup of the spectrum
 provisions today and reported their bill out of the Committee by a vote of
 16 to 5. We anticipate that CBO will score the bill at around $18
 billion. CBO released their official scoring of the House reported bill
 today: $9.7 billion, or $16 billion below the budget agreement.

 The balance of the weekD,s reconciliation markup schedule:

 Thursday, June 19th
         Senate Finance Committee                          Spending
