TEXT:
 Melinda just spoke to SSA and Ken's comments ARE going to be included in
the .final report. Therefore, HHS's comments ARE in conflict with SSAs.
The issue is whether to pull HHS's comments from the report.  Mary
Bourdette is the political person dealing with the issue at HHS.   We could
pull the HHSs comments and explain that it was inconsistent and could not
be reconciled with SSA in such short notice.
