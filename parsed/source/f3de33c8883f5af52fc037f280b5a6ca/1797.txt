TEXT:
The story on the service-learning announcement in today's NYTimes is the
Jeremy Rifkin "partnering" initiative that Harris pitched to us to do
here, and we said no thanks to, FYI.  It came out better (i.e., more
comprehensible to the average reader) than I expected ... wonder if we made
a mistake in passing it up, although we weighed in on pretty much the same
subject in the radio address.

Subject:         Partnering Initiative

One idea for a pre-summit event that Harris & co. are very pumped up about
strikes me as somewhat dull -- but I wanted to check it out with you.

It's called the "Partnering Initiative."  In a nutshell, I think the news
here is that a bunch of education groups are endorsing the concept of
service-learning in schools for the first time.  So it's big news in the
service world, but it doesn't strike me as event material.

Groups signing on include the Foundation on Economic Trends, NEA, PTA,
AFT, Council on Chief State School Officers, and National Association of
Secondary School Principals.  I'm not sure what this means, but Jeremy
Rifkin is very involved.  They actually plan to announce this at the
National Press Club on April 14, but would be flexible on dates, venue for
a WH event.

The only hook they have to offer is that this is some kind of call to
action on service in schools. We could certainly search for a better hook


 if you like this idea.
