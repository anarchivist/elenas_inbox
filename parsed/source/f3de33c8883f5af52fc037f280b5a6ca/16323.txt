Dear Mr. Connerly:

       Thank you for your recent letter supporting my effort to lead a national dialogue over the
next year on issues of race and reconciliation. Of all the challenges this country faces, building
one America is one of our most important undertaking. I intend to share your letter with my
Advisory Board on Race who are eager, as they help me in this endeavor, to hear from a broad
range of Americans and with varying opinions on matters of race.

       I share your admiration for President John F. Kennedy and his philosophy of equality
among and between the races. You and I also share the goal of achieving a society in which
discrimination against anyone on the basis of race no longer exists. Our disagreement is over on
some of the tools we must use in order to achieve our shared goal.

        A large part of your letter discusses affirmative action which, while not perfect, has been
one of the most effective tools used to achieve diversity within institutions and to address
problems of a lack of equal access to opportunity. As I stated in my commencement address to
the graduates of the University of California-San Diego, as a society, we cannot avoid the
unfortunate fact that racial, ethnic and gender discrimination continues to exist. We see
evidence of it every day. We also see continuing evidence of the enormous benefits that
diversity brings to institutions which demonstrates daily the need to preserve the gains made at
those institutions that have shown such progress in achieving diversity. As I have said, I
welcome suggestions as to other measures we might take that will combat the effects of past
discrimination, but don't believe that ending affirmative action at this time would achieve the
ends you profess to want. Quite the contrary, such a move would be quite disruptive. I have
yet to be presented with a tool which will work as well with no less disruption.

       The recent plummet in minority enrollment in California and Texas state universities is
persuasive evidence that tailored affirmative action plans, are still needed to ensure that under
represented students in those states have access to institutions of higher education and also to
enhance the breadth of experiences and knowledge that all students can draw from a diverse
student body. I look forward to working with these states to develop creative responses to this
problem that I am sure concerns us all. However, these distressing developments also
demonstrate that now is clearly not the time to simply do away with affirmative action.

        While I disagree with you that the time has come for us to be able to eliminate affirmative
action, at the same time, I am committed to ensuring that affirmative action, particularly when
undertaken by the federal government, is fair, balanced, flexible and extended only to qualified
recipients. I firmly believe that diversity and excellence walk hand in hand. And, I am proud to
say that the quality of my appointees in my administration as well as the judges I have
nominated, fully bears out this belief.

        Further, my Administration has worked diligently to reform affirmative action programs
across the federal government to ensure that they are narrowly tailored to a compelling
                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion

governmental interest. The Supreme Court indicated in Adarand that there is room for
affirmative action programs provided they meet these criteria. The Administration is working
within these requirements to preserve equal opportunity within the federal government in
employment, contracting and elsewhere.

        Again, thank you for your letter. While we disagree on the important issue of affirmative
action, I urge you to reach out to my Advisory Board on Race to continue the dialogue and seek
the solutions that we will pursue throughout the year.
