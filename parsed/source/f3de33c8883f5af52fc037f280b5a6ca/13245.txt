TEXT:
couple of things (some of which i have already relayed to some of
you) :
1. norm dicks called first thing yesterday morning to inquire reo
status of timber action.   i told him that we still thought that
the meeting with gorton was a top priority. he said gorton would
insist that that discussion only happen in the' context of
discussing the interior bill. i said that we had no problem
discussing the interior bill tho i had no reason for optimism that
that would be productive. norm was going to call gorton again and
try to set up meeting.
2. this am i mentioned to harold ickes and want to repeat to all
of you, we need to make a decision as to whether our principals
want to flag this issue as one we want fixed as part of the budget
deal.   i'm concerned that, if that is what we want to do, we need
to lay the marked down or we will be estopped from so doing later.
3. martha raised a question before the holiday on the proposal
kitzhaber has for a legislative fix.   know that he has decided not
to move it forward(this info from his office yesterday).   it is
like ours -- that is, it truly tries to fix problems; it does not,
for example, repeal the whole thing.   kitzhaber decided not to do
anything with it because it angers the enviros cause it does not
go far enough and it angers industry because it tinkers.   this
should be instructive to us as we decide how far we want to carry
our proposal. again, we need to define for ourselves a cut-off
point beyond which we decide whether simply to attack them for
extremism.
       I
