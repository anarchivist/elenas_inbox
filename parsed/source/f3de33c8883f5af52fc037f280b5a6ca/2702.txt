TEXT:
I have not heard about any briefing request.  I do think, though, that it
may have been made, perhaps b/c of the importance I impressed on Sally of
the White House not slowing any reg up.  If that is the case, I think it
is good that she is doing a briefing; I just think that you, Jen, and
Elizabeth should be there too -- if you want.

The biggest priority, however, (I think) is working the Dodd angle.  We
can slow or speed up how Sally handles this reg depending on our success
at changing the political dynamic. Tell me what, if anything, I can do to
help ...
