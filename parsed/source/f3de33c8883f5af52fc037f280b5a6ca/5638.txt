MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:                     Bruce Reed
                          Gene Sperling
                          Elena Kagan

SUBJECT:                  New Initiatives on Discretionary Side of Budget



Assuming OMB can come up with another $5 billion for discretionary spending, the DPC, NEC,
and OMB all recommend that you propose to fund the new initiatives listed below in your FY
1999 budget. We already have given you detailed memos on most of these initiatives. If you
approve the initiatives, you can announce them in the State of the Union.

EDUCATION

Education Opportunity Zones ($225 million): This initiative will provide funding to about 25
high-poverty urban and rural school districts for agreeing to adopt a "Chicago-type" school
reform agenda that includes ending social promotions, removing bad teachers, reconstituting
failing schools, and adopting district-wide choice.

Campaign on Access to Higher Education ($20 million): We are preparing to conduct an
intensive publicity campaign on the affordability of higher education. The goal of the campaign
would be to make every family aware that higher education is now universally accessible, as well
as to reiterate that higher education is the key to higher earnings. As a part of this effort, we
would provide families at high-poverty middle schools with an official notification of the
$20,000 or more that is already available for their children to go to college. "

College-School Partnerships ($150 million): To provide children in poverty with more than the
official notification of college aid (described above), this initiative will provide funding for
college-school partnerships designed to provide mentoring, tutoring, and other support services
to students in high-poverty schools, starting in the sixth grade and continuing until high school
graduation. The six-year funding path would provide help to nearly 2 million students. This
initiative builds on Eugene Lang's model of helping disadvantaged youth.
                                                                       Hex-Dump Conversion
Teacher Recruitment and Preparation ($67 million): This initiative, which you previewed last
July, will provide scholarships to nearly 35,000 new teachers over the next five years for
committing to work in high-poverty urban and rural schools. It also will upgrade the quality of
teacher preparation programs serving these communities.

Technology Teacher Training ($222 million): This initiative dedicates 30 percent of the
Technology Literacy Challenge Fund to ensure that at least one teacher in every school has
intensive training in the use of technology for education, so that they can train their colleagues.
An additional $80 million will begin an effort to train every new teacher in the latest technology.

Hispanic Education Action Plan - $195 million or more: This initiative will increase funding
for a variety of existing programs to address the Hispanic dropout rate and improve education for
Hispanic Americans and limited-English proficient (LEP) children and adults. It would double
our investment in training teachers to address the needs of LEP children; boost the Migrant
Education Program by 16 percent; increase the TRIO college preparation programs by 10
percent; and create a 5-year, $100 million effort to disseminate the best practices in ESL training
for adults. These and other program increases would be announced along with a number of
administrative actions to help Hispanic students complete high school and succeed in college.

After-School Program Expansion ($150 million): This part of a much larger child care
initiative (most of which is funded on the mandatory side of the budget) will provide additional
funding to the 21 st Century Community Learning Center Program (now funded at $40 million)
for before- and after-school programs for school-age children at public schools. Depending on
the exact funding level chosen, this investment will create programs in 1,500-4,000 new schools.

WELFAREIBOUSING

Welfare-to-Work Housing Vouchers ($283 million): The budget included $283 million for
50,000 new housing vouchers to help welfare recipients in public housing who need to move in
order to find employment. We would distribute these vouchers on a competitive basis to public
housing authorities working with local T ANF agencies and/or grantees of the new $3 billion
welfare-to-work program.

HOUSING

Housing Portability/Choice: In addition to the new welfare-to-work housing vouchers
discussed above, the package on housing portability and choice includes $20 million for
Regional Opportunity Counseling (ROC) sites; encourages the use of exception rents (rents up to
120 percent of the "fair market rent") as a tool for opening up more expensive suburban housing
markets; and eliminates obstacles to portability of Section 8 vouchers.

Fair LendinglFair Housing: As described in previous memos, we are working on a fair lending
initiative which has no budgetary impact. In the area fair housing, the budget does provide $8
million for enforcement which will help meet our goal of doubling fair housing enforcement
actions.
                                                                           ,\U10mated
                                                                           tk.d)ump Conversion

 "Play-by-the-Rules" Homeownership Proposal ($30 million): The budget includes a
 $30-million increase in the budget of the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation. This
 increase could be used for a new "Play-by-the-Rules" homeownership initiative that would help
 10,000 families become homeowners in FY99. We are going to help families that have a perfect
 track record of paying their rent on time with downpayment or closing costs assistance, a second
 mortgage, interest-rate buydowns, or rehabilitation loans.

 Community Empowerment Fund ($400 million): The budget provides $400 million for a
 public/private ("Eddie Mac") fund which will invest in inner-city businesses and create a
 secondary market for economic development loans (like Fannie Mae). [JON, ANY OTHER
 DETAILS]

 Homeownership Opportunity Fund ($11 million): HUD will develop a loan guarantee
 program to allow state and local governments to leverage current HOME funds with
 private-sector investments to fund large scale, affordable housing developments in distressed
 communities. [JON, HOW MANY COMMUNITIES, ANYTHING ELSE TO ADD] .

 LABORIWORKFORCE

 Child Labor ($89 million): The budget includes $89 million (FY 99) for a comprehensive Child
 Labor Action Plan, anchored by a $30 million commitment each year for five years to the
 International Program on the Elimination of Child Labor (IPEC). The initiative will include a
 stepped up Customs program to enforce U.S. law banning the import of goods made with forced
 or bonded child labor; increased support for the Migrant Education Program to support
 elernentaryand secondary education to an additional 50,000 hardest-to-serve migrant children.
 The budget also includes funds for the Department of Labor to double its enforcement of child
 labor laws in the agricultural sector. We will continue to develop non-budget items to
 complement the budget items.

   Community Adjustment ($50 million): As part of the Fast Track debate, we proposed the
   creation of the Office of Community and Economic Adjustment (OCEA). As you know, this
. office will be modeled after the Defense Department's Office of Economic Adjustment
   (OEA) -- the Administration's first point of contact with communities experiencing a .
   military base closure or defense plant closing. We provide $10 million for the first-year of
 . this office which would help 35-40 communities. We also expand the budget by $40
   million to deal with communities that deal with sudden and severe economic dislocation.
