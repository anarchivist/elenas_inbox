Option on Documents

1)  Industry must turn over all documents to the FDA on a non-disclosure
basis.

2)  Industry must immediately (prior to a settlement) make public all
non-privileged, non-trade secret documents.

3) Also all non-privileged, trade secret documents that do not relate to
formula or current advertising campaigns should be made public.

4) Disclosure process as outlined in your proposal for privileged
documents (question as to whether that process should begin before or
after the settlement).
