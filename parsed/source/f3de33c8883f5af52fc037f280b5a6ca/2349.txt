TEXT:
John Lozier of Healthcare for the Homeless dropped by the talk about the

homeless advocacy organization press conference.     He says that he has

traded voice mail messages with you.     He says the organizations are

sending a letter to the president c/o you reo a White House Commission on

Homeless.    I didn't give any sort of reaction since I didn't know what DPC

feels about this proposal.



We are looking at the nexus between welfare-to-work and homelessness.

Marriott seems to be pulling back from the "hardest cases", including

homeless welfare recipients.    We may try to feed into the VP's work to

develop support systems to keep welfare recipients in jobs.



Let me know if we can be of some help.
