TEXT:
Jennifer mentioned that she has checked around and that we may not have
enough to hang Friday's Patients Bill of Rights message event on.  We
originally spoke of School Violence as the message option, but then nixed
that.   Should we begin thinking about what makes sense to announce on
that day and what the policy shops would recommend based on what they have
left? Just makin' sure everyone knows what's happening. Thanks.
