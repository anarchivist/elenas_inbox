Re: academics. You both are very pithy.

Re: tobacco. We were looking for exec actions on the international front
and maybe this is one: There are draft commercial guidelines from State
that codify what we discussed in our last meeting -- what steps the
government will take to push tobacco products via our embassies etc. It
codfies our existing policy, essentially promising not to promote tobacco
products.  (This is not the same as limiting USTR in trade agreements in
which our policy is to not fight valid health regulations, only those
barriers that discriminated on the basis of national treatment.) Tarullo
met with Shalala and discussed this, concluding the commercial guidelines
might make a good Gore-Shalala event (see previous e-mail). What do you
think?
