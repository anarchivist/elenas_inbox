TEXT:
This Friday, Oct. 31, in Florida the main message event will be a Fast
Track event, then the.President will visit the elementary school he
cancelled on when he injured his knee and do a quick education speech.
Later in the day he will tape the radio address (from a golf course) on
the directive to ban assault weapons that Jose is working on.

We are now responsible for the elementary school event, which Ann thought
could mainly highlight the reading and parental involvement programs at
the school. The President's speech could focus on how reading is
fundamental and we all need to do more to make sure our kids can read --
including parents.  Tanya is looking into the programs at the school and
the parental involvement is great; the reading programs are also good.
I'll check with Mike, but is there anything newsworthy you think we should
try to include?
