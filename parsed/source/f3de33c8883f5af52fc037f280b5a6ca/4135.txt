      TEXT:
      HHS just called to tell me that MDRC had accidentally calculated their
      poverty numbers incorrectly. The new numbers are as follows:

      After 18 months, 71.4 percent of MFIP families had incomes below the '94
      poverty line, compared to 85.2 percent of control group families.

      I have made these changes in the attached documents below.

      Please substitute the following attachment for Wednesday's daily item.
      The only change in the document is in sentence #3.

      Before it read: "This combination appears to be a winning one: the program
      increased employment from 38 to 52 percent and reduced poverty from 60 to
      44 percent over an 18 month period."

      Now it reads: "This combination appears to be a winning one: after 18
      months, 52 percent of MFIP participants were employed, compared to 38
      percent in the control group. At the same time, 44 percent of MFIP
      families had income below the poverty level, compared with 60 percent in
      the control group."

Subject:         Daily Report Item for Wednesday


Stories are very likely to appear in Thursday's papers of a new MDRC study
of Minnesota's welfare to work program. Attached above is a daily item I
think should go in the Wednesday report -- the findings are interesting,
and MDRC studies always make news, particularly on slow news days.
Elizabeth Stock drafted this using the MDRC press release, executive
summary, and a memo Olivia and Pat Ruggles sent to Secretary Shalala.
Elizabeth's in the office Wednesday if you have questions (6-7871); Diana,
I've also left copies of the materials for you. Attached below are some
q&as describing the report.

        On Thursday, the Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation (MDRC) will
release a study showing Minnesota's Family Investment Program (MFIP) has both
increased employment and reduced poverty among long-term welfare recipients. This
welfare reform program was one of the first to provide both rmancial incentives to work
and mandatory participation in employment-related activities. This combination appears
to be a winning one: after 18 months, 52 percent of MFIP participants were employed,
compared to 38 percent in the control group. At the same time, 44 percent of MFIP
families had income below the poverty level, compared with 60 percent in the control
group. However, because participants were able to earn more and still receive benefits, MFlP
increased the duration of welfare receipt for some participants, and increased welfare spending
by 8 percent.

       Past studies have shown that mandatory employment-focused programs have often
increased employment but not reduced poverty in the short run, while programs that let families
keep more of their welfare benefits while working made families financially better off but did not
produce big increases in employment. MFIP, by combining work requirements with incentives,
has succeeded on both fronts. Minnesota, which started MFIP as a 7 county demonstration
project under the Bush Administration and expanded it to 8 counties under a 1996 Clinton
Administration waiver, has now adopted a modified version of the program statewide
underTANF.

               Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation Study
                on Minnesota Family Investment Program (MFIP)



Question:   What are the principal attributes of the MFIP program?

Answer:     There are three principal attributes of the MFIP program. First, MFIP
            provides recipients with enhanced f'mancial incentives to encourage work.
            Recipients continue to receive some MFIP benefits until their income is 40
            percent above the poverty line. Second, MFIP requires long-term recipients
            to participate in mandatory employment and training services. This
            requirement is for single parents who have received welfare for 24 of the past
            36 months and who are working fewer than 30 hours per week. Third,
            MFIP consolidates AFDC, Food Stamps, and the State's Family General
            Assistance into one cash grant.

Question:   What are the principal f'mdings ofthe MDRC study on MFIP?

Answer:     MFIP has produced some of the largest employment effects for long-term
            recipients that MDRC has seen in a welfare-to-work program, and has
            helped a proportion of families leave poverty. At the end of the 18-month
            follow-up period, MFIP increased employment by almost 40 percent: 52
            percent of these recipients were working compared with 38 percent of their
            counterparts in the traditional AFDC program. MFIP also reduced poverty
            by more than 25 percent: 44 percent of the MFIP families had income below
            the poverty line, compared with 60 percent of the families in AFDC.

Question:   How long has MFIP been operational and which agency is responsible for
            running it?

Answer:     The Minnesota Department of Human Services has been operating the MFIP
            since April 1994, under waivers granted under the Bush Administration and
            expanded under the Clinton Administration.

Question:   Where does MFIP operate?

Answer:     MFIP has been operating in the three urban counties of Hennepin (which
            includes Minneapolis), Anoka, and Dakota, and the four rural counties of
            Mille Lacs, Morrison, Sherburne, and Todd. In May 1996, HHS approved a
            waiver to expand MFIP to Ramsey County. The Ramsey county program
            was not part of the MDRC study, however.

Answer:     Yes, Minnesota has adopted a modified version of MFIP as its statewide
            policy under TANF. Minnesota will reduce the income level at which
            working recipients become ineligible for welfare from 40 percent to 20
            percent above the poverty line. This change should reduce the short-run
            costs of implementing the MFIP model statewide and reduce the duration of
            welfare receipt for some participants.

Question:   Was Minnesota able to achieve these results without an increase in welfare
            spending?

Answer:     No. MFIP increased welfare spending over the IS-month period by8
            percent, and increased the duration of welfare receipt for some participants,
            because working recipients were able to earn more and still be eligible for
            MFIP benefits. The Minnesota Department of Human Services is willing to
            make this investment because it believes that it will help families achieve
            permanent self-sufficiency.

Question:   Will MDRC continue to study the MFIP program?

Answer:     Yes. MDRC will produce a fmal MFIP evaluation report in 1999. This
            fmal report will examine the program's longer-term impacts, including child
            outcomes as well as fmancial measures.

                    Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation Study
                     on Minnesota Family Investment Program (MFIP)



    Question:   What are the principal attributes of the MFIP program?

    Answer:     There are three principal attributes of the MFIP program. First, MFIP
                provides recipients with enhanced fmancial incentives to encourage work.
                Recipients continue to receive some MFIP benefits until their income is 40
                percent above the poverty line. Second, MFIP requires long-term recipients
                to participate in mandatory employment and training services. This
                requirement is for single parents who have received welfare for 24 of the past
                36 months and who are working fewer than 30 hours per week. Third,
                MFIP consolidates AFDC, Food Stamps, and the State's Family General
                Assistance into one cash grant.

    Question:   What are the principal fmdings of the MDRC study on MFIP?

    Answer:     MFIP has produced some of the largest employment effects for long-term
                recipients that MDRC has seen in a welfare-to-work program, and has
                helped a proportion of families leave poverty. At the end of the 18-month
                follow-up period, MFIP increased employment by almost 40 percent: 52
                percent of these recipients were working compared with 38 percent of their
                counterparts in the traditional AFDC program. MFIP also reduced poverty
                by more than 25 percent: 44 percent of the MFIP families had income below
                the poverty line, compared with 60 percent of the families in AFDC.

    Question:   How long has MFIP been operational and which agency is responsible for
                running it?

    Answer:     The Minnesota Department of Human Services has been operating the MFIP
                since April 1994, under waivers granted under the Bush Administration and
                expanded under the Clinton Administration.

    Question:   Where does MFIP operate?

    Answer:     MFIP has been operating in the three urban counties of Hennepin (which
                includes Minneapolis), Anoka, and Dakota, and the four rural counties of
                Mille Lacs, Morrison, Sherburne, and Todd. In May 1996, HHS approved a
                waiver to expand MFIP to Ramsey County. The Ramsey county program
                was not part of the MDRC study, however.

                                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion

Answer:     Yes, Minnesota has adopted a modified version of MFIP as its statewide
            policy under T ANF. Minnesota will reduce the income level at which
            working recipients become ineligible for welfare from 40 percent to 20
            percent above the poverty line. This change should reduce the short-run
            costs of implementing the MFIP model statewide and reduce the duration of
            welfare receipt for some participants.

Question:   Was Minnesota able to achieve these results without an increase in welfare
            spending?

Answer:     No. MFIP increased welfare spending over the 18-month period by 8
            percent, and increased the duration of welfare receipt for some participants,
            because working recipients were able to earn more and still be eligible for
            MFIP benefits. The Minnesota Department of Human Services is willing to
            make this investment because it believes that it will help families achieve
            permanent self-sufficiency.

Question:   Will MDRC continue to study the MFIP program?

Answer:     Yes. MDRC will produce a rmal MFIP evaluation report in 1999. This
            rmal report will examine the program's longer-term impacts, including child
            outcomes as well as rmancial measures.
