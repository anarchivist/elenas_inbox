                            Identity Theft To Be Federal Crime

                            WASHINGTON (AP) -- Assuming someone's identity to
                            commit financial fraud would be a federal crime
under legislation
                            passed by Congress on Wednesday and sent to
President
                            Clinton.

                             Identity theft is the unauthorized use of a
person's name,
                            address, birth date, Social Security number and
mother's maiden
                            name to fraudulently obtain credit cards, loans,
and open bank
                            accounts.

                            Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt. who sponsored the bill
along with
                            Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., said Clinton would sign
the legislation. It
                            allows victims of identity theft to obtain
restitution and also
                            directs the Federal Trade Commission to
establish a centralized
                            complaints and consumer education service.

                            The measure also calls for forfeiture of
equipment used in the
                            crime.

                            Officials estimate that 40,000 people annually
have their
                            identities stolen.
