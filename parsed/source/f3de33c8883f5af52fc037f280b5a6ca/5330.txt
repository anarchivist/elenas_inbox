TEXT:
Since the President is seeing Senator Murray in Washington state on
Saturday, do you think he needs a memo in his trip book on the domestic
violence provisions of the welfare regulation? We could simply repeat what
we told him in this week's weekly (see below). The Senator's staff was
apparently a bit unpleasant at the HHS briefing

"The regulation also addresses Senator Murray's concerns about victims of
domestic violence without threatening the integrity of the work rules.
Under the regulation, a state will not be penalized for failing to meet
work rates or time limits if its failure to do so is attributable to
granting waivers to victims of domestic violence -- provided that the
waivers are temporary and that they are accompanied by services to help
the individual prepare for work and self-sufficiency.  Sen. Murray may
think that the regulation does not go far enough, but we think it
represents the best accomodation of the full range of interests."
