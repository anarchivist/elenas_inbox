TEXT:
As you recall, we agreed with Hilley that we would delay until September
any event launching a bill to reauthorize AmeriCorps.  I don't want to
miss the boat in terms of the President's schedule in September, and
Gomperts notes there are a couple of anniversaries in that month (Congress
passed it 9/12 and the President signed it 9/21 -- somewhat boring but a
bit of a hook) .

Do you want me to take a crack at a scheduling proposal/options now, or
wait a few weeks, or do you want to first touch base with Hilley to see
where he is on this?
