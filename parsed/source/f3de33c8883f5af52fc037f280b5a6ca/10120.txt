TEXT:
1. We meet with the agency folks and went through the technology which
looks fine, and they say the rule would be ready by mid-December.
Basically, the rule will require cars to be manufactured with two small
bars in that hidden space between seatback and seatbottom, by 2002.     Child
restraints will be required to be made with clips that easily and
audibly/or visibly attach to the clips. They have the child seat
manufacturers, car companies, and advocates on board and ready to come to
an event.   More importantly, they have projections showing an up to a
20,000 reduction in injuries and up to 48 lives saved. The only downside
is that the cost of the child restraint can go up, in one version of the
seat only 10-20 dollars, but up to $43 in another.     It will be important
to make this not only about ease of use (in which case why should the
government meddle?), but also 'about lives saved ('saving kids lives is
worth it). They say they focused grouped it and parents are happy to pay
the extra dollars.   (The cost of a car is supposed to go up $7-10 as
well). Evidently, one of the campaigners for the seat rule was a man who
lost his niece, Dana, to an improperly positioned child seat, which adds a
compelling element.                     .

2. Drunk/Drugged Driving. They are pitching a 12/18 event with cops to
reaffirm the drunk drivi'ng message and are getting grants etc. together
for cabinet affairs that might be announced by POTUS. Might want to get
Leanne into that.

3.   Rescue technology. They are developing demo projects for cars that
call 911 when they crash and tell rescuers where the car is. Evidently it
is on-going in Buffalo. Kind of interesting.
