  TEXT:
  Nicaragua boasts a unique cuisine.  Typical meals consist of eggs or meat,
  beans and rice, salad (cabbage and tomatoes), tortillas and fruit in
  season. Most common of all Nicaraguan foods is gallo pinto, a blend of
  rice and beans, with cooking water from the beans added to color the rice.
  Other traditional dishes include bajo, a mix of beef, green and ripe
  plantains and yucca (cassava), and vigor¢n, yucca served with fried pork
  skins and coleslaw.  Street vendors sell interesting drinks such as tiste,
  made from cacao and corn, and posol con leche, a corn and milk drink.  And
  most important, Nicaragua boasts the best beer and rum in Central America.

  There's a decent chance the President might be enjoying one of these
  regional delicacies when he reads our Daily Report tonight.  please send
  me your updates by 4 pm this afternoon (3/8) so we can get the report out
  in time for supper.
