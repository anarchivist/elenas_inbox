[Tobacco] is on the agenda by definition of being in the Senate bill and I
am sure KBH
will press for its acceptance. The House leadership has been intent on
keeping
controversial riders out and we may be able to appeal to that to keep them
on
our side, but if they see the Senate having all the fun of delivering 200
gazillion dollars to the states, they may want to play too ...

Also, no negotiations b/c bill on House floor all day yesterday and little
progress is likely over the recess, due to scheduling problems with staff,
I
think ...
