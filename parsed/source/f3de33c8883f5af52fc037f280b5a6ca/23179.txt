PATTON FIGHTS FOR STATES' TOBACCO MONEY IN WASHINGTON

Washington, DC -- Kentucky and the rest of the states are entitled to the
entire $246 billion tobacco. settlement agreement without federal
restrictions on spending, that's what Governor Paul E. Patton of Kentucky
told the United States Senate Appropriations Committee today in Washington,
DC.   Patton testified on behalf of the National Governor's Association
against a federal plan taking a percentage of the state's tobacco
settlement
as reimbursement for federal Medicaid expenditures.
"Medicaid is not a major component of the ·settlement, therefore the federal
government has no legitimate claim to the funds," the Governor told the
Senators.   "Medicaid was not mentioned at all in a number of cases and was
only one of a number of issues in many others.   I can assure you that I
agreed to the settlement as an attempt to recover at least a small portion
of the money Kentuckians have or will spend on tobacco-related illnesses
personally or through their government."   Patton said the state-by-state
allotments of the settlement were not based just on the federal Medicaid
expenditures, but on overall health care costs in each state.
The proposed federal plan would allow Medicaid recoupment of 57% on average
of the entire settlement agreement.   Kentucky, with more Medicaid matching
funds, would lose 70% of its allotted settlement dollars under this plan.
Kentucky's share would drop from $3.5 billion to $1 billion.
Governor Patton told the senators that the states need flexibility in
determining how to best help their state and citizens.   "I view the money
Kentucky state government will receive as belonging to the people of
Kentucky and the decision about how it should be spent should be made by
their representatives in the Kentucky General Assembly," Patton testified.
"Although states will spend significant amounts of money on programs that
improve the health, education and welfare of their citizens, states do not
need to be told how to spend any portion of their money."


Also under consideration by the US Senate is a plan to require 25% of the
settlement funds go toward smoking cessation programs.   The nation's
governors agree with the goal of reducing smoking, but oppose federal
mandates in this area.   "States are already spending funds on smoking
cessation and will substantially increase funding as the effectiveness of
programs becomes established," Patton said.   "We must have the flexibility
to spend funds in a cost-effective way."
Already included in the settlement are t
