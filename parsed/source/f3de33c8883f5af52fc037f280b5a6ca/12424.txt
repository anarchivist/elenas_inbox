          TEXT:
          As we discussed briefly in our somewhat recent meeting on choice, the
          choice groups, led by NARAL, are working to advance an amendment to the
          quickly-moving bankruptcy reform bill that would specifically disallow
          debtors in bankruptcy to discharge debts that they may owe from damages
          awarded to victims of clinic bombings, etc. Schumer is championing the
          amendment in the Senate (it lost in Committee by a narrow, largely
          party-line margin). As you will see below in an e-mail from WH leg.
          affairs, NARAL wants to meet with us soon to try to secure the
          Administration's support for the amendment.

          As you know, the Administration has several large concerns with the
          bankruptcy bills moving forward (a similar bill that moved through the
          House last year garnered a veto threat), and our ability to influence the
          bill on these large issues (means test, balance, etc.) is questionable, as
          is our ability to sustain a veto, frankly.

          The NEC-Ied bankruptcy working group will likely be looking to you both
          for guidance on the political and policy context of this amendment, but we
          should probably have a broader discussion soon to consider our position on
          the amendment vis-a-vis the rapid movement of the bill (e.g., if we want
          to kill the bill, maybe we should fight hard for the amendment).

          Subject:         The FACE Amendment

          NARAL wants to meet with us on Monday to discuss the Schumer and Nadler
          FACE amendments. Allison Hurit (sp?) wants the meeting to be with Schumer
          and Nadler's staff, them, and us.  I have a bit of a concern about this,
          because -- to the best of my knowledge -- we haven't discussed how helpful
          we're going to be on these amendments. As you know, generally we've
          remained silent except on the most significant of amendments.  Moreover--
          except for the possible political advantage (which if played well, could
          be significant) -- I think that most folks on the bankruptcy group
          probably think this amendment may not be the best bankruptcy policy.
          Indeed, even NARAL's own material's on the amendment note that given a


    recent Supreme Court decision, FACE damages are likely covered under the
    "willful and malicious injury" exception (NARAL appears to be worried
    about state FACE amendments which use a lessor standard of intent and
    forcing FACE victims to litigate the issue).  As a policy matter, I
    recognize the importance of protecting the constitutional right to an
    abortion, but I'm not sure damages under the FACE amendment should be
    protected more so than damages provided for under other statutes designed
    to guarantee other constitutional rights (e.g., voting rights, a Section
    1983 action).

    In short, I don't want to have to tell Schumer and Nadler (two guys who
    may carry a great deal of water for us on this issue) that we're not going
    to actively campaign for their amendments.

    That being said, if you all want, we can certainly make this a pro-choice
    deal and possibly throw a wrench in the progress of this bill.    I always
    like a good pro-choice fight.  Any thoughts?
