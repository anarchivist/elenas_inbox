Q.   What do racial incidents like the recent occurrence in Jasper say about the success
     of the Initiative and the state of race in this country?

A.    This first answer is being drafted by the PIR, but they would like our answer to the
     follow-up.

Q.   What role should the federal government play in addressing these kinds of
     incidents?

A.   The federal government must continue to playa leadership role in stamping out
     race-based hate and race-based crimes, through strict enforcement of our criminal and
     civil rights laws (including laws against hate crimes). In addition, all Americans -- not
     just government officials -- need to continue to speak out against hate, prejudice and
     senseless violence.

Q.   Aren't opportunities in this country limited more by class than by race? Thus,
     shouldn't class-based policies be our focus?

A.   America is moving closer to fulfilling its fundamental promise of equality and the
     opportunity for advancement for all. I have worked to restore the American dream by
     expanding the economy, investing in education for all children and making all of our
     communities safer. However, I recognize that while many ofthe challenges that we face
     are linked to issues of class, wealth and income, many others are rooted in racial and
     ethnic prejudices, both old and new. That is why we must focus both on creating better
     opportunities for all Americans in education, employment and economic opportunity and
     on developing and strengthening policies that are targeted to eliminating racial
     discrimination and racial disparities, such as increased enforcement of our civil rights
     laws and my initiative to eliminate racial and ethnic health disparities.

Q.   How do we get past our racial problems, when the Federal government relies so
     heavily on the use of racial classifications?

A.   Though our progress in bridging the racial divide in this country has been significant over
     the past 30 years, we don't yet live Dr. King's dream of all Americans being judged by
     the content of their character, rather than the color of their skin. As long as racial and/or
     ethnic categories have currency in our democr~y -- where we still see strong evidence
     of race-based housing and employment discrimination and large racial and ethnic
     disparities in health and college enrollment statistics -- the federal government must be
     able to both identify where race does playa role and target its efforts to close those gaps.

Q.   The issue of school choice has a racial impact -- more white students are able to
     afford and attend private schools while more students of color are stuck in
     low-performing public schools, especially in urban areas. Why not suppo~t full
     school choice (i.e., public, private, and parochial) to allow minority children to move
     into better schools?

A.   The best way to ensure that all children have access to a quality education in America is
     to focus on strengthening the public schools -- where 90% of our children are educated --
     and expanding choice within the public education system, such as through charter
     schools. Vouchers would diminish the country's commitment to public education by
     siphoning critical doll~s from neighborhood public schools that are already short on
     resources in order to send a few selected students to private schools. They would distract
     attention from the hard work of reform needed to change failing schools into good
     schools and good schools into outstanding schools.

     Public schools face a host of challenges, but the answer is to put competition, change,
     excellence, and accountability back into the public school system, not to take limited
     funds away from it. No child in America -- black or white; rich or poor -- deserves a
     second class education.
