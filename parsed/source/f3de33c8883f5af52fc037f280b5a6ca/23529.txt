TEXT:
Two questions for you --

Calls to Governors. As you know we want to give key people enough
information in advance so they can react to the radio address.  The
current plan is for Shalala to call Governors Carper, Thompson, Leavitt,
O'Bannon, and Hunt late tomorrow afternoon) and tell them where we ended
up on their big 3 issues (definition of assistance, separate state
programs, waivers). Would you prefer to call any of these guys instead?

Paper. We're planning to make heads up calls to governors and others
Friday without distributing paper. Does that make sense to you?
