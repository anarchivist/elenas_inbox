  TEXT:
  Katie asked that I summarize the results of discussions that took
  place this afternoon and evening involving two difficult issues
  related to the timber rider.
  1.  "First" and "Last" sales: these are the 2 sales on the Umpqua
  National Forest that were withdrawn by the Forest Service in 1990
  for failure to meet the requirements of the original §318. They
  are considered to be some of the most damaging sales outside of
  the murre let sales - and would severly impact runs of Coho salmon
  and cuthroat trout (both of which are proposed for listing under
  the Endangered Species Act). Judge Hogan has issued an injunction
  ordering us to release the sales.
  Jim Lyons has had several discussions over the past few days with
  representatives of Scott Timber who hold these sales and with the
  environmental plaintiffs to develop a package of replacement
  timber that would meet the purcahsers' needs and avoid having to
  release these units.   Despite some very preliminary progress,
  Scott timber moved cutting equipment on the sale unit today.   Jim
  has now gotten Scott to agree to hold off on cutting for one more
  day, and Jack Ward Thomas was directed tonight to proceed to
  develop a replacement timber offer over the next 24 hours. That
  timber will be in the matrix area of the President's Forest Plan
  in an area near Scott's mill. Jack also raised the issue of
  replacing that timber out of the Plan with additional timber, but
  was directed not to deal with the issue at this time, as we may be
'.

     able to make up the volume at a later point. These sales contain
     approximately 11 million board feet.   Meanwhile, Justice and USDA
     lawyers are working on a rulemaking that would be necessary to
     give the Forest Service the authority to offer replacement timber
     directly to the purchaser without going through the normal bidding
     process.
     It is certainly possible that at the end of the day (tommorrow),
     Scott timber will still decide to proceed with cutting. We will
     develop a statement for possible White HOuse use that would
     explain that we have no other choice but to release the sales,
     what we tried to do avoid that and explain why the Hatfield/Gorton
     language that's being proposed is an unsatisfactory solution.
     2. The murrelets sales:   these are the sales tied up in the
     litigation over the question of how to determine whether marbled
     murrelets, a threatened seabird, are "known to be nesting". We
     argued our case in front of Judge Hogan and lost.    Judge Hogan
     then granted a 60 day stay of his injunction to release these
     sales. We appealed his decision to the 9th Circuit, which has set
     oral argument in May.  Unfortunately, Hogan's stay runs out on
     Monday and the timber companies are arguing that they want to
     harvest the sales immediately - prior to the 9th Circuit decision
     - because the statute expires on Sept. 30th and if they want too
     long, they won't be able to get all of their timber.
     Argument on this issue is set for Friday on front of Judge Hogan.
     Justice developed several options for consideration. Their
     recommendation - in the context of winning the stay motion on
     front of Judge Hogan - was to proactively offer replacement timber
     for all of the sales we claim under "known to be nesting". Their
     rationale was that this would offer Judge Hogan - or,
     alternatively, the 9th Circuit - some comfort that the needs of
     the purchaser, would be met, and thus the stay would be extended,
     increasing the probability of saving the murrelets nesting trees.
     However, there are a number of difficulties identified with
     related to making a commitment of this magnitude (240+ million
     board feet) which could in essence extend the life of the timber
     rider past this fiscal year.
     Katie's direction on this point was to confine our argument on the
     motion to extend the stay to the considerable harm that would
     befall the birds should the trees fall before the 9th Circuit has
     a chance to issue their decision, to affirm that we would consider
     contract rights that were developed under the rider to last past
     Sept. 30th (but NOT the sufficiency language) and to state that we
     would (of course) honor those contract terms.    (One implication of
     this could be that we buy-back sales under the contract terms
     after Sept. 30th).  In short.       . to fight hard for the stay
     motion based on the equities to the birds, but to avoid anything
     that would extend the life of the timber rider.
     Sorry this is so lengthy; please call me at 5-5754 if anyone wants
     even more details.
