     TEXT:
     He~e's a brief summary of the public charge proposed regulation.    I
     believe the proposed rule gets us to where we and the advocates want us to
     be on the main issue (ie - receipt of Medicaid and CHIP is not a basis of
     public charge).    We are still waiting to receive the INS field guidance -
     which is important since it has the effect of requiring that INS officers
     begin to implement the proposed rule immediately and addresses other
     issues.   I will forward you a draft of the proposed regulation and
     guidance.   I am coordinating comments for DPC, please let me know if you
     have comments.

     DEFINITION OF PUBLIC CHARGE - The DOJ proposed rule defines public charge
     to mean - an immigrant who is likely to become "primarily dependent on
     government for subsistence, as demonstrated by either the.receipt of (1)
     public cash assistance for income maintenance or. (2) institutionalization
     for long-term care at government expense."   As part of· the rationale, a
     letter from HHS Deputy Secretary Kevin Thurm will be attached to proposed
     regulation.  This letter received concurrence from other agencies.

     PUBLIC CHARGE PROGRAMS - The DOJ proposed rule lists the programs upon
     which a public charge determination may be made - 551, cash TANF, and
     state or local cash assistance programs for income maintenance.  The only
     exception is "institutionalization for long-term care at government
     expense. " In addition, the proposed rule provides examples of programs
     that will NOT be considered in a public charge analysis such as Medicaid,
     CHIP, emergency medical assistance, Food Stamps, WIC, etc. and similar
     state and local non-cash benefits.

              ADMISSION AND ADJUSTMENT OF STATUS -    Under current law, an officer will
              apply a "totality of the circumstances" test to determine if an immigrant
              is likely (admission) or has become a public charge (adjustment of
              status). The factors that must be considered are - age, health, family
              status, assets, resources, education and skills.      Under the proposed
              regulation, an immigrant is inadmissible or ineligible to adjust their
              status if after considerations of the factors listed above, the existence
              of a binding affidavit of support, . and other relevant factors, the officer
              believes the immigrant will become "primarily dependent on government for
              subsistence, as demonstrated by either the receipt of public cash
              assistance for income maintenance or institutionalization for long-term
              care at government expense".   However, no single factor will be
              controlling not even the past or current receipt of public benefits.

              DEPORTABILITY - the proposed rule also clarifies the conditions that must
              be met to deport an immigrant as a public charge.    Based on a 1948 case,
              Matter of B, the court found to make a finding of public charge
              deportability, the INS must prove that an immigrant or their sponsor has
              failed to repay a legal demand for repayment of benefits that were
              received within the initial 5 years the immigrant entered the country . .
              However, if the immigrant can show that receipt of the benefit was a
              result of a condition that arose after admission into the country, he/she
              will not be deportable on public charge grounds.   Few immigrants have
              been found deportable under Matter of B test since there were no binding
              affidavits of support until welfare reform and therefore no legal
              obligation to repay benefits.   With the creation of binding affidavit of
              support that establishes such a legal obligation for repayment, DOJ has
              determined that the Matter of B case is now relevant to the determine
              public charge deportability. However, the proposed rule limits the
              application of the Matter of B test to receipt of cash benefits for income
              maintenance and long-term institutionalization at government expense.
