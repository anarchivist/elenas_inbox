TEXT:
Diane Ravitch is working on an op-ed for tomorrow's WSJ on our SOTU
proposals. We won't get a strong endorsement (she wishes we talked about
a national test for getting federal student financial aid, and standards
for Head Start), but I'm trying to get her on board with our stuff.

Lou Gerstner loved the piece in the Times today--he thinks we are
following recommendations he made to NGA about 3 years ago.  I sured his
staff that speech was very influential, and asked that Gerstner do a
supportive op-ed. He said they'd try.
