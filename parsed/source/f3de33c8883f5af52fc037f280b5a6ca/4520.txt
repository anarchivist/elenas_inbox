TEXT:
I spoke with Rob Weiner last night who was in touch with Doris Meissner
reo the CIR Report. Meissner thinks the stories on this may run over the
weekend, so we should have our statement and Q&A ready by COB today.

Two things carne up:

1) Statement.   They both thought that the WH statement should serve as
the statement for the whole Administration-- no other agencies should
release separate statements for now.  I think this is a good idea; we
shouldn't have other agencies putting out statements that might conflict
or undercut our statement.

2)  Q&A. They think it would be good to designate one press office to
handle press questions. Meissner would like for it to be INS' press
shop. As long as they use the same Q&A which we will circulate today, I
think this could work: If we have main Justice handle, it could send a
signal that we are already marginalizing INS.

Rob wanted to double check both of these with us.   Let me know if you have
other ideas. Thanks.
