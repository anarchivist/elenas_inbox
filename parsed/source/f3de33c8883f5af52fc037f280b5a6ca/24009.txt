                                    Question and Answer
                                        June 4,1999


Q:This morning on Good Morning America, the President said he would support
   requiring gun owners to register their guns. Why didn't the President propose this
   earlier? Is this something you are going to push for as the Congress- considers gun
   legislation?

A:    Last April, the President proposed the most comprehensive gun legislation put forward by
      any Administration in 30 years. We are pleased that the Senate passed a number of the
      President's proposals, including requiring background checks at gun shows, and
      mandating safety locks for handguns. But we will push the House to move forward --
      not backward -- on gun legislation, to include even more of the President's proposals
      such as raising the handgun age from 18 to 21 and requiring background checks for
      explosives purchases.

      As the President indicated this morning, we do not intend to pursue gun registration in the
      context of the legislation currently under consideration by the Congress, and we have no
      intention to introduce such legislation. The President made very clear that we are
      focused on the common sense steps we can take now to keep guns out of the hands of
      kids and criminals. We cannot allow the Congress to buckle under the NRA and delay
      or undermine passage of these sensible measures that will help save lives. And if the
      Congress fails to pass all of the measures contained in President's bill, we will continue
      to keep the pressure on Congress to do so.

                                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion
