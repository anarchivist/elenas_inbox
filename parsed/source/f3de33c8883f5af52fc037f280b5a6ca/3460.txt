TEXT:
USDA wants immediate clearance of a letter opposing a Lowey amendment that
would deny crop insurance and crop disaster relief for tobacco crops.
USDA's position is outlined below. Their position makes sense to me, but
we should word it carefully.   I'll get the letter. What do you think?

Elizabeth,

Just wanted to make sure that you are aware of this. TJ is fine
supporting the USDA position, but wants to weigh in with others in the EOP
to see if there are problems of which he is not aware.

Thanks.
Al

Subject:         URGENT: USDA draft letter supporting Tobacco crop insurance

House Ag Appropriatons Subcommittee Chairman Skeen has asked Sec.    Glickman
to send a letter to counter an expected floor amendment tomorrow,    and the
Secretary would like to send the letter today.   The amendment, to   be
offered by Congo Lowey (D-NY) , would prohibit USDA from offerring   crop
insurance or crop disaster assistance for tobacco - starting with    next
year's crop and forevermore thereafter.

The draft USDA postion is that "USDA is strongly opposed to this amendment
"   The letter states that crop insurance is the principal remaining
safety net for farmers who suffer crop losses; that most tobacco farmers
operate small farms and form an important part of the economy of many
rural areas; and that the Administration supports a "safety net" (as the
President cited when he signed the 1996 Farm Bill). It also recalls the
hurricanes of last year that hit tobacco growers hard in North and South
Carolina and Virginia, for which crop insurance provided significant
indemnity payments.

The Administration has not quite broached the fate of tobacco farmers in
the current tobacco company settlement talks.   However, there has been
some talk of ensuring any adverse affects on their livelihood are offset
 (USDA currently does not forecast adverse affects: while domestic demand
may decrease from the deal, export demand is growing).   In addition, in a
March 1994 ACB News Special that featured the President answering
questions from young people at the White House, the President stated,
"There are a lot of good people in America who still raise tobacco. And
we should have funds set aside for them (in the cigarette tax) to help
them convert away from raising tobacco to doing other kinds of farming so
they can actually make a living."   (This is about all we've got on the
President's potential views on this issue.)

In our view, some version of the safety net argument for preserving crop
insurance for tobacco, and opposing the Lowey amendment, would appear a
consistent Administration position. But this issue is clearly above our
heads, and so request any guidance you can offer as soon as possible.
Thanks.

For what it's worth, I think the President's statement speaks for itself;
and we have certainly made crop conversion a part of our economic
response.  Therefore, I see no way that we can back cutting off crop
insurance -- certainly not now, and probably even after we get a
substantial part of the land base to convert.
