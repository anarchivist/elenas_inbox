BR/EK:

Did you folks know that both the minority staff director job (Putala) and
minority counsel for Biden are opening up, and that Biden's new chief of
staff will be Alan Hoffman (who used to work at HHS before becoming an
AUSA in Philly)? Any ideas for good candidates?

I fear that Putala's departure -- along with David Yasky's upcoming
departure from Schumer's staff -- is one more sign that the network of
crime-saavy dems that helped us pass the Crime Bill is coming apart.
