TEXT:
I talked to Kevin about the Thurs mtg.  He thought it would be great to
put a process in place to analyze the settlement, if any.  Their
recommendation for our opening line is, we haven't seen the agreement,
I've asked my public health advisers to study it.

 He also said they would probably make a formal recommendation soon that
it's time to proceed with an EO banning smoking in federal workplaces.
