S. 1723 - American Competitiveness Act
(Abraham (R) Michigan and 15 cosponsors)

S.1723, D&The American Competitiveness Act,DB is intended to respond to a
reported skills shortage in the information technology industry by
increasing the annual cap on the number of temporary visas for foreign
D&specialtyDB workers under the H-1B program.  For the reasons outlined
below, the Administration strongly opposes Senate passage of S. 1723.   If
S. 1723 were presented to the President, the Secretary of Labor would
recorrunend that the bill be vetoed.

Regrettably, S.1723 emphasizes providing opportunities for foreign workers
rather than providing opportunities for and protecting U.S. workers.  The
billD,s temporary increase in the annual number of H-1B visas is too large
(up to 115,000) and lasts too long (5 years).   In addition, the bill does
not help ensure that U.S. workers do not lose their jobs to temporary
foreign workers and that qualified U.S. workers have the opportunity to
fill a job before a temporary foreign worker is hired.  Moreover, rather
than strengthening program requirements and enforcement to prevent
employer abuses of the H-1B program, S.1723 undermines some of the
programO,s important enforcement provisions.

Since 1993 the Administration has sought reforms of the H-1B program,
including requiring employers to make bona fide efforts to recruit and
retain U.S. workers before hiring temporary foreign workers and
prohibiting lay-offs of U.S. workers to replace them with foreign
temporary workers.  These reforms, if enacted, would help target H-1B
usage to industries and employers that are experiencing skill shortages.

Also, the Administration believes that the first step in increasing the
availability of skilled workers for industry must be increasing the· skills
of U.S. workers and helping.the labor market work better to match
employers with U.S. workers. Although S.1723 includes an authorization
for a scholarship fund and a small fund to train dislocated workers, the
Administration believes that increased training opportunities for U.S.
workers should be funded through an H-1B application fee paid by employers.



      Substantial additional efforts by industry to increase the skill level of
      U.S. workers and needed improvements in the H-IB program are necessary
      prerequisites for the Administration to support any short-term increase in
      the number of H-IB visas available for temporary foreign workers.  The
      Administration wants to work with the Congress to develop a bill that
      addresses the growing demand for highly skilled workers, while effectively
      protecting and promoting the interests of U.S. workers and enhancing the
      international competitiveness of important U.S. industries.
