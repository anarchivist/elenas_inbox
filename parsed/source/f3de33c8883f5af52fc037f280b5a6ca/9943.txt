TEXT:
I am working with the VP's office and Cabinet Affairs on a domestic
message calendar for while the President is in Asia. There are 3 or 4
days with message opportunities.  The agencies have made a couple of
recommendations, but we could really use a few more strong and substantive
options for possible policy announcements.

There is also 1 day when the VP is not available, so we will ask a cabinet
secretary to do something, unless we have something here that maybe John
P. or someone else could do.



     Could you think about any ideas or recommendations and we will pull a
     meeting together for Monday to review? Thanks very much for your help on
     this.
