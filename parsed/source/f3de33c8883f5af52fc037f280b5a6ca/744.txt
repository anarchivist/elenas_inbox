TEXT:
Ken Apfel says that there was a decision in the 7:45 yesterday NOT to
release the disability work incentives a day early, and therefore he is
not comfortable with announcing these today because of whatever
conversation went on in that meeting (which he didn't hear first hand).

Bruce, does yesterday's conversation/decision mean that we have to clear
this with more people before proceeding?
