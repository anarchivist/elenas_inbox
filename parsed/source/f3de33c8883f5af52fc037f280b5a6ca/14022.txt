TEXT:
I think the 45 day comment period is a dumb idea that will
needlessly antagonize the states. We're not regulating them on
process anymore, we're supposed to keep an eye on results.   If
there is any legal authority for this, I'm sure it's flimsy.    And
with Congress considering repealing the DC waiver, we shouldn't
forget that HHS is infinitely capable of causing us unnecessary
political headaches.
