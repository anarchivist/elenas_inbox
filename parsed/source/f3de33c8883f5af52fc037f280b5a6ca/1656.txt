 TEXT:
 The President is doing a joint press conference with Prime Minister
 Chretien on Tuesday of next week.  We need to have updated Q&A by Monday
 at 9:00 so that Elena can review that morning and hand it in by 12:00 to
 the Press Office. No extensions folks.   Get this to me by E-Mail.

 Thanks.
