TEXT:
She is going to the summit; she was invited by Billy Shor.

She says she can't go much beyond the current 900-1,000 for 3 reasons.
She says her ideal size would be 1,200! No way could she double it.

1. They are limited to official teacher shortage areas and have various
certification constraints imposed by school districts.  So they aren't in
lots of places for lots of reasons -- not in Boston because there's a
teacher glut; not in Phila she thinks because of rules about
certification.  She says a lot of the shortage is actually in areas like
special ed and bilingual that aren't qualified for.  This all seems very
different than we thought!

2. Applicants:  She doesn't think she can get more than about 500 high
quality people a year.  The number of their applicants has shrunk from
3,600 to 2,500 in the last 3 years.    They would love to have more
applicants, and said if the president wanted to challenge more college
students that would be great -- but then I said maybe it wouldn't be
because of item 2!

3. Management and financial constraints.

She suggested that the President call for an expansion of the teacher
corps concept into more professional areas (child care corps, anyone?) to
add to the youth corps model of AmeriCorps, which is fine, toward more
"professional" corps.  She'is sending me something on this.
