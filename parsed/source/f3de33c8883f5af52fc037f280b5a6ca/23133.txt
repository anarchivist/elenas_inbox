 PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
 RADIO ADDRESS ON POLICE MISCONDUCT
 THE WHITE HOUSE
 March 12, 1999

         Good morning.  I am joined here at the White House today by Attorney
 General Reno and representatives from law enforcement and civil rights
 groups to talk about what we must do to strengthen the bond of trust
 between police officers and the communities they serve -- and make our
 streets safer than ever.

         For too long, violent crime seemed destined to rise in America.
 Six years ago, I took office determined to change that. Working in
 partnership with state and local law enforcement, we put in place a
 comprehensive crime fighting strategy -- with more police, more
 prosecutors, better prevention, and fewer illegal guns. Today, we know
 our strategy is working beyond our expectations. Nationwide, crime is
 down to its lowest levels in decades.  In communities across America,
 families feel safe again.

         Community policing has been at the heart of our success.  By
 involving police in the lives of the people on their beats -- and
 involving residents in law enforcement decisions that affect their lives
 -- community policing has created a bond of respect and trust, strong
 enough to turn back the rising tide of crime.

         Unfortunately, this bond has begun to fray in some communities
 where residents complain that the cost of falling crime rates is rising
 police misconduct and abuse.  And several recent incidents of such
 misconduct -- from excessive use of force to the demeaning and often


 dangerous practice of racial profiling -- have made us all acutely aware
 that we must take action now.

         We know that the vast majority of our nationD,s police officers do
 things by the book -- they put on their badges every day and put their
 lives on the line for our safety. And we know that the vast majority --
 fully 99% -- of people who have face-to-face encounters with the police
 believe they were treated fairly.  But even one incident of police
 misconduct -- especially when it is racially motivated -- is one too
 many.

         That is why as part of my balanced budget for 2000, I have
 proposed a $1.3 billion dollar 21st Century Policing initiative.   This new
 initiative will help us put up to 50,000 more community police on our
 streets and give them the high-tech tools they need to do their jobs.
 Just as important, it includes new funding to prevent police misconduct
 and to engage the entire community in our fight against crime.

         My 21st Century Policing initiative includes $40 million in new
 funding to improve police training, and to help police officers raise
 their level of education -- and their level of understanding.  It will
 help establish more citizen police academies that inform residents about
 police procedures and teach them new ways to make their neighborhoods
 safer.   By increasing funds for minority recruiting, it will help build
 diversity on our nationD,s police forces and build up the bond of trust
 where it is most needed.

         And make no mistake. When police officers do break the law, my
 new initiative will also help bring them to justice. We will not let a
 few bad cops undermine the progress that thousands of police officers have
 worked so hard to achieve.

         These steps will help strengthen our police forces and keep our
 people safe.  So I calIon the Congress to pass my 21st Century Policing
 Initiative as one of its first orders of business.

         I am pleased that we have begun this dialogue here today -- but we all
 know that there is much more to be done.  Today, I am asking Attorney
 General Reno to convene a series of meetings with law enforcement and
 community leaders to see what else we can do to ensure that our criminal
 justice system serves all Americans.  Together, we will build safer
 communities and a stronger nation in the 21st Century.

         Thanks for listening.
