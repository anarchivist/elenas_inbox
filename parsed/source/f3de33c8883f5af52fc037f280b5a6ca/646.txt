TEXT:
i have been working with nga and gov chiles and carper on immigration. the
nga policy currently adds back legal immigrants eligible for ssi and fs
who were in the cOunrty on date of enactment and have a good reason why
they can't naturalize. ny and texas may decide to go further.  i've told
the dems to puch as hard as they can for more.  we are working on it.
frank and bruce should talk about this at dga meeting on saturday as say
as much as they can about the budget.

fyi, i am hearing that r's on the hill may be thinkng about a decretionary
block grant for legal immigrants to take care of pataki and bush. have
you heard this?
