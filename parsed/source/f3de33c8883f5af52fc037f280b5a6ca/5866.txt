TEXT:
Elena,

Do you need to see the latest draft of the IWG report on Native Americans
before we give it finally to Lyn? Leanne and I are incorporating your
comments and we have let Lyn know that .we are almost done with it. We
have suggested that she might want to consider releasing it in conjunction
with the Advisory Board meeting in Phoenix, but that it is her call.   If
she decides to do that, we are on a very short time frame (the meeting
with tribes is Tuesday).  Thanks.

Julie
