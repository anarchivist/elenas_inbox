TEXT:
Could you please let me know by 4:30 p.m. TODAY (August 29th) if you have
any comments on the Justice Report on HR1703, "Department of Veterans
Affairs Employment Discrimination Prevention Act"?  If I do not hear from
you by then, I will assume that you do not have any comment on this report.

A reminder: OMB has previously cleared a VA letter opposing HR1703.           The
Justice report is secondary to that VA letter, which expresses the
official Administration position.

Thank you.
