8/20/97 DRAFT LEITER TO COLLEGE PRESIDENTS



Dear:

The welfare reform law that President Clinton signed into law last year emphasizes work and
personal responsibility. One important question that has arisen in some States is whether
welfare recipients attending college must drop out to meet the law's work requirements. We are
writing to provide information about how welfare recipients can combine employment with
education and how States can use the flexibility in the law to use college to prepare recipients for
work.

Under the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) welfare program, summarized in
the attachment, welfare recipients can meet the work requirements and attend college, if colleges
work with State and local officials to provide qualifying work opportunities aligned with the
students' academic needs. For example, the Federal Work Study (FWS) Program, administered
by the Department of Education, can be used to provide work opportunities to help meet the
work requirements under TANF, if consistent with State T ANF determinations as to what is
work. Federal law does not limit the number of hours that a student can work under the Federal
Work Study program, so long as the student's academic and financial need and the college's
FWS allocation are taken into account. We encourage States to recognize work study as work
under TANF; ifthey do so, the Federal Government will recognize such work as meeting the
work participation requirements, so long as the required number of hours of work are performed.

In addition, we encourage you to explore with appropriate officials at the State and local level
other options to accomodate college attendance with the requirements of welfare reform. As
described in the attachment, States have the authority to use an array of services and activities,
including education and training, to prepare recipients for work and self-sufficiency. A list of
State welfare agency administrators is enclosed.

Achieving the Administration's goals of making welfare reform a success and increasing access
to college education requires continued cooperative effort from many parties. We look forward
to continuing to work with you and State and local officials in this process. Please feel free to
call upon us or the following individuals if you have any questions:




                                             Sincerely,


Donna E. Shalala                                              Richard W. Riley
Secretary of Health and Human Services                        Secretary of Education

                                ATTACHMENT
                    POST-SECONDARY EDUCATION UNDER TANF



The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program emphasizes work and
short-tenn training leading directly to work rather than longer term education and training. Each
year, States must place an increasing percentage of their case10ad in work activities that are
prescribed in the statute. In Fiscal Year (FY) 1998, beginning October 1, 1998, States must
engage 30 percent of all recipients in work rising to 50 percent by FY 2002. In FY 1998, single
parents must work 20 hours per week, increasing to 30 hours per week by FY 2000 in order to be
counted as "engaged in work" for the calculation of the State's participation rate.

Non-vocational post-secondary education does not count towards a State's participation rate.
Vocational educational training, including vocational post-secondary education, is one of the
specified activities, but can be counted for no more than 12 months per recipient and for no more
than 30 percent of individuals who count towards the State's participation rate. States can count
as work unsubsidized or subsidized employment, on-the-job-training, work experience,
community service, providing child care services to individuals participating in community
service, limited periods of job search, and secondary school for teen parents.

States must require all recipients to work after receiving benefits for 24 months, whether or not
consecutive. For the purpose of this requirement, work is defined by the State. Many States are
choosing to impose work requirements earlier. Federal funds may not be used to provide
assistance to families containing an adult who has received assistance for more than 60 months,
and States may impose shorter time limits.

Although some post-secondary activities may not be countable for the State's participation rate,
States are not otherwise precluded from spending their TANF dollars on these activities, so long
as they promote job preparation, work, and self-sufficiency for needy families or promote one of
the other primary goals of the TANF program. At the same time, States receive credit towards
the participation rate for caseload reductions not caused by eligibility changes. An effective
welfare-to-work program which includes support of post-secondary education, therefore, could
help a State achieve the participation rate requirement even if participation in those specific
activities are not countable.

In addition, federal law does not preclude States from encouraging recipients to combine their
required work activity with additional education. Although it is not easy to raise children, work
in a job, and go to school at the same time, many Americans do so each year. Most
undergraduate students, whether or not they are raising a child, work while attending college.
Almost all part-time students work; over half of full-time students work over 20 hours per week.
                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion

Many States are using their flexibility under the welfare law to help welfare recipients combine
work and education. For example:

·      Florida provides up to two years of supportive services, including child care, to
       individuals who successfully leave welfare for work and who wish to return to school in
       order to move to a better job.
·      California is increasing work-study positions for welfare recipients and has received an
       AmeriCorps grant to support service-learning positions for recipients studying early
       childhood education.                        .

States have great flexibility in designing their T ANF programs. The scheduling of work
activities and the availability of child care for both work and classes, for example, affect whether
taking college classes is a real possibility for recipients. University officials may wish to
explore with appropriate officials at the State and local level these and other options to
accommodate college attendance with the requirements of welfare reform. Such a dialogue
might include, for example, student employment opportunities on campus or other arrangements,
such as internships or work cooperatives, that would allow these students to continue their
studies, whether full- or part-time. The possibility of redesigning courses and programs to meet
the new needs of welfare recipients for intensive, short-term, job-oriented training also merits
consideration. States that wish to promote college as an option can also leverage resources from
outside the welfare system to support this goal.
