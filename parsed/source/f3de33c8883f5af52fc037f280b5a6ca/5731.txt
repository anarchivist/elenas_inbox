TEXT:
Any idea where Safire go the idea that "Clinton appears ready to trade
aways his desire for national standards -- too obvious a centralizatino of
power -- for the Federal money to finance local programs". I though we
were spending all this money so we could have national standards.  Is
there something going on I ought to know about?
