SUBJECT:   Paragraph on Seat Belt Report

TEXT:
In January the President directed the Secretary of DOT to work with
consumer and industry groups to develop ways to increase seat belt use and
to report back to him in 45 days (March 10).   Increasing belt use in the
u.s. by 15 percentage points -- from 68% to 83%-- would save over 2000
lives annually and would reduce airbag injuries. DOT's report is likely
to urge the President to:  set an ambitious national goal for seat belt
use (XX % by the year 2000); challenge the states to pass "primary" seat
belt laws (laws that allow cops to pullover and ticket passengers solely
for not wearing seat belts); provide $9 million in financial incentives to
states to improve and enforce belt laws (consistent with our budget and
draft ISTEA proposals); and challenge business groups to fund passenger
safety education. DOT is working to get private sector commitments to
fund education efforts before the report's release.   DOT expects to be
ready for any event as soon as March 13 or 14.
