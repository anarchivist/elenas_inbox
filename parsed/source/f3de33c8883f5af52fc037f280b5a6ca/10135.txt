Sorry, I didn't circulate this sooner ... we didn't get the FBI #s 'til this
afternoon.  We should get this approved and out by mid-day tomorrow, so
DOJ can make it available to their press.

                                   Statement by the President
                       (Embargoed until 9:00 am, Sunday, November 22, 1998)


    The 1997 Uniform Crime Report released by the FBI today shows that serious crime has fallen
    for 6 years in a row. With the murder rate down 26% since I took office, and to its lowest level
    in 3 decades, Americans are safer today than they have been in years. They should be proud.
    By working together -- with their local police, prosecutors and other government officials -- they
    have fought back, reclaimed their neighborhoods, and proven that rising crime and deadly
    violence do not have to be tolerated by any community. But crime remains a serious problem in
    many communities, and our work is far from done. We must continue the job of putting
    100,000 more police on our streets, tougher laws on our books, and stronger prevention in our
    schools. With these efforts, we can keep driving down the crime rates -- and tipping the scales
    of justice in favor law-abiding citizens.
