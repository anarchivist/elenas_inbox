TEXT:
On May 15, 1997, you will be attending the Annual Police Officers'
Memorial Event hosted by the Fraternal Order of Police on the Mall.  This
is an opportunity to layout your crime agenda for the coming year, and
make a strong push for your juvenile justice legislative package which is
being marked-up in the House this week.  Specifically, you could argue for
the inclusion of your proposed requirement that safety locks be sold with
every gun, which is currently absent from the House bill. The FOP and
most other police organizations strongly support this provision.

The main policy announcement could be that you are sending legislation to
the Hill that day that would expand the "Deegan" Law, which provides
educational scholarships to the children of federal officers killed in the
line of duty, to state and local officers.    The Police Corps funding you
will be announcing at the Service Summit does include educational
scholarships to state and local officers' children, but new legislation
would make this an entitlement identical to the Deegan Law so that
children of all law enforcement officers can receive an education in the
case of a tragedy.

In addition, you could use this forum to announce new concealed weapons
!:echnology and new "smart gun prototypes" which will help protect police
officers in the future.

FYI: (Police officers are acutely aware that there is a lot of work to be
done before this technology becomes useful on a daily basis, so this
should not be the centerpiece of the speech.  It does, however, show that
we are looking to reduce injuries to cops down the road.)
