Hi Elena.  Presidential Messages has asked us what policy language we
would like highlighted in the Roe v. Wade message. Audrey mentioned that
you were taking a look at that. Let us know what you are thinking and how
we can help pull that together.  Presidential Messages would like
something ASAP so that they can get the message ready by 1/19.  please
advise. Thanks.
