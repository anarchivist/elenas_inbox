 TEXT:
 On Wednesday at 5, CDC plans to release a new MMWR on price elasticity for
 adult smokers (age 18 and up).  This information is confidential -- I
 don't know if the rest of HHS even knows about it yet.  Generally, the
 report finds that minorities are much more price sensitive than whites;
 low-income people are much more price sensitive than higher income people;
 and younger people are much more price sensitive than older people.

 Here is what we can expect to see in the report (this is adjusted for
 income) :

 Across all age groups:  For every 10% increase in price, we would see the
 following percentage of people quit:

            12 % of Hispanics
            3.2% of African Americans
            0.5% of Whites

 Among 18-24 year olds:  For every 10% increase in price,       the following
 percentage of people would quit:

            20.3% of Hispanics
            8.6% of African Americans
            0.6% of Whites

 Among 40 year olds and up:  For every 10% increase in price,       the
 following percentage of people would quit:

            5.4% of Hispanics
            2.2% of African Americans
            0.2% of Whites

Among people with family incomes below the median:     For every 10% increase
in price, 1.8% would quit.

 Among people with family incomes above the median:    For every 10% increase
 in price, 0.4% of people would quit.

Overall, the MMWR elasticity estimates for adults is -0.13 for quitting
and -0'.23 for quitting and reducing.



 I will fax you an elasticity table from the report. We will make sure
 that Treasury is prepared for the release of the MMWR. Is there any
 particular analysis that you think they need to do?
