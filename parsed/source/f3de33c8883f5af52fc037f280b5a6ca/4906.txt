 TEXT:
 I have more information on the proposed Cessna/Wichita event, including an
 October 1st memo that Cessna CEO Russ Meyer sent directly to the
 President.

 Meyer describes the event as a dedication ceremony for their new welfare
 to work facility, marking what they call a "major expansion" of the
 program theyD,ve run since 1990 to train "men and women who were
 unemployable and subsisting on welfare" for jobs at Cessna. The President
 would congratulate the program's 200 graduates now in the workforce and
 highlight this public-private partnership as a national model.   Meyer says
 heD,s also invited Secretaries Glickman and Cuomo (HUD loans helped pay
 for the expansion) and plans to invite Senators Dole and Kassebaum who
 have both been long-time supporters.

 Kate Carr and Lyn Hogan say the Welfare to Work Partnership does not plan
 to have any announcements at the event, nor do they plan a major effort to
 recruit Wichita companies for the Partnership.   Instead, they see this as
 an opportunity for the President to highlight the good work one of their
 members is doing.   If this event were held on November 17th, the
 Partnership would still plan to announce its advisory board (including
 about 20 governors) ,in Washington D.C. on November 19th during their board
 meeting and they still very much want their board to have face time with
 the President that day. Bruce--do you want to discuss this with Eli?

 The information I have on the program looks good. My only concerns are
 that it appears small (with 200 total graduates I believe since 1990,
 although the materials arenD,t entirely clear), expensive ($5.27 million
 for the new facility -- this, plus operating costs probably add up to a
 high cost per participant), and some of their trainees were probably not
 AFDC/TANF recipients (but unemployed men or food stamp recipients).   On
 the other hand, the program 1) provides state of the art training and day
 care; 2) guarantees all successful trainees a private sector job at
 graduation; 3) provides a complete wage and benefit package during
 training; and 4) is part of a true public-private partnership which has
 helped revitalize an entire community.
"

    Here are some questions for which I think we need answers.   Do you have
    others?

    1) The proposal refers to 200 graduates who would be congratulated -- are
    these the total number of graduates since the inception of the program in
    1990? If not, how many individuals have been trained by the program since
    its inception?

    2) How many more individuals will be trained at one time in the new
    facility versus the old one?

    3) Is the new facility an entirely new building or set of buildings or an
    expansion of the previously-used building?

    4) Were all the trainees welfare recipients, i.e., been on AFDC or TANF?
    The proposal refers to O&men and women who were unemployable and
    subsisting on welfare08 which.indicates some were not actually on
    welfare.

    5) How much per person does the training program cost, when all the public
    and private contributions are totaled?

    6) Do all the trainees get hired by Cessna? If other employers are
    involved, what percent of the trainees get hired by Cessna?
