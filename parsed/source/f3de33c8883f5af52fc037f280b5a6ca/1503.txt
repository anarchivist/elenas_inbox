TEXT:
You asked if I had any thoughts about the memo to the President from Maria
and Kitty on whether he should call on the FDR memorial commission to show
FDR in his wheelchair in the memorial. We have worked with public liaison
on this for some time, and we have generally supported OPL's strong view
that the memorial should depict the disability.

By the way, the memo came back from the President and he selected the
option Maria recommended -- that he attend the dedication ceremony but
call on the commission to add a sculpture showing the disability.   (For
some reason, Todd Stern's cover memo on this referred to support from
"Maria, Kitty, Erskine, Sylvia, John Hilley and Carol Rasco.")
