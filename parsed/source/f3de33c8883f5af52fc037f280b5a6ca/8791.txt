    I confess to feeling somewhat baffled by this -- an executive order on
    children saying what?? I'm going to ask Jen to call Lynn to find out what
    she wants and why, but I have to say that I'd oppose an executive order on
    "children's lives." We have many different initiatives that focus on
    children -- we have education policies, child care polcies, health
    policies, etc. We shouldn't trivialize our work in this area by issuing
    an executive order telling everybody to everything they can for every
    child.

    How did you all respond to this? didn't we do something re children--or
    was it just the order directing issuance of data re children? do I need
    to follow up here?

Subject:         proposed EO

There are requests for an EO on children--Indian children, Asian children,
other minority children. Some of us have been talking and while we agree
that an initiative on children's health, education and other aspects of
their lives is timely, we would like to do just one document.  I would
assume that you agree with this. My proposal is that we meet internally,
come to a decision, and then work with the outside groups to ensure that
the major needs are covered. Do you want to convene such a meeting--we c
ould tell you who would need to be at the table from our side of the
perspective.  Let me know.
