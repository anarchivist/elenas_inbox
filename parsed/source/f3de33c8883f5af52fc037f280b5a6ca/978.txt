TEXT:
Would like to invite you to a short meeting on Tuesday, Feb 25 at
2:30-3:00 in Chris Jenning's office to discuss the issue of long term care
services for people with disabilities.

In November, we committed to a meeting with the President and disability
leaders to discuss, "such issues as personal attendant, home and community
based services, and other issues ... " The purpose of this meeting will be
to determine what, if anything, we are prepared to do on this subject
prior to a meeting with the President.
