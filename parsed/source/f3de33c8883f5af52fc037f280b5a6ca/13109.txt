TEXT:
Yet another legal issue that has arisen in the course of
implementing the timber provisions of the rescissions bill is
whether that legislation forces us to release sales that are the
subject of prior injunctions. Justice has been notifying relevant
courts and parties that §2001(k) may require the release of
particular sales.
In response, pilchuk Audubon Society and other environmental
plaintiffs have filed a motion to clarify and enforce previous
judgments for six sales in the Umpqua National Forest in Oregon.
(Actually, only four of the six sales were enjoined; the Forest
Service withdrew the other two sales allegedly because they would
also be enjoined for similar reasons) .
Plaintiffs ask that the court 'declare that §2001 (k) is
unconstitutional, in that it violates the separation of powers,
or, alternatively, to declare that that sales at issue need not be
resurrected and offered. They ask for expedited oral argument; to
my knowledge, briefing and hearings dates have not yet been
scheduled.
