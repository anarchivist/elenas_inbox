     Attached is a list of three potential panel participants for the Equal Pay
     Event:   (1) the woman professor who spearheaded the study at M.I.T.; (2) a
     business that is good on recruiting and hiring women and paying them
     equally; and (3) a comparable worth woman, who is a union member and works
     for the State of Minnesota. We are still looking for one other panel
     participant -- an older woman who is struggling in her retirement because
     she was not paid equally during her career. Ann Lewis thought that we cou
     ldn't have more than four persons other than the President and the First
     Lady on the panel and that if Secretary Herman were on the panel, then we
     could only have three women on the panel.   (I think Herman is going to
     lobby heavily to get on the panel) .   Ann Lewis also had this vision that
     we should have a woman starting her career, one in the middle of her
     career, and a woman in retirement. While we don't have a woman young in
     age, I think both the MIT professor and the Minnesota woman can speak to
     the issues of a woman starting her career.   The MIT study found that young
     professors felt like they were treated equally, but that as they
     progressed in their careers, they felt marginalized. The Minnesota woman
     got a pay raise early in her career, which allowed her to quit her second
     job and helped her to decide to stay on the state payroll.

     I am in the process of getting these people vetted. Let me know if you
     think they are alright.  Is there anyone else you think I should send them
     to (Karen or Ann)? Thanks, Mary       ==================== ATTACHMENT . I ==========

Potential Panel Participants for Equal Pay Event

Professor Nancy Hopkins, molecular biologist, Massachusetts Institute of Technology
Professor Hopkins was the initiator of the effort at M.I.T. to study gender discrimination in the
School of Science. At the beginning of her career at M.I.T, Professor Hopkins felt that she was
treated equally with the male faculty members. However, even after learning somewhat
fortuitously that she was 20 percent underpaid, she did not really believe that she was being
discriminated against, albeit unintentionally. However, in 1994 after seeing how other women
were treated, Professor Hopkins joined forces with the only 14 other tenured women faculty vs.
194 tenured male faculty in the School of Science to see whether their situations were unique.
These woman found that they shared common experiences, and the university agreed to set up a
committee to study how female faculty were treated in the School of Science. The committee
found that senior female faculty members were marginalized; were not given sufficient space or
resources for their research; and were not paid equally. Recently, M.I.T. published the report of
the committee and has made concerted efforts to correct these disparities. Professor Hopkins
believes that the success of this initiative stemmed, in large part, from the collaboration between
the school and the professors in trying to identify and solve the problem. Professor Hopkins
continues to try to expand this effort to the entire university.

United Technologies Corporation (UT), Hartford, Connecticut
UT is a federal contractor, which is unionized and manufactures high technology products such
as elevators, helicopters, and air conditioners. UT has won the highest award at Department of
Labor in 1998 -- the Secretary's Opportunity 2000 award. UT tries to provide excellent
opportunities for women in several areas. In hiring, UT extensively recruits women for
non-traditional fields such as engineering and provides a slating process to ensure that women
and minorities are considered for new hires. In trying to retain its workforce, UT conducts
ongoing salary reviews in each business unit to ensure that women and minorities are being paid
equally. In addition, UT offers several "family friendly" benefits such as flextime, childcare,
eldercare, and telecommuting. UT also offers an "Employee Scholar" program where it
provides tuition reimbursement and paid leave for employees to pursue degrees. Upon complete
of a degree program, UT provides a stock award. In the area of career development, UT tries to
keep qualified women and minorities in the pipeline for upper-level jobs by ensuring that women
and minorities are slated as potential successors and receive the training they need. In setting
wages, UT does a factor analysis which looks at the tasks involved, the responsibility level, and
skills needed. UT believes that these policies are a business necessity in order to attract and
retain workers and remain profitable.

Anna Marie Rodriguez Krueger, Administrative Secretary, Minnesota Department of
Revenue
Ms. Krueger is a member of AFSCME and the "comparable worth" story. She has worked in
the Minnesota Department of Revenue since 1977. In 1982, at the age of23, Ms. Krueger
joined a strike of clerical workers for three weeks in order to get a pay raise. As the result of a
new collective bargaining contract, Ms. Krueger received a pay raise over two years from $6.50
per hour to $8.94 per hour, with some ofthe raise a regular increase and the rest a pay equity
adjustment. As the result ofthis raise at an early stage of her career, Ms. Krueger was able to




                                                                       Automated Records Manage,!,ent System
                                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion
      quit her part-time job as a travel agent. Since that time, Ms. Krueger has been promoted to the
      top of the clerical rank. Ms. Krueger did not know the details of how the pay equity adjustment
      was'reached (that her female-dominated job was compared with an equivalent male-dominated
      job); she just seemed happy that she received a raise. She recalled that after she returned to
      work after the strike, the other workers treated her and the other clerical workers with more
      respect.
