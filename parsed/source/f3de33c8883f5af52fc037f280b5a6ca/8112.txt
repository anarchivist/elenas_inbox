     TEXT:
     An update on our events following today's crime meeting:

     1.  6/13 Radio address:   I think Christa let you know that this weekend's
     radio address will be school violence.   Originally, Rahm wanted to release
     a Safe and Drug-Free Schools report that is overdue to Congress.   I have
     just been told that it won't be ready until August.   The good news is that
     we floated another option by Rahm, which would be for the President to
     instruct Secretary Riley to develop guidelines on crisis management/early
     warning systems on student threats.  Rahm seemed to like this idea, and I
     will talk to Mike Cohen about this. Riley briefly remarked about such
     guidance in a statement on school crime earlier this week, but for the
     President's address we could flesh out the proposal a little more and
     perhaps accelerate the timeframe for when they should get this done.
     Thoughts?

     2.   6/16 Police Bills Signing Event:  In addition to the bill signings,
     Rahm very much wants to make an announcement on kids and guns. He really
     wants the President to be able to issue a challenge on "childproof guns"
     (smart guns). The challenge would be to industry to have a childproof gun
     marketed by the year 2000.   If this doesn't work, he would like to
     announce support for legislation on parental liability for child access to
     firearms.   I am working with the Justice Department on both pieces.  The
     parental liability piece should be easier to clear with them than the
     smart gun challenge. We could also continue to push for the Degan
     expansion which has been held up in the House.

     Please let me know if your thoughts or reactions to any of this-- in
     particular, the childproof gun challenge. Two things to keep in the back
     of your mind are that both Leahy (who pushed for the vest bill signing)
     and the police groups probably won't be too thrilled with gun
     announcements at the signing event.

     I spoke to Jose' about both items this afternoon and got his feedback.
     I'm sure he will be pondering all of it at game 3.

     Thanks,


  Leanne
