TEXT:
FYI -- On Monday, a state appeals court in Massachusetts reversed a lower
court ruling that MIT had not discriminated against a woman because of her
gender.  The case was filed in 1995 by a woman who alleged that her
post-doctoral position was terminated because she was pregnant.   The case
is now remanded back to the trial court for further proceedings. Our
panelist, Nancy Hopkins, was quoted in the article as saying this
litigation is unrelated to the issues addressed in the report about the
status of women professors in the science department.
