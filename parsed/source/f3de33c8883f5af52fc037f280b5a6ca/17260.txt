Dear Representative Stupak:

       Thank you for your letter dated September 24, 1997, expressing your profound concern
about food safety and the provisions concerning food safety in the North American Free Trade
Agreement. I share your concern about the safety of food for all Americans, and I will not
permit any trade policy to impair the health and safety of the American people.

        I have committed this Administration to ensuring that the food that Americans eat is the
safest in the world. We have put in place improved safety standards for meat, poultry, and
seafood products, and have begun the process of developing enhanced safety standards for fruit
and vegetable juic~s. Together, we have put in place important legislative proposals, including
the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1996 and the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996.

        This month, I announced an initiative to upgrade domestic food safety standards and to
ensure that fruits and vegetables coming from overseas are as safe as those produced in the
United States. I asked Congress to enact legislation that will require the Food and Drug
Administration to halt imports of fruits, vegetables, and other food products produced in
countries that do not meet U.S. food safety requirements. I also directed the Department of
Health and Human Services and the Department of Agriculture to work cooperatively with the
agricultural community to develop guidance on agricultural and manufactUring practices for
fruits and vegetables within one year. Finally, I committed to providing the necessary funds in
my Fiscal Year 1999 budget to enable the FDA to dramatically expand its international food
inspection force.

        This new initiative will help gaurantee the safety offood in the United States. It
provides the improved inspection capacity we need and increased regulatory power to combat
imports that could be contaminated. I am committed to continuing to improve the safety of food
that Americans eat, and I look forward to working with you on this vital project. Thank you
again for your letter.



                                            Sincerely,
