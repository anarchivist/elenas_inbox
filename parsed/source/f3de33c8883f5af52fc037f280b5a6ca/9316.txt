TEXT:
Elena/Maria,
I spoke this morning to James Castello reo DOJ options reo Section 377
(late amnesty).  James is scheduled to have a conversation with Rob Weiner
later this week to discuss the litigation aspects of this issue (both the
LULAC and the Zambrano cases, I would assume). After that, we can sit
down with Rob and determine what our options are.  I received another call
from Becerra's staff person (William Gill) this morning.  He suggested
that after we learn more from DOJ, he would like to schedule a meeting
with the advocates. Maria -- he particularly asked that you be present at
this follow-up meeting.  I will keep you posted.

julie
