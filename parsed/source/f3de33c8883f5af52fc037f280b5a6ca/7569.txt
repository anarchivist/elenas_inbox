FYI -- the Senate Judiciary Committee is holding a hearing on May 20 on
Senator Abraham's bill, S.1645, which makes it a federal crime for anyone
to take a minor across state lines for an abortion if it would violate the
state's parental consent law.   Pro-choice Hill staffers are VERY
nervous.  Let me know if you want me to do any work on this.
