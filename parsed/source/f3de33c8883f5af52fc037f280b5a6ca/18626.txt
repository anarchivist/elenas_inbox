Subject: Coverdell legislation

Karen-

I know there's a lot going on there, so I thought you might find it
easier to talk via e-mail ...

Sandy is concerned about developments on the Hill over the
Coverdell-Torricelli education "IRA savings account" legislation.  She
asked that I check in with you ( I know that our legislative director,
Jerry Morris, also has a call into Larry Stein) .

The questions are as follows:

1. Knowing that the President issued a veto threat on Coverdell before
the recess (and before discussions of trying to come up with a
compromise on the bill between D and R leadership heated up), does the
President still maintain his commitment to vetoing the legislation in
its initial form?

2. Now that discussions of a compromise have surfaced (even though there
appears to be no agreement at this time), if K-12 school tuition were
·

    removed from the legislation, would the President's position still be
    to veto the legislaiton?

    Obviously, the AFT would urge that, shoudl it reach his desk, the
    Presdient veto any form of this legislation -- including one that takes
    K-12 tuition out. A compromise such as this merely opens the door for
    Congress to come back at another time and expand the provision to
    include K-12. We view this as a dangerous opening to vouchers.

    Thanks for your time on this.   It's of utmost concern to Sandy.

     -Gigi
