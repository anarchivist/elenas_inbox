TEXT:
FYI, you will recall that I had been pushing a draft presidential
directive to encourage agencies to implement flexible work schedules to
allow federal employees to volunteer.  I had an OPM draft circulating, in
the hopes it would be ready in time for the summit.  However, OMB just
informed me that the Labor Dept. has raised a major policy objection to
it, saying that it is bad timing with the alternative work schedule bill
S4 we are fighting the Republicans over on the Hill, and that it would
give ammunition to those we are fighting.  I haven't had much time to
focus on the merits of this objection, figuring this was probably the
death knell for this idea, but I can pursue if you want me to.
