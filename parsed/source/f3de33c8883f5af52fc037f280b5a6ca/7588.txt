TEXT:
This bill would amend the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act to do two things:
1) would require CBO to do an analysis on any legislation that would
impose a private sector mandate of over $100 million annually; 2) would
require that any tax increase included in legislation be offset by a tax
decrease (including tobacco).  If either of these provisions were not met,
the legislation would be subject to a point of order in the House of
Representatives.

OMB is not sure they want to do a SAP because of concern that the
Administration would be taking a position on a bill that is centered
around a change in House floor rules.  However, I believe that is
shortsighted. We have taken positions on bill like this before, including
the original Unfunded Mandates Reform Act which Sally Katzen and I helped
write. Another example is the Congressional Accountability Act.
Secondly, this bill is about more than a change in House rules, it also
impacts national policy (taxes).

I recommend you discuss with Sally Katzen. Apparently EPA is interested
in doing a SAP because of the impact on Superfund taxes. The bill will be
on the House floor Wednesday.
