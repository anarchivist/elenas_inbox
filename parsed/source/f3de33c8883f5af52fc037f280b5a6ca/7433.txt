TEXT:
Could you please assist me with the following:

Sylvia Mathews called me from the road asking if I could get talking
points on tobacco, specifically how to refute the arguments that the
proposed legislation would result in increased smuggling and increased
crime.

If you have anything related to this, I'd appreciate it if you would email
me the info.

I appreciate your help.
Nelson
