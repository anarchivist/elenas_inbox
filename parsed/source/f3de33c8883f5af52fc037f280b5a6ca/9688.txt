Attached is language on national testing we have sent to Mr. Goodling, as
a result of our meeting with him yesterday. The proposal includes (1)
the Senate bill langauge (2) a new National Academy of Sciences study
intended to address GoodlingD,s concerns that more needs to be done to
ensure that students have well prepared teachers before they are tested;
and, (3) report language that addresses an additional Goodling concern,
that tests not be used to compare school districts with each other.   Our
proposal would enable us to meet our key objective of conducting pilot
tests this year.

authority over the development of voluntary national tests as described

study to identify the knowledge and skills teachers must have in order to
prepare students effectively to meet national standards, and to identify

development to ensure that teachers possess the requisite knowledge and
skills.

        (B) REPORT OF FINDINGS TO CONGRESS -- The National Academy of
Sciences shall report the results of the study to Congress by________
