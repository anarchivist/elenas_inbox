TEXT:
Sorry to belabor this, but you may hear from Chater, Apfel, and
others that we need to nail down now the day for the SSI children
announcement.   Ken really wants this discussed at the 7:30 (not
sure why Raines can't raise it).
SSA thinks next Wednesday is rotten because it is so close to
Chater's departure, but they will accept it. They would prefer
Monday or Tuesday (day of President's press conference, as you
obviously know) .
