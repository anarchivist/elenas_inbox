TEXT:
Here's the Chafee language with tobacco prevention at 20% and IDEA at 37%
(see bottom of page 2).

With state tobacco settlement funds at about'$B billion a year, this would
add $3 billion a year in federal funds to IDEA. According to figures
Tanya got from OMB, an additional $11 billion would need to be added to
reach a federal share of 40 percent.

Current spending: federal govt pays $4.3 billion or 11% of about $39
billion in cost.

With this amendment: federal govt pays $7.3 billion or 19% of about $39
billion in cost.  ==================== ATTACHMENT   1 ====================

Modified version ofChafee recoupment bill with funds for IDEA


                                                 A BILL

  To amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to pennit the Secretary of Health and Human
 Services to waive recoupment under the Medicaid program of certain funds received by a State
 from manufacturers of tobacco products if a State uses a portion of such funds for tobacco use
                             prevention and reduction programs.

  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in
                                     Congress assembled,

        Section 1. Short Title.
                This Act may be cited as the " _ _ _ Act of 1999".


        Section 2. Findings.
                Congress makes the following findings:
                         (1) Tobacco products are the foremost preventable health problem facing
        America today. More than 400,000 individuals die each year as a result of tobacco
        induced illnesses and conditions.
                         (2) Virtually all new users of tobacco products are under legal age. Every
        day, 3,000 young people become regular smokers. Of these children, 1,000 will die
        prematurely from a tobacco-related disease.
                         (3) Tobacco products are inherently dangerous and cause cancer, heart
        disease, and other serious adverse health effects.
                         (4) Medicaid is a joint Federal-State partnership program designed to
        provide health care to citizens with low-income.
                         (5) On average, the Federal Government pays 57 percent of the costs of
        the Medicaid program, and no State must pay for more than 50 percent of the cost of the
        program in that State.
                         (6) The comprehensive settlement of November 1998 between
        manufacturers of tobacco products (as defined in section 5702(d) of the Internal Revenue
        Code of 1986) and States, and the individual State settlements reached with such


                                                     -1-

       manufacturers, include claims arising out of the Medicaid program.
                      (7) It is in the interest of the public health to target a portion of the funds
       received by States as a result of such settlements towards combating the problem of
       youth smoking.

       (2)(B) with respect to amounts recovered or paid to a State as part of the
       comprehensive settlement of November 1998 between manufacturers of tobacco products
       (as defined in section S702(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) and States, or as
       part of any individual State settlement or judgement reached in litigation initiated or
       pursued by a State against one or more such manufacturers, if, with respect to a fiscal
       year, the Governor or Chief Executive Officer of the State-
              "(I) certifies that at least 20 percent of such amounts received during the fiscal
       year will be expended on activities to reduce tobacco use described in subparagraph (C);
       and
                      "(AA) includes as part of such certification a written description of how
       such amounts will be expended; and
                      "(BB) supplements and does not supplant the level of funds expended by
       the State in 1998 for similar activities in the State, as defined in subparagraph (E);
              and
              "(ii) certifies that at least 37 percent of such amounts received during the fiscal

               "(iii) smoking cessation programs (including training for health care professionals
       and providers on how to conduct such programs);

               "(v) evaluation and surveillance of the effectiveness of such programs and
       activities.
       "(D) Nothing in subparagraph (B) shall be construed as limiting the authority ofthe
       Secretary under this title to-
               "(1) require reports and conduct investigations to ensure that a State is complying
       with a certification submitted under that subparagraph and clause (iii) of that
       subparagraph; or
               '(ii) limit or deny Federal payments under this section to a State that has failed to
       so comply.

States must demonstrate a maintenance of effort. This maintenance of effort is defined as the

       programs under subparagraph (C) and

               previous fiscal year; and
       (BB) for subsequent fiscal years, the lower of -
               (I) the cumulative general inflation as measured by the consumer price
               index for the period between 1998 and the previous year; or
               (ii) the cumulative change in the Federal appropriation for the program for
