BofA Heeds S.F. Law, Offers Domestic Partner Benefits
Bank's decision covers parents, siblings as well
Ilana DeBare, Chronicle Staff Writer
         Bank of America yesterday joined the growing ranks of companies
offering
health coverage to the domestic partners of their employees -- a move that
bank officials said was spurred in part by San Francisco's new law
requiring
such coverage from companies with city contracts.
         With 80,000 U.S. employees, the San Francisco bank is the largest
financial institution to offer a significant program of domestic partner
benefits.   It is also the first major company to credit the controversial
San
Francisco law in its decision.
         --Beginning in January 1998, Bank of America will begin offering
medical, dental and vision coverage to what we are calling extended family
members -- a parent, a sister or brother, an adult child, or yes, a
domestic
partner of the same or opposite sex,"   said bank spokesman Dennis Wyss.
--We
feel the San Francisco ordinance was a factor in our decision-making, but
it
was only one factor. We have been considering this a long time."
         Gay and lesbian employees at BofA had been pressuring the company
for
years to follow firms such as IBM Corp., Apple Computer and Disney in
offering benefits to domestic partners.
         In the fall, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors passed a law
requ~r~ng anyone with a city contract to offer domestic partners the same
benefits offered to married couples.


          Gay rights advocates praised the bank's decision and credited the
mix
of internal and external pressure as an influencing force.
          --The legislation was the straw that broke the camel's back -- the
impetus for the company to do the right thing,"    said Jeff Sheehy,
president
of the Harvey Milk Lesbian/Gay/Bisexual Democratic Club.
          Elected officials said the bank's move was proof that the domestic
partner law was having its intended effect.
          --This sends a very positive message and lets other businesses know
that domestic partner benefits are workable, " said Supervisor Leslie Katz,
one of the chief backers of the law. --This is a great example of a
responsible business approach to the changing needs of our society. I think
we're going to see other large companies that want city contracts moving in
this direction."
          But the bank's decision was also greeted with harsh criticism
yesterday-- both from conservatives and from some gay rights advocates who
felt it didn't go far enough.
          --It looks like I'm going to have to do my banking somewhere
else, ' I
said the Rev. Louis Sheldon, a Bank of America customer and chairman of the
Traditional Values Coalition, a group of 8,300 churches that opposes gay
rights. --The backlash from the moderate to conservative parts of
California
could be quite significant."
          Liz Winfield, a Massachusetts business consultant who conducts
education about gays in the workplace, objected to the bank's extension of
benefits to family members and domestic partners. BofA is one of the few
major companies to offer brothers, sisters and other family members the
same
benefits as domestic partners.
          --That sort of cheapens the (domestic partner) relationship,"
Winfield said. --If I were an employee who needed benefits, I'd be grateful
that this could save me thousands of dollars a year. But I'd also feel that
it cheapened my relationship. ' ,
          Until yesterday's announcement, BofA had offered bereavement leave
and family medical leave to domestic partners of its employees, but health
benefits had been reserved for spouses and children.
          With the announcement, BofA becomes the 17th Fortune 500 company to
offer health benefits to domestic partners, Winfield said. It follows in
the
footsteps of more than two dozen big Bay Area employers such as Levi
Strauss
& Co., Kaiser Permanente, Hewlett-Packard Company, Silicon Graphics and Sun
Microsystems.
          Bank officials said their new policy would meet the needs of their
workforce.
          --This is basically an acknowledgment that the families our
employees
support include parents, siblings, domestic partners and others, " Wyss
said.

B of A to Extend Health Benefits to Unmarried Partners


   Banking: Employees may choose an adult relative instead. Firm is first
major
bank to have such coverage.
By DON LEE, Times Staff Writer
      Bank of America said Monday that it will offer health and dental
benefits to gay
and heterosexual partners of employees, becoming the first major u.s. bank
to
provide such coverage.
      The new program, which will be offered to most of the bank's
nationwide
work
force of 80,000, including 25,000 in the Southland, will allow an employee
to
enroll
one domestic partner or another dependent adult relative, such as a parent,
grandparent or sibling. The benefit will begin next January.
       BofA's step was partly prompted by San Francisco's recent ordinance
that
penalizes city contractors who do not offer domestic partner benefits.
BofA,
which
is based in San Francisco, is a major contractor with the city.
      But the bank's decision, which followed three years of internal study,
was seen as extraordinary because of the breadth of its program and the
fact
that it took shape in a button-down industry.
       "This is an indication that providing coverage to nontraditional
members
is
extending to a conservative industry," said Michael J. Powers, a benefits
consultant
at William M. Mercer Inc.
      Powers, who heads his firm's national resource group on domestic
partner
benefits, said about 400 private u.S. businesses now offer the benefits.
Academia
and the entertainment industry have led the trend, although American
Express
and
IBM are among the most recent to offer the coverage.
      Some companies have limited the extension of benefits to same-sex
partners, as
Disney did more than a year ago, in the process inflaming a number of
conservative
groups. But relatively few companies have extended the coverage to include
adult
dependents such as a grandparent or sibling.
     Powers, however, said more companies were considering the broader
coverage,
perhaps partly to defuse the controversial issues raised by the benefits.
      "I think it's a business issue for most corporations," said Susan
Gore,
owner of
the Mentor Group, a Dallas-based management and diversity consulting
company.
"It's not just doing the right thing, but it's about attracting and
retaining
the best and
the brightest."


      Dennis Wyss, a BofA spokesman in San Francisco, said Monday that the
bank
was not calling it domestic partner benefits but rather extended family
benefits.
Enrollment will start this fall, he said, and employees would need to show
they have
been in a committed relationship for at least six months with the domestic
partner
seeking the benefit. To sign up other related adults, employees must verify
that that
person is claimed as a dependent on an IRS form.
      "It's an acknowledgment that our employees are responsible in
supporting
a
number of extended family members," Wyss said. The new benefits were not
announced publicly by BofA, but revealed in an employee newsletter Monday.
      Wyss said it was unclear how many people will enroll a domestic
partner
or
dependent in the program. Companies have found that 1% to 3% of employees
sign
up for domestic partner benefits, although BofA may experience a higher
enrollment
because its program is broader. Wyss said the bank does not expect the plan
to
cost it significantly more.
    Analysts said they expect other companies, particularly those
contracting with
San Francisco, to offer the coverage. Other banks were eager Monday to
learn
what BofA had offered.
     "It's something we've been thinking about [for] over a year," said
Kathy
Shilkret,a Wells Fargo spokeswoman. "But we're not ready to announce any
program. "

     Richard Jennings, executive director at Hollywood Supports, a group
that
has pushed studios to offer the benefits, said, "We've been talking to a
lot of
banks and
financial services companies about it." He said BofA's announcement is
"recognition
that there are lots of gays and lesbians working in the financial services
industry. "
