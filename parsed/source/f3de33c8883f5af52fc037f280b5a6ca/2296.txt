TEXT:
Yes and yes. By the way, HHS wants us to OPPOSE the bill because it
doesn't protect voluneers ENOUGH.  In particular, I believe they'd like to
get rid of joint and several liability for ALL damages.  They may take an
appeal through OMB which OMB is sending my way.  If and when we get it, we
should discuss what to do.  ellen
