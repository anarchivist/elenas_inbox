Study Overstates Difficulty of Meeting Welfare Law's Work Reguirements -- Last week's Wall
St. Journal reported on a new study's findings that, as early as 1998, most state economies will
not generate enough low-skilled private sector jobs to absorb welfare recipients required to work
by the welfare law. According to the study by Regional Financial Associates, nationwide only
54% of those who must work can be absorbed in that year. Only 13 states are able to provide all
the jobs needed, led by Nevada, Utah, and Idaho; while 21 states can't provide even half of the
jobs needed -- with New York able to provide only 13% of the jobs needed. The study argues
that public workfare will have to fill this considerable gap.

However, the study paints a false picture for 1998 by failing to account for several critical
factors, the most important of which is the dramatic case load reductions that have already
occurred and that states are permitted to count toward the work requirements. The case load
drop of roughly 18% since 1995 counts toward 1998's 30% work participation rates. In addition,
the study ignores the fact that approximately one-quarter of the caseload is exempt from the work
requirements for various reasons.

Correcting roughly for these factors, in the aggregate the economy can easily meet the 1998 work
requirements. This does mask differences among states -- some states with below average
growth rates and/or case load reductions may not be able to generate enough private sector jobs
even in 1998. The harder prediction is for the year 2000 because of the difficulty of predicting
the economy's performance by then. The study did not address this question.


Elena: This summary may raise more questions than it answers. Although the study is dumb
and flawed, we haven't corrected it state by state, but just painted a rough aggregate picture, and
haven't updated it for 2000. We could do more over the next few weeks, but I wasn't sure if
you wanted this item in in the interim, just to correct any misimpression that he may have.

FYI, Phil Levine of CEA confirms our criticisms.
