TEXT:
FYI, someone I trust in the disability community (she works at DOJ) thinks
that the disability advocates will be very disappointed in the INS reg and
guidance.  The problem with saying that our legislative proposal would
solve the problem is that it exempts people disabled after entry, and that
pretty much leaves out the mentally retarded.  And they are a lot of the
most compelling ones.
