Subject: Tomorrow's Hill Mtgs

As you know, we are meeting with Conrad's staff at 1:30pm tomorrow to
brief them on the tobacco budget, and we are meeting with Harkin's,
Chafee's, and Graham'S staffs at 2:30pm to be briefed by them on the bill
they are writing.

Do you ~ave everything you need for the Conrad meeting? I'm still waiting
to hear from Josh about whether OMB will be able to help Conrad's staff
estimate how much revenue JCT will say they have to spend.

On a separate matter, Conrad's and Kennedy's staffs would like our
thoughts on or better yet our help drafting provisions on licensing and
documents.
