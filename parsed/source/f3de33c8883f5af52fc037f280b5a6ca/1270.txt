TEXT:
I have theoretically been a member of something called the Federal
Interagency Coordinating Committee for the past year or two.  It focuses
on disabled kids aged 0-3, and includes Education Dept. people as well as
parents and advocates.  I think it's mandated by law.  There are two nice
special ed programs under Judy Heumann that focus on this group, and the
FICC monitors all this.  I went to one meeting and it was nice but not
that directly related to whatever fires I was putting out, so I never went
to another.

Now the Education Dept. is calling to ask whether I'm still the person and
couldn't I please attend more meetings.  I told them I wasn't sure.
(Galston was theoretically a member before me; I don't think he ever
went. )

I wouldn't bother you except for the whole question of who's doing
disability issues and you might get a phone call on this; and because the
Education person suggested maybe the FL's office should be the
representative given the brain conference. Let me know if you want me to
do anything on this.
