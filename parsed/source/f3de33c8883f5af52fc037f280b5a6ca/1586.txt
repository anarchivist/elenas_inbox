TEXT:
The meeting was a chance for everyone to express their concerns.  Steve
noted we continue to hear about summit plans too late to affect the
planning. Don noted that the Corporation has not been as effective as it
might be. Relevant outcomes:   Sylvia may reach out to the CEO to express
concerns; we all agreed that we need to have a cadre of federal officials
at the summit itself who can be helpful as communities move forward on
their post-summit plans, and we should put our best people forward; we
should ask Lynda Robb, the new vice-chair of the summit to come in so we
can talk about this effort with her.

In terms of general progress, we probably need to sit down on all this
soon, but:   I am pushing the Corporation on HS service scholars for later
this week; no read yet on how much more of the non-federal match is in
place.  I am meeting with federal agencies tomorrow morning on a
significant increase in our adopt-a-school effort and on fashioning
federal commitments around afterschool, children's health, and
environment.   The military is still being cagey about their potential
commitment, but I am promised something later this week.   The summit is
also on board for the President to announce a few significant private
commitments later this week if we do a radio address.

By the way, you should know that the First Lady is doing a summit video
conference on Wednesday with the 140 communities coming to the summit.
Also, Gen. Powell is coming in to brief Erskine again on Monday.  The
current thinking is that the President should drop by.

Finally, we got briefed by Points of Light today on the structure of the
break-out sessions during the summit itself.  In addition to a VIP
roundtable that they hope the President will attend, the main track will
be the 140 communities.  They will clustered in groups of 10 communities
each, and each will develop plans for the future on the 5 goals.   A second
track will be state governments. The third track is the leftovers/"all
other".  Summit planners act like they expect only a handful of federal
officials at these sessions. We will be pushing for considerably more
than that.
