TEXT:
Here's a bullet for the weekly on next week's event.  I'm not sure if I've
accurately described what you're envisioning for the directive, but I gave
i t a shot. (Not literally, of course.)


Juvenile Crime -- Next Wednesday, you are scheduled to speak at a Justice
Department conference on combating juvenile crime. The purpose of the
one-day symposium is to highlight what works in reducing juvenile
violence, with panel discussions on targeting gang and gun violence, and
successful enforcement and prevention practices. The conference date
falls one day before the Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to markup
its juvenile crime legislation. At the conference, you will announce a
directive to Treasury which seeks to keep handguns out of the hands of
minors.  The directive will order Treasury to require every
federally-licensed gun dealer to post a sign on the wall warning gun
owners to lock their handguns out of the reach of minors and/or mandate
gun dealers to put a warning sticker containing similar information on
every handgun they sell.
