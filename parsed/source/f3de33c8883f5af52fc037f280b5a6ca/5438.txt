TEXT:
As I have mentioned to some of you, we will submit to the President for
his Christmas reading a book compiling memos and speech draft submissions
by outsiders (authors, academics, policy experts, artists, business
leaders). We are gathering up the names of people we will contact.

please let me know if you have any suggestions for people to contact, as
soon as you can.

Thanks!
