  quick turn-around).   I can be reached at x57763.

  Elena, we would welcome any additional descriptive materials you may have
  on what the research fund will buy with the extra $20 million under option

 11 21 st Century Community Learning Centers;

                Background. An EXOP and interagency group has been working to develop a child
                care initiative. HHS and Education requested $2.16 billion ($10.8 billion over five
                years) in mandatory funds for this initiative .

.'              OMB, DPC/OFL and NEC have developed two child care options for discretionary
                spending.

 ·              Option #1 costs $221 million in FY 1999, and $1,455 million over five years. This
                option includes the following:

                           Standards Enforcement ($100 million). This new activity would support State
                           and local systems for health and safety monitoring, report cards, and
                           assistance in attaining private accreditation for child care providers. This
                           activity would also fund State and local consumer education efforts, state and
                           local hotlines, and resource and referral programs designed to assist parents
                           in identifying and locating quality child care.

                           21 sl Century Community Learning Centers ($60 million). Additional funds to
                           add 1,500 school buildings and other sites available for after-school programs
                           for school-age children. The total program in FY 1999 would be $100 million
                           ($60 million in new funds), a 150 percent increase over FY 1998. This
                           program would grow to $200 million by FY 2001.

                           Provider Scholarship Loan Fund ($50 million).            Announced by the President at
                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion

          the White House Conference on Child Care. With State and local matching,
          the program will provide scholarships for up to 50,000 providers.

          Child Care Apprenticeship Training Program: $1 million. Ten FTE to expand
          the DOL Child Care Apprenticeship Program, which funds the training of child
          care providers working toward a degree equivalent to the Child Development
          Associate degree. This program currently exists in only one state.
          Apprenticeship program participants would be eligible for Child Care Provider
          Scholarships.

          Research Fund ($10 million). Establish a new fund to support analysis of
          child care data and research projects, including a focus on methods and
          technology that can be used to train child care providers in rural regions.

          Early Leaming Fund ($400 million). Addressed as a mandatory program.

·         Option #2 costs $700 million in FY 1999 and'$3,750 million over five years .
          This option increases funding for some of the programs listed in Option #1 and
          provides discretionary funding for an Early Leaming Fund, as described below:

           Early Leaming Fund ($400 million). To provide challenge grants to
           communities (e.g., counties or local public-private partnerships) to support
           child care providers and programs through a range of activities developed at
           the community level. Funds could be used for: (1) basic training to providers;
         . (2) creating and supporting family day care networks; (3) assisting providers in
           meeting accreditation and licensing requirements; (4) linking child care
           providers with health professionals; and (5) providing home visits, parent
           education, and consumer education about child care.

          21 st Century Community Learning Centers ($160 million). Provides additional
          funding in FY 1999 so that the program will grow from $40 million in FY 1998
          to $200 million in FY 1999. These funds will add 4,000 new sites available for
          after-school programs.

          Research Fund ($30 million). Increases the research fund beyond the
          amount provided in Option #1.

          Child Care Apprenticeship Training Program ($10 million). Additional funds to
          finance a contract for an intermediary to assist states in replicating the program
          and for assessing results.

          Standards Enforcement ($100 million) and Child Care Provider Scholarship
          Fund ($50 million). Proposes the same funding levels as in Option #1.

·   Increases to the Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG) and reforms to
    the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit (DCTC) may be addressed in discussions
    of mandatory funding for the Child Care Initiative. The DPC/OFL recommends
                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion

DCTC reform at a cost of $5.2 billion over five years and CCDBG expansion at a cost
of $4 billion over five years.
