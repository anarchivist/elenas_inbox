Christa:

Elena told me this morning that she will make sure that the collective
bargaining memo gets to the President before the FOP event.  We don't
expect a decision, but at least he will be informed. Also, I spoke to Jim
Pasco today, and he suggested I sit in on the Rahm meeting.  Could you and
Leanne check this w/Rahm? I probably won't make the 3pm.

Thanks,
Jose'
