TEXT:
As you know the Iowa AG sent us a memo arguing that the state settlements
were based on three types of claims -- Medicaid, consumer fraud, and
miscellaneous (including civil penalties, antitrust, and nuisance) --. and
argued funds should be allocated among these categories and the federal
government can only claim a share of the first category.

DOJ makes the following points:

Under a legislative resolution of claims, one could devise whatever
Medicaid/non-Medicaid allocation one chose to.

Under an administrative recoupment, there are statutory constraints:

         (1) The statute requires reimbursement of Medicaid claims first.
It would be inconsistent with DOJ's usual litigation posture and bad
precedent to allow allocation of claims as Miller proposes, if the overall
settlement amount is less than the Medicaid claims.   Here's how it usually
works: say someone on Medicaid gets injured on the job, and Medicaid pays
$50,000 for his health costs. The person settles with the employer for
$25,000.   In this case, the federal government always argues that all the
$25,000 should go to reimburse Medicaid and rebuffs arguments that a share
of funds were awarded due to, say, pain and suffering, and should
therefore remain with the individual.

         (2) However, DOJ thinks it is acceptable to discount claims for
litigation risk, e.g., the risk that one would lose in court.   In our
example, this would mean that the federal government would argue that all
$25,000 should reimburse Medicaid. However, if the lawyers thought there
was, say, a 10 percent risk of losing the case, the lawyers could settle
for $22,500 out of the $25,000.

Thus, they believe a good faith effort to apportion based on litigation
risks would be allowable, if we wanted to go there, but again this applies
only to administrative recoupment.

Perrelli says Tom Miller called Phil Bartz last week.  Phil apparently
told Tom that people were looking into this and have concerns but did say
anything specific.
