TEXT:
1.  Benefits restoration for immigrants could be a leak.

2. 100,000 Native American Teachers could be a leak (though Mary says it
may be part of the SOTU).

3.  According to Ceci Rouse, NEC is looking to do an event around the
larger literacy initiative sometime between the SOTU and the budget
release.   The ESL/Civics component (now at $70 million) should be a part
of that.
