Take the attached to a meeting and try and skim them if you have a
chance.  My gut feeling about the bottom line is this: TFA is
controversial (by definition, given the following articles), but clearly
defensible. Much of the criticism seems to come from a small cadre of
self-appointed critics from Ed Schools. There are certainly individual
anecdotes of TFA failures, but it's not as if there's a shortage of Ed
School trained teacher failure stories either ...

One other observation: How come every single article mentions AmeriCorps?
What's that all about? Duhhh.

We found the attached stories on Teach for America. There does seem to be
a fair mixture of criticism and praise. Call with questions.  Thanks
