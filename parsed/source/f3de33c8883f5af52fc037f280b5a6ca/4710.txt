 TEXT:
 Diana has a good service idea -- see below.

 A good VP event would involve him announcing the welfare to work
 competitive grant application (around Oct. 31st) at a visit to one of the
 non-profits in his Coalition to Sustain Success, i.e., Salvation Army, who
 would be eligible to apply.  But I'm not sure I'm ready to give that up as
 a POTUS announcement.

 Another idea is to have him visit a GSA child care site to underscore what
 is quality child care and combine it with a reinventing government message.

 Also, DOT had what I remembered to be a decent idea to have the VP
 dedicate a new
 light rail station in San Diego which is combined with an adult education
 center. They could make a NEXTEA event out of it.   I'll check to see if
 they're still interested.

 When Gen. Powell visited with the President about a month ago, Powell
 asked if the President would visit one of the "mini-summits" that are
 being held allover the country, modeled on the Phila. service summit.
 The President was cagey in his response, but the VP said he'd be happy to
 do one. I'm not sure if there are any perfect ones in Oct/Nov, but we
 could check.   Powell only goes to a few of them, and would undoubtedly
 want the VP to do one that he was NOT doing, to spread the wealth.

      The VP's office is in the market for October/November events.  If you can
      think of anything that the President won't do but that the VP might, let
      me know ASAP. Also, keep this request in mind throughout the coming
      weeks.
