TEXT:

The idea is that it would serve as an agenda during the Monday meeting --
it can still be changed, so let me know if you have any problems with it.

I will work on Saturday afternoon to prepare one page on each issue
outlining the best arguements for our positions.   I will fax them to you
at home Bruce, and Elena -- let me know where I should send them for you
 (I'll page you if I need to).  ==================== ATTACHMENT   1 =================

                                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion

1. Domestic Violence - HHS shall not grant reasonable cause exceptions to penalties to states
that exempt more than 20 percent of their caseload from the five year time limit due to the
granting of good cause domestic violence waivers.

2. Penalty; Diversion to Separate State Programs -To discourage states from diverting
families from T ANF to state programs in order to avoid work penalties or avoid sharing child
support collections with the federal government, add these provisions to the proposed reg:

       a) In order to enter into corrective compliance plan or receive a reduction in penalties
       ("some or all") for not correcting a failure through such a plan, a state must prove that it
       did not divert families to a separate state program for the purpose of avoiding work
       participation rates.

       b) In order for a state to be eligible to receive a reasonable cause penalty exception, to
       enter into a corrective compliance plan, or receive reduced penalties ("some or all") or
       penalties based on degree of non-compliance, a state must prove that it did not divert
       families to a separate state program for purposes of preventing the federal collection of
       child support.

       c) Include in the MOE data report infonnation on whether individuals served in the
       separate state program were on T ANF within the last six months, to help the Secretary
       determine if diversion has occurred.

3. Penalty - States that achieve at least 90 percent (rather than 75 percent) of the required work
participation rate shall be eligible for a reduced penalty based on degree of non-compliance.

4. Penalty; Compliance Plan -

       a) Reduce the amount of time that States have to complete corrective actions from 12 to 6
        months.

       b) Eliminate the option for the Secretary to reduce the penalty on a state that has failed to
       correct a violation through a corrective compliance plan if a state expended more
       resources, made substantial progress, or encountered cirurnstances that could not have
       been anticipated.
5. Caseload Reduction Factor - Remove two provisions relating to thef-lms61.~d ~umion
factor calculation:

       a) The first would provide states with a choice of applying the two parent caseload
       reduction or the overall caseload reduction as a credit to the two parent work participation
       rate.

       b) The second would give HHS the option to allow states to exclude some or all families
       in any separate State program from the caseload reduction calculation ''based on nature of
       benefits provided."

6. Child Only Cases - Upon review of State classification of child only cases, if the Secretary
determines that they are not legitimately classified, the Secretary will reclassify the cases to count
toward the participation rates and time limits~

7. Waivers-

       a) Prior law definitions of work activity (e.g., job search and vocational education) may
       not be continued under waivers;

       b) Waivers that are inconsistent can only be continued in the same geographic areas as
       they were originally approved in the waiver and were in effect on date of enactment;

       c) A state that continues a waiver inconsistent with PRWORA's time limits or work
       requirements shall not be eligible for a high performance bonus or a caseload reduction
       credit;

       d) A state that continues a waiver inconsistent with PRWORA's time limits or work
       requirements shall not be eligible to receive a reasonable cause penalty exception, to enter
       into a corrective compliance plan, or receive reduced penalties;

       e) In order to continue a waiver inconsistent with PRWORA's time limits or work
       requirements, the state must notify the Secretary in writing in a letter signed by the
       governor.

8. Administrative Costs - Include case management and eligibility determination in the
definition of administrative costs.
