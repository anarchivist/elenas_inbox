TEXT:
Gov Thompson virtually endorsed every major point of the President's
eduation agenda today in his State of the State address, point by point
giving the President credit followed by "I agree." We need to get the
text of this address. He says improving education must not be a partisan
nor racial issue.  Perhaps we are closer to the Republican governors than
some expected.
