We circulated this to HUD. They have made comments on drafts 3 and 4 and
have the final draft.  I do not believe they have any additional
comments. OMB has also seen.    I know you want one pagers, but we have
already cut this down from six to two pages.   I don't believe there is
anything else we can knock out.

      MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

      FROM:          BRUCE REED
                     GENE SPERLING

      SUBJECT:       Including Welfare-to-Work Housing Vouchers in the FY 1999 Budget

      Overview

              Over the last three months, the Domestic Policy Council (DPC) and the National Economic
      Council (NEC) have been leading an interagency process on economic development and housing.
      The purpose of this memorandum is to present to you a proposal for 50,000 new housing vouchers
      to help welfare recipients who need to move in order to find employment and to help address the
      shortage of affordable housing.

             In addition to the new welfare-to-work housing vouchers, we are also recommending that
      the FY99 budget include proposals to promote housing portability and choice and to increase
      home ownership by reducing barriers to buying a new home. We believe these new initiatives,
      along with a strengthened Fair Lending Law and a possible increase in the Low-Income Housing
      Tax Credit (LlHTC) would build on your record of providing public housing tenants with the
      opportunity to move to neighborhoods with more jobs, better schools, and less crime.

      The Need For Affordable Housing

              The need for affordable housing exceeds supply, particularly for poor families with
      children:
              ·      In 1995, 5.2 million families spent more than half their income on rent and/or were.
                     living in severely substandard housing (unreleased data from forthcoming HUD
                     report). More than 2 million of these households were families With children.

             ·       The demand for affordable housing exceeded supply by 1.7 million units in 1993 for
                     the lowest income households. However, the number of vouchers has remained
                     nearly stagnant.

      Promoting Welfare Reform and Housing Mobility

              The lack of affordable housing can impede families' efforts to move from welfare to work.
      Many welfare recipients, even with a job and the Eamed Income Tax Credit, find it difficult to
      afford housing near their job, child care, or transportation line. Others find it difficult to begin the
      journey to self-sufficiency if they are homeless, living in crowded conditions, or surrounded by
      crime and drugs. While your welfare to work transportation proposal, if enacted, will help
                                                                           HeX-Dump Conversion

welfare recipients travel to their jobs, only housing vouchers provide individuals the freedom to
take the immediate step of moving in order to leave welfare for work. This proposal will provide
another targeted tool for states and localities to use to help individuals achieve self-sufficiency.

Administration Track Record

        Past Administration efforts to increase the number of vouchers have not been successful.
Your FY 1998 budget request included 50,000 additional vouchers targeted to individuals making
the transition from welfare to work, but the proposal lacked detail and the welfare-to-work aspect
was not emphasized by the White House or by agencies and offices other than HUD. Congress
provided only $54 million for 6,500 new targeted vouchers. However, where the Administration
has made housing a priority, we have been more successful. For example, in 1993 Congress
acceded to your challenge to make the LIHTC and the Mortgage Revenue Bond (MRB) programs
permanent. And this year, Congress agreed to provide sufficient funding to renew all of the
Section 8 project and tenant-based assistance contracts expiring over the next five years.

Recommendation

        With FY 1999 budget guidance levels, OMB has provided HUD with 50,000 new housing
                         .              .
vouchers. OMB has suggested targeting 32,000 of these new vouchers to homeless households
with a severely disabled member and 18,000 for a variety of special purposes such as the witness
protection and family unification programs.

         We recommend that you include in your FY99 budget an additional 50,000 housing
vouchers tied to welfare to work. While this is likely to be an uphill battle, we believe the
initiative would strengthen our housing policy and support our welfare reform goals. DPC, NEC,
OMB, and HUD believe that a strong, clearly articulated link to welfare reform may increase
support for the initiative. We recommend that the welfare-to-work vouchers be on the mandatory
side of the budget, similar to the TANF welfare block grant and the $3 billion Welfare to Work
program, but unlike other section 8 vouchers. The cost is expected to be about $1.3 billion over 5
years. The most critical step to securing the additional vouchers is a firm Administration
commitment, which would entail a concerted effort to recruit Congressional champions.

         DPC and NEC staff recommend making the additional vouchers available on a competitive
basis to public housing agencies that submit a plan to use the new vouchers to support families
transitioning from welfare to work. This plan would be developed jointly with the local welfare
agency and/or the Welfare-to-Work program grantee (generally the local private industry council),
allowing state and/or local participation in the effort. The vouchers would be used to further the
goals of welfare reform (e.g. to help welfare recipients go to work or retain jobs, or allow them to
move to areas where jobs can be found). Local agencies would have great flexibility to design
and operate the welfare-to-work voucher program within broad national guidelines. For example,
the agencies would propose whether to focus on particular categories of welfare recipients
(long-term recipients, victims of domestic violence, those living in public housing, or those who
have retained employment for a certain period of time) and whether to provide short-term,
transitional housing assistance, or longer-term support. Local plans would be reviewed and
ranked by HUD in consultation with HHS and DOL.
