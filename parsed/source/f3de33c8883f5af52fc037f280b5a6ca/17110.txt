TEXT:
It went very well.  It turns out that BLS has been working on this for the
past year.  The hard part is coming up with 2 or 3 questions that really
measure disability -- a more complex concept to measure than race or sex.
Adding more than a few questions to the monthly "CPS" (the monthly survey
that produces the unemployment rate) is considered untenable because
people won't want to answer the survey if it gets too long.  BLS is now
field testing 2 questions on disability, but they won't have results for a
year.  If the results are good, they would be added to the monthly CPS in
about a year and a half.  If it goes poorly, they will have to try again.
The appointees were remarkably reasonable in the face of this timetable,
and we agreed roughly on an approach to r~flecting this in the draft
executive order. And the person from CEA who came was very reasonable.
