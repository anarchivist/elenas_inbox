TEXT:
Now that I have re-emerged from both the budget and a vacation, I think I
am ready to spend some serious time on the budget group of the tobacco
settlement.  I realize, however, that I don't know some of the basic
processes. Is each of the 4 working groups producing a report? Are these
reports being drafted over here or at HHS? OMB and Treasury also seem to
have their own teams working on this -- are Raines, Shalala and Rubin each
coming up with their own recommendations?   I don't want to be duplicating
a process already in motion, but I also don't want us to be caught
flatfooted.

I also apologize if all of this has been explained to Chris -- he and I
have not connected on this and he is on vacation.

Thanks, Jeanne
