TEXT:
Just wanted to give you all a heads up --

HHS has been working with the Hill on the medical records privacy
legislation throughout the weekend.

HHS is planning to send us a summary draft of the remaining outstanding
issues tomorrow morning, and a draft of a letter from the Secretary
responding to the legislation late tomorrow afternoon. We think that our
position on the legislation will be generally positive, but right now it's
a really close call.

We are hoping to give this letter an expedited review, with the goal of
getting comments back to HHS by tonight, and are going to try to meet
quickly this evening to go over the letter if necessary.

Thanks -- please call with questions.
