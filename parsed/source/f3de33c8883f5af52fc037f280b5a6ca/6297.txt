Here's where we are after talking to Counsel's office and Correspondence
office:
Letter to 3,000 partners
Counsel's office is fine with sending these letters. Both they and
Correspondence recommend a letter be developed that goes to "Dear Welfare
to Work Partner", gets an autosignature, and is then sent to the
Partnership for reproduction onto White House stationary. The Partnership
will pay for the stationary. We will send a cover letter authorizing them
to reproduce and mail the letters.  Correspondence is currently editing
the draft letter submitted by the Partnership. Kate Carr prefers that the
letters be individually addressed to each company, but Correspondence and
Counsel are extremely reluctant to hand this over to an outside
organization to do a mail merge and give up quality control on something
signed by the President.

Letter to Board Members
Our Weekly suggested that the President send a personal letter to the five
founding members and one or two other companies.  The Partnership now
wants to send such a letter to all 21 Board members, plus Xerox (who made
a major contribution but chooses not to sit on the Board). Dan Burkhardt
says it's highly unlikely that the President will personally sign 22
letters, and he may hot sign any of them personally since his note on the
Weekly didn't specifically say he would (although the fact that Eli has
asked may help).  Kate realizes it was a big leap from 6 to 22.   I've
asked her to prioritize the companies for personal signature. The
Partnership is sending over a draft letter that Correspondence will
edit.   We believe these letters will go on the President's azure
stationary.

TEXT:
Humphrey's staff called to express concern about stories running in the MN
press with roughly the following lead:   "Rebuffing Minnesota's attorney
general ... the Clinton administration urged Congress to enact a settlement
without seeing all of the cigarette industry's internal documents." The
stories quote Ogden stating Congress shouldn't wait for the documents to
enact comprehensive legislation and that every day we delay 3,000 kids
start smoking.

Humphrey understands that we have never held the position that all of the
documents must be released before Congress acts. But he would appreciate
it if we would tell the press that we applaud his efforts to make
documents public and that the release of documents has helped pressure
Congress into enacting tougher legislation.
