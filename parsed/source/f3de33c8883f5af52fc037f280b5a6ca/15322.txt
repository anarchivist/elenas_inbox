TEXT:
On student loans and service, here's the story.   There are 4 types of
breaks on student loans you can offer people who serve.

1. Income contingency -- We did this in 1993. It says that if you can
take a low-paying service job, your loan payments will be only a limited
percentage of your income, and ultimately forgiven after 25 years.

2. Loan deferment -- This predates us.   It is used when (1) someone wants
to take time off during school but doesn't want to have to start paying
back loans during that time; or (2) someone finishes school, but argues
they have a good reason they don't want to start paying back their
loans.   You can get a deferment for up to 3 years. You are eligible if
you are unemployed, or if it would create an "economic hardship," which
includes service. There is no separate service deferment. There used to
be, but the system got so complex that it was simplified in 1992.

3. Subsidize all loan deferments for service-- This is our new idea.
This means that no interest accumulates on loans during the period of
service. We already do this for subsidized loans, which are about 2/3 of
the volume, so this would fix unsubsidized loans and make it universal.

The $7 million cost over five years would allow 12,000 borrowers with
unsubsidized loans to get this benefit during their deferment. The
average benefit would be $600. This estimate assume that no one is
induced to serve. If the program cost doubled to $14 million because the
subsidized deferment would be more attractive, the number of beneficiaries
would increase to 24,000, each receiving $600.

In answer to your question as to whether we could do this for more than
one year of service: This cost estimate already assumes that this could
be for up to 3 years. The estimate simply reflects historical data on
people who request a deferment due to economic hardship for
"service-related" reasons, so it is a mix of people requesting 1, 2, and 3
years of deferments.  I don't think we would want to go past the 3 year
point.

4. Tax Incentives for Student Loan Forgiveness - This is our existing
legislative proposal.  It says loan forgiveness for service reasons by
non-profit charitable or educational institutions should not be taxable.


Loan forgiveness by public institutions is already not taxable if it is
for service reasons.
