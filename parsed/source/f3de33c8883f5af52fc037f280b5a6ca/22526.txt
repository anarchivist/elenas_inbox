TEXT:
As a follow up to yesterday's meeting, I'm re-vamping our priority
charts.   I want to make sure that I have the·correct information, so could
you let me know if the following are part of the Crime Bill:

- Children Exposed to Violence Initiative
- Drug Free Prisions Initiative

Also, you mentioned grouping the Lands Legacy and the Better Bonds.   Would
the Livability Initiatives fit into this grouping as well?

Thanks.
