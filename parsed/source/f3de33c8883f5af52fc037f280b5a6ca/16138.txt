Subject:         Tribal Affairs

Erskine, given the news articles today regarding the Cherokee nation
controversy, the Coeur d'Alenes tribe Internet gambling and the July 10
meeting you have agreed to with members of Congress, Lynn Cutler and I
think it would be helpful if we could meet with you for 30 minutes to give
you a status report. (The President has made clear thru our Weekly Reports
his concern about Tribal Affairs in general and the Cherokee nation
specifically.)  We would further suggest that you invite Leg Affairs,
Cabinet Affairs (since Justice and BIA are involved), OPP (Appointments)
and the General Counsel's Office (Lynn has been getting help from Bill
Marshall) .
The purpose of the meeting would be to prepare for July 10 but moreover,
to ensure we are responding approriately to the current controversies. A
meeting Tuesday would be ideal.
