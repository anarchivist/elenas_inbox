TEXT:
I agree that no meetings should happen wlo WH folks and think we should
reiterate that to the agencies at our meetings.  Barnett did say CDC said
it wouldn't meet w/o WH ok so maybe it is getting around but we should
reinforce. Anyway, Bruce sent me a note saying do this as long as someone
from the WH went along.  I've passed that along to Cynthia and Ohara.
