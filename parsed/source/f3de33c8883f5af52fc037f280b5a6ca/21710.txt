TEXT:
I've quickly read through the settlement (except the exhibits).      No
surprises, but a few interesting details:

The allowable one brand name sponsorship per year includes a single
national or multi-state series or tour (e.g. any number of NASCAR races
held in different states as part ofa national tour).    Events in
adult-only facilities and using corporate names are unlimited.
Sponsorships of concerts, events with an intended youth audience or youth
contestants, or team sports are prohibited except B&W may sponsor either
the C country music festival or the Kool jazz festival.   Companies don't
have to break contracts in effect as of 8/1/98 until they expire or for
three years whichever comes first.   No brand names on stadiums, arenas,
or sports teams.

Outdoor and transit ads are banned, but are defined to exclude: any ads in
adult facilities or tobacco manufacturing plants, signs smaller than 14 sq
feet in retail establishments, ads promoting an adult only event at the
site of that event.

Cartoons are banned and are defined as:

(1)    "Cartoon" means any drawing or other depiction of an
                  object, person, animal, creature or any similar caricature
that
                  satisfies any of the following criteria:
                       (1) the use of comically exaggerated features;
                       (2) the attribution of human characteristics to
animals,
                  plants or other objects, or the similar use of
anthropomorphic
                  technique; or
                       (3) the attribution of unnatural or extrahuman
abilities,
                  such as imperviousness to pain or injury, X-ray vision,
                  tunneling at very high speeds or transformation.
                       The term "Cartoon" includes "Joe Camel," but does not
                  include any drawing or other depiction that on July 1, 1998,
                  was in use in any State in any Participating Manufacturer's
                  corporate logo or in any Participating Manufacturer's
                  Tobacco Product packaging.

I assume the later phrase is to protect the Camel packaging?

             Documents: Manufacturers have to maintain at their own expense until 2010
             document web sites for existing and new documents except those for which
             the industry is asserting privilege, trade secrets, etc. Unfortunately,
             the type of docs are listed in the exhibits, so its hard to tell how
             complete this is.

             Public education: the $1.45 billion for public education is $250 million
             in year 1 and $300 mi/yr in years 2-5.

             National foundation: There are detailed goals for the national foundation
             (funded at $250 million total over 10 years), including "developing and
             disseminating model advertising and education programs to counter the use
             by youth of substances that are unlawful for use or puchase by youth with
             an emphasis on reducing youth smoking." What does this mean for our
             Thursday VP announcement?   The foundation shall have a board with 11
             directors (

             Effects of federal legislation:  If federal tobacco related legislation is
             enacted before 11/30/2002, then each original participating manufacturer
             shall receive a dollar for dollar offset for all amounts paid by such
             manufacturer pursuant to such legislation and actually made available to
             such setting state.  Such an offset would only apply to federal funds to
             states that are (1) unrestricted or (2) restricted "to any form of health
             care or to any use related to tobacco (including, but not limited to,
             tobacco education, cessation, control, or enforcement.)"
