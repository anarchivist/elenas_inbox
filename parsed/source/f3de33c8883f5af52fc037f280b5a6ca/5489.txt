TEXT:
OMB floated to Greenstein that nice option OMB developed on giving states
the option to offer legal immigrants food stamps, with a 50% federal
match. Greenstein dislikes it. He argues it's a bad precedent to make it
optional and have the federal share be less than 100%. They say hunger
groups will boo it down.  So Chow is talking to Lew about whether they
should return to earlier options of covering just families with children
and maybe refugees.  It's too bad because it was a neat option with
possible political appeal, and it would cover 2/3 of the population by
leveraging state money ($1.2b federal, $1.2b state).   Maybe groups could
be persuaded .... but if not I don't think we want to offer something they
will denounce.

Fallback options are:  Covering all families with children at $1.9
billion; covering all families with children under 7 costs $0.7 billion;
covering only the kids but not parents in all families at $0.6 billion.
