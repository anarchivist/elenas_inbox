meeting. Because of the media's preoccupation with entitlement reform,just the fact that the
process is starting is likely to generate a good deal of attention. To help illustrate your
commitment to addressing long-term financing challenges facing the Medicare program, you are
scheduled to meet with the Commission to thank them for their willingness to serve the day
before the first meeting (Thursday). During that meeting, you may want to also discuss how this
effort builds on your commitment recent commitment to develop consensus on needed Social
Security reforms. You may also want to ask the Commission to work together in the same
bipartisan fashion that produced the unprecedented Medicare reforms in the balanced budget
agreement. To date, Senator Breaux and Congressman Thomas are still working out a
somewhat uneasy leadership collaboration for the Commission. They have solicited suggestions
from all Commission members as to how best to structure the process and set the agenda. Their
first meeting will likely be devoted to approving the structure and laws that govern the process as
well as setting the desired goals and outcomes. As a result, little news, other than the fact that
commission is meeting, is likely (or desired) to come out at the beginning of the process.


Patients' Bill of Rights Legislation. Next week, the Democratic Leadership is expected to
unveil its version of the patients' bill of rights. The legislation will go beyond the consumer bill
of rights recommended by your Quality Commission and is likely to include several provisions
that are extremely controversial, particularly with the business community. These include an
enforcement provision that allows remedies through state courts as well as new benefits
requirements which would direct all health plans to cover all clinical trials, all services associated
with mastectomies, and breast reconstructive surgery. The business community will no doubt
argue that these provisioris will lead to uncontrollable litigation, higher premiums, and more
uninsured Americans. These claims are overblown and there will be studies to counter these
charges, it is highly likely that the well-financed business efforts will have an impact on the
perception of this view in Congress. Because this version of the bill of rights stands little to no
chance of passing this Congress, our challenge is to indicate support for the legislation without
offering a complete endorsement. We will be meeting with the Democratic Leadership to
construct a communications and legislative strategy before the bill is unveiled. In addition,
Senator D' Amato is expected to introduce legislation as an amendment on the Senate floor that
will require health plans to cover a number of new benefits, including requiring medically
necessary services following a mastectomy, breast reconstructive surgery, and requiring patients
to be able to get a second opinion on cancer. Although elite validators and the business
community despise these benefits, we expect they will likely pass the Senate.

                                                                  H\l;\~I!~ eoo\'~on

     Conversation with Bill Thomas. Next week, Larry Stein and Chris Jennings are scheduled to
     meet with Congressman Thomas on a range of health issues, including the Medicare
     Commission, the patients' bill of rights, and other health reform initiatives. In a conversation
     this week with Chris, Mr. Thomas indicated his desire to set up a meeting (along with Dennis
     Hastert, who has been asked by the Speaker to coordinate the Republican House consumer
     protections'strategy). Notably, Mr. Thomas said that the current Republican "go slow" strategy
     on the patients' bill of rights is not serving the interests of either the House Republicans or the
     Administration. He believes that the House Republicans need to move quickly to develop an
     alternative to the Dingell/Kennedy and Norwood legislation. Although his vision of consumer
     protections may be problematic, we view this as positive news. However, bipartisan efforts in
     this regard will be made more difficult by the fact that some House Democrats, particular Mr.
     Gephardt, continue to be more interested in using this as a political issue rather than passing
     legislation.

     Mr. Thomas also indicated his desire to work closely with the Administration on the Medicare
     Commission. In particular, he will work with us to assure that various communications about the
     Commission do not catch the other side off guard. He also indicated that he would work with
     Republicans to encourage good behavior in the upcoming White House meeting, but wanted a
     commitment that we were not planning any surprise announcements. Finally, Mr. Thomas
     indicated his desire to open discussions on a range of major health reforms in the upcoming
     months. He is particularly interested in: (1) considering capping the tax deductions for health
     care plans and using the savings to help provide coverage to low-income workers; (2) designing
     significant insurance reforms including community rating; and (3) mandating that individuals
     buy health insurance. He recognizes that these aggressive options will not be well received,
     particularly coming from a high ranking Republican. However, he wanted us to be aware of his
     interest in this area and says he is seriously willing to push this agenda (and all of the ensuing
     controversy) if we are willing to engage on this front as well. It is clearly premature to take any
     action on this front, but the fact that Mr. Thomas is moving in this direction is well worth noting.

     State Medicaid Update. Following the NGA conference, the New Hampshire and Missouri
     Governors have indicated a strong interest in pushing a quick and positive resolution to their
     proposed Medicaid waivers. Both have requested waivers as part of their application under the
     new CHIP program, and both have proposed provider taxes as financing mechanisms that are
     holding up their final approval. Earlier this week, Governor Carnahan and his staff met with
     representatives from DPC, OMB, HHS, and Intergovernmental Affairs. The Governor
     expressed his frustration with HHS' s lack of clarity about the problems with his proposal. He
     did, however, seem quite satisfied with the conclusion of the meeting which resulted in an
     agreement to have more formal and expedited discussions about the provider tax issue.
     Governor Shaheen and her staff have also been working on a children's health proposal that
     includes a creative financing mechanism to raise the Federal/state match through funds from a
     non-profit insurer (Blue CrosslBlue Shield). Although HHS's counsels office initially has
     indicated that this financing structure is unworkable, Nancy-Ann DeParle has indicated her desire
     to work with the state to see if there is any way to make this kind of an arrangement work. The
     Governor's office was quite pleased to see the commitment of the White House and the
     Department to do everything possible to be responsive.
