TEXT:
1.    Issue: the prestigious National Academy of Science will likely
release a first phase of its report on the single food agency in August.
It is likely to list problems with the current food safety system.

2.   Problem: We should try to be in a position so we don't have to just
take the punch in August, but to agree with the findings and be on the
side of reform when the report comes out.  However, the cabinet
secretaries have told the VP/Morely they would disagree strongly with a
single food agency (unless it is in their department.)

3.   What we've done so far:   We've started a process with NPR, and
joined by USDA, FDA, EPA, Commerce, OSTP and OMB to complete the
following:  list the areas we are likely to be criticized in, find what
steps we have taken or could take to better coordinate federal policy,
list the areas where we have on-going efforts at coordination, and
complete a policy planning strategy statement that was promised in the May
report of last year.  The goalis to have at least a "virtual" food safety
agency plan in place for each important area -- research, surveillance,
emergency outbreaks, education, and by products where there is joint
jurisdiction (eggs). The idea would be to have joint/coordinated plans
made in every important area.  We already do this for some probelms
(budget for example).  I also thought we might formally designate a group
to consider the NAS findings and reommendations and discuss how they could
be implemented.
It is the best plan we could come up with. Thoughts?
