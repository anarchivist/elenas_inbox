Subject:         livability/Daschle

Eric Washburn with Senator Daschle's office called me to say that the
Senator would like to make the livability tax proposal a leadership
priority and to work with us closely.  I discussed this with David Beier,
and he agreed that we cannot say no to this.  We do need, however, to work
with Eric to ensure that we are moving forward as constructively as
possible.  I asked Eric to call you directly with questions.  Please keep
me posted on your conversation. Thanks
