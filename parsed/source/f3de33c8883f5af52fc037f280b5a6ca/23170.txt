TEXT:
It looks like the House and Senate will appoint conferees this week on
Ed-Flex.  Numbers of conferees are not yet set.  It is highly unlikely
that the conference will get underway before the two week Easter break
that begins next· Friday.

When the House takes up appointment of its own conferees, it will be in
order for the Democrats to offer a motion to instruct House conferees.
That could happen as early as this Wed.   Such a motion could serve as a
test vote on class size.  I think
we probably all agree that the best "message" for that instruction would
be that the conferees get rid of the Lott amendment on this year's class
size funding, rather than insisting on class size expansion.  Gephardt and
Clay will be looking for our advice as to that message.

If the conference is still open 20 calendar days after appointment of
conferees, additional motions to instruct would be in order as privileged
motions (with a one day notice before any such motion must be considered
by the House) .
