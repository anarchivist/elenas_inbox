 Bruce: With your approval, I have changed the order of your inserts; I
 think it's a little smoother this way, esp. with the settlement piece at
 the end.   I will change it back at one, at your request.

 You will notice that I have made adjustments to allow for the VP's
 participation. Let me know if you still think this is the most
 appropriate place to do it.  It seems to work fine this way.

 Thanks.==================== ATTACHMENT       1 ====================

Draft 8/8/97 4:00pm

                          PRESIDENT WILLIAM J_ CLINTON
                           AND VICE PRESIDENT AL GORE
                                EXECUTIVE ORDER
                      BANNING TOBACCO IN FEDERAL BUILDINGS
                                  August 11, 1997

        Good morning. Vice President Gore has joined me today to talk to you about what we
are doing to reduce smoking, especially by young people, and to protect Americans from the
dangers of deadly second-hand tobacco smoke.

        Cigarette smoking is the most significant public health problem facing our people today.
Every year, more Americans die from smoking-related diseases than from AIDS, car accidents,
murders, suicides and fires combined. And the human cost doesn't begin to calculate the
economic burden tobacco-related diseases puts on our health care system, and on businesses
across America.

                  Last year, my administration took bold action to shield our children from
tobacco. We told tobacco companies: market and sell your products to adults if you wish, but
draw the line at children. And we launched a comprehensive plan that prohibits retailers from
selling tobacco to minors, and requires clerks to check LD.s before selling cigarettes to young
people. These regulations are critical to our goal of keeping tobacco out of our children's lives
-- but they must be enforced. I requested $34 million dollars for enforcement in my 1998 budget,
but Congress cut that funding before they left for vacation. I urge the Congress to restore the
full $34 million when they return in September -- our children's health depends on it.

        This week, I signed historic legislation that balances the budget in way that protects our
values and invests in our people. Our balanced budget includes a 15-cents-a-pack cigarette tax
that will help states provide health care for up to 15 million uninsured children, and help prevent
many young people from taking up smoking in the first place.

        But we must do more to protect all Americans from the dangers of smoking. One of the
most important things we can do, is to protect those who don't use tobacco from the insidious
threat of second-hand smoke. [I'd like to ask'the Vice President to etc.]

       [VP] Studies overwhelmingly show that environmental tobacco smoke is more than just
unpleasant -- it is lethal. In fact, thousands of American non-smokers die every year from lung
cancer caused by environmental tobacco smoke, and hundreds of thousands more develop
tobacco-related diseases. Second-hand smoke is so dangerous that the EPA lists it in the same
category of carcinogen as asbestos, radon, and benzene.

       Our children are especially vulnerable to environmental tobacco smoke. Every year,
hundreds of thousands of our youngest children get pneumonia or bronchitis from breathing
                                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion

second-hand smoke. And children who are exposed to second-hand smoke are at an increased
risk to develop serious asthma.

       All over the country, communities are responding to the dangers of environmental smoke
by banning cigarette smoking in public places. And employers are beginning to realize that
workers who smoke not only do harm to themselves, they harm other workers, and they harm
businesses with additional health care costs, absenteeism, and lower productivity. [transition to
POTUS]

        [POTUS] The federal government is doing its part to make our workplaces smoke-free.
One ofthe first things I did when I took office in 1993 was to ban smoking in the White House.
Since then, many of our federal agencies have taken action to prohibit or severely restrict
smoking.

        Today, I am signing an Executive Order that takes the next step, and bans smoking in all
Federal facilities under the control of my administration. One year from today, every federal
agency and office building, every visitor center at every national park, every facility owned or
leased by the executive branch, must be smoke-free. This order does allow agencies to
designate smoking areas for their employees who smoke, as long as these areas are ventilated to
the outside, and non-smoking employees do not have to enter them. But make no mistake: our
federal workers and the thousands of people who visit federal facilities will be protected from the
dangers of second-hand smoke.

        This Fall, I hope we will begin an important national debate on additional measures we
can enact to reduce smoking, especially by children. I applaud the state attorneys general and
public health advocates for providing us an extraordinary opportunity to engage in this debate,
and build on the progress we have already made. I am particularly pleased that their plan
includes a proposal-- based on a bill by Representative Henry Waxman -- to protect all
Americans from second hand smoke, and I look forward to working together in the months ahead
to meet this challenge.

       Environmental tobacco smoke is a public health hazard that we £!!! prevent.
Americans who have made the choice not to use tobacco products should not be put at risk
by those who choose to smoke. And with the step we are taking today, millions of
Americans will be able to breathe a little easier.

       Thanks for listening.
