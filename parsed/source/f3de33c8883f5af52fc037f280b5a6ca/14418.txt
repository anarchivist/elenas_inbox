TEXT:
Rich Tarplin spoke to Ron Haskins, Moinihan, and Rangel about the NY state
plan. They are all fine with the HHS Regional Administrator calling her
contact at the NY Dept of Social Services to say the following:

HHS is unable to certify your plan complete because you say you need
legislation to implement the 5 year time limit.  You can cure this by
telling us that you understand that you can only use federal funds for 5
years (the Regional Adminstrator will explain that Ca has just done this
and their plan was certified complete). If NY can tell HHS this by feb 1,
NY will get TANF funds retroactive to the date of plan submission.

This call is scheduled for 1:30 pm. The same call will be made to NJ. Rich
spoke to Ron about NJ but felt that the NJ delagation would not be a
problem.

Let me know if you have any problems/questions.
