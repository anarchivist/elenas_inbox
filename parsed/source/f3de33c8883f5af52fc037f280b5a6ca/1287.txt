TEXT:
For what it's worth, we policy noodles think some Presidential jawboning
would be a good idea, to encourage states to use TANF surpluses wisely by
investing in welfare to work.  Praising states (like NC?) that do so is a
positive way to get the message out without appearing to dictate to the
states.
