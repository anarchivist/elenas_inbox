PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
REMARKS ON TOBACCO
THE WHITE HOUSE
April 20, 1998

         Good morning.  Today, Congress returns to work, and to its obligation to
act on the most critical public health threat facign our children. Over
the next five weeks, we have the opportunity of a generation to pass
bipartisan, comprehensive legislation to protect our children from
tobacco.   Congress must not let this opportunity slip away.

         The facts are as plain as the stakes are high.  3000 children
begin to smoke every day; 1000 of them will die early as a result.    And
 these children have been the target of a massive, multimillion dollar
marketing campaign that preys on their insecuriites and dreams.   For
 decades, the tobacco industry has sold cigarettes to children, and for
 decades, the tobacco industry has lied about it.  Now, the tobacco
 industry once again seeks to put its bottom line above the health of our
·children.

        In todayD,s newspaper, the lead lobbyist for the tobacco industry
says, and I quote, D+we are fighting for our life.D,   Let me be clear:
We are fighting for the lives of thousands of teens who start smoking. We
are fighting for public health. And we are fighting against predatory
practices by tobacco companies that have targeted AmericaD,s children.



        Over the next five weeks, Congress must move forward to passage of
comprehensive, bipartisan legislation to protect our children from tobacco
marketing, reduces teen smoking, raises the price of cigarettes if
necessary to achieve that end, protects tobacco farmers, and promotes the
public health.   The legislation authored by Senator John McCain, which
was voted out of committee on a nearly unanimous bipartisan vote only [3]
weeks ago, is a strong step in the right direction.

        We have a rare opportunity to put aside politics, turn aside the
pleas of special interests, and act now to protect the health of
generations of children.  I calIon Congress to do so -- and I look
forward to working with them.
