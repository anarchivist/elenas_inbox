TEXT:
Because Rahm is all hot to trot on this managed care memo, I worked to
complete it prior to your morning meeting.  I am dropping it off at your
desk, but am also attaching it via this E:MAIL.

Because of the time sensitivity, I am making an executive decision to go
ahead and circulate the memo around. It certainly would be better with
your input and I am sure I am going to hate myself for doing it, but I
feared the demand for the memo (and the fact it isn't a POTUS
communication) outweighed our normal process.  I would just view it as a
decent cheat sheet for this issue.  It is too long, but it is a document
we can work off of should we need to get a POTUS memo in.

Following up on our conversation, I talked with Carole Parmelee.   I
advised her that it would probably be necessary to schedule an Erskine
meeting between 10:30 and 12:00 to accomodate Rahm's desire for closure on
this issue, as well as to assure we don't completely bypass Donna.   HHS
staff has been advised to be on the look-out for a meeting.  By the way,
Carole thought it was likely we could fit in a meeting in that timeframe.

I am out of here.

X-      DCl

Later today, we are attempting to schedule a meeting with Secretary Shalala and
 her staff at
HHS to go over a range of options for the President to consider t
o respond to those Health
Xu-Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) that chose to selectively terminate some of
 their plans
from participation in the Medicare program.  Because of the growin


g news coverage of this
issue, Rahm and Bruce believe it is advisable for us to
 move quickly to determine our
strategy and public positioning on this issue.
They asked if I would provide you this memo
in preparation for such a meeting.



X-[]Background


X-DAs of late last night, HHS had not completed its analysis of the impact of t
he roughly 25
(mostly large) HMOs that chose to selectively terminate some of t
heir plans from
participation in the Medicare program. On a preliminary basis,
 however, it appears that the
decisions by these HMOs will affect between 325,0
00 to 400,000 beneficiaries in about 375
counties. Because the Medicare progra
m has about 6.5 million of its over 38 million
beneficiaries in HMOs, about 5 p
ercent of Medicare HMO enrollees and about 1 percent of
the entire Medicare pop
ulation seem likely to be impacted in any way at all.   Having said
this, becaus
e most of the beneficiaries affected will have another Medicare HMO option in
t
heir county, there appears to be a much smaller number of beneficiaries (betwee
n 30,000 and
80,000 about 1 percent of the Medicare HMO population) who will n
o longer have the
option of enrolling in an HMO.   (They will, however, always h
ave access to their traditional
feeforservice plan, as well as to at least some
 supplementary "Medigap" coverage.)

.. (0*0*0* "0
         I




The Congress, so far on a bipartisan basis, has been critical of the decision b
y some within
the HMO industry to selectively withdraw from Medicare. On Frida
y, the Republican
Leadership left the Commerce Committee in the hands of the De
mocrats and some of their
party's most vociferous critics of HMOs (such as Mr.
Ganske) to excoriate the industry's
representative.   Mr. Thomas, the Chair of t
he Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health, has
also indicated at least his initi
al support of our decision not to allow plans to charge more
and/or reduce bene
fits.  Having said this, members of states that will be disproportionately
affe
cted can be counted on to pressure us to take more actions.   Senator Dodd has a
lready
weighed in, and we can be sure others will follow.

The American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) support last week's decision


 by the
Administration to reject the industry's request for changes in their co
verage and cost sharing.
They have indicated that they want to work with us to
 make sure that beneficiaries know all
of their options and rights (discussed b
elow) relating to the plan terminations from the
program. Although they acknow
ledged that their sentiments may change as more
beneficiaries complain, AARP in
dicated that they now see no reason to move quickly to
respond to initial "scar
e" articles by taking any position that appears to reward "bad apple"
HMOs.   Ha
ving said this, they also do not believe we need to take a strong and public
po
sition that appears we have drawn lines in the sand on against doing something
on this
issue. They are of the mind that we should wait to see how big the pro
blem is and how the
public responds to it before taking any formal, final posit
ion. They think a quick tough .
position may unconstructively unify the HMO indu
stry against us.


X-DOptions to Respond to HMO Industry's Actions.


X-DBefore briefly outlining some options, it is important that you are aware of
  actions we can
and should take regardless of our broader strategy on the Medic
are HMO issue. Clearly, we
must be quick to ensure that HCFA collaborates with
  the aging advocates (like AARP), the
aging network (like the Area Agencies on
Aging), the statebased insurance counselors, and
others in and outside the Admi
nistration to ensure that beneficiaries in impacted areas know
that they can al
ways return to the program's feeforservice plan.    Beneficiaries also need to
kn
ow that the law requires Medicare supplemental insurers to offer beneficiaries
access to
certain " Medigap " coverage without being underwritten.  As a result,
insurance that fills in
the voids that Medicare does not cover is truly accessi
ble.   Finally, to illustrate our
commitment to find ways to assure this never h
appens again, we may also want to indicate
our intention to introduce legislati
on that would help ensure that this never happens again.
 (For example, we migh
t want to contemplate provisions that penalize plans for "cherrypicking" the hi
gh reimbursement areas or disallow HMOs to enter any new market if they
have wi
thdrawn in others.)     Being proactive could help immunize us against charges we
  do
not care about beneficiaries.



X#'-"#'Q*Q*Q*%"C
X-Options for responding to last week's decision by many HMOs to pullout of Me
dicare:


X-01.XxExplicitly announce a "do nothing" position.O In short, draw a line in
the sand quite
publicly and blame any subsequent mess on HMOs who signed a cont
ract in May and
are reneging on their commitment. Highlight all the "selfish"
reasons why some
HMOs are dropping out and underscore our commitment to never b
e "blackmailed"
into changing the contracts we signed in good faith on behalf 0
f the beneficiaries. (#

XxPros:   Strong and decisive action; Puts industry on the defensive and initiat
es a much
more public war with one of the nation's most unpopular industries H
MOs. (#

XxCons:  Republicans, some Democrats, and AARP may feel we are acting too
polit
ically and too abruptly; Charges of callousness to harmed beneficiaries may ens
ue;
If we don't stay tough throughout inevitable "horror" stories, we will look
 much
weaker. (#



Xy-02.XxTacit "do nothing" position, but leave door (quietly open) option.O   Un
der this
scenario, we would continue to say we are looking into impact to deter
mine severity,
but would say we continue to be skeptical that there is a valid
argument to do
anything. We would background the press on the weaknesses of th
e HMOs'
arguments, but would hint that we might not reject out of hand any futu
re intervention
x-if our review turns up major problems for beneficiaries. (#

XxPros: Would appear that we are not backing down to industry, but also gives
flexibility in case we want to alter our current course; would 'likely be suppor
ted by
the Republicans and AARP for now, might be safest but certainly not bol
dest option for the moment. (#

xl-
XxCons: Could come across that we do not care about beneficiaries' woes; Could
 appear
weak and indecisive; Opens door to HMOs to come in to cut a deal that m
ay viewed
by the validators as setting very bad precedent for the Medicare prog
ram. (#


x       -03.XxExpediteOO approval of new plans coming into counties now not served.O


 This option
would highlight our commitment to work with and give expedited app
roval to HMOs
that were not in a service area when another HMO dropped its cove
rage.  These socalled "goodguy" plans could give a less comprehensive benefit     0
r costsharing
protection package than the one that it would replace. (#

XxPros:   Would not reward "bad apple" HMOs; Supports our contention that we are

taking reasonable actions to help beneficiaries keep access to an HMO option;
in
combination with base administrative and legislative package (outlined above
), would
illustrate that our "first and foremost" commitment is to beneficiarie
s not HMOs.(#

XxCons:   Very few new plans can be expected to come into these marginal markets

will not significantly reduce the number of "victim" stories that will be r
eported;" (0*0*0*'"
#Hv
00
#Hv
Makes us potentially more vulnerable to criticism that we did not do everything
 we
could to help beneficiaries; If we pursue this option but eventually cave t
o HMOs'
desires for other plans to get a similar offering, we would be perceive
d as very weak. (#


X-D4.XxExpedite approval of new plans, but allow selected old plans to apply to
 come
X-back in if no other option is available.D This approach would allow a plan t
hat
withdrew from a service area, which now has no HMO option, to downgrade its

X_-DDbenefits package to a level the HMO believes is financially viable. (#

XxPros:   Would help more beneficiaries at least retain some of their current HM
o
coverage; Would be more responsive to the inevitable pressure from the Congre
ss to
do more; and if as is likely the old HMOs do not come back, it is easie
r to lay
the blame on them.  (In other words, we did everything the HMOs asked
for and they
still did not come back.) (#

XxCons: Rewards bad actors; Makes us look somewhat weak as though we backed
X-down from pressure of the HMOs, Sets bad precedence for Medicare for future s
imilar
disputes with the industry (unless our administrative/legislative packag
e makes it
appear certain that we cannot or would not be able to do this again.
) (#



X4-C'5.Xx"Third way" option: try to split the difference between option 3 and 4


to attempt
X-to get the best and avoid the worst of both options. DIt might be possible (
although
X-we are still trying to develop a way to rationally apply this option) to allo
w only new
plans in, but to give the HHS Secretary emergency authority to appro
ve in selected
cases applications from HMOs from the old service area to come
 back into the
county. Under this approach, no such plan could even be cons ide
red unless it was
clear that no new plan would likely come into a particular se
rvice area. There would
have to be additional criteria as well to ensure that
there is no substantive difference
between option 4 and 5.  (#

XxPros: Could argue that we showed how we could. respond to beneficiaries' conc
erns
without backing down to the "bad apple" HMOs; See #4 above for similar pr
os. (#

XxCons: Could be vulnerable to charges that it is "too cute by half;" Might no
t be able
to develop criteria that was realistic and useable enough to differen
tiate amongst
similar plans. (#


X!-DConclusion.  DThere may be other options, but the above outlines what is mo
st likely to be
discussed later today.  The White House staff (DPC, NEC, OMB, 0
VP, Rahm, etc.) has not
had the opportunity to think through all of these optio
ns.  In general, however, the White
House tends to want to be a bit more aggres
sive than HHS. Consistent with this, HHS had
indicated an interest in option 4

#Hx
 on Friday
#Hx
    However, some of Donna's staff seemed to be
cooling to the idea over the wee
kend.  Regardless, it is clear that all views on this issue will
be #Hextremely
 influenced by the degree to which we receive troubling reports about beneficia
ries.

HHS' staff will ·be meeting early this morning to go over their preliminary anal
ysis and
options. We will advise you if anything unusual comes back to us prio
r to your meeting.
