The second fact they are asking for SOTU seems like one that we may not
want emphasized .... I am sure you are aware of this but thought I'd ask.

PLEASE HELP ... THANKS

Our helath care bill of rights says: Every American should have the right
to the best care ... the right emergency care. Within my power as
president, I have enacted, extending these rights to the [85 million]
Americans served by Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal health plans.
IS THAT CORRECT?

Illness due to smoking -- from cancer to emphezyma -- costs Medicare [X
billion] a year .... Already, state governments have recovered [X] billion
dollars for taxpayers for state health care costs.
