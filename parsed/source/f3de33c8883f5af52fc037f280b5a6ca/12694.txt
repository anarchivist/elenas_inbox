Subject: Title XI



This is from Jack Kristy

This language addresses Bill Taylor's concerns and does so in the most
logical place. It would require States to describe in their Accountability
Plans (I) its statewide system for turning around low-performing schools,
and (2) the steps it will take to ensure that all LEAs have the capacity to
meet the substantive requirements of the Accountability Act.
