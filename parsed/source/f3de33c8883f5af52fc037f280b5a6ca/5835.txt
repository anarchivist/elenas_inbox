TEXT:
The industry has tenatively agreed to supply the phones, DoJ has talked to
battered women's shelters where they've been given and found they are
useful, and we have a rough count of places they might be appropriate
(1,400 to start with).  Rahm now says it smacks of the small ideas cell
phones for community groups.   (That proposal has led to 30,000 crimes
reported a month by donated cell phones and at least 34 incidents reported
by law enforcement where a life has been saved). Anyway, I like it, but it
would seem to be on the backburner unless you feel we. should push.
