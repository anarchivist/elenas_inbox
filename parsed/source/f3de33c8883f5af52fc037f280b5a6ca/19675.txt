The Honorable Lamar Smith
Chairman
Subcommittee on Immigration
judiciary Committee
U. S. House of Representatives
Washington, D.C. 20510

Dear Mr. Chairman:

       .Today, your Subcommittee will mark-up H.R. 3736, the "Workforce Improvement and
Protection Act of 1998" which is intended to address the growing demand for skilled workers in
the information technology (IT) industry by enacting a temporary increase in the annual cap on
the number of visas for temporary foreign "specialty" workers under the H-IB program, while
also effecting reforms to the H-IB program that would help target their usage to industries and
employers that are actually experiencing skill shortages.

        The Administration believes that the first step in increasing the availability of skilled
workers must be raising the skills of U.S. workers and helping the labor market work better to
match employers with U.S. workers. Therefore, substantial additional efforts by industry to
increase the skill level of U.S. workers and needed improvements in the H-IB visa program are
necessary prerequisites for the Administration to support any short-term increases in the number
of visas for temporary foreign workers.

        We are pleased that H.R. 3736 is consistent with one of our primary objectives, insofar as
it conditions a temporary increase in the H-l B cap on the enactment of meaningful reforms to the
H-IB visa program. Your bill would help ensure that U.S. workers would not lose their jobs to a                  ,
temporary foreign worker and that qualified U.S. workers would have the opportunity to fill a job                    "
before a temporary foreign worker is hired. Moreover, your bill modestly expands enforcement
authority to help prevent employer abuses of the H-l B program. These reforms will effectively
target H-l B visas to industries experiencing skill shortages.

        Unfortunately, H.R. 3736 does not contain any provision for additional training
opportunities for U.S. workers. Training is a vital component of our strategy to address the
long-term demand for highly skilled U.S. workers and to enhance the international
competitiveness of important U.S. industries. An effective training strategy would also work to
reduce the demand for H-l B visas. We are also concerned that the increase in the annual
number of H-I B visas reflected in this bill is too large, although we agree that the increase
should last for only three years.

       For these reasons, the Administration believes that this legislation would substantially
improve the current H-l B program and, with the addition of meaningful training provisions and a
modest reduction in the level of increase in the annual H-18 visa cap, would gamer the
Administration's support. Modifications to the H-I 8 program that appropriately protect U.S.
                                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion

workers will also reinforce the Administration's strong support for legal immigration. We look
forward to working with the Congress on these and other specific provisions in the bill.

      The Office of Management and Budget advises that there is no objection to the
submission ofthis report from the standpoint of the Administration's program.



Sincerely,




BRUCE REED                                         GENE B. SPERLING
