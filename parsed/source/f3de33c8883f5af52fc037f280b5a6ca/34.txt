I. DEFINITION OF "CANCEL":     The House offer recommends use of
the word "veto" in applying the new authority to direct spending
and tax benefits.   However, the Department of Justice has
indicated constitutional problems inherent in authorizing a
President to "veto" pieces of a bill, following signature of the
overall bill.
While use of the word "suspend" is the preferred way of avoiding
a constitutional defect, "cancel" may be another option if it is
appropriately defined.   Following is a definition for use of the
word "cancel" with reference to new direct spending and targeted
tax benefits:
         NEW LANGUAGE TO BE ADDED TO SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS.
 (7) The term "cancel" means--
     (A) with respect to "new direct spending," withholding
the authority to obligate the United States pertaining


thereto, and suspension of legal entitlement to claim any
benefits or payments deriving therefrom; and
    (B) with respect to "targeted tax benefits," the
suspension of legal entitlement to claim any Federal tax
deduction, credit, exclusion, preference or other tax
benefit deriving therefrom.
