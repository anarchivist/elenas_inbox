TEXT:
FYI -Information on State of the Union Amplification activities:
 1 - Paper: Communications will be responsible for pulling together the
"paper" for people who will need to be talking on the State of the Union
speech (Senior staff, elected officials, Cabinet members, constituent
leaders, Friends of the Administration, etc). What this means is that a
packet with the following items will be sent to your office by Tuesday
early afternoon (unless we are told it can go earlier) :
                Talking points (overall)
                State by State accomplishments (to offices who work
w/states)
                Constituent Accomplishments
                5 Year Accomplishment cards (yellow-you should have them
now)
                3-5 Issue papers on specific issues that may be in the SOTU

The packets will be sent to 1-2 people in your office who will then be
responsible for making the appropriate amount of copies for what your
individual staff needs will be.  please make sure to communicate and
coordinate within your own department to make sure that each of your
colleagues will receive the materials they need.

We completely understand the need to receive this material early and will
do everything we can to get this stuff to you in a reasonable amount of
time while not jeopardizing information getting out before the President's
speech.

Immediately following the State of the Union speech the actual text of
what the President delivers will be posted on the WH web site for
immediate access of the text.

2 - Message Call: We will also be setting up a 3-5 minute conference call
immediately following the speech where Ann Lewis will run through message
points for people who will be speaking publically and need some message
guidance and focus.  This will be a 1 way call, which means that Ann will
talk, but the callers will not be able to ask questions.  The capacity for
this call is 100 people.  So, please be cautious about who you recommend
be on the call so all departments with surrogates will have access to this
information.  Kevin Moran is the contact for getting on this call.


3 - Briefings: We will also be helping schedule the Senior Staff for
participation in briefings and conference calls to get everyone on message
for the SOTU.   Ann Walker will be helping with that piece and we will
call you within the next few hours to work on slating each of the needed
briefers.

Please share this memo with other staff that may need to know how things
will work.  If you have a specific need or problem that has not been
addressed please feel free to call and we will try to help you, or direct
you to someone who can. Thanks for your patience and cooperation.
