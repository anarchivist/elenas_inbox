      CEA Proposal to use Census data to focus collection of pay data on problematic industries:

      Collection of pay data from all firms in the EEO-I universe, or even half of all Federal
      contractors (which would be 30% of the EEO-I universe), would be very expensive. It would
      be better to target any additional data collection where existing data indicate that there may be a
      problem. The value of the data could be enhanced and the collection cost reduced by targeting
      on the top 10% of industries that have problematic gender pay differentials, as indicated by the
      micro data from the decennial Census.

      The 1990 Census Public Use Microdata Sarnple (PUMS) data file could be used as described
      below, to create profiles of gender differences in wages by narrowly defined occupation,
      industry, and labor market area, adjusted for differences in educational attainment and age.
      Then those industries that have unusually large gender differences in wages within occupation
      and area could be identified, and firms in those industries could be required to submit pay data on
      a revised EEO-I, 60/2, or other form.

       The Census PUMS data, while somewhat dated, are still useful for preliminary screening to
       identify those industries that warrant closer scrutiny. Gender wage differentials within
     . industries do not change very rapidly over time. In some ways, the Census is more useful for
       identifying suspicious gender gaps than the proposed revised EEO-I form would be, because it
       identifies hundreds of detailed (3-digit) occupations and includes workers' education and age. It
       contains data on a 5% random sample of individuals (about 5 million workers) and is publicly
       available for anyone to use.

      For each individual the 1990 Census PUMS file includes:
              annual earnings, weeks worked, and hours worked per week -- from which average hourly
                      earnings can be calculated
              3-digit occupation
              3-digit industry
              residence (state, metro area, city)
              place of work (state, metro area, city)
              gender
              race, Hispanic origin group, birthplace, date of immigration, ancestry
              educational attainment
              age
              and other demographic characteristics
      There is rio information on firm size, actual work experience, or fringe benefits. Despite the
      lack of firm-level data, however, the Census data are still useful for identifying problematic
      industries.

      There is considerable doubt about the usefulness of any pay data that would be collected on the
      proposed revised EEO-I, because the few (IS?) broad occupational categories would cover many
      different job titles at different skill levels and rates of pay, and because the data would lack
      information on workers' qualifications, experience, fringe benefits, and working conditions.
      This information is essential to determining whether pay differences may be the resuit of illegal




     discrimination. However, if any such additional data are to be collected, the use of Census data
     as described above would focus the collection more cost-effectively.
