TEXT:
One important thing that I have pathetically not accomplished is write the
memo you wanted on whether people have to drop out of college because of
welfare reform, and responses to the President's conversation with Bruce
on this.   Since this is important and I really haven't gotten too far on
it at all, I thought maybe it would make sense for Cynthia to take it on.
Not that I should be giving her assignments, but I am still snowed under
at all times, and I'm sure she is very familiar with the issues. What do
you think?
