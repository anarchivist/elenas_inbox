TEXT:
Stephanie Robinson, Sen. Kennedy's child care assistant, called to
compliment the White House on the announcement and tell all of us that the
Senator was extremely pleased and positive about the progress.  He has a
release that details his support.  If anyone wants a copy please let me
know.

Stephanie emphasized that the Senator felt VERY strongly that anyone who
is making statements on the child care proposal (Secretary, FLOTUS,
VPOTUS, Mrs. Gore and POTUS) should emphasize its connection with the
tobacco settlement and not offer alternatives to the tobacco money.   The
Senator feels that if we offer alternatives to the funds from the tobacco
settlement to early in the game, Republicans will quickly reject the
funding option in favor of other options.  I told Stephanie that I would
make sure everyone knew the Senator's concerns.
