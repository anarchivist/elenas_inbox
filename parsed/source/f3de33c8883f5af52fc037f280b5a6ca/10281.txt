PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
RADIO ADDRESS ON BRADY LAW/NRA LAWSUIT
DECEMBER 5, 1998

        Good Morning.  Since I took office, we have worked very hard to
make our streets, schools, and neighborhoods safer places to live, work
and raise families.   WeD,ve put in place a comprehensive strategy of more
prevention, stricter enforcement and tougher punishment. WeD,ve taken
more guns and criminals off the street and put more police on the beat.
As a result, crime has dropped for six years in a row.

        This week, America launched a new effort to keep guns out of the
hands of criminals and make our streets even safer.  For the first time
ever, the Justice Department, working with the states, conducted
computerized background checks on ail firearm purchases.  In its first
three days, the new National Instant Check System reviewed more than
60,000 prospective gun sales to make sure only law-abiding citizens took
home new guns.  In those three days, we stopped some 1,300 felons,
fugitives, stalkers and other prohibited purchasers from walking away with
new guns. Who knows how many lives were saved.

           But within 24 hours after the new background checks went into


 effect, the National Rifle Association went to court to stop the new
.system. The goal of gun 10bbyD,s suit is plain: As the NRAD,s executive
 director himself put it this week, they want to D&scale backD8 the Brady
 law.

         Five years ago, as the Brady Bill was nearing passage in Congress,
 the gun lobby spent millions of dollars in a desperate effort to kill it.
 Fortunately, the good sense of Congress and the will of the American
 people prevailed.  The gun lobby lost. But as we saw this week, they will
 stop at nothing to gut the Brady Law and undermine the efforts of the
 American people to keep guns from falling into the wrong hands.

         We must not turn back. Brady background checks have stopped
 nearly a quarter of a million illegal handgun sales.  We cannot go back to
 the days when dangerous criminals walked away from stores with new guns,
 no questions asked.

         police, prosecutors and the American people they protect have made
 it clear that they want even tougher gun laws. That is why we must
 continue to work with law enforcement to strengthen -- not weaken -- the
 Brady law.  That is why, when the new Congress goes into session next
 month, one of my top priorities will be to pass legislation to require a
 minimum waiting period before a handgun sale becomes final.   This
 D&cooling offD8 period will help prevent rash acts of violence and give
 authorities more time to stop illegal gun purchases.  I also calIon
 Congress to ban violent juveniles from owning guns for life. There is
 absolutely no reason why young people convicted of violent crimes should
 be allowed to buy guns on their 21st birthday. And I thank Senator Bob
 Dole for coming out in support of such legislation this week.

         Finally, we must make sure that firearms sold at gun shows are not
 exempt from background checks -- and that they do not let unscrupulous
 dealers circumvent our gun laws.   Last month, I asked Treasury Secretary
 Rubin and Attorney General Reno to find ways to close this loophole.   And
 I calIon Congress to support their recommendations.

         Reducing crime has been one of the American peopleD,s greatest
 achievements in recent years. A decade ago, no one thought we could do
 it. But we did. Why would we retreat on this hard-won progress? We must
 remain vigilant in our efforts to support the laws that protect our
 children and families. Thanks for listening:
