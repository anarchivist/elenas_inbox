TEXT:
I was just on a conference call regarding rollout of the adminsitration's
position on the Unz Intiative. Janet Murghia wants to see a draft of the
memo before it goes up to the President.  Education (Pauline Abernathy for
Mike Smith) reiterated their strong belief that this memo get to the
President this weekend.   A couple of the call participants are planning
to call you to get a copy of the memo and/or encourage that it be sent up
asap.

(Mike Cohen also participated in the call, but is now en route to NJ) .
