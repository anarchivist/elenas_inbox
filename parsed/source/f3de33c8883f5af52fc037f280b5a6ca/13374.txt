TEXT:
We have the Woodrow Wilson room in the WH conference center.   I
plan to mention the mtg. at tommorrow's timber mtg. (if anyone
other than the attendees want to come, I think we should be open
to that) and will announce the change in venue then, although we
need to make sure all of the probable attendees are there.   Thanks
for setting it up!
