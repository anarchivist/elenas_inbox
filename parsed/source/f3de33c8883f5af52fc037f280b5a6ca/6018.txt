TEXT:
Elena -- FYI -- this has been cleared by Susan Liss, but not by Klain ...

Also, Susan wanted to know why we are doing the LA Times today ... is it
embargoed for Monday? This is of concern to her ...

Two quick talking points we could give to those who talk to the press in
advance of the MLK speech/EEOC announcement:

First of all, don't play up or overhype the speech; it's not the VP's big,
definitive speech on race.  He's not even the keynoter at Ebeneezer
Baptist Church on Monday, and he will focus on the life and lessons of Dr.
King.  He's spoken on race many times before, and he will do so many times
again.

That being said, in addition to making the EEOC announcement, the VP will
push back at our conservative critics on race (in particular, those who
think we should ignore race and abandon all race-based remedies).  He will
make the point that race does indeed still matter in America; that the
roots of discrimination run very deep; and that we still need concerted
action -- by government, and by all Americans working together -- to fight
racial and ethnic discrimination and to build One America (which is why we
are taking new steps to more vigorously enforce our civil rights laws).
