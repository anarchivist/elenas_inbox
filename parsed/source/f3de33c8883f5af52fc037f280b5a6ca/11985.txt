        In follow-up to the public charge meeting, I think we made some good
        headway in preclearing the public charge NPRM and guidance with the
        agencies.

        In follow up to Dan Chenok 's suggestion that INS establish a review
        mechanism if an Legal Permanent Resident (LPR) who was formerly a refugee
        is found to be inadmissible upon returning to the US,  Barbara call me to
        explain that there are already mechanisms in place to ensure that LPRs are
        not deported before there is a thorough review of all the circumstances.
        She indicated there are 3 steps already in place.   When a LPR is found
        inadmissible, they are put in deportation proceedings which is triggered
        by filing a Notice to Appear. This notice (1) must be signed off by a


 supervisor and (2) reviewed by district counselO,s office; (3) and finally
 the LPR would be in deportation proceedings so they would have the
 opportunity to make their case before an immigration judge. During this
 period, the LPR is not in detention nor is this a case of expedited
 removal.    The LPR would have a full opportunity to make their case to a
 judge.

 In effort to get this reg out, I suggest that we not push this further.   I
 spoke with HHS and they are okay with this approach but are anxious to
 review the NPRM and guidance.

 Please let me know if you have any questions.

 Thanks.
