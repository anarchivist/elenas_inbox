           DISCIPLINE AND PROTECTING OTHER CRITICAL INVESTMENTS
                                                           June 9,1998


Today, President Clinton will sign an ISTEA Reauthorization Bill That Includes An Historic Investment
in Infrastructure While Maintaining Fiscal Discipline and Protecting Critical Investments, Such As
Education, the Environment, and Health Care. While providing an historic investment in our infrastructure,
the agreement maintains President Clinton's priorities of reserving the surplus until Social Security is reformed
and investing in critical areas such as education, the environment, and health care. In response to the concerns
the Administration raised, Congress improved the bill and the agreement now represents a solid compromise
that is consistent with President Clinton's core principles:

       ,1Strengthens Our Infrastructure. The agreement guarantees nearly $200 billion to continue
       rebuilding America's transportation system -- an approximately 30-percent increase over the 1991 ISTEA
       reauthorization. This agreement will help communities modernize and build the roads, bridges, transit
       systems, and railways that link the people of our great and vast country together, that keep our economy
       strong and vibrant.

       ,1Maintains Fiscal Discipline. The agreement reduces the amount of additional transportation funding
       by $17 billion from the spending levels that were included in the original Congressional bills even
       though those bills had passed the House and Senate by large majorities.

       ,IPreserves    Surplus Until Socral Security Is Reformed. Unlike the original Congressional bills, the
       compromise is fully paid for with real offsets. And because the agreement does not touch the surplus, it
       is fully consistent with the President's call to "Save Social Security First."

       ,I Protects   Critical Investments in Our Future: Unlike the original Congressional bills, the transportation
       agreement does not squeeze other critical investments in our future, such as education, health care,
       research and development, and the environment, because it is not financed by lowering the discretionary


  THIS HIGHWAY-TRANSIT BILL AGREEMENT ALSO REFLECTS PRESIDENT CLINTON'S
                              PRIORITIES BY:




     ,(EXPANDING TRANSIT FUNDING
     '(PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT
     ,( HELPING MOVE PEOPLE FROM WELFARE TO WORK
     ,( HELPING DISADVANTAGED BUSINESSES
     ,( EXTENDING THE ETHANOL TAX CREDIT
     '(STRENGTHENING BORDER INFRASTRUCTURE


       caps .
       ./' Expands Transit Funding Within A Smaller Bill. While the agreement has less overall spending than the
       original Congressional bills, it increases the share of transit funding from 17 percent of total surface
       transportation spending to 20 percent of total spending by 2002.
      public health and the environment by increasing funding for the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality
      Improvement program by 40 percent above prior ISTEA levels.

       ,('Helps Move People from Welfare to Work. One of the biggest barriers facing people who move
       from welfare to work -- in cities and in rural areas -- is finding transportation to get to jobs, training
       programs and child care centers. To help those on welfare get to their jobs, the highway-transit
       agreement authorizes $900 million over the next six years for President Clinton's welfare-to-work
       transportation plan. Of the $150 million per year, $50 million is guaranteed in FY99, rising to the full
     . $150 million per year guaranteed in FY2003.

      ,('Helps Disadvantaged Businesses. The highway-transit agreement provides opportunities to
      disadvantaged businesses by retaining the Department of Transportation's Disadvantaged Business
      Enterprise (DBE) program.

      '(Extends the Ethanol Tax Credit. In order to provide incentives to use ethanol in gasoline and
      protect the environment, the highway-transit agreement extends the Ethanol Tax Credit through FY2007.

      '(Strengthens Border Infrastructure. The highway-transit agreement authorizes the Administration's
      program to target resources to border crossings to improve traffic flow and reduce illicit trade. The
      agreement allows highway funding to be used for Customs and INS equipment that speeds border
      crossings.

While the Agreement Provides Funding For Increased Safety, It Does Not Include A National Drunk
Driving Standard of .08 BAC. The agreement includes a number of measures to increase safety, including
incentive grants to increase seat-belt use and a strong program to make highway-rail grade crossings safer.
Congress has also agreed to new provisions to target repeat drunk drivers and to ban open alcohol containers in
cars. However, the President is disappointed that Congress refused to lower the national drunk driving standard
to .08 percent blood alcohol content (BAC). The President will continue to work to make sure that .08 is the
law in every state of the country.

                                                                             Automated Records Management System
                                                                             Hex-Dump Conversion
