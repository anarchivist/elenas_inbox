TEXT:
BR/EK:

Here are the current changes that have been incorporated into the new
Lautenberg/Kerry amendment on gun shows.  There are a few more than what I
previously mentioned.

1.    Narrows gun show definition to events where 20% of exhibitors are
firearms exhibitors, there are more than 10 firearms exhibitors, or 50 or
more firearms are for sale;

2. Drops the exhibition of a firearm from the definition of a firearms
transaction;

3.    Limi ts keeping of Brady/NICS records to 90 days;

4.    Drops advance notification to ATF of all gun shows;

5. Drops requirement on gun show promoters to send ledger of participants
to ATF (However, promoters would still be required to keep such ledgers);
and

6. Clarifies that amendment does not require unlicensed sellers to keep
records (only federal dealers that conduct checks for them) .
