                           MEETING WITH COLIN POWELL

                             DATE:                  August 11, 1997
                             LOCATION:              Oval Office
                             BRIEFING TIME:         10:00 a.m. - 10: 10 a.m.
                             EVENT TIME:            10: 10 a.m. - 10:40 a.m.

I.    PURPOSE

      To discuss General Powell's and the Administration's follow-up activities to the
      Philadelphia service summit.

II.   BACKGROUND

      Administration Accomplishments: Since the successful summit in Philadelphia, the
      Administration can point to a number of actions or events that further the summit goals,
      including the selection of the first 1,600 high school service scholars that you recently
      highlighted in the radio address, and 10,000 applications from service and religious
      organizations for the new AmeriCorps scholarships you announced at the summit. In
      addition, the Administration continues to use partnerships and citizen service to reach its
      key policy goals. In May, the Vice President announced a new partnership of civic
      organizations to mentor families seeking to leave welfare for work. Also in May,
      the Welfare to Work Partnership announced an expansion of its efforts to mobilize
      businesses to hire welfare recipients, so those parents can move into the economic
      mainstream and improve their children's future. In June, you announced that
      Kaiser Permanente will commit $100 million to provide health coverage for
      uninsured children in California, complementing the new budget's achievements on
      children's health coverage.

      Finally, federal agencies are following up on the more than 40 commitments they made
      at the Philadelphia summit, including mentoring, tutoring, and launching new
      partnerships with corporations and nonprofits. Attached is a document that highlights
      our progress.

      General Powell's Efforts: Since the summit, we have met regularly with General
      Powell's staff in an effort to continue our productive working relationship with him and
      "America's Promise," the nonprofit organization he chairs that is following up on the
                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion
       summit. America's Promise has struggled a bit to get organized, with the first CEO,
       Rick Little, stepping aside and Ray Chambers taking on the role. The first board meeting
       was held last week, with participation from new board members, including Jamie
       Gorelick. There hasn't been much press coverage of their work since the summit, but
       NBC and Jonathan Alter are planning to do some kind of "report card" on the summit in
       October.

       America's Promise is focusing primarily on two things: fostering state and community
       "mini-summits," and commitments (both adding new ones and ensuring that existing
       commitments are met). Its staff is now evaluating about 200 new commitments that
       have come in since the summit, and they will track our commitments as well.

       To date about 200 communities and states have decided to hold mini-summits. General
       Powell has asked that you, the Vice President, and the First Lady consider adding a
       mini-summit to your fall schedules, and he will probably raise this in your meeting.
       Attached is a list of upcoming summits. The Scheduling office is reviewing the list to
       determine how it fits into your schedule.

       General Powell may also ask you to speak about the summit's goals before appropriate
       audiences. You can report that you have been doing so (before the Welfare to Work
       Partnership in May; before the Business Roundtable and the Conference of Mayors in
       June; in the radio address on July 23). You also have an opportunity to mention it at the
       Welfare to Work event in St. Louis this coming Tuesday.

       We should ask General Powell for his support of our efforts to secure adequate
       appropriations and reauthorization for AmeriCorps and Corporation for National Service
       programs. We expect to send a bill to reauthorize AmeriCorps to the HilI this fall.
