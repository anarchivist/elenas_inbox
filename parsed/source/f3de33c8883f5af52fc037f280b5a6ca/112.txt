TEXT:
On page 36 line 12, of the House Government Reform and Oversight
Committee markup of H.R. 2086 there is a provision which requires
the President to certify the CEB's approval or disapproval of a
flexibility plan before the plan can take effect or before a plan
is terminated.
The bill states that the President "shall make a certification" or
"issue a finding that the certification may not be made" within
15 days after the CEB makes a decision on the plan.
Does this provision rise to the level of mentioning it
specifically in the SAP?
Justice - please check this provision with OLC
