TEXT:
Bruce, thanks again for participating in the tobacco forum in Tampa on
Florida.  It looks like we got good press and everyone was happy with how
it turned out.   Please let me know if you have any suggestions or changes
for the next forum.

We're looking forward to scheduling the other two forums. very
tentatively we're looking at Seattle (Nov. 6-7) and Chicago (Dec. 17).
The goal is to make these actually regional and bipartisan.  I'm working
w/ our Leg Affairs office to see if Lugar would come to Chicago or Hatch
would come to Seattle.  I also asked Fred DuVal about getting other
elected officials outside of their state to attend one of these events.
Any other thoughts or suggestions on making these regional and bipartisan
would be appreciated.

Do any of you have any thoughts or red flags on either of these
locations? Please advise. Thank you.
