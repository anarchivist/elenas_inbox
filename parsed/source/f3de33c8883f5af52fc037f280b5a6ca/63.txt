PRINTER FONT 12 - POINT- COURIER
Press reports are that agreement has been reached on product
liability. We need to make a decision ASAP within the EOP
whether to issue a SAP, a presidential statement, a DOJ
letter, or to issue no policy statement.
Normally, Administrations do not issue statements on
conference reports -- the rationale being to preserve the
President's options. However, we have not always followed
this approach depending on the particular circumstances.
Following, FYI, is a brief history of our Administration
statements on product liability (prepared by Ingrid Schroeder
at LRD) , as well as the text of statements made last year on
the Senate bill:
Product Liability/Civil Litigation/Medical Malpractice:
    (I. Schroeder, x53883)
House passed HR 956 on March 10 (265
o
-161).' It would cap
punitive damages in all civil cases and would cap non-
economic (pain and suffering) damages in suits against
health providers and insurers. Basis for opposition:
Product liability reform should generally be left to the
States; punitive damages shouldn't be arbitrarily capped;
and differential treatment of "economic" and
"noneconomic" (e.g., "pain and suffering") damages is
inappropriate.   (March 6th Reno/Mikva letter.)
Senate passed HR 956 on May 10 (61
o
-37).   It would cap
punitive damage awards by juries in product liability
cases at $250,000 or twice compensatory damages (economic
and non
o
-economic damages), whichever is greater.   Judges
could override those limits in "egregious" cases.
Punitive damage awards in product liability cases could
not exceed $250,000 for small businesses .. Basis for
opposition: A May lOth White House statement said the
Senate
o
-passed liability bill "in its present form does
not go far enough toward balancing the interests of
consumers with those of manufacturers and sellers." The
statement also stated the Administration's concerns
regarding the limits on punitive damages adopted by the
Senate and reiterated the Administration's opposition to
provisions which would abolish joint and several
liability.   (A provision limiting punitive damage awards
in all civil lawsuits, which was the subject of a May 4th
Presidential veto threat, was later limited to product
liability cases only.)
Text of May 4, 1995 Statement of the President:
        The Senate is engaged in the laudable goal of seeking to
reform our legal system. Yesterday they went much too far by


 adopting an amendment to cap punitive damages in all civil
 lawsuits.  In its present form the Senate bill sharply limits
 the damages paid by many classes of offenders who deserve to
 pay much more to their victims for the harm they have
 inflicted upon them.

         The bill now·before the Senate might be called the "Drunk
 Drivers Protection Act of 1995" -- for what it does is
 insulate drunk drivers and other offenders from paying
 appropriate amounts of punitive damages justified by their
 deeds.  I insist that we hold drunk drivers fully responsible.
 When they cause injury and death to innocent adults and
 children, we should throw the book at them, not give them a
 legal limit on damages to hide behind.
         The Senate should reconsider its position. At the least,
 it should remove damage caps on lawsuits involving drunk
 drivers, murderers, rapists, and abusers of women and
 children, despoilers of our environment like the Exxon Valdez
 and perpetrators of terrorist acts and hate crimes.
         All of these receive undeserved protection from the
 present bill. The Senate should reserve its compassion for
 the people who deserve it.   If this bill comes to my desk as
 it is now written I will veto it, and therefore I encourage
 the Senate not to vote to limit debate on the bill at this
 time.
         The Administration supports the enactment of limited, but
 meaningful, product liability reform at the federal level.
 Any legislation .must fairly balance interest of consumers with
 those of manufacturers and sellers.

 May 10, 1995 Statement by the WH Press Secretary:
         The Senate
 o
 -passed product liability bill is a clear
 improvement on the extreme legal reform measures passed by the
 House.  Unfortunately, the legislation in its present form
 does not go far enough toward balancing the interests of
 consumers with those of manufacturers and sellers.
         The Senate approach on punitive damages is an improvement
 on an absolute cap, but it still has flaws.  Moreover, the
 Administration has consistently made clear its opposition to
 the provision that would make it harder for injured consumers
 to recover their full damages in cases involving more than one
 culpable defendant.
         President Clinton supports balanced legal reform and will
 work with a House
 o
 -Senate conference to address these and other
 concerns.
