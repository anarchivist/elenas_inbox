TEXT:
After the terrific job Jose did in meeting with Chris yesterday on the
Crime chapter, I wanted to follow up on the one policy piece on crime that
is still unresolved.  Until the profiling issue is settled, we won't be
able to get this chapter put to bed.  So I'm playing the role of pest here
to urge you guys to schedule the meeting you're planning to have, figure
out what kind of memo needs to move forward to the President, and then get
it there.  If I can be helpful in any way, please let me know.  And if you
could let me know when you do schedule the meeting, I'd appreciate it.
Many thanks.  tds
