MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT'AND VICE PRESIDENT

FROM:          MICHAEL WALDMAN
               KATHLEEN WALLMAN
               [Who else should be added?]

SUBJECT:       THE PRESIDENT'S SPEECH TO THE FREE TV FOR STRAIGHT TALK
               COALITION ON TUESDAY, MARCH 11


        On March 11, the President will speak before Paul Taylor's Free TV group. Both the
President and the Vice President have been long time advocates of free television for federal
candidates. This conference presents an opportunity for the President to indicate for the first
time that the Administration supports requiring digital broadcasters to take on a new public
interest obligation to provide free television time to federal candidates. Further, the President
could charge the group that the Vice President announced on February 5 would be formed to
study the nature of digital broadcasters' public interest obligations with exploration of this
solution.

BACKGROUND

       To jump start the transition from analog to digital broadcasting, each existing analog
broadcaster will be given, free of charge, enough spectrum to broadcast two channels of video
programming. After a few years, the broadcasters will be required to return their analog
spectrum, which then will be auctioned.

         The spectrum that will be furnished to the broadcasters free of charge represents
enormous capacity and has enormous commercial value. In that light, it seems reasonable to
revisit the public interest obligations that currently apply to broadcasters and to see how they
should be updated or expanded.

        Nevertheless, the National Association of Broadcasters resists the thought of additional
obligations. NAB argues that digital broadcasters have not even figured out their business plans.
 They do not even know, for example, whether it will be more profitable for them to use the
spectrum for video or for data. Thus, they argue, it is at least premature to suggest now that any
additional public interest obligations should be imposed on digital broadcasters.

        The debate over possible. new public interest obligations threatened to stalemate the
transition process at the FCC. To avoid this, last month, the Vice President announced that a
                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion

special group would be formed to study this issue, and to report back to the President within a
year while the FCC continues to move forward with the transition. The group has not been
formed yet, and it would be timely within a day or two of the President's speech for the Vice
President to name the head ofthe group and to underscore the importance of taking up the
question of digital broadcasters' public interest obligation as it relates to campaign finance.

HOW THE NEW PUBLIC INTEREST OBLIGATION WOULD WORK

      There·are many aspects of the possible new public interest obligation relating to
campaign finance that demand further inquiry and study, but here is the basic outline:

       Digital broadcasters collectively would be required to provide free time or its cash
equivalent value totalling $1 billion (taking 1996 cycle spending as a benchmark) for each
two-year election cycle. (A mechanism would be needed to allocate responsibility for the time
and money among digital broadcasters). The time and money would be pooled in a "bank" and
could be redeemed by federal candidates with vouchers issued to them, perhaps by the FEC. (A
mechanism would be needed to handle "deficits" that might occur when a broadcaster is asked to
redeem vouchers totalling more than the amount that it paid in to the bank.)

        Participation in this "Timebank~' plan would be voluntary. A candidate who participates
would agree, in exchange for receiving the vouchers, not to purchase additional time, or to limit
additional time purchases. It will be important to confirm that nothing in this approach
undercuts McCain-Feingold, but rather functions as advance implementation of the free time
parts ofthe bill.

ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE HEAD OF THE STUDY GROUP

       The study group likely will need to be constituted as a committee under the Federal
Advisory Committee Act. We are confirming this with Counsel's Office. We will need to be
far enough along in establishing it by next week to be ready for an announcement.

        The leading candidate to head the group appears to be Newton Minow, former Chairman
of the FCC, who has been a leading advocate of improving the ways in which broadcasting
serves the public interest. Other names that have come forward are Charlie Firestone, head of
the Aspen Institute, and Walter Cronkite. A formal decision memorandum concerning this
selection will come forward from Bob Nash. In the meantime, we seek approval to talk with
Mr. Minow about serving in this capacity.

RECOMMENDATIONS

       1.     That the President urge in his remarks active study ofthe Timebank
              approach as a promising way to eliminate the need for candidates to raise the
              millions of dollars that they now need to spend to be heard by voters.

              _Approve               _   Disapprove                    Discuss further

       2.     That the Vice President announce the head of the new study group shortly
              after the Free TV speech and underscore the need for serious .study ofthe
              Timebank idea as an appropriate new public interest obligation for digital
              broadcasters.

              _Approve               _   Disapprove                    Discuss further

       3.     That you authorize us to talk with Mr. Minow about serving as head of the
              group.

              _Approve               _   Disapprove                    Discuss further
