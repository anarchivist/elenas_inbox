TEXT:
OSHA has been asked to brief two committees on tobacco and indoor air
quality in preparation for hearings in the Senate in January (Chafee) and
the House (not settled on date).  Emily Sheketoff, who called from OSHA,
would like to know if they should go ahead and brief.  In addition to
briefing, the Senate would also like them to testify.  Should I ask her in
to see what they would say in a briefing?
