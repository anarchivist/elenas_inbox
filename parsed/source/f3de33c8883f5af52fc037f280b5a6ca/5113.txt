TEXT:
FYI, we have made remarkably little progress on this issue, and it may end
up getting elevated. Just to remind you, this is the issue where HHS
wants to count fingerprinting, drug testing, and whole grant sanctions as
eligibility decreases, and give states that initiate use of these tools a
smaller caseload reduction credit.

HHS has several arguments.
First, the law says that eligibility decreases must be factored out of the
credit, and they say fingerprinting was explicitly identified as a
condition of eligibility in AFDC. Therefore, they argue that it's hard to
say it's not an eligibility change for this purpose. We are working on
this question.
Second, they concede that some of the 10-20% caseload reduction that
results from fingerprinting does reflect rooting out fraud, but they argue
that much of it is simply an extra administrative hurdle that causes many
people to fall by the wayside. Also, Emil Parker argues against us on
this, making the argument that many poor people are generally frightened
of fingerprinting and other police-like actions.
Finally, they argue (as we do on other issues) that we are just talking
about the caseload reduction credit here.  States are still free to
fingerprint, and they will benefit in other ways if they do -- with money
saved, and with a smaller base of people to whom the work participation
rates are applied.

We are assuming we should continue to carry the standard into battle on
this one.
