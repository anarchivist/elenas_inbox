Subject: OCR testing-related work: update

     Bill and Mike,

     This is an update on our work regarding Title VI and Title IX in the
     area of test use.  Please forward this information to Elena and Tanya
     (I don't have their internet addresses.)

     Background:

     You will recall that we met on several occassions with the Leadership
     Conference in the context of national testing issues. As part of our'
     discussion, we committed to moving OCR's draft testing guidance to
     final (following collaboration with DoJ, among others), and solicited
     comments from the Leadership Conference regarding the draft.

     Update:

      We had targeted mid-December for a release of the guidance in final.
      We are, however, still talking with DoJ regarding some outstanding
     points related to the guidance (nothing that calls into question the
      legal standards we're using). This target date will move to the
early
     part of '98. As a result, we've asked a subgroup of the Leadership
      Conference to meet soon regarding the guidance (substantively, as
well
      as regarding the form of the release) .

     Our very strong recommendation will be to maintain the final issuance
     of the guidance in a form that is not regulatory.  For a host of
     strategic reasons, we are hopeful that there will be concurrence on
,..   c.,


            this point among Leadership Conference members.

            In addition to the guidance, itself, we are preparing a pamphlet of
            questions and answers to assist educators and parents in this area,
      as
            well as a more comprehensive information strategy to accompany the
            issuance of the guidance in final.  We will meet on this, and related
            matters, in the coming weeks.  In the meantime, we'd appreciate any
            ideas or suggestions you may have regarding our work in this area.

            Thanks.
