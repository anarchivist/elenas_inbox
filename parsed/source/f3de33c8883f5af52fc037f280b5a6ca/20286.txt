Children and Families -- After-School Event: On Wednesday, June 17th, you wiIl be joined
by the First Lady and the Vice President in the Rose Garden as you announce the 21st Century
Learning Centers grants that have been funded for FY 98. The $40 million appropriated last year has
funded 98 grants to 315 schools in 36 states to establish or expand after-school initiatives to serve
their communities. You will also release a new report titled Safe and Smart: Making the
After-School Hours Workfor Kids, which was authored by the Departments of Justice and Education
and finds that quality after-school programs both decrease juvenile crime as well as improve the
academic performance of participating children. This event will take place as Congress gears up for
an appropriations process in which there is broad, bipartisan support for expanding the 21 st Century
Learning Centers Program, but scarce resources because of the strict budget caps adopted in both the
House and the Senate.
