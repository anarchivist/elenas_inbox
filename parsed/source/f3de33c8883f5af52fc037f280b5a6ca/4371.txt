TEXT:
We have received DOJ's hate crime proposals. With the exception of
legislative proposals which Tom addressed in an earlier e-mail, these
non-legislative proposals generally look pretty good.   The centerpiece of
DOJ's proposal is the formation, in each of the u.S. Attorney Office's
districts, of a working group consisting of federal, state, and local law
enforcement, as well as community leaders, to develop a comprehensive
approach to hate crimes.

DOJ has proposals centered around (1) data collection, and (2) community
outreach, including to the educational communities.   The only proposal
that might require some additional vetting is one of the educational
components which envisions sending pamphlets to each of the nation's
school districts with suggestions for classroom activities.   I'll send
you a copy of the draft memo containing the various non-legislative
proposals.   If you need anything else, let me know. Mary
