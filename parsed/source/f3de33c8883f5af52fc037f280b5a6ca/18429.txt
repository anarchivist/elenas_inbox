     Immigration -- INS Reorganization. We have completed our review of proposals to
     restructure the nation's immigration system, including the final recommendations of the
     Commission on Immigration Reform (CIR). In its final report, the CIR called for the separation
     of the enforcement and service functions that INS now performs, through reallocation of major
     functions to other agencies. After consultation with representatives from the Department of
     Justice, the INS, the Department of State, the Department of Labor, members of the CIR, and
     immigrant advocacy groups, we have concluded that though the functional separation of service
     from enforcement is an effective way to improve the administration of our immigration laws and
     policies, this separation is best achieved through reform within the INS rather than through a
     dismantling of the agency. This functional separation within INS will strengthen accountability
     and lines of authority, while making the agency more efficient and effective in carrying out its
     interrelated responsibilities. DOJ has entered into a contract with a private consulting firm to
     assist them in designing a reform plan that meets our goals. Over the next few weeks, we will
     be meeting with INS, DOJ and the contractor to assist in guiding this development.
