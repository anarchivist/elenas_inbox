TEXT:
You dropped me a note about whether the Doggett amendment passed.  It did
in State/Commerce, but has not been signed yet.  (It formalized the US
position on tobacco exports-- prohibting promotion of tobacco overseas but
allowing the government to fight discrimination specifically against US
tobacco) .
