TEXT:
Minneapolis-St. Paul Star Tribune
               Elena Kagan, a domestic policy adviser to President
               Clinton, said the White House hadn't seen details of the
               settlement package but was cheered by what it knew.
               "From what we hear, this is a real step in the right
               direction," she said. "We give the attorneys general all the
               credit in the world for having accomplished this. At the
               same time, it leaves a great deal to be done."
