TEXT:
We are concerned about the lead time needed to clear and finalize the INS
restructuring package. We must get the Rogers letter, comparison chart
and Labor and State letters into the LRD clearance process as early as
possible TODAY.

Status:

The Rogers' letter is with DPC for its final cut before LRD interagency
circulation. The side-by-side has been shared with EXOP and Justice and is
ready for LRD clearance. We have a Labor letter which is almost ready for
LRD re-circulation (we are suggesting a number of minor changes which
Labor should not object to). We are hoping to get the State letter for
LRD clearance by noon today.
