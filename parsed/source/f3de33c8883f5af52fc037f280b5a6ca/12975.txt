Hollywood Surprised by Clinton's Violence Inquiry
                 Entertainment: Some in industry are miffed at president,
saying he has
              one-upped Congress at their expense.
              By AMY WALLACE, FAYE FIORE, Times Staff Writers

        Shortly after President Clinton loosed federal investigators on
                              the entertainment industry last week,
Hollywood began
                              cooking up conspiracy theories. What,
blindsided executives in
                         Los Angeles wanted to know, had made this
Democrat--a fan of pop
                         culture, defender of the 1st Amendment and major
beneficiary of the
                         industry's largess--Iaunch a $l-million inquiry
into how they market
                         violence to children?
                              Was the lame duck president searching for a
legacy that wasn't
                         scandal? Was he mad that not a single Hollywood
honcho had
                         attended his May 10 youth violence summit? Was he
trying to give
                         Hillary Clinton a springboard to run for the
Senate?
                              "Clinton did this in a surprising way," said
Donna Bojarsky, a
                         Democratic activist with long-standing Hollywood
ties. "People are
                         trying to understand it."
                              What had happened in the six weeks between


the high school
                          massacre in Littleton, Colo., and Clinton's
unprecedented probe of
                          entertainment violence only underscored how the
insular worlds of
                          Washington and Hollywood play by different rules.
If on the surface
                          they both attract big egos, value showmanship and
survive by figuring
                          out what America wants, they are different in one
key respect:
                          Washington lives by votes, and Hollywood by
profits.
                               "We're driven by market forces," said one
movie industry insider,
                          rejecting the notion that Hollywood's production
of violence is out of
                          sync with the nation. "We are in sync with
America. People love
                          violence. They will rebuke it all day long, but
'The Matrix' just made
                         $155 million."
                              However accurate, that bottom-line
viewpoint--bolstered by the
                         fact that moviegoers often say they want one thing
then plunk down
                         $8 at the multiplex to see another--may have left
Hollywood unaware
                         that this time Clinton meant business. Few in the
entertainment world
                         expected the boom would be lowered so quickly, or
that Clinton
                         would be the one to lower it.
                              But if the industry was in tune with the
desires of millions of
                         consumers, it was hopelessly out of touch with the
depth of the
                         national sentiment demanding action after
Littleton and the political
                         realities of Washington.
                              "Clinton was well-armed with polling that
told him what this would
                         mean, and he doesn't move without that," said one
East Coast film
                         industry lobbyist. "There are few forces of nature
more powerful
                         than a political opportunity waiting to be
seized. "
                              political insiders agree that the events of
last week were vintage
                         Clinton--co-opting a popular issue with expert
timing. The
                         senate-passed legislation ordering the Federal
Trade Commission and
                         Department of Justice to investigate the marketing
of music, movies
                         and video games to children was awaiting approval
by the House.
                         When Congress went out of town for the Memorial
Day recess,


                          Clinton leaped out front and ordered the probe
himself.
                               His action was consistent with his history on
similar
                          issues--pushing a balking television industry to
accept sex and
                          violence ratings,   lambasting violent rap lyrics
and publicly condemning
                          the industry's excesses.

                               Inquiry Follows Party Fund-Raiser
                               What recent events illustrate is the
sometimes profound
                          disconnect between the Democratic president and
the industry that
                        thinks it has a relationship with him. In the
weeks after Littleton, the
                        links between the two power centers were frayed.
                             Some East Coast political analysts said
Hollywood's strong
                        financial support of Clinton's agenda probably
                        boomeranged--targeting the industry rather than
shielding it.
                             The inquiry came two weeks after DreamWorks
principals
                        Steven Spielberg, David Geffen and Jeffrey
Katzenberg hosted a
                        Beverly Hills event that raised $2 million for the
Democratic Party.
                        Some saw the inquiry as a move to ward off charges
that the
                        Democrats use Hollywood as a cash machine but are
loathe to take it
                        to task on tough issues.
                             "After that fund-raiser in Los Angeles what
could [Clinton] do?"
                        said one political observer. "People were going to
say Hollywood
                        bought him [and the Democrats] off."
                             Those contradictory perspectives were voiced
time and again last
                        week: Washington accused Hollywood of hiding
behind the 1st
                        Amendment to defend the production of disturbingly
violent product,
                        and Hollywood decried Washington for scapegoating.
Many in the
                        industry said it was their earnest desire to help
curtail youth violence,
                        but that the White House slammed them before they
had the chance.
                             "[Clinton's] announcement certainly felt like
finger-pointing," said
                        Andy Spahn, corporate spokesman for DreamWorks
SKG, adding
                        that the timing and scope of the inquiry seemed
inconsistent with the
                        president's earlier invitation to work together
without blame.
                             Industry leaders were discussing possible


steps to reduce youth
                        violence when Clinton charged ahead.   "Why none of
us were
                        consulted and why that process wasn't permitted to
unfold isn't clear
                        to me," Spahn said.
                             Nevertheless, one entertainment industry
publicist noted that
                        though Hollywood players may feel miffed, they
don't have a lot of
                        alternatives.
                             "It's not just about the money. They share
their aura, their glitter,
                        their fairy dust. They let [politicians] come to
their homes. That's
                        what flips them out more than anything else. They
thought the
                        seduction had worked. They thought they owned this
guy," the
                        publicist said. "But they're stuck. There's
nowhere to go."

                             Clinton Earlier Expressed Concerns
                             Clinton's concerns about media violence are
not new--he has been
                        consistent about the issue since he first
campaigned for president in
                        1992. After TV's "Murphy Brown" featured Candice
Bergen as an
                        unwed mother--drawing fire from the likes of
then-Vice President
                        Dan Quayle--Clinton said he was "troubled by the
gratuitous violence
                        and sex and mixed moral signals on television."
                             Visiting Hollywood in late 1993 after his
election, Clinton urged
                        agents at the Creative Artists Agency to take
personal responsibility
                        for what they helped produce.
                             Then at last month's White House summit,
Clinton spoke of a
                        direct link between violent images and violent
acts. The combined
                        eagerness of Congress and the White House to find
a solution--or at
                        least to appear to be actively searching for
one--made it clear in
                        Washington that some federal action had to be
taken to assure the
                        nation that its government wasn't just sitting
around waiting for the
                        next campus tragedy.
                             "The president was determined from the
beginning to focus our
                        efforts on ending marketing of violence to young
people, and since
                        the summi't he has made that point in a variety of
ways," said a senior
                        White House official. "Many in the entertainment
industry haven't


                         grasped the distinction between marketing and
creative license, and
                        they had a reaction to any action by the
government, even one that's
                        designed to reinforce the spirit of the industry's
own [movie] rating
                        system. "
                             Hilary Rosen, president of Recording Industry
Assn. of America,
                        responded: "It's not that the industry didn't
understand that
                        Washington was serious. But there is a broad-based
cynicism about
                        the president's motives--that something has to be
done because we
                        have to look like we're doing something."
                             The federal inquiry may only be the
beginning. On Friday, Sen.
                        Joseph Lieberman (D-Conn.) joined Sen. John McCain
(R-Ariz.) in a
                        bid to expand the law that requires warning labels
on cigarettes to
                        apply to violent entertainment products. They plan
to introduce a
                        Senate bill to that effect next week. Industry
analysts saw the action
                        as the latest volley in a game of one-upmanship,
with Clinton and
                        Congress now competing to see which could slap
Hollywood hardest.

                              As politicians such as Lieberman vowed to
deliver a "wake-up
                         call," by week's end Hollywood was already wide
awake.
                              "Bill Clinton loves black people. He rebukes
Sister Souljah,"
                         mused one Hollywood insider, recalling Clinton's
1992 condemnation
                         of the militant black rap singer's comments after
the Los Angeles
                         riots.
                              "Bill Clinton loves poor people. He signed
the Republican version
                         of welfare reform. He's a friend of Hollywood and
he bashes
                         Hollywood. It's not inconsistent with the middle
of the street he likes
                         to walk. We are Sister Souljah right now."
                              What inflamed Tinseltown most was Clinton's
decision to limit the
                         federal inquiry to the entertainment industry,
leaving the impression
                         that the guns were not part of the problem.
                              TV producer Norman Lear, a longtime supporter
of Democratic
                        causes, said, "Singling us out--looking at the
entire culture, the whole
                        fabric, and picking out one thread and pointing
the finger because


                          that's the way the wind is blowing? My visceral
reaction is the
                          president . . . had nothing to say, so he grabbed
at a straw. r find that
                          totallyobjectionable."
                               That people feel not just ambushed, but
spurned, could have
                          lasting effects for the Democratic Party, part of
the reason Clinton's
                          decision to launch the inquiry did not have the
unanimous support of
                          his advisors, according to one senior White House
official. But
                          Clinton "felt comfortable" with the timing, the
official said, and
                          remarked heading back from the Rose Garden Tuesday
that it was
                          "the right thing to do."
                               Part of Clinton's comfort could stem from the
fragmented nature
                          of contemporary Hollywood. The movie studios now
are part of
                          multinational corporations with myriad products
and competing
                        interests. Actors and directors often are
dissatisfied with the ways
                        studios market their films.
                             "There is no monolith Hollywood," said one
Washington lobbyist.
                        "One guy can't stand up, snap his fingers and say,
'We will no longer
                        support the White House, Hillary or [California
Democratic Sen.J
                        Dianne Feinstein.' Not like other industries where
they all support
                        their friends all the time."
                             Meanwhile, there are signs that Hollywood is
responding in its
                        own way. Agents report a "chilling effect" on
violent projects, even
                        the most innocuous. Disney's plan to create a
feature film franchise
                        called "Fear Street" (based on a series of
humorous children's books
                        by R.L. Stine) reportedly was shelved in the wake
of Littleton.
                             And not everyone is chafing at the inquiry.
                             "r understand being singled out looks bad,
but to think that the gun
                        lobby hasn't been singled out since Columbine is
inane," said Jeff
                        Ayeroff, co-chief of Sony Music's Work Group
label, who in the
                        early '90s helped create "Rock the Vote," a voter
registration effort
                        aimed at young people. "Self-examination isn't a
bad thing."
