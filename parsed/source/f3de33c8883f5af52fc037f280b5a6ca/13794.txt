TEXT:
Remaining problems under the rider include (but are not
necessarily limited to) :
a)  offering replacement timber for the 225 mbf that fall under
the "known to be nesting" category (2001(k) (2)). Our position is
that the replacement timber must comply with environmental law;
industry thinks otherwise.   This likely will be litigated.
FUrther, it will require additional work to figure out precisely
where those replacement sales will come from (and recall that they
have to be of "like kind and volume".   The Forest Service very
much wants to avoid offering timber from this year's sales
(because it will irritate other purchaser).   Those sales are are,
of course, the sales most likely to already be in compliance with
env. law.
b)  I believe we have a few (k) (1) sales where environmental
modifications are still an issue, but I need to confirm that.
c)  Salvage side:   important problems have emerged over the past
few weeks, as USDA as taken a closer look at salvage.    Several
hundred new salvage sales are due to be released in California
this summer, some of which will be highly controversila. As you
know, the Secretary's office is working on developing a directive
to try to control the volume of green trees being offered under
salvage and to stay out of roadless areas.   There is considerable
resistance to that.   There is also an interagency review of the
salvage program being launched.
On the litigation front in salvage, the cae of most significance
involves a challenge from the Klammath tribes, raising Indian
treaty violations.
d)  Analysis of impacts to the President's Forest Plan:    getting
the murre let decision means that the agencies have a better
understanding of what the environmental baseline will be a result
of the timber rider.   The regional env. office set up under the
Plan will coordinate an effort to analyze the ecoloical effects of
the rider to determine whether a. supplement to the Plan EIS and
reinitation of consultation under Section 7 of the Endangered
Species Act is necessary.   We can certainly expect litigation from


     environmentalists regarding the continued validity of sales under
     the Plan once the rider expires at the end of this year.
