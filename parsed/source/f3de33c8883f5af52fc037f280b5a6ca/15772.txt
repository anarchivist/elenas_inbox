Subject:         Adoption bill

The Senate cloakroom reports that they'll likely take up the abortion bill
next week. If they take up the House-passed version, we will plan to send
up a SAP identical to the House version (strongly support) .

If they take up S. 511, the Chafee/Rockefeller version, we'll draft a new
SAP. We have not taken a position on the Senate version to date.   (I
don't believe CBO has scored the bill, but it may cost money.)

Yesterday, the Senate had a 2nd reading of the House-passed bill, so it's
likely that will be the one they take up.

Will keep you posted.
Alice
