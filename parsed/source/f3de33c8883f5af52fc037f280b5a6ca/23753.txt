                               Students Have Always
                               Been Violent
                               They're just better armed today.

                                By David Greenberg
                                (Posted Friday, May 7, 1999)




                                       Judging by the histrionic Columbine
                               massacre coverage you'd think that children
are
                                by nature innocent, free of violent or
sexual
                                thoughts until corrupted by our culture.
That
                                schools have traditionally been safe. That
the
                                recent spate of killings is unprecedented.
                                       History says otherwise. In every
era, American
                                schoolchildren--especially teen-agers--have
been
                                unruly and destructive. As late as the 17th
century,
                                those "children" we now call teen-agers were
                                considered adults. And preteens swore,
drank, had
                                sex, even dueled with guns. If school
violence wasn't a
                                problem back then, it's only because few


children went
                               to school.




                 n colonial America, most young children were taught
                 at home. Those who attended school were just as
                prone to be disorderly as today's youths. Teachers
                kept problem children in line with corporal punishments
                that seem positively barbaric today: They tied children
                to whipping posts and beat them or branded students
                for their crimes--a "T" for thievery, a "B" for
                blasphemy. Occasionally children were put to death.
                       Branding fell from favor in the18th century, but
                students were still flogged or tied to chairs (for more on
                corporal punishment, click here). In the early 19th
                century, school reformer Horace Mann reported that
                he saw 328 floggings in one school during the course of
                a week. As the principles of humanitarianism spread
                and the era of mass schooling arrived, Mann and others
                replaced or supplemented the elite academies with
                taxpayer-supported "common schools," which admitted
                young students from all walks of life. (Later, attendance
                become compulsory.) In the Gilded Age, as immigrants
                and migrants flooded the cities, public elementary
                schools proliferated. Finally, the Progressives
                championed the view of adolescence as a stage of
                childhood, and high schools (the first of which opened
                in the 1820s) multiplied as well.




                                 t appears that more students meant more
violence. In
                                 1837, Mann noted that almost 400 schools
across
                               Massachusetts had to be shut down because of
                               disciplinary problems. In most
institutions, keeping
                               order cook precedence over teaching. One
observer in
                               1851 likened the typical American school to
"the
                               despotic government of a military camp." In
the
                               colleges, where the teen-age students were
bigger and
                               less docile, violence was even worse.
Princeton
                               University, to take just one example,
witnessed six
                              major riots between 1800 and 1830,
including the
                               burning of the library in 1802 and a rash
of campus
                               explosions in 1823 that caused half of one
class to be
                               expelled.




                                       School violence persisted into the
20th century,
                                taking different forms according to the
climate of the
                               day. In politically charged times, students
became
                               violent in the name of political causes. In
1917, for
                               example, when New York City introduced a
"platoon"
                               system to deal with an influx of pupils,
students
                               rebelled--literally. Between 1,000 and 3,000
                               schoolchildren picketed and stoned P.S. 171
on
                               Madison Avenue and attacked nonstriking
classmates.
                               Similar riots erupted across the city,
resulting in furious
                               battles between student mobs and the
police. Likewise,
                                the civil rights movement and anti-vietnam
War
                               protests brought different forms of
"political" violence to
                               places ranging from Little Rock Central
High in
                               Arkansas to Kent State University in Ohio.




                     ore politically sedate times didn't translate into
                     student acquiescence, however. In the
                 post-World War II years, urban strife and suburban
                 anomie gave rise to school violence of the sorts broadly
                 rendered by Hollywood in the 1955 films Rebel
                 Without a Cause and Blackboard Jungle. The nation
                 waxed hysterical over "juvenile delinquency," as the
                 vogue phrase had it--alienated adolescents
                 unaccountably sullen in the bountiful Eisenhower years.
                 Though history had recorded public concern over
                 bands of violent teen-agers ever since the beginning of
                 the republic, the fear of "gangs" (a term coined in the
                 1930s) caught the nation's fancy. Time magazine
                 headlined a story, "Teen-agers on the Rampage," which
                 detailed a weeklong outbreak of violence in high
                 schools from Maine to California. Congress held
                 hearings on the delinquency epidemic, calling
                 comic-book artists to testify about whether their
                 drawings inspired children to violence.
                        Youth rebelliousness surged in the 1960s. While
                 crime grew overall, juvenile crime grew faster.
                 Sociologists, social workers, and policy wonks turned
                 their attention en masse to offenses ranging from
                 vandalism to gang-related crime, from drug use to
                 student-upon-student assaults. Schools implemented


                 safety plans, bringing in adult hall monitors and setting
                 up bodies for hearing student grievances. Urban
                 schools hired professional security agents--and later
                 adopted the surveillance cameras, metal detectors,
                 locker searches, and other measures more commonly
                 seen in prisons. But a major study conducted in 1978
                 confirmed what experience had been teaching.
                 Teen-agers were more likely to be victims of crime at
                 school than anywhere else.




                                  f student violence has now been a major
concern for
                                 decades now, what seems to distinguish
'90s violence
                                is the suburban- or rural-school massacre.

Littleton,

with guns,
                                committed multiple murders in or near the
school itself.
                                To be sure, similar atrocities have
occurred in the past.
                                In 1927, a 55-year-old school-board
official detonated
                                three bombs in the Bath, Mich.,
schoolhouse, killing 45
                                people. And to be sure,   the string of
recent killings in
                                fact reveals nothing, statistically
speaking, about our
                                society. Yet they remind us that the number
of children
                                killed by guns skyrocketed in the '80s and
while tailing
                                off in the '90s remains far higher than in
decades past.
                                According to one recent study, the growing
trend of
                               .violent altercations ending in death is
attributable
                                "almost entirely" to the proliferation of
guns among
                                children.
                                       History makes it clear that children
and teen-agers
                                are no strangers to violent impulses. There
have always
                                been, and always will be, maladjusted or
deranged
                                students who unleash those impulses. That
they. do so is
                                inevitable. How they do so may be within
our control.
