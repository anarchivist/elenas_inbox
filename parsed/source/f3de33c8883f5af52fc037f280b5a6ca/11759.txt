TEXT:
BR/EK:

Just a quick note for tomorrow's senior staff meeting ...

Senators Session and Thurmond have scheduled a joint
Judiciary/Administrative Oversight Subcommittee hearing on gun
prosecutions for next Monday morning.  They have a damning chart on how
we're charging fewer persons overall for gun crimes, and have asked the
U.S. Attorney from Richmond, VA (Project Exile) to testify.  No one from
OOJ has been invited yet, and their thinking is that they're better off
pushing the Dems to make sure that people like David Kennedy (Boston Gun
Project) will be invited, than insisting on their own participation.
While the R's will hate it -- and think we did it simply to scoop them --
this does make the case for the gun directive on Saturday.
