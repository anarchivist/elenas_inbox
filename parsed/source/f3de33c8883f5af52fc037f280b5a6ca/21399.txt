TEXT:
Word is that the ago bill negotiations are still on-going -- food safety
being stuck at $52 million of new money.  I've talked to Harkin's guy
(sponsor of the senate amendment) and    Weatherly at OMB to reinforce that
we shouldn't be satisfied with $52 million.  Folks say you should remind
Lew/Stein that the Senate voted for $66 million, (we had about $96 million
in our original),  and we should keep pushing at least for an additional
$14 million.
