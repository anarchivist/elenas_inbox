TEXT:

I understand that the judge in California granted the injunction
which will prevent Governor Wilson from denying prenatal care to
undocumented mothers on an expedited basis using emergency
regulation procedures.
The normal nonemergency procedures will take a number of months to
complete (perhaps 5-7 months is what I was told), although the
Governor may try to find other ways to shorten that process.
