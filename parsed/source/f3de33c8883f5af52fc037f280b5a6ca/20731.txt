TEXT:
I just spoke again with Barbara Chow.  She has asked Labor to draft a
letter in opposition to the Wyden/Graham bill (instead of this weak
statement). Barbara spoke with Martha, who agrees that a statement like
their earlier draft would encourage passage of the amendment.   Barbara
agrees that the letter should strongly oppose the legislation and, if it
is similar enough to the Smith bill, should threaten a veto.  Barbara also
thinks that we should try to get USDA to sign on to the letter.   I am
going to speak to David Carlen (Asst. Secy. for Congo Affairs).
