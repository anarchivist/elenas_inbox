TEXT:
Just learned that this is happening today.    We're still obviously not in
this loop. According to Ceci Rouse:

The farthest Alexis will go is to propose a 25% pilot, which would mean
Detroit and a few surrounding counties.   Biggest challenge is that GI
bill is ready to go, may be conference action this week, and they hope it
could be signed pre-recess.  So their goal is a meaningful enough
conversation with Engler that the Hill thinks we're credible and we want
to work it out. Alexis told Sweeney last night what she'll propose, and
he supposedly will try to carry some water on that.

Ceci says DOL is driving this more than NEC, which hasn't been that
involved in the mechanics.
