TEXT:.
According to DOT staff, there's a possibility that the First Lady may be
attending this event (Jen, this is when secretary Slater will be
announcing availability of the Job Access/Reverse Commute grants that we
fought hard for and were included in TEA-21.)   If HRC does attend, DOT
will make sure there are some former welfare recipients participating who
could introduce her.  We've suggested they go to united Airlines for local
success stories (W2W Partnership staff and United will be on one of the
panels) .  Sen. Mosley-Braun, Rep. Danny Davis, Mayor Dailey, and Cook
County Commissioner John Stroger are expected to participate.

Also, there's a rumor that Slater is considering naming the program for
Rosa Parks and Delores Juerta (sp?), so it would be something like the
Rosa Parks and Delores Juerta Job Access and Reverse Commute Grants
Program (try to get an acronym around that one!). There may be legal and
perception issues w/ this that DOT is ·still sorting out.
