TEXT:
Bruce/Elena,
FYI.  Michael Deich, Steve M. and David H. have been working on revised
projections in light of the INS's recent determination (as of the end of
last week) that their FY 1998 and FY 1999 naturalization application
receipts are down 46%. That translates into a 46% reduction in revenues
for those two years.  The Hispanic Caucus and the immigration advocacy
groups have been pressing for an additional appropriation of money for
naturalization. They are particularly upset in light of the expected fee
increase for naturalization (from $95 to $225) that INS will announce on
August 1st (to take effect October 1st) .

Steve M. is faxing me charts that explain (I) the current projections for
nats. backlog reduction (that were part of our FY 1999 budget); (2) INS's
projections with the old estimates; and (3) a revised plan (based on the
current application estimates) that includes the fee increase + shifting
some detention money ($60 million) to naturalization backlog reduction
(targeted to specific areas, consistent with the Coopers & Lybrand
audit). This $60 million is left over from FY 1998 and would otherwise
lapse into the FY1999 detention budget.

According to Steve M., Jack Lew wants to find some additional money (like
this $60 million) for naturalization backlog reduction. Lew wants to call
Congo Becerra this afternoon to discuss this issue. Becerra has stated
that he will support the fee increase (which he has opposed up until now)
if the Administration supports some kind of additional appropriation.
This $60 million may do the trick.  Doris is also scheduled to meet with
Becerra today or tomorrow.
