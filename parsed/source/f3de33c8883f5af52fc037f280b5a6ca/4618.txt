TEXT:
I had shared a draft of this memo with Andy Blocker earlier today asking
for input. As you can see from the attached, Andy has now shared it with
Hilley---not exactly what I had in mind.

I'm sending the draft of the memo in a separate e-mail.

I would like to review the memo before it's submitted to the President
