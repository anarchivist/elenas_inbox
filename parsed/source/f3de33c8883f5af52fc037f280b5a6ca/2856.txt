TEXT:
Doug Steiger from Moynihan's staff has sent me a few notes in the last two
days about his talks with Committee Democrats on FLSA.  Here they are, in
the order in which I received them:

[Yesterday he wrote:]

      At some point this week, we should have a chat about FLSA.       I think
my
     boss is (believe it or not) with the Administration on this issue,
     although I still need to confirm this.   If the Majority follows Ways
     and Means on this issue, my first thought is to try to strike the
     state option to include other benefits and concede the "not
employees"
     and TANF+food stamps calculation.   (I don't have a lot of confidence
I
      can get all the Dems to that position, let along going any further
but
     we haven't really talked it through yet.)     But I wouldn't be
surprised
     if you all want a pure motion to strike.

[I urged the pure strike option.    He replied:]

  You're right, and I'd prefer to"do what the House folks did.  I just
     don't know if the troops are willing to follow.  I suspect, but have
     no evidence, that the vote total gets one or two better with a
partial
     strike. But I'll know better within a day or two (I hope).

[And today he said:]

I think we won't be able to hold Graham on FLSA.  Causes too much
     trouble for Florida and, well, he used to be a governor you know. As
     for others, I'm spending more time explaining the issue to staff than
     getting a response as to where their bosses are at.  I'm sure you had
     that experience with a few issues last year.
