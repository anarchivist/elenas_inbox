      TEXT:
      I have used the DPC policy teams as the basic structure to assign
      individuals on my Policy Planning and Research staff to different policy
      areas as follows:

      Education - David Campt and Scott Palmer
      Economic Opportunities (including housing)   - John Goering and Ana Lopez
      Health - David Campt
      Administration of Justice - John Goering
f.



      These are preliminary assignments but I think it will help us get
      started.  Please include me in the various subgroup meetings for the time
      being so that I can get a broad sense of where we are going.   But I will
      generally depend on our staff here for more detailed feedback.   Thanks.
      We are all looking forward to working with you on these issues.
