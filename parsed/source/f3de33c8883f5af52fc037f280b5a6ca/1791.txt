TEXT:
Janet Murguia says that Rep. Gutierrez, who is the Hispanic Caucus' point
person on welfare reform, will push the President on Wednesday to give a
speech or do an event regarding restoring benefits to legal immigrants.
He has introduced a bill of his own which reinstates all benefits and has
asked the White House for our language so he can compare our plan with
his.

Our current plan is to hold our language.
