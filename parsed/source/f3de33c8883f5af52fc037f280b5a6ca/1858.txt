TEXT:
This is from Mark Kleiman at the UCLA Public Policy School.  He used to be
at the Kennedy School.  He has been extremely helpful to us over the years
on drug issues and ideas and this looks like it could be a helpful forum.
I sent it to Rahm, too.

Subject: Briefing

Dennis:

         The Drugs and Addictions Working Group at Harvard delivered a
half-day
briefing for
Gen. McCaffrey and some of his staff just before he took office last year.
He seems· to have
found it useful.

        I would like to offer a similar briefing to Rahm Emmanuel and
anyone else
you and he
think might be interested.  The topics could be shaped to fit the interests
of those attending,
but we would plan to cover the underlying logic of drug policy, the values
and limits of the
main instruments (enforcement, treatment, and prevention), an overview of
the budget and the
issues around shifting it, and a few hot current topics (coerced
abstinence,
violence-minimizing
enforcement, medical marijuana, drug treatment in the managed-care
environment) .

           Our group includes Mark Moore (Kennedy School), Howard Shaffer


 (director of
 the
 Division on Addictions at Harvard Medical School), Peter Reuter
 (RAND/Maryland), Jonathan Caulkins
 (RAND/Carnegie-Mellon), will Brownsburger (Massachusetts Assistant AG) and
·Phil Heymann.
 Who actually would do the briefing would depend on the topics selected and
 the timing.
 If we wanted to expand the subject to include youth violence, David Kennedy
 could join us.

         The group currently plans to meet in New York Friday May 2nd and
Saturday
morning May 3rd.
We could easily mount a show for anyone who wanted to corne to New York on
the afternoon of the 3rd,
and have them back in DC in time for dinner. Other dates could be
negotiated. My sense is that
either New York or Boston is better than Washington in terms of getting the
undivided attention
of the sort of people we want to brief.

        Let me know how you want to proceed.


Mark
