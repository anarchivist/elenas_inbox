    TEXT:
            Knowing that things change -- I thought it would be good to try to
    tie down the policy aspects of the discussion.  I think this is where we
    are:

    24th Guns -- if the issue is not dead, POTUS does a departure statement
    and releases it early --DPC lead

    25th EO to be issued at Empowerment Zone Conference-- NEC has the lead on
    this one

    1st     FTC Study -- DPC has the lead

    3rd    Cabinet Mtg wi pool spray -- Todd Stern's EO -- Stephanie to figure
    out time -- Goody/Kris we will need an agenda for the meeting -- Todd you
    have the lead on the Exec Order

    4th -- Disability Awards (possible if 99 recipients have been chosen)
    Streett following up--also Kennedy Jeffords venue-- DPC

    5th -- radio addre
