Message Creation Date was at 20-MAR-1997 20:27:00

TO:   DIRECTOR FRANK RAINES
  DEPUTY DIRECTOR JACK LEW
  DEPUTY DIRECTOR JOHN KOSKINEN

FROM: OMB LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS

DATE: MARCH 20, 1997

SUBJECT:   LEGISLATIVE REPORT


Late this afternoon Sen. Domenici, as expected, introduced two budget
resolutions, which were then referred to the Budget Committee.  Under Senate
precedents, however, the budget resolutions will automatically be discharged
from the Committee following the recess, since the Committee will have missed
the statutory April 1 deadline for reporting a resolution.

The two resolutions are: (l) the PresidentD,s budget as reestimated by CSO; and
(2) a budget resolution, based on CBO economics, which includes the
PresidentD,s mandatory savings; a defense path similar to the PresidentD,s
request; no net tax reductions; $183 billion in NDD cuts (which Domenici said
would amount to 20 percent cuts, if applied across the board); no new spending
initiatives, but addbacks would be triggered if the economy performs better
than CBO now predicts.

Domenici made clear in his floor statement that the second plan is not "his
plan" and is not "the Republican plan," but said he would be forced to vote for
the plan if progress is not made over the next few weeks.   He said he hopes
that neither of these resolutions will have to be considered, and he remains
hopeful that a budget agreement can be reached.


On Friday, 3/21, oral arguments on the line item veto case will take place in
the US District Court.
