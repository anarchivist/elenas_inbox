TEXT:
Bruce -- Christa left you a message saying Craig Smith will probably
oppose our
bid to have the President speak to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce because of
their
position on fast track.  It would be very helpful if you could call Craig
before the 2:00
scheduling meeting.  I'm puzzled, because the Chamber's web site makes
their fast
track position sound an awful lot like ours -- am I missing something?

                  TOp '98 Legislative Issues for
                                            Business:

                           Tax Relief, Health Care, Fast Track
                                         Trade Authority

                  When Congress reconvenes the last week of January 1998, the
U.S.
                          Chamber will be advocating the following
pro-business agenda,
                          among other issues:

                          Renewal of Fast Track Negotiating Authority 0) This
authority,
                          given to every President for two decades, allows
the President to
                          work in close collaboration with Congress and to
negotiate market
                          opening agreements for U.S. goods and services
around the world.
                          Without Fast Track, the United States remains on
the sidelines, as
                          countries negotiate trade deals that leave American
companies and
                       their workers locked out of the worldO,s
fastest-growing markets. The


                         U.S. Senate supported Fast Track legislation by a
wide margin this
                         fall   (69-31). Unfortunately, a vote did not occur
in the House, where
                         the President was only able to muster 44 Democrat
supporters to go
                         along with more than 165 Republicans who supported
Fast Track.
                         The President asked House congressional leaders to
delay the vote
                         until he could have more time to build Democratic
support for the bill.
                         Congressional leaders have indicated that mid-March
is the most
                         likely timetable for a vote. Meanwhile, organized 1
abor leaders are
                         seeking to include their own agenda within Fast
Track legislation. The
                         U.S. Chamber will continue to provide strong
support for a "clean"
                         Fast Track bill that expands U.S. exports -- which
are responsible, in
                         large measure, for the current U.S. economic
expansion. Fully
                         one-third of the growth in the U.S. economy over
the past year has
                         come from a substantial increase in U.S. exports to
the world,
                         primarily to nations within our own hemisphere.
