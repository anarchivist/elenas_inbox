Subject: NYT: Giuliani Proposes Bill to Broaden Rights of Unmarried Coup

New York Times, May 12, 1998

Giuliani Proposes Bill to Broaden Rights of Unmarried Couples
By DAN BARRY
       NEW YORK -- Mayor Rudolph Giuliani proposed legislation on Monday that
would require the city's government to treat unmarried couples the same as
those who are married, allowing them to continue as tenants in apartments
leased to their partners and insuring their rights to be buried together
in a
city-owned cemetery.
       The mayor forwarded the legislative proposal late on Monday afternoon
to
the City Council, where the measure will be sponsored by Peter Vallone, the
council speaker. With Vallone's support, the proposal is virtually certain
to
pass.
       Giuliani's proposal, which fulfills a campaign promise he made to gay
rights advocates last year, would give New York City one of the nation's
broadest set of policies regarding domestic partnerships.
       It would enshrine into city law the initiatives relating to domestic
partnerships begun by Mayors David Dinkins and Edward Koch, Giuliani's two
immediate predecessors. Those initiatives included granting bereavement
leaves
for city employees and visitation rights in city-owned hospitals.
       The mayor's proposal would also obligate the city to give registered
domestic partners the same benefits as spouses under the city'S future
collective bargaining agreements and would allow the mayor to provide "Good
Samaritan" awards to the domestic partners of uniformed city employees who
are
killed in the line of duty.
      One gay-rights organization said that the law, which would apply to
heterosexual and homosexual domestic partnerships registered with the city


clerk, would provide greater recognition of the emotional and practical
import
of same-sex relationships.
      "It would be a psychological and emotional affirmation of our
relationships," said Matt Foreman, the director of the Empire State Pride
Agenda, a gay-rights organization that had worked with the Giuliani
administration in drafting the language of the legislation.
      The mayor has already quietly begun to change the rules and
regulations
of city agencies to insure equal treatment for registered domestic
partners.
For example, the partners of city employees will have the right to be
buried
with them in the city-owned Canarsie Cemetery in Brooklyn -- a right
previously given only to spouses. And, like spouses, registered partners
will
also be able to represent their companions in challenging tax bills.
      The sweeping proposals come at a time when Giuliani is trying to raise
his profile as a potential Republican candidate for higher office. In
recent
weeks he has traveled to Michigan, New Mexico and Arizona to speak to rock-
solid Republicans about the strides he has made in reducing crime and
cutting
budgets -- but not about his efforts in behalf of gays and lesbians in New
York City.
      On Monday, several Republican leaders around the country said that
they
were baffled by his proposal. A few said that it reinforced the perception
that the mayor is too liberal for the generally conservative Republicans
who
participate in the party's presidential primaries.
      "You ask the average Republican on the street who would sponsor that
kind
of bill, and 99 percent would say a Democrat," said Chris Baker, the
executive
director of the Colorado Republican Party. "For lack of a better term,
it's a
very Northeastern Republican bill," he added. "Imagine him trying to
campaign
on that kind of legislation down in Alabama. It won't work."
      Randy Mastro, the deputy mayor of operations, declined to discuss the
national political implications of the proposal. But he emphasized that the
measure would also benefit heterosexual couples. According to city
statistics,
of the 8,700 unmarried couples that have registered with the city clerk's
office since 1992, more than 55 percent are heterosexual.
      Mastro said that in submitting the proposal, Giuliani was merely
honoring
a commitment he made to the Pride Agenda and other gay-rights
organizations to
fight for legislation that would insure equal treatment by the city of
registered domestic partners. That commitment came in mid-October, three
weeks
before his re-election.
      "What we have done is propose legislatiol1 tailored to address those
issues and to provide the same rights, obligations and .benefits to
registered
domestic partners under the local law as those provided to spouses," Mastro
said.
