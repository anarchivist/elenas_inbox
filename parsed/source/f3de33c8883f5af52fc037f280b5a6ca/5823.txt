TEXT:
Good Housekeeping magazine, as you may recall, is interested in
associating themselves with one of the President's'major goals:     new ways
to reconcile work and family.

After a few discussions and letters, Jurate Kaczikas from GH says they are
interested specifically in endorsing a Presidential call to expand the
Family and Medical Leave Act to ensure that families can take up to 24
hours of unpaid leave for school visits, children's doctor appointments,
and elderly care. To illustrate this point, GH is going to propose "Daddy
Goes to School Week", an idea based on "Take your Daughter to Work Day" in
which fathers would be encouraged to visit their kids' schools.

I think the extended FMLA is a big winner for us, and we ought to take GH
up on their offer of support and assistance. The Good Housekeeping Seal
of Approval: is something that can only help -- and make it harder for a
Republican Congress to kill this proposal.

Jurate would like GH to host a luncheon with about 30 corporate execs in
which they would express support for this policy. GH would also like the
President to promote the extended FMLA and the Daddy Goes to School Week
in a radio address.

What do you think?   How should we proceed?
