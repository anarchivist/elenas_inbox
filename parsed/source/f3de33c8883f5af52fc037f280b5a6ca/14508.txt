Bruce, Rahm, Elena,

Eli asked me to draft some SOTU language for the corporate welfare to work
entity -- I've attached it.  Eli saw it last night and is very happy with
it. Right now, he'd like to move ahead with the announcement, providing
we can work out the CEO politics and leadership.

Bruce and Rahm -- I think you need to talk to Cheri about the CEOs as soon
as possible.

Eli asked me to go back to Cheryl Mills and find out legally how specific
the President can be about this new entity. Can he actually call for a
501 c 3? Can he actually appoint Eli--or what.   I'll let you know.

Please let me know if you want me to rework/change the attached draft
language.==================== ATTACHMENT   1 ====================

As many of you know, I have worked for nearly a decade to reform this country's welfare
system. As Governor of Arkansas and Chairman of the National Governors Association, I was
committed to reforming welfare. Over the past four years as President, I have worked tirelessly
to improve the lives of the millions of families stuck in poverty with no way out.

Then, last August, I was given the opportunity to sign a far reaching set of reforms that I believe
offers those on welfare the opportunity to improve their lives and the lives of their children. I
signed that legislation because I believe in my heart that it will make a positive difference in the
lives of millions. I am publicly and personally committed to ensuring its success.

But I can't do it alone. That is why last summer I challenged all of you to help me move at least
1 million recipients off the welfare rolls by the year 2002. Again, I challenge you -- help me
move 1 million welfare recipients into work. I call on religious organizations, community
organizations, educational institutions, state government, neighborhood organizations, and others
to rise to the challenge I have laid before you. And again, I call on the business community to
step forward. As much as someone on welfare wants to work and as hard as she might try to
find employment, if we don't offer jobs, our effort will fail.

Just a few weeks ago, I met with 14 CEOs committed to meeting my challenge.' They and
other CEOs pledged to hire welfare recipients and to use their leadership and profits to
encourage others to do the same. And for these committed CEOs, there are thousands more I
have heard from. I am heartened by this resurgence in corporate responsibility and corporate
citizenship. But while these corporations are giving, they are getting back too. They have
pledged to hire motivated, hard working individuals who ask only for a chance to succeed.
These corporations know this. That is why they are involved.

And that is why I am thrilled to announce that XXX, XXX, and XXX, who are sitting in the
audience tonight with the First Lady, have agreed to lead a corporate effort to help meet my
challenge. Along with a dear and trusted friend of mine and the former head of the Corporation
for National Service, Eli Segal, they will mobilize the business community to help put 1 million
welfare recipients to work.

Some corporations will directly hire welfare recipients. Others, who may not have available
jobs, will encourage and motivate different businesses to hire. Still others might fund specific
programs, offer leadership, call on contacts, or recruit other corporations and their employees to
the effort.

But whatever their role, of one thing I am sure. If every one of you watching and listening
tonight pledges in some way to help those who simply need a chance, we will far surpass the
challenge to move 1 million welfare recipients to work. We will have met a more profound
challenge: that of community and spirituality spread nationwide.
