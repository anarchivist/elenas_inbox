TEXT:
I understand that you were frustrated yesterday when you were not provided
with the President's event briefing for the VP's Family Conference until
9:30 pm.  I don't blame you, that is simply too late. However, if anyone
is to blame, it is me, not Christa.  Let me explain:

At 3:00 o'clock yesterday, I got a frantic call from Christa asking me to
go to the scheduling meeting in Erskine's office.  I had thought you were
going to attend (Cathy told me that was the plan earlier in the day), but
Christa advised me that your meeting was running late.  Christa also told
me that she needed to be on a conference call at 3:00 to speak with Nancy
Hoyt about the VP's conference. Unfortunately, I had just sat down with
Julie Fernandes to begin interviewing her for the race position, and felt
that I couldn't ask her to wait 50 minutes after she had just arrived in
my office. So I told Christa to get on the conference call for 15 minutes
and then head for the scheduling meeting.  Unfortunately, Nancy was not on
the conference call and Christa then had to run to the scheduling.  She
then tried to reach Nancy all day, who never returned her calls, until
8:30.

Looking back at this, I should have asked Julie to come back in an hour.
But I did have concerns that it would be unfair to her and
unprofessional. Of course, it also would have helped if Nancy Hoyt and
the VP's staff had been responsive to Christa and understood that the
President needed this information at a decent time.

Again, sorry for the delay.
