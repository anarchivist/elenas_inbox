TEXT:
The Higher Education Act you recently signed includes a new program to
help states strengthen teacher certification requirements and help school
districts and colleges work together to recruit and better prepare new
teachers, particularly for high poverty schools. However, funding for
scholarships to help recruit teachers is limited to 10% of the total
progam funding, so it will be limited in its overall impact.
