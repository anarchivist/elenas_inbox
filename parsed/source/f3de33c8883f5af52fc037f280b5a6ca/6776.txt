TEXT:
Turns out that Janet Murguia pushed for the delay in sending the Unz memo
to POTUS--after she heard from Becerra who (1) knew we were sending a memo
to POTUS; (2) was ticked off at the prospect of it going before we
consulted with him; and, (3) warne<;i against a 3-year deadline for learning
English.

I met with the Council of Great City Schools earlier today (big city
superintendents and school board members--including a number·of California
districts). The Council passed a unanimous resolution yesterday opposing
Unz, and I got a number of questions and comments on Unz. One of the
school board members urged us not to set a 3.year deadline for learning
English.

I know I should be surprised, but I'm actually shocked that Becerra and a
Cal. school board member know so much about what we're doing.   It's nice
to know that you can fully trust everyone you work with!
