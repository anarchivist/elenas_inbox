TEXT:
As part of Bruce and Jack's deal regarding how to reward high performance
in the DOL WtW program, we agreed to reward only unsubsidized employment,
defined as employment not subsidized by WtW funds (Bruce's reply to Jack,
copied below, even made that distinction).  See note below for why we
thought it made sense to include jobs subsidized by TANF or other funds.
OMB staff say DOL staff say Kitty Higgins is furious about this decision,
and may call one of you to protest.  It appears Jack may not have been
aware of the distinction when he agreed to the deal, and his staff is
siding with DOL.   Everything else has been agreed to.

I suggest we wait to see if Kitty really does call or if they're just
bluffing. Alternatively, we could cave.

We think it's very clear from Bruce's note to Jack that the agreement to
reward unsubsidized employment excluded only wage subsidies paid with WTW
funds.  Following our July 2nd meeting with agencies, we never had any
reason to believe that subsidies paid with non-WTW funds were even an
issuue. At that meeting, we questioned how a WTW agency would be able to
track subsidies paid by non-WTW funds and DOL said they envisioned only
excluding subsidies paid with WTW funds.   We are willing to hold the PICs
responsible for knowing whether or not they are paying a subsidy; it gets
much more complicated to expect them to know if someone is getting a wage
subsidy from another source, i.e. what counts, for what period, and what
happens if status changes from subsidized to unsubsidized in the middle of

I think your offer makes a lot of sense.  We'll go along with your
proposal to reward unsubsidized employment (i.e., exclude wage subsidies
and OJT paid with WTW funds), if you go along with setting the threshold
for the 2nd job entry measure at 30 hours, not 20; and the overall
weighting at 60% job entry (40% job entry, 20% substantial job entry) and
40% retention/earnings gain (25% retention, 15% earnings gain) .

Thanks for resolving this.   We'll calIon you to settle the next baseball
strike.
