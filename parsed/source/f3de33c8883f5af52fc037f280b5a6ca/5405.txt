TEXT:
Just before Thanksgiving, I attended a meeting at DOL to give them
feedback on their draft Welfare to Work Competitive Grant application.   I
should have a revised version soon, which I will want to share with you.
Keep in mind that the application, and the August '96-August '97 caseload
numbers, should both be ready to release this month (the caseload numbers
could be held, of course.)
