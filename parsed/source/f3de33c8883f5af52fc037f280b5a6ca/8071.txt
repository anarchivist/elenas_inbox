PRESIDENT WILLIAM J . CLINTON"
REMARKS ON THE EQUAL PAY ACT
THE ROSE GARDEN
June 10, 1998

 Acknowledgements: The First Lady; Rep.     [TBD); Sen. Boxer; VPOTUS and Mrs.
Gore; Dorothy Height

 I want to begin by saying how pleased I am that Dorothy Height is able to
join us this afternoon.   For six decades now, Dorothy Height has worked
tirelessly for civil rights, the rights of women, and the health and
strength of AmericaD, s families and communi ties. I was honored to present
her with the Presidential Medal of Freedom four years ago, and we are
equally honored by her presence here today.

 America has come a long way in the thirty-five years since Dorothy Height
attended the signing of the Equal Pay Act.   Just last week we learned that
the American economy, the strongest in a generation, has created 16
million new jobs in the last five years.   Unemployment is low, wages are
high.  ThatD,s good news for men and women.   The rising tide of our
surging economy is, indeed, lifting all boats.

 Equal pay has come a long way in thirty-five years.      At that historic


bill signing, President Kennedy said that the Equal Pay Act is D&basic to
democracyD8 -- giving women D&the same rights at the working place.
that they have enjoyed at the polling place.D8

 Back then, women earned only 59 cents, on average, for every dollar men
earned. Today, I am releasing a report by the Council.ofEconomic
Advisers showing that the gender gap in wages has narrowed considerably.
Women now earn 75 cents for every dollar men earn.

 The new numbers represent a significant step forward.  But we are still
miles from completing the journey.  It has taken us longer to get women
three-quarters of the way to equal pay than it did to send a man all the
way to the moon.

 The CEA study shows that the gender gap continues to narrow; but also
that it will not close of its own accord.  There are many reasons for
this, despite womenD,s gains in education and experience.  Today I am also
releasing a Labor Department review that paints a historical picture of
womenD,s employment, showing obstacles overcome and challenges remaining.
Balancing family and work is one of those challenges for many women.   But
we cannot forget another important factor in the wage gap:  discrimination.
  Even with the economy booming and real wages rising, there are many
women whose work is not being fully valued by employers.

 Equal pay is not a political issue.  It is not even a gender issue.   It
is, at heart, a national issue, a family issue, and a question of what
kind of country we want America to be today and in the 21st century, when
our daughters will grow up and enter the workplace·.

 That is why our administration is working hard to close the wage gap, as
the Vice President explained. And that is why, today, I am personally
endorsing the equal pay measure introduced by Senator Daschle and
Congresswoman DeLauro. This legislation would strengthen enforcement of
the Equal Pay Act, toughening penalties and making wage discrimination
based on gender as costly as wage discrimination based on race.   It would
also ensure that women who face wage discrimination are fully
compensated. This legislation is tough, it is fair, and Congress should
pass it today.

 Americans have always believed in the value of work -- that anyone who
works hard should be able to provide for themselves and their family with
dignity.  More women than ever now have that chance.   But 75 cents on the
dollar is not enough -- for women, for families, or for America.    As our
nation moves forward into the 21st century, we must make sure that our age
of opportunity will not be remembered for opportunities lost.    If we meet
this challenge, if we value the contributions of· all AmericaD, s workers,
then we will be a more productive, prosperous and proud nation in the 21st
century.
