TEXT:
Thursday afternoon we will have another DPC-OMB-HHS meeting in Sally
Katzen's office (time to be arranged).  The game plan is for us to have
settled as many issues as possible by then, and have DPC-HHS-OMB
agreed-upon paper about the issues to elevate.

This Thursday meeting will be followed shortly by a Reed-Shalala meeting.
