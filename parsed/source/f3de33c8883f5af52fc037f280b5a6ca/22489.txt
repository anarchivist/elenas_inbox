Thank you for sharing your views about immigration.

Our nation was built on the dreams and deeds of immigrants. The life
of our country has been continually renewed and enriched by the many
different people who choose to come here and become our fellow
citizens.  Each immigrant brings a part of his or her own heritage,
which over time becomes part of our common heritage.  It is of great
importance for the future of our country that we expand that common
ground, focusing more on what unites us than on what divides us.

Our new immigrants are revitalizing our cities, energizing our
culture, and building up our economy. We have a responsibility to
make them welcome here and they also have a responsibility to enter
the mainstream of American life and contribute toward making our
country a better place to live for all of its people.   That includes
learning English and learning about our democratic system of .
government. We must continue to recognize anew that working together
in a spirit of community is not a hope but a necessity, that our
individual dreams can only be realized by our shared efforts.

The abundant gifts of America's immigrants have helped make our
country strong, and I encourage each of you to maintain and advance
this important legacy.

Sincerely,

BC
