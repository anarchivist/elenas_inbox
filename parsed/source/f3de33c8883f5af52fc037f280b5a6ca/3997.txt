I did talk to Pat about USDA's plans and thoght they were definitely .on
the right track because:
      if we have information that can prevent children going hungry, we
should do what we can to make that information available;
       we should not avoid talking about the issue because we did not try
to change legislation; -- it is appropriate for the administration to
address issues and get out useful information on a wide variety of issues,
and we cannot possibly be active legislatively on all of them.;
       if we do not use a variety of means to get the word out, the result
could be not getting information to families who can use it. (I guess this
is the same as the first point but I mean that they should not be
penalized further -)
