                                                                              Automated Records Management System
                                 STATEMENT BY THE PRESIDENT                           Hex-Dump Conversion

            I am pleased that the Sentencing Commission has moved forward with recommendations
     to Congress to reduce the disparity between crack and powder cocaine penalties. My
     Administration will seriously review these recommendations and give them due consideration.

            In October 1995, I signed legislation disapproving the Sentencing Commission's
     recommendation to equalize penalties for crack and powder cocaine distribution by dramatically
     reducing the penalties for crack. I' believe it was the wrong approach then, and would be the
     wrong approach now.

             Current law does require a substantial disparity between sentences for crack as compared
     to equal amounts of powder cocaine. I have stated before that some adjustment to these
     penalties is warranted. That is why the legislation I signed directed the Sentencing Commission
     to undertake additional review of these issues and to report back with new recommendations.

             Any revision to the sentencing laws must continue to reflect that crack cocaine is a more
     harmful form of cocaine. Trafficking in crack, and the violence it fosters, has a devastating
     impact on communities across America, especially inner-city communities. Any change in
     penalties must not send the wrong message to drug dealers or our children.

            I am also looking forward to the Sentencing Commission's recommendations on my
     methamphetamine legislation which I signed into law last year. This law asked the Commission
     to toughen penalties on this emerging drug to prevent the kind of epidemic we saw in the 1980's
     with cocaine use.

            My Administration has fought to stop drug abuse and its destructive consequences.
     Overall, drug use in the United States has fallen dramatically-- by half in 15 years. And cocaine
     use has dramatically decreased since the high point in .1985-- the number of current cocaine users
     is down by 74% over the last decade. While these are encouraging figures, I am committed to
     doing more to continue to bring drug use down further - - particularly among our children.

          I have asked Director McCaffrey and Attorney General Reno to review the Sentencing
     Commission's recommendations to Congress and to report back to me in 30 days.
