      TEXT:
      A House Democrat told me Shaw's staff thinks they can get bipartisan
      support from governors on a proposal that:

              1) The workfare paycheck would come not from the employer but from
      the welfare
                      agency. (Diana's asking DOL if this is a problem. Without
      the language, which
                      we do not have, we may not be able to tell.)
              2) The work rates would be weakened. Low benefit states could
      require fewer than
                      20 hours of real work (people would have to work only as
      many hours as
                      benefits divided by the minimum wage) and job search, etc.
      could be used to fill
                      the gap. Also, a state "retaining" child support payments
      could not require a
                      parent to work for those benefits, thus allowing states to
      lower work rates below
 ·

               the currently required 20 hours for those families.
       3) FICA and FUTA would not apply.

They expect to hear back from the governors on Wednesday.

If they get bipartisan support, they plan to have a full celebration
(committee hearing, press conference, subcommittee and full committee
markups) and have it pass on the suspesion calendar in the House.
