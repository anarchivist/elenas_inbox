Bruce I agree,    we should include Sandy.    Please invite her.

That sounds like a good plan on needle exchange, will you please ask Elena
to include me in the deputies meeting.  Thanks.

Sandy would like to attend the 7:45 a.m. mtgs in the Roosevelt Room. The
women's office, the drug office, and other satellite operations all send
reps -- and it would be a good way for her to get to know more folks
around here.

Does that sound OK to you?

By the way, now that Satcher is confirmed, we're starting a decision
process on needle exchange. Elena is calling a deputies meeting next
week.  I suspect there will be quite a gap between McCaffrey and Shalala
on this one, but we'll develop a range of options and do our best to keep
it quiet.
