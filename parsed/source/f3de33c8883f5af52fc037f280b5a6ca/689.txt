Do we need to clear the five corporations to be mentioned in the State of
the Union with labor? They cleared on the list for the last meeting with
POTUS via Gene's call to Jerry Shea .. is that sufficient clearance since no
new names will be mentioned?

My understanding is that the five corporations will be United, UPS, Burger
King, Spring and Monsanto.

Gene, Rahm and Bruce please advise asap.      If call is necessary will Gene
make that call?
