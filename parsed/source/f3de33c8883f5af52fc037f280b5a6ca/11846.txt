    TEXT:
    Folks, OA is on an absolute rampage about logging and turning off
    computers. Do not, do not, underestimate their anger, powertripping, and
    their willingness to punish those who do not obey their commands.  r know
    we have all experienced this wrath.  So let me strongly encourage you to
    make certain you turn and log off your computer EVERY night.

     Don't mess up.   I can't help you if you get in trouble on this one folks.
