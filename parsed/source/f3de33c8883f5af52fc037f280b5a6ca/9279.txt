TEXT:
Elena/Sally:
Contrary to what we were told by the USDA, John Fraser at the DOL says
that he is not sure that the MSPA requires the payment of 100% of the
contract wage.   Labor was at the meeting when USDA asserted this (and we
all discussed it), but they now question whether this is a statutory
requirement.   John is checking on this.

What is clearly true is that a U.S. worker who has a work contract that is
broken (b/c promised 8 wks of work, but provided with only 5 wks) could
bring an action against the employer for breach.  This option is less
possible for migrant workers.
