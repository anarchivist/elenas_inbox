TEXT:
Governor Davis' DC office has requested a briefing on ESEA this coming
Monday, and Fred Duvall asked if I would do a briefing for them.  Tanya
and I are happy to do a briefing for them, but we would welcome your
guidance on this.  Would one of you like to lead the briefing and/or
should we try to get Mike Cohen to do it?

This is particularly important because Davis might consider endorsing our
general approach to ESEA, if not necessarily all of the specifics.   By
coincidence he is in town 5/6 (the same day that ESEA is tentatively
scheduled for) currently planning to do a short meeting and statement with
the VP and Riley announcing some Obey-Porter $ for California.   If ESEA is
announced that day, we could try get Davis to speak at the signing
ceremony or at least turn the Gore-Davis-Riley statement into a statement
of Davis support for ESEA.                              .
