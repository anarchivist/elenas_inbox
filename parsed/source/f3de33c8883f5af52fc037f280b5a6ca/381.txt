Elena -
thank you for your quick response. Diane Blackmun appears to be
the main person we need to talk with to help us understand the
approach that SSA sets out in the POMS.  Unforturnately she is not
available Friday through next Wednesday.  So I wanted to see if
you might be able to squeeze in some time tomorrow for this.
Sorry if this causes problems for you -- Diane can meet at anytime
Thursday that might work for you.  What do you think?
