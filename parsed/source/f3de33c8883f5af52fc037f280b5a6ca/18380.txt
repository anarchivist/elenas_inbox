This is a Q and A on tobacco tax:   1.  I've added an opening question on
whether we'll introduce a Clinton bill and a last question about states'
being entitled to the money; 2.   the middle two questions are the same as
the one's I sent before-- but I don't have Elena's edits of what she sent
in. Regards, Tom==================== ATTACHMENT    1 ====================

Q. What progress has been made in getting comprehensive tobacco legislation enacted? Will
the Administration introduce its own tobacco bill?

A. We are making very solid progress towards enacting comprehensive tobacco legislation.
The leadership of both the House and Senate has been working diligently in drafting bills, and
we've discussed directly with them how important this issue is, and how it should be a
bi-partisan effort. I'm looking forward to working with Congress and passing and signing a bill
in the first part of this year. I announced in September the five key elements that I think are
essential to a comprehensive bill, and I look forward to continuing to work with Congress as we
craft a bi-partisan bill that helps reduce teen smoking in America.




Q. Will your upcoming proposed budget rely on revenues raised from a tax on tobacco products,
and if so how much money do you believe can be raised in this manner?

A. I have said consistently that there needs to be comprehensive tobacco legislation with the
primary goal of reducing teen smoking. We are making good progress in that direction. As part
of that comprehensive approach, I have called for a combination of industry payments and
penalties to increase the price of cigarettes by up to $1.50 over the next decade, as necessary to
meet youth smoking reduction targets. These revenues need not be a tax, and reports that indicate
that has been decided are wrong. I think it is fair to say that comprehensive tobacco legislation
should raise some revenue and that we will assume some revenues from it in our upcoming
budget.


Q. Are the revenue estimates reported in the Wall Street Journal accurate, suggesting that a
tobacco tax would raise $10 billion for your FY '99 budget and $40 to $60 billion over five
years?

A. I won't comment on particular numbers that may still be in the drafting stage. The budget is
not finalized and obviously hasn't been released. The projected revenues we use for the budget
will be consistent with what I have called for in the past. I've said there should be a
combination of industry payments and penalties to increase the price of cigarettes by up to $1.50
over the next decade, as necessary to meet youth smoking reduction targets of 30% in 5 years,
50% in 7 years, and 60% in 10 years.


Q. There are various reports about how much money will go from the tobacco legislation to the
states, and what right the federal government has to this money. What do you think the states
are entitled to?
most of this historic opportunity to reduce teen smoking. There is some existing law on the
allocation issue, but I think the best way to allocate tobacco funds between the federal and state
government is through legislation, and I am looking forward to finding a mutually agreeable
purpose for the funds generated by tobacco legislation. It is a question we will be able to work
out in Congress.
