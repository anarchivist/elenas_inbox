TEXT:
Olivia Golden sent over a list of child care ideas. One looked
prom1s1ng:  she referred to emerging congressional proposals to provide
tax relief for businesses that invest in child care. What is this?

Can you also find out what a significant expansion of child care might
cost, either thru refundability of the DCTC or some other means?
