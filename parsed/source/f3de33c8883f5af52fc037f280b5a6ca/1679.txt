We should allow a TODAY SHOW anchor, Katie Couric or Matt Lauer, to spend part of Sunday
morning April 27 with POTUS and/or FLOTDS and Chelsea as they participate in Philadelphia
service event. TODA Y anchor could interview POTUS on service as anchor and First Family
work together on a service project. (This proposal is subject to review by OFL)

GOOD MORNING AMERICA (ABC)
A live interview on Monday morning with Charlie Gibson regarding national service.

NIGHTLY NEWS (NBC)
Pre-tape an "In Their Own Words" segment. This would give POTUS opportunity to discuss his
concept of National Service in his own words.

CBS EVENING NEWS WITH DAN RATHER
If Rather is on-location in Philadelphia, we should offer him an interview.

WORLD NEWS TONIGHT (ABC)
If Jennings is on-location in Philadelphia, we should offer him an interview.

NBCIMSNBC TOWN HALL_
NBC & MSNBC are proposing ajoint two-hour TOWN HALL meeting on service on Monday
evening. NBC has made no broadcast commitment yet, but the producers are talking about one
hour on NBC & MSNBC and an additional hour on MSNBC. Producers are extending invitations
to President Bush and Gen Powell. Producers are also proposing participation by Bill Moyers,
Tim Russert and Tom Brokaw. They also intimated possible participation by Gwen Ifill.
Producers would make tape of TOWN HALL available to TODAY SHOW for Tuesday as well
as to DATELINE.

RECOMMENDA nON:
We recommend extending President's participation, if NBC broadcasts the TOWN
HALL. If MSNBC is the only venue, we recommend taking a pass ..
