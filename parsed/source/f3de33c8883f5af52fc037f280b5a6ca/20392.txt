PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
RADIO ADDRESS ON PROSTATE CANCER
JUNE 20. 1998

        Good morning.  Tomorrow is FatherD,s Day, the day we pay tribute
to the irreplaceable role fathers play throughout our childrenD,s lives.
There is no greater responsibility -- and there is no greater reward
than ra~s~ng a child.   For me, no job, not even the presidency, has been
more important than being a father.



        I want to talk to you today what we are   doing to protect our
fathers, our grandfathers, and all men from one   of the greatest health
threats they face: prostate cancer. This year,    nearly 200,000 people will
be diagnosed with prostate cancer -- and 40,000   will die from it.  In
fact, every year, as many men die from prostate   cancer as women die from b
reast cancer.

        For far too long, too little was known about prostate cancer. Too
little was said about it, out of embarrassment and fear.  Because of this,
too little was done about it, as precious research dollars were spent on
other problems.

        For five years now, we have worked hard to increase public
awareness about prostate cancer -- and to find a cure.   Since I first took
office, we have increased funding for prostate cancer research at the
National Institutes of Health by 100%. This year alone, we are funding
more than 450 critically important research projects on prostate cancer,
ranging from prevention to detection to treatment.    Last year, scientists
at the Human Genome project and Johns Hopkins University located the first
gene known to predispose men to prostate cancer.   Prostate cancer is th~
first disease being studied by the Cancer Genome Anatomy Project, a very
exciting new program we recently launched at the NCI. We are closing in
on this silent killer.

        But as far as we have come, we know that many questions about
prostate cancer remain unanswered.   We do not fully understand the role
of environmental and dietary factors in prostate cancer. We do not fully
understand why the disease progresses at such varying rates in different
men.   We do not yet know why prostate cancer disproportionately affects
African American men. And we do not yet know how to eliminate the risks
of treatment for prostate cancer that discourage too many men from seeing
their doctors.

        The only way we will ever answer these questions -- and the only
way we will ever beat prostate cancer -- is by continuing to invest in
research.  Today, I am pleased to announce that the Department of Defense
is awarding $60 Million in grants to some of the most promising research
projects in the country. These grants will fund innovative new studies to
determine the causes of prostate cancer, to develop new methods of
prevention and detection, and most of all, to discover ground breaking new
treatments that will save lives.

        These grants are an important step in our fight against prostate
cancer. But we must press on. This year, as part of historic legislation
to protect our children from tobacco, I proposed to make the largest
commitment in history to fund cutting edge cancer research.  My proposal
would also allow people on Medicare to participate in cancer clinical
trials. This will be especially important for prostate cancer, which
overwhelmingly affects men over 65.  The more older men are able to
participate in these trials, the more we will learn about this disease,
and the faster we will be able to find a cure.

        But three days ago, a Republican minority in the Senate bowed to
enormous pressure by the tobacco industry and voted against this
legislation ... against protecting our children from tobacco ... against
our families      against increased cancer research ... against saving
lives.   The American people wonO,t stand for it.

         This Fathers Day, as we celebrate how much fathers mean to their
.
      children, we should also renew our commitment -- as fathers, as parents,
      and as Americans -- to our families, by insisting that Congress join
      together in passing comprehensive bipartisan tobacco legislation that
      protects our children and strengthens our nation.

              Thanks for listening.
