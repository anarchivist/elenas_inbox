TEXT:
Hi Elena. I'm the director of correspondence for Erskine and Jason
Goldberg referred me to you in regards to a letter Erskine received from
Sen. Phil Gramm. He wants to meet with Erskine ASAP to discuss the Texas
Integrated Enrollment Services project. Any thoughts on how I should
respond?   Has the administration made a final decision on this? Thanks
in advance for your advice--Karen Fahle.
