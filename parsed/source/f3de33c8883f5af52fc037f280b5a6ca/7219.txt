RJR Does Not Market Its Products To Minors

  WINSTON-SALEM, N.C., April 21 /PRNewswire/ -- In response to news stories
. published
  today, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. issued the following:

The 9,700 employees of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company are parents,
grandparents, aunts, uncles
and family members who take strong exception to the claims that we market
cigarettes to children.

The continued accusations by the President that we market cigarettes to
children are wrong and
irresponsible. As adults, we gladly accept the responsibility, in our
personal and professional lives, to
ensure that our children know the diff~rence between right and wrong and
do not engage in adult
behavior.

We do not want children to smoke, nor do we market this adult product to
minors. Our concern for
the well being, care and health of children is strongly held by each of
us, and we refuse to have our
beliefs and actions impugned for the sake of a headline or political
posturing.

We do not leave our responsibilities as parents and citizens at home when
we go to work at R.J.
Reynolds. We invite the President to Winston-Salem to learn for himself
how we conduct our
business.
