 TEXT:
 Also regarding the attached, for some reason SSA chose today to send to
 the Hill and make available to the press a compendium describing 80
 randomly-chosen cases of children under review, 40 of whom are keeping
 benefits, and 40 of whom are losing benefits.   I just got a copy, but
 haven't read it yet.   SSA doesn't think it will generate any press
 coverage by tomorrow, although the NYTimes editorial board has it.   Their
 intention was to rebut horror stories being circulated by the advocates
 about kids who are clearly still eligible.   But it would have been nice to
 know in advance.

 Apparently the NYTimes ed board does know about a case in Brooklyn where
 SSA erroneously cut off a child with very serious problems.

 Subject: Kids SSI editorial in the NY Times tomorrow


 I just heard from Brian Coyne that the NYTimes will run a negative
 editorial tomorrow on SSA's handling of the SSI kids reevaluations. It
 will echo Jonathan Stein's request that SSA suspend further cutoffs
 pending a review of their process.
