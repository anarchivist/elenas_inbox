                                July 18, 1998

Q:   The Republican and Democratic proposals are not that different. Aren't you just
     playing politics with this issue?

A:   NO" bill is acceptable if it excludes over 100 million Americans, and that is exactly what
     the proposal Republicans released this week does. We thought one thing that everyone
     agreed on was that all Americans should have basic patient protections. However, the
     Senate Republican proposal only applies to Americans in self-insured plans, excluding
     most Americans in small businesses and millions of other Americans from being assured
     these important protections. Friday's USA Today editorial said it best: there are "100
     million reasons the GOP health plans fails."

     Both the House and Senate Republican proposals also have many other weaknesses. For
     example, they do not assure that patients can see oncologists or heart specialists when
     they need to; they do not limit or require disclosure of financial incentives for doctors;
     and they do not compensate patients who are maimed or who die as a result of a
     wrongful health plan action. Although, by any definition, the Republican plans fall
     short, the President remains hopeful and committed to passing a strong patients' bill
     of rights this year.

Q:   By requiring any bill to allow individuals to sue their HMOs, aren't you raising the
     bar to make it impossible for Republicans to pass legislation this year so you can call
     them the "do-nothing" Congress?

A:   We are not raising any bar. The Administration has consistently stated that a right
     without a remedy is not a right at all. The right to sue in state courts is certainly one
     approach, but we continue to be open to other meaningful approaches that ensure
     recourse for patients who have been maimed or who have died as a result of health plan
     actions.

     As was reported just last week, judges across the country believe that their hands are tied
     by the current law. They have explicitly stated that Congress should remove the
     statutory barriers of ERISA that prevent consumers from seeking a meaningful remedy
     when they are injured because of their health plans' actions.

Q:   But the President said on Thursday that you have to have the right to sue?

A:   No. The President said that any patients' bill of rights should give "patients a right to
     sue or some other enforceable legal right that patients' need." This is consistent with
     what the Administration has consistently said in testimony and in statements by
     Administration officials.

A:   The bipartisan Dingell-Ganske bill enforcement mechanism through the state courts is
     certainly one viable approach. As I have stated before, we are open to considering other
     meaningful approaches to ensure that these patient protections are real.


Q:   What are other approaches that the Administration would except?

A:   There are other meaningful approaches beyond state court enforcement approaches.
     Some have suggested some type of Federal court approach. However, the devil is always
     in the details, and I am certainly not going to engage in negotiating the specifics on this
     show. However, the Administration's position is clear: those Americans who are
     maimed or who die because of a health plans' actions must get some type of remedy.

     It is important to remember that HMOs are one of the few entities in this country that
     cannot be held accountable for wrongful actions. Americans harmed by bad apple
     physicians or sloppy manufacturers can be compensated. For some reason, current law
     assures that HMOs are not held accountable. We simply believe that is unacceptable.


Q:   Isn't this going to lead to a proliferation of lawsuits? Is that really what we need in
     this country -- more lawsuits?

A:   We believe that having a strong internal and independent external appeals process in
     place will address almost all patients' grievances and that very few cases will ever make
     it into the courts. That is why all of the independent analyses of the Dingell-Ganske
     enforcement approach have been scored as costing between a dime and a dollar per
     month.

     There is no question that this is small price for such an important protection. Under
     current law, let's say that a patient is denied a critical mammography test recommended
     by her doctors and she is later diagnosed with stage two breast cancer. Even if it is
     determined that the HMO was clearly at fault, the patient can only be compensated for the
     cost of the test -- not for any subsequent treatment she will need and not for pain and
     suffering. We believe that patients who are maimed or die because of action of their
     health plans ought to have some type of real compensation.

     patients' bill of rights. Is this true?

A.   Such claims are flawed, widely exaggerated scare tactics used by insurers and other
     special interests to try to stall and kill this important legislation. There are
     absolutely no independent, credible reports that these basic patient protections are going
     to significantly increase the number of uninsured. The multi-million dollar,
     industry-sponsored ad campaigns that are scaring Americans with these unfounded claims
     are based on flawed assumptions that the patients' bill of rights will significantly increase
     health care costs.

     However, there a numerous independent analyses that these patient protections
     would not have a dramatic impact on the cost of health care coverage. A new
     analysis by the Congressional Budget Office shows that the patients' bill of rights will
     have only minimal effects on premiums. They estimate that these protections will
     increase health care costs by $7 per month. In most cases, the cost to the individual
     would be only about $2 per month.

     There is no reason to believe that this type of increase is going to cause millions of
     Americans to lose their health care coverage. Moreover, for good health plans that
     already provide these basic protections, it should cost almost nothing.

     Also, the Kaiser Foundation has estimated that patient protections would increase
     health insurance premiums less than one percent (less than $3 per family per
     month), and another Kaiser study released last week even found that allowing patients to
     sue their health plans would only increase premiums between three and 13 cents a month.


     Finally, the over 150 consumer and health care provider organizations around the
     nation that are supporting passing a strong, enforceable patients' bill of rights are
     also extremely concerned about the number of uninsured. They certainly would not
     be such strong advocates oflegislation if they had those concerns.
