TEXT:
I spoke earlier today with Mr. Mica's counsel regarding an administration
witness for their planned 4/24 hearing on the administration's plan to
hire welfare recipients for federal positions.   Obviously, they are
anxious to get our response regarding a witness.  Counsel suggested that
they would accept John Koskinen if necessary although Bruce is their top
choice. Jim King is also someone who we could send.    I need a decision so
we can get back to counsel on this.
