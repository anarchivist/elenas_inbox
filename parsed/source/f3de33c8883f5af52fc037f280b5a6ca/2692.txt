      As you are no doubt aware, earlier today, the Supreme Court ruled that part of the Brady
Handgun Control Act is unconstitutional. Although we are disappointed in the Court's decision,
we must all abide by it.

        We wanted to make certain that all of you understand that the Supreme Court's decision
did not "strike down the Brady Act," "declare it unconstitutional" or anyone of a number of
broad based and inaccurate statements that you may hear. Rather the Court simply stated that
the Federal government cannot require that state, county, and local officials conduct the checks
provided for under the law until November 1998, at which time the permanent federal Brady
check system (Instacheck) will become effective.

        We know that the vast majority of concerned and effective law enforcement officers in
this country support and conduct background checks under the Brady Act, not because they are
required but because -- plain and simple -- it is good law enforcement. Therefore, this decision
ought to have little impact on law enforcement. Those who wish to purchase a handgun from a
licensed federal firearms dealer (FFL) must still complete a background check form under the
Brady Act, and the FFL must forward that form to the chief law enforcement officer (CLEO).
As before, if, after five days, the CLEO has not advised the FFL not to transfer the handgun, the
FFL may sell the handgun to the purchaser.

        The sole change occasioned by the Supreme Court decision is that the CLEO is no longer
required by federal law to run the Brady background check. We expect and hope that the vast
majority of law enforcement agencies in America will continue to run these checks voluntarily
because they are saving lives, keeping guns out of the hands of criminals and generally in the best
interest of law enforcement. We urge you to continue the background checks called for by the
Brady Act within your jurisdiction.

        Since the Brady Act went into effect, over 186,000 felons, fugitives, and other prohibited
purchasers have been denied handguns. It would seriously undermine our efforts to reduce
violent crime if these and other prohibited individuals were able to purchase handguns because
law enforcement officers stopped doing Brady background checks.

        We recognize that some CLEOs may still use the Court's decision as an excuse not to
conduct Brady background checks. That would be unfortunate. It's just common sense that we
all keep doing whatever we can to keep dangerous criminals -- such as murderers, rapists and
stalkers -- from obtaining handguns. The safety of all Americans is better assured when Brady
background checks are conducted.

       Our request is simple: please join us in continuing to enforce the Brady Act.

                                             Sincerely,

                                             Janet Reno & Robert Rubin
