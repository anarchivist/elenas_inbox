 TEXT:
 Please let me know by 6:00 if you think any revision is required.

 One issue I should flag for you:   I have listed Snowe #1 as oppose.   Our
 policy is that we want the lookback su~charges to go into public health
 the entire account (22% of total).   The bill as currently written -- if it
 incorporates a technical amendment that is in Commerce's technical
 amendments package -- does this.   The Snowe amendment is thus a narrowing
 amendment, which would put 20 percent of the funds into cessation only.

 Currently, the section 451 (b) (1.) of the bill says that two types of funds
 go into the public health account: 1) 22 percent of the overall trust fund
 and 2) all the funds credited under section 401(b) (3), which in turn --
 and here's where we need the technical fix -- cites section 202 of the
 bill.
 Section 202 of the bill originally and now with the Durbin amendment, is
 the "purposes" section of the lookback subtitle.      Commerce Committee's
 planned technicals would change it to section 204, which would have worked
 under the pre-Durbin language; now it should be 205, or I think to be
 safe, subtitle A of Title II, i.e., the entire lookback subtitle.
