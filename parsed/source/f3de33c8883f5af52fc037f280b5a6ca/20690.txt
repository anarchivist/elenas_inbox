weeks to restrict safe reproductive choices for women. It is regrettable that some Members of
Congress have chosen to pursue a series of initiatives designed to create a political issue at the
risk of increasing unintended pregnancies and abortions and of compromising women's health
and safety.

        I have long said that I believe abortion should be safe, legal, and rare. All of the
proposals being offered would restrict safe medical choices. Some would actually restrict access
to family planning information and services and could have the perverse effect of increasing the
number of unintended pregnancies and abortions. I urge the Congress to put partisan politics
aside and instead put women's health and safety first.

        In this context, I am heartened that the House defeated attempts to kill Congresswoman
Lowey's amendment to require health plans participating in the Federal Employees Health
Benefits Program to cover all FDA approved prescription contraceptives. The Lowey proposal
will improve basic health care coverage for many women and help reduce unwanted pregnancies
and the need for abortion. A bipartisan majority of the House acted in the interests ofwomen's
health when it beat back efforts to undermine this important proposal.

        Congress unfortunately has not adopted this reasonable, health-oriented approach on
other issues. First, I strongly object to the amendment to impose restrictions on international
family planning programs. By prohibiting foreign non-governmental organizations from
receiving United States funds if the organization uses any non-US government funds for
abortion-related services or even advocates changes in abortion laws, the amendment jeopardizes
funding to health care providers who are working to meet the growing demand for family
planning and other critical health services in developing countries. The result of this
amendment's provisions could be an increase in unintended pregnancies, abortions, and maternal
and infant death.

        Second, I find it deeply disturbing that the House would take the unprecedented step of
intervening in the Food and Drug Administration's drug approval process by banning funding for
the approval or testing of drugs such as RU-486. For years, the FDA has used vigorous testing
and the highest scientific standards to protect public health. This amendment substitutes
political ideology for sound science. It would restrict scientific research that can protect
women's lives and offer them safe medical choices.

        Third, I am disappointed that the House chose to reject the changes that I proposed to the
Child Custody Protection Act. As my Administration conveyed to Congress, I would support
properly crafted legislation that would make it illegal to transport minors across state lines for the
purpose of avoiding parental involvement requirements. I have repeatedly stated that I would
sign a bill if it were amended to exclude close family members from criminal and civil liability
and to ensure that individuals who provide only information, counseling, referral, or medical
services to the minor cannot be subject to liability. As amended in this way, the legislation
would prevent the circumvention of state parental involvement laws while ensuring healthy
family communications. Unfortunately, the Congress has ignored these proposed changes, as

     well as those designed to address certain constitutional infinnities. In doing so, this Congress
     has demonstrated that it is not truly interested in passing legislation, but only in creating another
     partisan political issue.

              Finally, Congress is again signaling that it will tum the difficult debate over so-called
     partial birth abortions into an opportunity to score political points, rather than to pass legislation
     restricting this procedure. I have long opposed late tenn abortions, and I believe that we
     generally should prohibit the use of this procedure. I have insisted, however, on exempting
     those few but tragic cases in which this procedure is necessary to save a woman's life or to
     protect her against serious injury to her health. I again call upon Congress to add such a narrow,
     tightly drawn exception t<;> this bill, so that I can sign the legislation and put an end to all other
     uses of this procedure.

            I urge Congress to move beyond ideology and political maneuvering, to abandon
     extremism, and to protect women's lives and health while reducing the need for abortions.
     Congress's current course would remove appropriate reproductive choices for women, seriously
     jeopardize their health, and very possibly increase the frequency of abortions. I will strongly
     oppose these efforts.
