Chairman
Committee of Appropriations
United States Senate
Washington, D.C. 20510

Dear Mr. Chairman:

         The purpose of this letter is to provide the Administration's views on the Commerce,
Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill, FY 2000, as
approved by the Senate Subcommittee. As the Committee develops its version of the bill, your
consideration of the Administration's views would be appreciated. These views are based on
incomplete information and are, therefore, necessarily prelimi':lary.

        The Administration appreciates the Subcommittee's efforts to accommodate some of the
Administration's priorities within its 302(b) allocation. However, the inadequacy of the 302(b)
allocation has forced the Subcommittee to make choices that are simply unacceptable.

         The President's FY 2000 Budget proposes levels of discretionary spending that meet
important national needs while conforming to the Bipartisan Budget Agreement by making
savings proposals in mandatory and other programs available to help finance vital spending
needs. Congress has approved and the President has signed into law nearly $29 billion of such
offsets in appropriations legislation since 1995. The Administration urges the Congress to
consider such proposals as the FY 2000 appropriations process moves forward. Such action will
be critical in the development of this bill, as it must accommodate additional requests for two
vital activities - the decennial census and embassy security - that were transmitted to the
Congresf>, fully offset, on June 8, 1999. We look forward to working with the Committee to
ensure that funding is provided for programs included in that budget amendment package as the
bill moves forward. In addition, we urge the Committee to keep the bill free of extraneous
provisions.

        [While information on the bill is not complete, if a bill that did not address the
concerns below were presented to the President, the President's senior advisers would
recommend that he veto the bill.) The Administration strongly urges the Committee to
address the following issues:


                                                             Automated Records Management System
                                                             Hex-Dump Conversion

        21 5t Century Policing Initiative/Community Oriented Policing Services. The
Administration strongly opposes the Subcommittee's decision not to fund the 21 5t Century
Policing Initiative, the logical successor to the highly-effective Community Oriented Policing
Services program. Congress should not terminate this highly-effective program. We urge the
restoration of funding for the 21st Century Policing Initiative, which will enable local police
Departments to hire up to 50,000 additional community police officers.

        Federal Law Enforcement Funding. The Administration is concerned that while the
Subcommittee bill purports to fund several new initiatives, it fails t~ even provide funding to
support the FBI, DEA, INS, and U.S. Attorneys at current services levels in FY 2000. If these
levels and the earmarks identified in the bill were enacted, reductions in current staffing levels
would be required.

         Brady Handgun National Instant Check System. The Administration is concerned that
the bill does not include the requested fee to fund the cost of the Brady Handgun National Instant
Check System (NICS), nor does it provide sufficient funding to the FBI to continue operation of
the NICS system to perform these necessary checks. The Administration urges the Committee
to approve the requested fee.

       State Criminal Alien Assistance. The Administration is disappointed with the
Subcommittee's decision to substantially reduce funding for the State Criminal Alien Assistance
program.

Department of Commerce

         Decennial Census. On June 8, 1999, the President requested $1.7 billion in additional
funding for implementation ofthe decennial census. This funding will support the increased
activities made necessary by the January 25, 1999, U.S. Supreme Court ruling. The funds
requested in the amendment primarily address the additional workload associated with a
non-sampling census for purposes of congressional apportionment, including additional staff,
equipment, office space, and information technology needs. Although proceeding with a
non-sampling census for purposes of congressional apportionment will increase our costs
substantially, it unfortunately will produce less accurate results than the sampling method
proposed by the Census Bureau.

       National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. We are disappointed that the
Subcommittee mark does not provide the $60 million needed to implement the 1999 Pacific
Salmon Agreement, as requested in the Administration's recently-submitted budget amendment.
We also urge full funding of the President's Lands Legacy initiative. In addition, we urge the
Committee to fully fund the request for the Global Learning and Observations to Benefit the
Environment (GLOBE) program. The Subcommittee bill would freeze the program at $2.5


                                                                 Automated Records Management System
                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion
million for new education and outreach activities at Historically Black Colleges and Universities.
 This funding would have a dramatic impact on creating a pipeline of marine biology students at
these institutions.

         Economic Development Administration. The Subcommittee mark reduces the Economic
Development Administration (EDA) by $165 million, over 40 percent below both the request and
the FY 1999 enacted level. This funding level would mean a significant reduction in EDA's
ability to create jobs and expand economic opportunity in hundreds of distressed communities
around the country.

        Critical Infrastructure Protection. The Subcommittee mark does not include the funds
necessary to protect our Nation's critical infrastructure. We urge the Committee to fully fund
the $7.3 million requested for NTIA and NIST.


Legal Services Corporation

        The Administration urges the Committee to increase the mark for the Legal Services
Corporation (LSC) from a freeze at the FY 1999 enacted level, $300 million, to the requested
level of $340 million. Funding LSC at the requested level will help to ensure equal access to the
judicial system.

International Affairs Programs

        The Administration is deeply concerned about the Subcommittee's severe reductions to
the request for Department of State accounts that fund diplomatic and consular activities, as well
as contributions to international organizations and peacekeeping. Reductions of eight percent to
the request for ongoing diplomatic and consular operations would impair the ability of the
Department to support American interests and provide services to the public by forcing severe
reductions to personnel, operations, and investment that would ,undermine US. leadership in
world affairs.

         The Administration appreciates funding provided to continue enhanced embassy security
operations, but the Subcommittee's mark does not meet the President's request for an accelerated
construction program of new, secure embassy facilities and does not provide the requested
advance appropriations necessary to support a multi-year capital improvement program. The
Subcommittee bill significantly underfunds the annual assessed contributions to international
organizations and peacekeeping and only partially funds our requirement to pay off US.
arrearages. These funding levels would increase arrears, further inhibit chances for reforms we
are all seeking, and seriously constrain the ability of the United States to address foreign policy
interests through the mechanism of UN. peacekeeping. Most troubling, based on limited
information, the Subcommittee mark does not appear to include the $107 million arrears credit
that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee specifically directed to be included as part of the
bipartisan arrears package. The Administration considers this credit a key element of our U.N.
arrears agreement.
                                                                   Automated Records Management System
                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion
Endowment for Democracy.

Small Business Administration

        The Administration is disappointed that the Subcommittee mark does not include funding
for the new markets initiatives to invest in rural and urban areas -- $82 million for New Markets
Technical Assistance, 7(a) small loans, and the New Markets Venture Capital initiative. In
addition, we are concerned that the Subcommittee has not provided the $233 million in
contingent emergency funding requested for disaster loans. This funding will ensure SBA that
can meet the projected demand for the program.

        The Administration will provide additional views on the bill as information becomes
available. We look forward to working with the Committee to address our mutual concerns.


                                            Sincerely,
