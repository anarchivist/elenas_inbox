        Tobacco -- Legislative Update: This week, there was activity in both the Senate Labor
and Commerce Committees. On Wednesday, Senator Jeffords held opening statements on his
bill, which creates a separate title under the Food and Drug Act for tobacco and weakens the
agency's regulatory authority. Senator Jeffords says he wants to give FDA the full authority to
regulate tobacco products, but he wants to do so outside of the "drug and device" framework by
establishing a separate title just for tobacco. His current draft has two problems. First, it
deprives FDA of certain regulatory authorities which it needs and currently has to regulate
tobacco. Second, by creating a separate chapter of the law for tobacco, the Jeffords bill would
leave the provisions open to new interpretation by the courts and would require the agency to
promulgate new regulations. We met with Senator Jeffords and Kennedy's staffs on Thursday
to discuss our concerns and expect to have the opportunity to review revised language soon.

        As you know, Senator McCain is leading an effort -- blessed by Trent Lott -- to report a
comprehensive bill out of the Commerce Committee. He plans to begin marking up a bill on
March 25th. Currently, he is working off a draft bill that reflects the settlement and has
significant weaknesses, especially with regard to price and FDA jurisdiction. There is little
doubt, however, that McCain would like our support and that he is listening carefully to our
concerns. On Friday, we were invited to a meeting chaired by Senator McCain's and Hollings'
staffs which was very constructive in its tone and content. Mostly, we discussed FDA
jurisdiction. While we are not sure that they are ready to adopt our view that the legislation
should reaffirm FDA's current authority to regulate tobacco products, they are clearly working
hard to understand our concerns and are seriously considering our views.

        McCain has been working primarily with Hollings so far, but plans to expand his working
group next week to include Breaux and Gorton and perhaps others. They have made clear that
they want us to participate with them in this bipartisan working group. They want us to review
and provide feedback on their ideas. They seem to want to produce a bill we can support, or at
least one that we will not criticize. Erskine, Larry, and I are meeting with Senator McCain on
Monday to reinforce our interest in helping crafting a bipartisan bill that we can support.

        Tobacco-- Funding for Counteradvertising Campaigns: You asked us how much the
different bills spend on counteradvertising. The settlement proposed to spend $500 million a
year. The Jeffords and Kennedy bills match that figure, while the newest bills spend a bit more
-- $700 million a year in Conrad and $750 a year in Chafee-Harkin. Our budget includes
counteradvertising in a $22 billion a year "other uses" category which includes support for
farmers and unrestricted funds to states, and we had assumed -- although not released -- to match
the $500 million a year settlement level.
