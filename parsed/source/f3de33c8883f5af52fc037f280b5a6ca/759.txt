TEXT:
The welfare budget briefing tonight went OK; no particularly tough
questions.  The low point, I thought, was Ken's explanation for the size
of the fix package; people looked pretty baffled by it.  If it is to have
any success, it needs some serious work, assuming it's not too late for
that. Attached FYI is a note to him on this.

Subject:         Explanation for size of fix package

Briefing went fine after you left; no big deals.

You don't need this from me this morning but, for what it's worth:  I
found the explanation for why our fix package hasn't grown confusing.  I
know it is inherently very confusing, but I couldn't follow it very well,
even though I had read the document.

I don't follow why the fact that CBO originally low-balled the cost of
exempting legal immigrants from the SSI ban is so important.   It just
sounds like we discovered that our desires are more expensive than we
thought.    It doesn't seem to address the argument that we are now seeking
to save less money from this law than we once were.

I have a feeling there are better ways to frame it -- either arguing that
our new policy is actually to save MORE on food stamps/immigrants than our
old policy; or else maybe argue that the difference between us and them at
enactment was really more like $20 billion than $13-15 billion, because we
always loved the $6 billion in TANF money added at the end.  I will talk
to your staff to see if I am barking up the wrong tree.
