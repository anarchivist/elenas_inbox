TEXT:
I've pushed this question too and found nothing newsworthy.  The rule
faithfully implements the statute, but doesn't break policy ground worth
noting -- all the issues are really quite technical.  Lots of good
government implementation stuff but nothing worth highlighting.

But I do think there's a possible event for Mayor June around the
approval of the first state plan -- could go to a site an do a ribbon
cutting, push for some of our employment budget initiatives (Jeffords-
Kennedy or perhaps Welfare to Work).  probably a VP event. Schnur has
been somewhat involved (primarily checking out the community college
angle) and this is on his possible event radar screen.   DOL will get the
first state plans in April and will have up to 90 days to review them.
