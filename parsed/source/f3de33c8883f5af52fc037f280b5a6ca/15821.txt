TEXT:
Let me just follow up on this for a minute.   It would be very much
appreciated if you guys put our office in the loop at the beginning of the
process of doing potential directives or executive orders, not at the
end.  In other words, as soon as you start sharing a draft with other
people to get their views or clearance, send us a copy as well.   Keeping
us looped in won't, I assure you, make your life any more difficult, but
it will make ours much less difficult. Let's please do this from now on.
Thanks.  todd

It's really not helpful at all to find out so late in the process that you
there is a directive for an event tomorrow. This has been on the schedule
for some time and I'm sure someone has been thinking about this
directive.  In the future, we need to know much sooner.
