TEXT:
Attached is an Education Department document outlining a proposed new
commission
on math and science that Secretary Riley might preview in his State of
American
Education Address next week. The commission would be chaired by John
Glenn, would
focus on recruiting and training good math and science teachers, would
begin work in
April and finish its work between April and August of 2000. Education is
proposing that this be
announced at a White House event in several weeks.

I think it seems like a good idea, and in fact it might be something that
the VP could lead.
A few questions for you:
I} What do you think? Would you like to make changes in the way this is
being conceptualized?
2} Are you comfortable with Secretary Riley announcing this next week?
3} Do you think it makes sense for the VP to play some kind of leadership
role in this? (If he did,
I might want to explore with Education if it might make sense to delay
even previewing the
announcement until the VP could participate.)

                                        A Blue Ribbon National Commission
                                 Improving K-12 Mathematics and Science Education


           Background. The Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), the National Science
           Foundation (NSF), and NASA believe the time is right to launch a Blue Ribbon National
           Commission to Improve K-12 Mathematics and Science Education. Senator John Glenn would like
           to devote some of his time to K-12 mathematics and science education and has expressed interest in
           serving as chair of this Commission.

           The Problem. Far too many U.S. students finish high school without mastering the challenging
           mathematics and science necessary for success in higher education and in our competitive
           knowledge-based economy. The Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS)
           results show that, while our 4th graders perform above the international average, performance begins
           to decline in the middle grades, and by the end of secondary school, U.S. students score significantly
           below the international average in both general and advanced mathematics and science. The TIMSS
           results also suggest possible avenues for change in its analysis of educational practices worldwide.

           How a National Commission Can Help. A National Commission can review the current state of
           American K-12 math and science education and highlight important policy recommendations to
           improve U.S. student achievement in math and science. The TIMSS results have captured the
           attention of the public and the media, and the Administration has repeatedly cited math and science
           education as a priority. A high profile Commission can now convincingly articulate the steps needed
           to produce higher student achievement in math and science.

           Possible Outcomes/Recommendations. The Commission will produce a report focused on specific
           action steps that federal, state, and local policymakers can take to address teacher supply and quality
           issues in K-12 math and science education. The report would highlight states and districts that have
           implemented some of these steps, resulting in higher student achievement in math and science. At
           the federal level, recommendations for legislation similar to the Reading Excellence Act, and
           building on current Congressional interest in math and science education, could emerge so that
           targeted resources become available to carry out the Commission's recommendations.

           Possible Members. As mentioned above, Senator John Glenn has expressed interest in serving as
           chair of a Blue Ribbon Commission that will move policymakers forward. Among the remaining
           12-15 participants would be key members of Congress, Governors, Mayors, Chief State School
           Officers, Nobel laureates, Business CEOs, University presidents, and so on.

           Charge and Timing. Secretary Riley could foreshadow the announcement of the Commission in
           his State of American Education address by previewing a White House event and mentioning John
           Glenn as the chair. A White House event might include John Glenn, Neal Lane (OSTP), Rita
           Colwell (NSF), Daniel Goldin (NASA), Bruce Alberts (NAS), Secretary Richardson, Secretary
           Slater, and Secretary Riley, as well as a few ofthe Commission members. The Commission could
           begin meeting in April and meet once every other month for the next 12-16 months. The
           Commission will be charged to focus on teacher supply and quality in math and science, as
           described on the next page.
                                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion


                     TEACHER SUPPLY AND QUALITY IN MATH AND SCIENCE

      Critical to efforts to improve student achievement in math and science is the need for a cadre of
      highly-qualified teachers nationwide. Current realities intrude, however, with many math and
      science teachers teaching out of field. And, many others are underprepared in their disciplines, with
      few opportunities to upgrade their skills. Predictions of teacher shortages and student population
      growth combine to exacerbate the problem. A high profile Commission would command both
      respect and attention as it focused on the challenges ofteacher recruitment, retention, and
      reinvigoration in teacher preparation and professional development programs.

      Math and Science Teacher Recruitment

      Issues: In some states, as many as half of those who complete teacher preparation programs do not
      become teachers. This is especially true of math and science teachers who are lured into industry by
      intriguing job opportunities and high salaries.

      Potential Recommendations: Although a difficult issue without an easy answer, tax credits, loan
      forgiveness, or higher salaries for math and science teachers could attract more talented people to the
      profession. Moreover, alternative routes like the President's $18M Troops to Teachers program
      would encourage more mid-career moves to teaching.

      Math and Science Teacher Preparation

      Issues: Many prospective elementary or middle school teachers take only 1 or 2 undergraduate math
      or science courses. In addition, many middle schools hire teachers with elementary certification (K-
      8) who therefore lack the content background needed to teach math or: science well. Furthermore,
      few prospective K-12 math and science teachers receive adequate training in how to use technology
      to improve their classroom instruction.

      Potential Recommendations: Colleges and universities must make the effective preparation of
      teachers a priority. College presidents' could be exhorted to use the Commission's
      recommendations to reform their preparation ofteachers of math and science. The Commission
      could also recommend that more states implement content-specific middle school certification for
      teachers, so more middle school math and science teachers would have strong content backgrounds.

      Supporting Current and New Math and Science Teachers

      Issues: Slightly more than 25% of our current high school math and science teachers lack a major or
      minor in the subject area they teach. In high poverty schools, the percentage almost doubles, which
      means that lout of every 2 math and science teachers is unprepared to teach the discipline well.
      Moreover, many teachers do not have regular opportunities to improve their professional practice by
      upgrading their content or teaching skills.

      Potential Recommendations: Strategies that districts can put in place to address these challenges
      include: (1) continuous, collaborative, content-based professional development experiences; (2)
      mentoring programs for new math and science teachers; (3) use of teacher leaders to provide peer
      support; and (4) incentives for math and science teachers to seek National Board certification.
