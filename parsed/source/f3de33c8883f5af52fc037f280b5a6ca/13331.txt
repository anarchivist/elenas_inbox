TEXT:
I will try to catch him on this, but I'm never sure that I will do
it in time. Can you or Elena make sure Katie, too, is fully aware
of this so that she can mention if they discuss with POTUS?
Also, what would the effect of the TRO be? Just to stop the
suspension but not to mandamus us to do anything specific? In
other words, could it be worse than making us do what we are now
doing and seek to suspend?
