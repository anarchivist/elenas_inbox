MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:          BRUCE REED
               CYNTHIA RICE

SUBJECT:       NEXT WEEK'S SPEECH ON STATE WELFARE REFORM EFFORTS

        On Monday, July 28th, you will speak to the National Governors' Association in Las
Vegas. We are planning for this to be a major statement on welfare reform one year after you
signed the new law into effect and four years after you began to reform welfare by granting
waivers to the states. We will follow this speech with a Welfare to Work Partnership event on
August 12th with several hundred business leaders in St. Louis who will accept your challenge to
hire welfare recipients.

        We hope in the NGA speech to provide a statement of the principles and values that have
guided welfare reform. We will discuss the importance of work and responsibility, of requiring
both parents to support their children, and also of teaching teenagers that staying in school and
avoiding parenthood are the right things to do. We will talk about the new role of welfare
workers: not to dole out checks, but to assist welfare recipients in meeting the challenge of
joining the workforce. And we will talk about the need to support work -- to make sure it pays
better than welfare -- through the minimum wage, EITC, child support, and investments in health
care, child care, and transportation.

        We also hope in the NGA speech to tum the spotlight on the states: to underscore the
successes -- but also point out some of the shortcomings -- of state welfare reform efforts. We
will emphasize that while we have much to be proud of, we cannot rest on our laurels. We must
seize the opportunity to use savings from declining caseloads and the growing economy to put
even more people to work. Many states are investing new funds in child care, transportation,
and other welfare-to-work efforts; others are diverting savings to other parts oftheir budgets.
We plan to praise those who are doing the right thing, and scold, though not by name, those who
are not. Overall, we hope in this speech to send a signal that we intend to hold states
accountable for their actions.

        Finally, we plan to include an update on education standards in the speech, probably
referring to the announcements you will have made on Friday of the big city school districts that
have agreed to adopt the new tests.



                                               -1-
                                                                 Hex·Dump Conversion        .
         As you know, welfare refonn began long before last August, with the waivers we granted
to 43 states to allow them to impose tough work requirements and time limits and provide
incentives to make work pay better than welfare. Under the new law, nearly 90 percent of these
states have chosen to continue or build upon their waivers. Many of these states have intensified
their efforts, either expanding small demonstration projects state-wide or leveraging additional
financial or community resources for welfare to work efforts. Other states are simply in a
holding pattern, postponing changes because of political conflict (i.e., New York and California)
or for other reasons. Here's a summary of some of the interesting trends we've uncovered.

        Child Care: Efforts to expand child care are widespread. Because of the additional $4
billion we secured in the welfare law, all states are receiving more federal funds, which they must
match with their own dollars. About half the states are increasing their spending beyond what is
needed to match the new federal funds. Some states are adding quite a bit more: Wisconsin is
adding $160 million, Illinois is adding $100 million, and Florida is adding $23 million in new
funds and shifting $60 million from the welfare block grant to child care. A new paper by the
Progressive Policy Institute praises Illinois, Michigan, and Washington for establishing
"seamless" child care systems which provide subsidies for all workers below a certain income,
whether they've been on welfare or not. (There's a growing concern that some states are
short-changing the working poor by giving fonner welfare recipients priority for child care
subsidies. Creating a universal, income-based system avoids that problem.)

        Transportation: Several states have developed strategies to ensure welfare recipients have
the transportation they need to get to work. Kentucky is now implementing an initiative to
ensure that transportation is available in all areas of the state. Connecticut is earmarking $2.2
million of its TANF funds for new transportation services for welfare recipients. New Jersey
has announced a $3.7 million initiative to move Work First New Jersey participants to work. In
May, the Department of Transportation worked with NGA to award planning grants to help 24
states develop transportation strategies to support their welfare to work efforts.

        Welfare to Work Programs: Nearly all state welfare-to-work programs include the
traditional elements: job search, training, education, community work experience, and placement
in unsubsidized jobs. But now 22 states are using welfare checks to subsidize private jobs,
although mostly on a small scale. Eighteen states have "upfront diversion" programs which
provide job search assistance or emergency cash grants to help prevent people from going on
welfare. Several states (Ohio, Florida) provide tax incentives to companies that hire welfare
recipients. In many states, the governor and other elected officials are reaching out to the
business community to forge new partnerships. In Nevada, the state has set a goal for new
casinos to set aside 10 percent of all positions for fonner welfare recipients.




                                               -2-
                                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion

        Diverting Welfare Savings for Other Uses: Not all states are investing welfare savings in
child care, transportation, or other welfare to work efforts. One state, Ohio, is actually cutting
child care spending and is using some of its savings from lower welfare caseloads for tax cuts.
In Connecticut, the governor proposed to use federal T ANF dollars to replace existing state
social service spending. In Texas, the state spent less than one-third of its surplus from
declining caseloads on welfare to work programs; the rest was used on state programs previously
funded by state dollars.

        Child Support Enforcement: As you know, we have made progress in child support
enforcement, increasing collections by 50% from 1992 to 1996. Last year's welfare law
included tough new measures to help states track deadbeat parents across states lines. To date,
however, HHS has determined that only 16 states have enacted all the state laws needed to put
these tough new measures into place (the updated number may be higher, because HHS staff are
receiving materials from recently completed state legislative sessions.). One state -- Idaho -- has
not enacted any of the new child support provision~ required by the new federal law. Moreover,
nine states -- including California, which has 22% of the nation's welfare caseload -- will likely
not make this October's deadline to put in place new child support computer systems. We think
that in your speech you should underscore the need for prompt state action in these areas.




                                                -3-
