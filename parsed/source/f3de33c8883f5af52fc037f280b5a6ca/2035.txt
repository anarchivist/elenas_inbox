TEXT:
I will talk to him, though I advised Bruce on Friday that we may need to
slow down on this.  I met with Rep. Frank Riggs, who chairs relevant
subcommittee and who supports what we are trying to do.  His reading of
his own caucus is that this move could blow up on us if we proceed too
quickly.  Essentially, there is concern on the hill that, even though we
have the statutory authority to develop these tests (in a discretionary
fund that enables the secretary to do a whole bunch of stuff -- and which
Lamar Alexander used to fund the development of national standards)·, that
creating national tests is a big policy change that warrants Congressional
involvement. From this point of view, a unilateral executive branch
action, Riggs thinks we may stiffen opposition over procedural issues if
we issue an executive order now, without first building a stronger base of
understanding and support.

While we don't want Riggs to control the timing of our action, one key
reason for appointing an advisory panel is to build support on the hill.
So we certainly shouldn't rush to shoot ourselves in the foot.

Riley is testifying on the national tests tomorrow.   We will know somewhat
more about where we stand after the hearing.

Do you think Barry still wants to know about this now?
