TEXT:
I still haven't heard from Sally or her staff responding to my e-mail or
phone calls ... can you help by calling them directly from Bruce's office?
Maybe you will get better response. Distilled Spirits Council is getting
very anxious about whether or not this meeting will take place ... we need
to do something asap ... thanks so much!
