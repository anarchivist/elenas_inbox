TEXT:
We've taken out the reference to additional penalties in Judge Ross'
testimony, and have been going back and forth on a Q&A instead.   HHS wants
to say simply we're willing to work with the Committee to keep from
hurting children. OMB and I have worked up a more aggressive version,
below:

New schedule from Haskins:  he wants to put together a bipartisan
Congress/Admin group to develop a proposal on systems penalties to move
forward at the first of the year. He apparently doesn't think it can get
done by end of this session. He's apparently planning to have Shaw say
tomorrow something like: 16 states are now certified, 35-40 will be by end
of year. We're concerned that states haven't made it. We want to work
with Administration and others to find ways to ensure all states have
functioning state-wide computer systems in place ...


Q: Do you really intend to disapprove State plans for those States whose
automated systems are not in compliance? What other options do you have
for responding to such States?

A: The federal law is very clear that States must have a comprehensive
state-wide computer system in place in order to continue to receive
federal child support funds.  We intend to enforce the law. But
obviously, no one wants to hurt children by jeopardizing State child
support systems.  Thus, should the Congress be willing to discuss
additional penalties which would allow the State child support programs to
continue running while providing strong financial incentives for them to
come into compliance, we would be happy to work with you.

Withholding all federal funds would still remain a very real possibility,
but new penalties, which were tough, automatic, and rapid when a State
fails to meet the deadline for certification and continued to increase as
long as a State remains out of compliance, would create a real and
immediate incentive for States to comply while maintaining the operation
of the program. The Administration would be very interested in working
with the Committee to develop additional penalties along these lines.
