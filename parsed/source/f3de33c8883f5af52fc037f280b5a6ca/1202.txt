Send to the attention of Robin Leeds, (she's on email and fax: 67311
phone: 67339.
please email me a copy of the revised too.

In general the women's office wants to be involved in any meetings

on-the-job training.  Does this mean they should be invited to the Tuesday
weekly meetings (as though we could fit more people in Bruce's office)?
