TEXT:
As I was thinking about this last night, one thing that these do not
address are the provisions in the 2nd NAS study that have to do with
whether the tests are free from bias, address the needs of LEP and
disabled kids, and whether they can be used for "tracking, graduation, or
promotion," etc.   Does it make sense to include a mention of these in the
TP's, or do the caucuses and advocates view this language as such a thin
reed that its counterproductive?

 The following is a HEX DUMP:
                                                                                   Hex·Dump Conversion

           Questions and Answers on Tentative Agreement on National Tests
                                 November 7,1997


Q:   Earlier the Administration had indicated the President would veto this bill if it
     required further authorization from Congress to move forward with testing. But
     some suggest that this compromise basicaUy kills the national test to clear the way
     for Fast Track. Has the President given up on a national test?

A:   Absolutely not. The agreement allows us to proceed with development of the 4th and
     8th grade national tests that the President has proposed. It also allows us to pilot test the
     items for these tests next fall. This is a delay of a few months, but it's one we can live
     with. At the same time, we will go forward with a National Academy of Sciences study
     of ways to link state tests to each other and to NAEP, an existing national sample test,
     that reflects high national standards. Both aspects of the agreement make progress
     toward a single goal: ensuring that all students, across the country, are measured by the
     same high standards.


Q:   The legislation looks like a victory for test opponents. What did the Administration
     get out of this agreement?

A:   This agreement is a solid victory for high standards. Under the compromise, the final
     appropriations bill drops the general prohibition on national tests contained in the
     House-passed bill, which the Administration threateried to veto, and allows us to proceed
     with development of the 4th grade reading and 8th grade math tests. The bill shifts
     control over test policies and development to the independent, bipartisan, National
     Assessment Governing Board (NAGB), as the Administration had proposed. It provides
     $16 million dollars to support the testing plan. And it allows for pilot testing of test
     items to begin next fall. At the same time, the bill provides for a potentially valuable
     study of ways to link state tests to each other and to NAEP, an existing national sample
     test, that reflects high national standards. This agreement puts us on the road to high
     national standards, and to measuring whether these standards are being met. We will
     finally have high expectations for all our students and real accountability for all our
     schools.


Q:   Is further development of the national tests dependent on the findings of the
     National Academy of Sciences study? What is the timeline for this study?

A:   The Academy will be asked to make an interim report by June 15, 1998 with a final report
     submitted by Sept. 1. Further development of the national tests is not contingent on the
     findings of the NAS study. NAGB can goforward with test development activities
     leading up to pilot testing right now. Pilot testing is postponed until after September 30,
     but does not depend on the completion or findings ofthe National Academy study.
                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion

Q:   Does the compromise require further authorization to move beyond the pilot testing
     stage?

A:   The compromise allows for test development in FY 98, and pilot testing after September
     30. It is silent on the subject of further congressional action.
                                                                             Hex.Dump Conversion
                               Q&A on Pilot Testing Date


Q:   It sounds as if the Administration and Hill negotiators spent all day yesterday
     haggling over two dates: September 1 and. September 30. What was at stake and
     were you satisfied with the resolution?

A:   We had an agreement with Mr. Goodling to allow pilot testing to begin September 1.
     Mr. Goodling changed the date to September 30, but after reviewing the legislative
     language, we determined that this would not interfere with our plans in any way, because
     as a practical matter we would not have begun pilot testing in the first few weeks of the
     school year.
                                                                       Aultlm~md Records Management System
                                                                              He~·Dump Conllersion
                  Talking Points on Tentative Agreement on National Tests
                                     November 7,1997

    ·   This is a win-win agreement -- a genuine bipartisan victory for high standards.

    ·   The agreement allows continued, timely development of new national tests in 4th grade
        reading and 8th grade math, as called for by the President in his State of the Union
        Address. As provided for by the Senate, control of test policies and development will be
        transferred to the National Assessment Governing Board (NAGB).

    ·   At the same time, the National Academy of Sciences, in consultation with NGA, NCSL,
        and NAGB, will study how tests already developed by commercial publishers and states
        may be used to measure student performance against each other and against national
        standards. In addition, the Academy will study the technical quality.and other aspects of
        test item development.

    ·   The Academy will be asked to make an interim report by June 15, 1998 with a final report
        submitted by September I. Further development of the national tests is not dependent on
        the findings of the NAS study. NAGB can goforward with test development activities
        leading up to pilot testirig right now. Pilot testing is postponed until after September 30,
        1998, but does not depend on the completion or findings of the National Academy study.
        This timeline represents a delay of a few months, but it's one we can live with.

    ·   The agreement allows for test development in FY 98, and pilot testing after September
        30. It drops the general prohibition on national tests that the Administration threatened
        to veto, and does not include any requirement for congressional authorization to proceed
        with national tests.

    ·   As a result of this agreement, we are now on the road to high national standards, and to
        measuring whether these standards are being met. We will finally have high expectations
        for all our students and real accountability for all our schools.
