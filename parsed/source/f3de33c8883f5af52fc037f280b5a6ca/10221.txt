TEXT:
OMB gave FDA $0 for the food safety intitiave, we are pushing for the $49
million in the plan. OMB has indicated to FDA that they expect the WH
(DPC) to "signal" to them that this is important to the President if it is
going to.get back in the budget.  So if you can. signal, that'd be great.

You probably also know FDA got 0 of the 50 million they wanted for
tobacco. Also, they have a piece of a pretty good sounding bio terrorism
plan (13 million) which got nothing. It doesn't sound like the department
is fighting that hard for these.
