TEXT:
Charter Schools. House and Senate staff have met to preconference the
charter schools bill, and are close to agreement on virtually every
issue. Drafting should be completed within the next day or two, and the
current plan is to take the bill to the floor next week. While many
Democrats and eduction groups (NEA and AFT in particular) are lukewarm to
the bill at best, Sen. KennedyD,s staff does not anticipate opposition or
attempts to derail the bill. We should know early in the week if any
amendments will be offered, though at present the bill seems to be on
track.
