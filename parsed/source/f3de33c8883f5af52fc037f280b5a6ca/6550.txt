TEXT:
Elena,
At the EEOC hearing yesterday, Gingrich made a very strong statement
opposing class actions, pattern or practice cases and testing. Gingrich's
rhetorical push was toward using enforcement money to handle cases of
"actual victims" of discrimination, rather than "creating cases" (testing)
or class actions.' He did seem to concede, however, that testing could be
warranted where there were strong indications (unclear what the threshold
would be) that the employer might be unlawfully discriminating.
Igasaki (acting EEOC chair) made clear that though the agency was in the
middle of a small pilot program to determine how best to use testing in
the employment context, their FY99 budget request did not include any
money for testers.
