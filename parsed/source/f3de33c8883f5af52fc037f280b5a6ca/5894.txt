TEXT:
Elena,

Steve Mertens has sent me another version of OMB's draft statement.   It is
not much different from his last one, but there are some changes.   I am
sending you both that document and my suggested edits (budget.red)
Mertens has told me that Deich wants us to get the statement to INS and
DOJ today if possible.  They are looking for a Monday 9am deadline for WH
sign-off.  Thanks.

Julie

major changes in how the Federal Government sets and implements immigration policy. In

particular, it urged a separation of the enforcement and benefit functions thta INS now performs.



The Administration has studied these and other reform proposals, and has developed a plan to

enhance immigration law enforcement while improving the delivery of immigration services and

benefits. The plan is designed to separate INS' enforcement and service operations, but keep the

agency intact. The division of functions will improve efficiency and effectiveness, while

strengthening accountability, lines of authority, and leadership. To support these structural

changes, INS will also implement management and administrative improvements. In addition,

the Administration's plan will enhance coordination among Federal agencies involved in

immigration and establish greater accountability within each agency. Together, these reforms

within INS and across the Government will support and sustain the Administration's progress

over the last five years in enforcing our immigration laws and fulfilling the Nation's commitment

to its immigration heritage.
