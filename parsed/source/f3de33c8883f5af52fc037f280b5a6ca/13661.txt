TEXT:
In response to your e-mail (a welcome break from my forray into
the wonderful world of utiliy regulation) :
1. Yes, so far JWT's response is our only response. The Lyons
letter starting generating lots of comments about it being too
wordy, etc., and I have the sense that someone made a decision not
to do a follow-up substantive response. But that makes no sense,
so hopefully I'm wrong.  I need to follow up on this, or better
yet, ask OMB to do so.  I'll e-mail Ruth Saunders.
2. First and Last - yes, we traded.   Somewhat better, not
perfect. About to do the same thing on Abes Wren, and I suspect,
any remaining units of Boulder Krab and Elk Fork. Those sales
were treated as kind of a separate bundle of emergency situations
for which alternative timber needed to be identified asap.   Rest
of the sales are awaiting final guidance yet to be issued from the
FS.
3. What's going on with salvage? Come to tommorrow's meeting (if
you can - or if not, I'll get back to you). You will note that
the agenda message mechanism got switched to my machine and I got
it out on Friday (I'm very, very proud of this - hey, gotta have
something!).  I did that in large part to give a heads-up to the
agencies that we were going to have a serious talk about salvage
(they'd had an early warning the week before) .
4. Looking forward to the next version of our favorite brief.
