 The White House Conference on Mental Health
 Working for a Healthier America
 June 7, 1999


 "ItO,s time to bring health care into the 21st century and end the stigma
 and discrimination that have for too long prevented people from seeking
 the treatment that can help them live healthy, productive lives."
 --Mrs. Tipper Gore


Join Mrs. Gore as she chairs, along with the President, Vice President and
First Lady, a live televised satellite conference on mental health.  The
conference, on June 7, 1999, will bring together consumers, providers,
advocacy groups, business leaders, community mental health resources, and
,.

local, state, and national elected officials as well as leaders in mental
health research and pharmacology, service delivery and insurance
coverage.  The White House Conference on Mental Health: Working for a
Healthier America will take place at Howard University in Washington D.C.
You can be a part of this national dialogue by hosting a local discussion
and viewing the broadcast. ***

Conference Background and Purpose: On June 7, 1999, the White House will
host the first ever White House Conference on Mental Health to address an
issue that impacts more than 50 million Americans and countless more
family and friends who support loved ones living with mental illness.

In his 1999 State of the Union address, President Clinton announced the
first ever White House Conference on Mental Health to be chaired by Mrs.
Tipper Gore. As the President's Mental Health Policy Advisor and
well-known advocate for people with mental illness, Mrs. Gore has made a
strong commitment to eradicate the stigma and discrimination associated
with mental illness and educate Americans about the need for quality,
affordable mental health care.

Breakthroughs in science, research and medicine have taught us more than
ever before about the brain and the connections between mental health and
physical well being. Despite these advances, there is still a widespread
stigma and discrimination attached to mental illness based on a lack of
understanding.  Many agree that this is one of the last stigmas of the
20th century that we have not yet begun to fully address.

The White House Conference on Mental Health will seek to shed light and
understanding on issues surrounding mental illness and its impact on
people of all ages.  It will highlight cutting-edge treatments and
approaches to recovery, dispel myths about mental illness and bring us
closer to a time when mental health is given the same level of importance
as physical health.

The exact times of the satellite broadcasts are 12:30 PM-2PM EST and 3:30
PM-5 PM EST. There are two broadcasts: an opening plenary with the
President, Vice-President, First Lady, and the conference chair, Mrs.
Gore; and a second broadcast, which is a town-hall meeting interacting the
Gores with three interactive sites across the country.  The three sites
that will be used for this conference are Flint, Michigan; Atlanta,
Georgia; and Portland, Oregon. All satellite sites across the country
will view this interaction and have the opportunity to interject questions
via the chat room of NASA's webcast (to access this, click on WEBCAST from
www.mentalhealth.gov).  The coordinators are working with these areas to
develop a program and will provide the point of contact very soon.

***You can show your support and be a part of the broadcast by hosting
your own meeting on mental health. To create your own host site, you must
first visit the web site, www.mentalhealth.gov, to register your meeting
and read available materials.  If you cannot access the website, please
call 1-202-456-6671 for information.  Secondly, you must identify
participants and organizers from a cross-section of perspectives
including: consumers, providers, advocacy groups, business leaders,
community mental health resources, and local, state, and national elected
officials as well as leaders in mental health research and pharmacology,
service delivery and insurance coverage.  Thirdly, you must create a
design team to organize your meeting and invite participants and
speakers. Lastly, you must identify one person as the meeting facilitator
to thoroughly read the website materials, become familiar with the topic,
and know how to get questions answered.
