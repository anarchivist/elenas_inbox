1.      Litigation report

3.      New information analysis (as we discussed previously, if
possible, please try to have discussions with your agency's
regional program and legal personnel prior to Tuesday's meeting so
that we can either reach a consensus on this issue or better
define any outstanding issues)

5.      Other business
