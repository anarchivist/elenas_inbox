I'm sure this wasn't intended for me, but perhaps you can understand it.

Subject:         Re: Director Reviews:

The Director gave us basically the same message this morning -~ that
passbacks would be "at or even below guidance."   Addressing the PADs, he
went on to say; "this is not your problem -- it is their (the agencies')


problem."    He will be talking to cabinet members soon with this message.
I think what this all means is that we are presenting at, or very near,
guidance.

One of the tricky parts is that to the extent that agencies submitted
initiatives above guidance, we,will need some to develop an understanding
with them about whether they want them badly enough to continue to support
them within guidance levels -- i.e., are they willing to take big hits to
their programs to make room for the new initiatives.

Those are not judgments we should make entirely for them.
