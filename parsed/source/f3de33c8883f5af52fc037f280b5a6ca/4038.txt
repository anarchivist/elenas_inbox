TEXT:
Here are the education events that were discussed at the meeting with
Rahm. He is going to call another meeting for Wednesday to review where
we are on these; by then, I will have a short memo with a brief blurb on
each.

1. Aug. 30 Radio Address: release of NAEP long-term trend report.    (I
will discuss this with Ann)

2.   Sept. 8 Test event:   Exec. Order/Leg

3. Sept. 20 Charter Schools:   In Bay Area, school visit (possibly ribbon
cutting at new charter school; release of charter schools grants to states.

4.  Sept. 26 Community College: Dallas or some other Texas site tbd with
scheduling; demonstrate how HOPE has made community colleges virtually
free, and release state-by-state analysis of community college tuition.


In addition to these, Ann Lewis noted that the COngressional Dems are
talking about pushing early childhood, standards, and school construction
during September--no details were provided.

NEC pushed for events in the Fallon America Reads and Professional
Development/Computers.  They didn't get very far, partly because all of
September is booked, though Oct has possibilities.

One other note:  Paul and Rahmview Charter Schools as, in part, a
Clinton signature initiative (along the lines of community policing) and a
response to the attacks we expect on Coverdell/vouchers in the next few
months.  I talked about the failing schools idea; Paul in particular loved
it.
