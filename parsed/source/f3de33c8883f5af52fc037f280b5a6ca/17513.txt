TEXT:
O'Hara from HHS called and said DPC probably needs to call a meeting to
get HHS/USTR/USDA together to get a bill out of them.  If you agree, I'll
go ahead and call a meeting for next week.

Richard Socrades said Sylvia is planning on sending a long race 'memo to
the President early next week and including a few sentences on the Hate
Crimes Conference basics, Richard has already drafted the logistical
description.

Have a great weekend.
