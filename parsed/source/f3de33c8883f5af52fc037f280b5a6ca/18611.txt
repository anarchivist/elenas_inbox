MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:          Bruce Reed
               Elena Kagan

RE:            DPC Weekly Report




        Education -- National Testing: Goodling's bill to prohibit further development of
national tests without specific authorization, beyond what was explicitly agreed to in the FY98
appropriations bill, passed by a vote of 242-174. Twenty-five Democrats (mostly conservative)
joined all but 2 Republicans to support Goodling. Both the Black and Hispanic Caucuses
opposed Goodling's bill, partly in recognition of the substantial and targeted education
investments in your budget, and partly because they viewed Goodling's bill as a partisan effort to
embarrass the Administration. However, this vote does not represent a fundamental change in
position for either caucus; when we face more substantive votes on national tests in the future,
we will not gain their votes without address their policy concerns, such as a ban on high stakes
testing and development of Spanish-language reading tests.

       Education -- Coverdell Education IRA's: (Laura and Elena: consider this a
placeholder until after the meeting on Friday with Erskine). Coverdell's proposal for education
IRA's will be marked-up by the Senate Finance Committee next week .....

         Child Care -- Current Legislation. On Thursday, Senator Dodd and a group of24
Democratic Senators introduced child care legislation similar both to your proposal and to the
Chafee bill introduced last week. While the Dodd bill is substantially similar to your child care
initiative, it has some differences: (1) the dependent care tax credit is made refundable and
reformed to provide assistance to stay-at-home parents; (2) the Family and Medical Leave Act
threshold is lowered to cover businesses of 25 or more employees; (3) after-school programs are
enhanced both through the 21 st Century Learning Center Program and through a set-aside in the
block grant; and (4) a new fund is created to promote public-private partnerships in child care.
In addition, on Tuesday, Congresswoman Nancy Johnson introduced the Chafee bill in the
House.
                                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion


        Tobacco -- Current Legislation: There are reports that Senator Conrad, who is leading
the Senate Democratic task force on tobacco, will shortly introduce legislation that fulfils the five
elements you stated must be a part of comprehensive tobacco legislation. We have met with
Senator Conrad and his staff, and they are anxious to obtain a statement of support from you
when the bill is announced. They expect they will have all but 4 or 5 Democratic Senators
endorsing the legislation. We believe this a positive sign, giving us a more specific base for
negotiations, and we recommend issuing a statement of support for the legislation. So as not to
harden the issue along party lincs, however, we also suggest that the statement encourage a
bipartisan solution and indicate that you could support other legislation if it meets the
requirements of your five point plan. We continue to work with Republicans to encourage
building a bipartisan coalition on this issue.

         The Wall Street Journal incorrectly reported on Thursday that the Administration "for the
first time" would "explicitly support granting the tobacco industry relief from potentially
crippling lawsuits" in testimony by the Department of Justice. In reality, the DO] testimony
used the same language used by the Administration since at least June, 1997 to indicate that
limitations on civil liability for past misconduct is "not necessarily a deal-breaker" for the
Administration if the agreement as a whole ·advances the nation's public health interests and
meets your five point plan to reduce youth smoking. We have reached out to members of
Congress, the health groups including Dr. Koop, the rest of the Administration and the news
media to make sure this point does not become confused. One potential benefit of this
inaccurate story is that it re-emphasizes the Administration's good faith to Republicans in
suggesting that we want comprehensive bipartisan legislation, not a political issue.

        Drugs -- Home Drug Tests: Next week, HHS/FDA is planning to release a proposed
regulation for "home drug test kits." HHS/FDA intends to codify its policy of the past year to
allow manufacturers to market these kits without prior FDA approval so long as they meet 3
conditions:

       1. That one of the more than 200 already FDA-approved testing procedures is used;
       2. That one of the 70 FDA-certified labs determine the results; and
       3. That the kits themselves be accurately labeled.

Interested parties will have 90-days to comment on this proposed regulation, and HHS/FDA will
also conduct a public hearing on home drug test kits during this time -- and before issuing a final
regulation. Under the proposed regulation, Sunny Cloud -- the individual who initially
challenged HHS/FDA's -- could continue to market her home drug test kits; however, proponents
of hair testing, which is not currently approved by the FDA, are likely to be unhappy with the
regulation. The proposed regulation has no impact on law enforcement-related drug tests.
