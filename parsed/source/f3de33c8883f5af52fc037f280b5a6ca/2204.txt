TEXT:
Per Melanne, you are now a member of the President's Commission on Women.
They are having a meeting on Wednesday at the State Department with the
First Lady, Albright, and Shalala. You will leave here at 1:00 and return
around 3:00. I am trying to figure out who else from the WH is going if
you want to ride over with any of them.  I need to send your date of birth
and social security number to the State Dept. to clear you in and I do not
have that.  Thanks.
