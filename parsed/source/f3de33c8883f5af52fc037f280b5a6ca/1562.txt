In Wednesday's crime meeting, Rahm said he wanted to send a memo to the
President on Brady.  I have attached a rough draft.   Would you take a
look at it, when and if you have a chance? I am giving Rahm a copy, now,
because he wants to look at it over the weekend.  I think he wants to
submit it to the President on Monday.   Some of this stuff was covered in
Bruce's weekly already.

The SG's office were very strange to Kent about this whole issue, today.
They had a meeting about legislative fixes today and Kent said that they
were going off on tangents about whether we even want to send legislation
to the Hill.  They are worried that if this legislative fix ever passed
which is a very high bar to meet --- it could cause us bigger problems
because lOth amendment advocates would go forum shopping, have the fix
overruled in an opinion that would even further restrict the federal gov
ernment's authority   ( .... this is very nutty).  They were also bringing
up "equal footing" doctrine concerns    (which is bunk) and are worried that
this legislation would be an "in your face" to the Court that they would
not favorably react to    (so then what was the Lopez fix that Walter
testified before Congress on?)

I told Kent that,  first of all, the Justice Department Building has a
serious asbestos problem on the east side of the fifth floor and they need
to fix it because it is seriously affecting the minds of some folks in the
SG's office.

The truth is Walter was out of town, today, and some of these folks should
not be let out of their study w/o his supervision.

SUBJECT:       BRADY LA W STRATEGY IN RESPONSE
               TO SUPREME COURT DECISION


       The Supreme Court will decide on the constitutionality of the Brady Law within the next
few months, and most experts believe that the Court will hold that the Federal Government
cannot require state and local law enforcement officials to conduct criminal background checks.
We wanted you to know the strategy we will propose in the event the Court rules this way.

       Three elements of the law would most likely still be standing --- I) Brady's 5-day
waiting period; 2) Requirement that gun dealers obtain a statement from purchasers concerning
the proposed handgun sale; and 3) Transfer by gun dealers of the statement to state or local law
enforcement officers. In addition, the decision would apply only to 24 Brady states, and not to
the Brady alternative states (states where state legislatures have established an alternative system
that meets federal standards).

        In the event of an adverse Court decision, law enforcement officials would be able to
continue to conduct criminal record checks of handgun purchasers on a voluntary basis. And
most law enforcement officials believe that the vast majority of local chief law enforcement
officers would continue to perform background checks.

        We have been working with the Justice and Treasury Departments to develop a
multi-pronged strategy to respond to such a decision. The strategy would stress that the majority
of the Brady Law is still intact, but criminals should have no safe haven. This landmark public
safety measure is too important to have judicially-created exceptions. The law should be clear --
no background check, no gun sale.

       The steps we recommend to implement the strategy are:

        I)     The afternoon of the day the opinion comes down, you would make a statement at
                              the White House with the Bradys condemning the decision and
               directing the Attorney General and the Secretary of Treasury to review the
               decision and present you with options to respond within the week.

        At an event later in the same week, you would stand with the Attorney General, Secretary
Rubin, law enforcement chiefs and sheriffs, Members of Congress, and the Bradys to announce
the following:
                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion

       2)      Legislation. Sending legislation to the Hill that will respond to this Supreme
                      Court decision and challenge Congress to move on it quickly (in addition,
               Treasury is reviewing any actions you could take by Executive Order in
               conjunction with the legislative fix);

       3)      Law Enforcement Pledge Release a pledge signed by chiefs and sheriffs
               throughout the nation that they will continue to enforce the Brady Law -- many of
               whom would be in attendance at the event.

       4)      RenolRubin Letter. Release Letter from Reno and Rubin to every police chief
               and             sheriff in the country urging them to continue their public safety
               duty to conduct background checks on handgun purchasers. The letter would be
               sent electronically by Treasury to all state and local law enforcement
               organizations, and also sent to state attorneys general.

       5)      ATF Lettcr. ATF Director Magaw would send notification to Federal Fireanns
               Licensees explaining the Court decision and noting that their obligations remain
               unaffected.


Legislation:
       The Justice and Treasury Departments are considering legislative options to pursue in
response to an adverse Court decision. Understandably, they have only developed general
approaches, since a more definitive recommendation is dependent upon an analysis of the
Court's opinion.

       Here are at least some preliminary options that we are considering.

        Condition Funding. Condition federal law enforcement funding to states and localities
on the passage of state legislation requiring background checks before the purchase of a handgun.
 As would any funding condition, this option causes some consternation in the law enforcement
community.

         Regulate FFLs. Another option we are reviewing to require background checks is
through the federal government's authority to regulate Federal Fireanns Licenses dealers (FFL).
Under this approach, an FFL would not be pennitted to sell a handgun unless the chief law
enforcement official has certified that s/he will conduct a background check. Without this
certification, the FFL would be prohibited from selling handguns -- at all.

       Most chief law enforcement officers are going to conduct background checks, those who
refuse will have to explain why they don't to their gun owners -- because there will be no
handgun sales in their area. It sticks to a simple overall message -- no background check, no gun
sale. Handgun Control supports this approach.
