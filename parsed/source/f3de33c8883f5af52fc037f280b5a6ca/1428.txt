TEXT:
To build serious momentum for our legal immigrants proposal, I think we
need to strategize and coordinate message/events with the Hill and outside
advocates.   Others seem to agree because Sandy Levin is organizing a
strategy group to meet about every three weeks, comprised of:

About 5 House members (Levin, Becerra, Spratt, Kennedy, Gephardt)
About 5 Senators (Kennedy, Daschle, others)
About 10 key advocacy groups (counties, public hospitals, state
legislatures, Catholic Bishops, National Council of La Raza, etc.)

and they want us also.  Eric Gould called me and Janet Murguia from Leg
Affairs. The first meeting, for staff, is scheduled for this Friday at
9:30 but later meetings will probably include members.  Coincidentally,
this Friday's meeting clashes with our 10:00 bifucation meeting with HHS
and is right before our 11:00 meeting with a large group of immigration
advocates.

Questions:
        1) Do you think the Administration should attend these meetings?


           2) Who should represent the Adminstration?
                   a) White House (i.e. me, Diana, leg affairs)
                   b) White House and OMB
                   c) White House, OMB, and agencies? (HHS, SSA, USDA)

Coincidentally, I'd like to have a similar type of group for our welfare
to work legislative proposal.  I'm sure if we ask the Blue Dogs would
organize. What do you think?
