TEXT:
There is a hearing in the House on the CASA bill next Thursday, March
12th. This is the bill being pushed by ADAPT, the disability advocates,
that would make home and community-based services, including personal
assistance services, mandatory under Medicaid.  It has a price tag of
about $12 billion.

I am trying to get details, but the rumor I have heard is that Gingrich
and Gephardt will be on the first panel.  Gingrich introduced the bill,
but does not endorse it.  Gephardt is a co-sponsor. The second panel is
supposed to be an Administration witness.  I hear HCFA wants to send Sally
Richardson; disability groups will be mad that it isn't Shalala or Min.
Then a 3rd expert panel.

We are finishing up a letter from the President to Gingrich on the
legislation that details Administration actions on this issue, praises
CASA's goals, notes its costs, declines to endorse it, and says we should
work together on the issue.' I hope we can issue it in the few days before
the hearing.

Elena/Laura: Andy Imparato/Marca Bristo of the National Council on
Disability may be calling you on this, supposedly with ideas on what the
Administration could say.  I am trying to figure out what they think.
