TEXT:
The VP can't go to Seattle on Friday, Nov. 7 because it is the target date

of adjournment for Congress and Ron wants him to be here in case he's

needed for any votes.   So, we're looking at other dates in November, but

it looks more likely that it will be bumped to December, which means that

we'll have to do two forums in December.



Sorry for any inconvenience.   I'd still like to know what Gregoire says

when you know, Bruce.   I'll keep you all posted from over here ...
