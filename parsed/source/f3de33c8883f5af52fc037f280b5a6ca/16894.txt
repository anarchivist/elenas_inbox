TEXT:
  I have contacted David Ogden about setting up an interagency meeting and
we have agreed to shoot for next Thursday at 2:00pm-- this works for both
of your schedules.  I have been working with Cabinet Affairs to get our
contact names for the meeting.  I will give you the list of attendees once
it's set.

Thanks.
