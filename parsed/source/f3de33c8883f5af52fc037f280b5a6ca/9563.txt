SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE, October 1, 1998
San Francisco, California, USA

Wilson Vetoes Measure on Domestic-Partner Insurance
Lots of bills killed, signed by deadline
Greg Lucas, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau

    In his last chance to decide the fate of legislation, Governor Pete
Wilson vetoed dozens of bills yesterday, including a measure ordering
health insurers to offer domestic-partner benefits to employers.
    Wilson had until midnight to act on the remainder of the 950 bills
sent to him by the Democratic-majority Legislature before it adjourned
August 31.
    The Republican governor, who leaves office in January, said no to
bills that would have created a new system for reporting cases of HIV,
spent $300 million to repair storm-damaged roads, and create minimum
nurse-to-patient staffing ratios at hospitals, a move nurses said would
make hospitals safer.
    Wilson signed bills that allow creation of AIDS Awareness license
plates, clear the way for a land transfer of state park property to San
Francisco for a new 4gers stadium and provide more protection from abuse
and neglect to California's 3.3 million seniors.
    Wilson has never supported expanding health-care options for domestic
partners. The bill he vetoed would have forced health insurers to offer
the coverage, but not make employers buy it.
    "This was just a bill about fairness and equity in the workplace, and
I think the governor knows that in his heart, " said Assemblywoman Carole


     Migden, D-San Francisco, the bill's author.
          Wilson said that if he signed the bill, it would increase health
     insurance costs and that the question of domestlc-partner health coverage
     is - -more appropriately left to negotiations between' employers and
     employees. ' ,
          Wilson vetoed a second Migden bill, which would have created a
     statewide reporting system to document people with HIV -- but do so by
     using code numbers instead of names.
          Local health authorities receive reports only of AIDS cases, not of
     people who contract HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. Migden said her bill
     would have given health officials more accurate information on HIV cases
     while protecting the privacy of people who test positive for the virus.
          In his veto, Wilson conceded that California is one of only nine
     states that do not track HIV. But he said that 30 other states use a
     name-based reporting system and that --irrational concerns over privacy
     should not interfere with what must be our highest priority, interrupting
     the chain of HIV transmission."      .... (excerpted)
          Bills faring better included a measure by Senate President Pro Tern
     John Burton, D-San Francisco, that allows creation of AIDS Awareness or
     "red ribbon"      license plates. The plates will cost $50 to buy and $40 to
     renew. The money is to be deposited in a new AIDS research account and
     spent by the Legislature on research grants awarded by the University of
     California . . . . . (excerpted) Other bills signed by Wilson: -- Make it a
     felony to knowingly expose an unaware person to HIV or AIDS through sexual
     contact.
