    MEMORANDUM FOR STEPHANIE STREETT, DON BAER, AND ANN LEWIS

    FROM:                     BRUCE REED/MIKE COHEN

    SUBJECT:                  EDUCA nON SCHEDULING PROPOSALS

    Following is a list of four upcoming education events that we have requested the President and/or
    another principle attend. To help you prioritize these requests, you should know that we will be
    ready to announce the recommendations of the Interagency Working Group on Improving Math
    and Science Education at any of these events. It is important that the President participate in ill..
    least one of these events so that he can make the new announcements on math standards and
    continue to highlight his call for national standards in both reading and math.

    June 10         Release of 4th Grade Results the Third International Mathematics and
                    Science Study (TIMSS). The results show the U.S. above the international
                  . average in 4th grade math. This is good news and it gives the President an
                    opportunity to positively highlight the importance of national math standards and
                    competing globally.

    June 11-13     1996 Presidential Awards for Excellence in Science and Mathematics
                   Teaching for Elementary School Teachers. If this is President does not
                   participate, the Vice President or First Lady should host the ceremony.

    June 24-28     1996 Presidential Award for Excellence in Science and Mathematics
                   Teaching for Secondary School Teachers. The First Lady has been requested,
                   but this event would also be suitable for the President's message event on math
                   standards if this is the only time it can be scheduled.

    July 1         Release of a Link-Report of the National Assessment of Educational Progress
                   (NAEP) and the Third International Math and Science Study (TIMSS). This
                   report compares math and science scores of individual states to other countries.
                   This event promises to receive the most press coverage since it provides data
                   specific to each of the 40 states that participated in the studies.

    In addition to the above events, we have also requested that the President participate in an event
    on July 2 at Camden Yards to launch a PSA campaign on educational standards featuring major
    league baseball players. The Business Roundtable, NGA, AFT, NAB, Major League Baseball,
    and Department of Education are the sponsors of the PSA campaign.

                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion
