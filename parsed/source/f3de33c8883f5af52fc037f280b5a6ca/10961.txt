                 ADDRESS TO THE NATIONAL SCHOOL BOARDS ASSOCIATION

                                    DATE:           February 1, 1999
                                    LOCATION: Grand Hyatt Hotel
                                    BRIEFING TIME: 4:00pm - 4:20pm
                                    EVENT TIME:     4:30pm - 5:30pm
                                    FROM:           Bruce Reed, Ben Johnson


        I.    PURPOSE

              To build support for your education initiatives and education budget, and to thank the
              National School Boards Association for their efforts in fostering excellence in public
              elementary and secondary education.

        II.   BACKGROUND

              You will be addressing approximately 800 participants in the National School Board
              Associations' Annual Federal Relations Network Conference. The audience will include
              NSBA leaders and approximately 700 local school board members from every
              congressional district. The theme for the conference is "The Federal Role: Collaboration
              for Student Achievement". The Federal Relations Network Conference began on
              Sunday, January 31, and will end tomorrow, Tuesday, February 2, with participants
              spending the day on Capitol Hill meeting their representatives and senators. NSBA and
              its Federation members represent the nation's 95,000 local school board members.

              NSBA has been a strong supporter of all of your education initiatives of the past 6 years,
              and has worked closely with the Administration to secure their enactment. The
              participants in this Federal Relations Network Conference will be focused primarily on
              the upcoming reauthorization of ESE A, and on education appropriations. As they
              approach ESEA reauthorization, they will be generally supportive of the substantive
              direction of your accountability proposals, though concerned that they be given adequate
              flexibility to implement them. They will push generally for greater local flexibility in
              federal education programs, though they have also opposed block grant proposals in the
              past. They are staunchly opposed to the voucher proposals the Republicans are expected
              to offer.
                                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion
