TEXT:
I need your help to ensure that IGA is included consistently in the effort
to build a national campaign to prevent violence, winning support for our
gun initiatives, and the Juvenile Justice bill. City and County elected
officials, AG's and others can be enormously helpful on all of these
issues and are very interested in working with us.  Bill White, our IGA
liaison to DPC, has been asked to increase our engagement with DPC on
these issues.  Your guidance please.
