     TEXT:
          Folks:
          I wanted to follow up with some information from today's meeting.
          Below is the text that we are proposing to insert in appropriation's
          language.  You'll note the last sentence says that the programs need
          to be consistent with the principles published in the federal
     register
          by the Secretary.  This means that we do have some flexibility for
          their content, although we are expected to get significant outside
          input via the federal register. Our counsel's office is still
          assessing whether we would have to go back to the federal register if
          we wanted to make a change down the road.  At this point, they
     believe
          that we would have to go through some formal rule-making procedures.

             I am going to talk to Deputy Secretary Smith about whether he thinks
             we should pursue a stronger enforcement approach to the principles.
             He conceived of them initially, and I am not sure that this was what
             he had in mind, but we can look at some options.

          I am also attaching the document I passed out which was missing a
          page.  It lays out several strategies for responding to the RTI
     study.
          Please let me know if your computers can read it (it's in MS WORD.)

             Thanks for your time this morning.  We look forward to discussing
             these items further with you.  (Bill/Dennis- I am not sure I have the
             right email address for Mike or Elena. Could you make sure they
             receive this note?)

             Thanks,
             Michele
