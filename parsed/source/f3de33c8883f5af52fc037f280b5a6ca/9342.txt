Long-Term Care. If Democrats introduce an alternative tax bill, we could do an event (either
before or concurrent with the Democratic unveiling) that highlights the President's long-term
care initiative. The President's proposal would provide for a $500-$1,000 tax credit to people
with long-term care needs or their caregivers. It would cost about $5 billion over 5 years and
help about 2.2 million people. It would also establish a private long-term care insurance
offering to Federal employees through the Federal Employees Health Benefit plan. OPM
estimates that 300,000 people would buy these policies.

Work Incentives and Health Care for People with Disabilities. Within the next week, we
will know whether the Senate can agree to bring the Jeffords-Kennedy Work Incentives
Improvement Act -- the disability community's top health priority -- to the floor for a vote.
If it does, because of our summer-long work to help develop this bill with the Senators and
advocacy communities, we could create a strong event with both the disability and AIDS
communities to give it a strong Presidential push. We could also announce the approval of four
states for the new "date certain" grant program. This long sought after initiative (by the
disability community) provides states the ability to use Medicaid resources to offer
institutionalized disabled persons the option of returning to the community -- within a specific
time frame -- to receive their needed long-term care services. It would be viewed by the
community as an important signal that we are attempting to move the Medicaid away from its
historic institutional bias for the chronically ill.

NGA Partnership Even on Children's Health. October is the 1st anniversary of the effective
date ofthe Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and October 5th is Child Health Day.
We could release the first annual report on states' progress in implementing CHIP, which is
expected to coincide with a sufficient number of state approvals to cover 2.5 million kids. At
this event, we would launch phase one of our children's health outreach campaign with NGA to
target parents of uninsured children eligible for CHIP and Medicaid. As part ofthis
announcement, we would unveil a series of targeted radio ads in 9 states and well as highlight
innovate efforts by the Governors themselves. Finally, we are working on getting a commitment
from Americorps -- to have them help families sign up for Medicaid and CHIP at the local
level-- that could complement our range of Federal activities.

Cancer Event(s). In addition to the September 26th Cancer March (and the President's
possible involvement through a radio address), October is National Breast Cancer Awareness
month.
It is also the 5th anniversary of the President's launching of the National Action Plan on Breast
Cancer. We have tentatively scheduled October 21st for an event with the First Lady to
highlight a new information outreach and screening campaign focused particularly on
underserved minorities. Because of the President's strong cancer record, as well as his desire to
underscore our commitment to ending health disparities between races, this might provide a good
