TEXT:
A quick update on today and yesterday's class size meetings:

Mike Cohen held a meeting yesterday with Education, OMB, and DPC staff to
discuss strategies on the class size initiative in relation to the
upcoming markup of the Republican (McKeon) teacher quality bill. The
current expectation is that the bill will be marked up by committee before
the end of the month.   There is a meeting scheduled for Friday with staff
from Goodling's, McKeon's, Martinez', and Clay's office and Education to
address concerns with McKeon's bill.

Issues with McKeon Bill. ED has several significant concerns with the
bill -- namely the class size and national board provisions. The
Republican bill does not authorize a separate funding stream for class
size reduction.  Moreover, school districts can simply opt out of class
size reduction activities for a multitude of reasons (e.g., lack of
facilities or qualified teachers) and use the funds to support other
teacher quality activities. The bill also prohibits the Secretary from
supporting national certification schemes (i.e. the language could make it
impossible to fund the national board for teacher certification) .

Today's Congressional staff meeting.    ED staff met this afternoon with
Martinez' and Clay's staff.   ED communicated that class size and the
national board have real strong support in the WH and at ED.   Martinez'
and Clay's staff are in agreement.   There was some disagreement as to
whether to raise at Friday's meeting some of the other concerns - i.e.
professional development - that Education would like to work on with
Republican staff.   After some wrangling, all agreed to start Friday's
meeting with a strong statement on the non-negotiablity of class size and
the national board, and to also try and work out some of the professional
development concerns.

WH Support. At Mike's meeting and again in phone class today, Education
staff have stressed that they believe it is important for the WH to take a
visible leadership role on the class size issue.    Also, Sen Kennedy's
staff is also asking for WH leadership and visibility on this issue. ED
would like to discuss WH involvement on class size at Bruce's strategy
meeting tomorrow.  See· next item for potential event.

Class Size Report/Release of Funds -- The Class Size initiative staff is


preparing a report that will show who has applied for the funds (alISO
states), discuss how successful districts have been in meeting their
hiring plans,  and give examples of how the funds will be used. An
initial version of this report may be ready to go in early July.  Note:
the class size funds themselves will be distributed on July 1.
