TEXT:
Bruce wanted Melissa Skolfield to get the President into the child support
story she's giving to USA Today today.  She thinks Rich Wolf will put· in
his story a quote from the President.  Please review this quote.· Once
you've reviewed, I presume I should get Rahm and Barry Toiv to look at it
as well?

DRAFT QUOTE:

This powerful   new child support collection tool -- part of the
comprehensive   legislation I proposed in 1994 and signed into law in 1996
-- will track   down deadbeat parents so we can take the child support they
owe right out   of their paychecks.
