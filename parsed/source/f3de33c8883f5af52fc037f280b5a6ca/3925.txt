                                Key Issues in Tobacco Settlement         Hex-Dump Conversion
I.     FDA Jurisdiction

        The settlement would codifY FDA's authority to regulate tobacco products, and enact into
law the specific access and advertising restrictions contained in FDA's rule, ending the risk and
delay of legal challenges to the rule, and the risk that a subsequent FDA Commissioner could
conclude that FDA does not possess the authority to regulate tobacco under current law.
However, the settlement would significantly alter FDA's current authority. The settlement takes
the positive step of establishing a "risk reduction" standard for FDA to use in evaluating tobacco
products -- a more logical and flexible standard for tobacco products than the Food, Drug and
Cosmetic Act's required showing of safety and efficacy. But other provisions in the settlement
place significant new substantive and procedural hurdles in the way of any FDA restrictions on
cigarette and smokeless tobacco content, labeling, and marketing.

        To modifY tobacco products, including reducing or eliminating nicotine, FDA must make
new substantive findings and meet new standards of evidence. FDA must show a required
product modification will: 1) result in a significant reduction in health risk to tobacco users; 2)
be technologically feasible; and, 3) not create a significant demand for contraband. FDA must
also consider the number of dependent users, the availability and demonstrated market
acceptance of alternate products, and the effectiveness of smoking cessation techniques before
requiring product modifications.

         Under the settlement, administrative courts would give the agency less deference in
reviewing challenges to FDA's rules. Currently, courts uphold FDA's decisions as long as
FDA's actions are not "arbitrary and capricious." Under the settlement, administrative courts
would hold FDA to a "substantial evidence" standard in reviewing its actions to reduce nicotine,
and to a "preponderance of evidence" standard for actions to eliminate nicotine. Further, the
settlement specifies that the court's deference to the agency would depend on the "extent to which
the matter at issue is then within the Agency's field of expertise."

       The settlement places procedural hurdles before the agency as well. The FDA must use
burdensome, trial-like formal rulemaking procedures in lieu of regular notice and comment
procedures to mandate product modifications that reduce risk. Finally, the settlement bars FDA
from eliminating nicotine or taking an equivalent action for 12 years, and from changing the
access and advertising provisions for 5 years except under extraordinary circumstances.

        To address these concerns, the settlement could be modified to codifY FDA authority,
consistent with FDA's final rule on tobacco, except changing the standard for tobacco products
regulation from safe and effective to "reduced risk" and changing the required findings to facts
the agency must consider. The new procedural hurdles, standards for review, and time
constraints (particularly the 12 year prohibition on eliminating nicotine or taking equivalent
action), could be dropped. These changes would affirm FDA's current authority rather than
circumscribe it.

                                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion
II. Look Back Provisions

        The settlement embraces the Administration's goals of reducing underage use of tobacco
products and seeks to eliminate industry profits from new youth smokers. The industry would be
subject to monetary penalties if youth tobacco use fails to drop by 30 percent in 5 years, 50 percent in
7 years, and 60 percent in ten years. The penalty is set at about the estimated lifetime industry profits
from addicting a new smoker -- $80 million per percentage point under the target. However, the
penalty is capped at $2 billion annually (about 8 cents per pack), and is lowered by 75% if companies
make a "good faith" effort to comply with the agreement.

        As structured, the penalty does not provide a meaningful incentive for the industry to
work to meet youth targets. Since it is easy to show "good faith," the actual penalties for
recruiting new youth smokers will be at best 75% below industry profits from the new customers.
Further, since the smoking reduction targets are based on industry-wide usage, individual firms
will have financial incentives to keep selling to children because they will reap the full reward
while bearing only part of any penalty.

       Our goal should be to provide meaningful incentives to the industry to reduce youth
smoking. Industry representatives have said that they do not believe youth targets will be met
and have argued that the industry should not be held accountable as long as it complies with the
settlement's access and advertising restrictions. We believe, however, that providing the
industry with a strong incentive to reduce youth smoking is the only way to assure meaningful
progress toward targets. Our bottom line must become the industry's bottom line.

To strengthen the penalties, we could:

       Levy the penalties on a firm-by-firm basis;
       Make the penalty substantially higher than foregone profits (e.g. 3x profits);
       Make the penalty higher further from the target (e.g. 2x profits if the 50% reduction
       target is missed by 10 percentage points; 3x profits it's missed by 20 percentage points);
       Remove the annual $2 billion cap;
       Classify the penalty payments as fines, making them non tax deductible;
       Eliminate the "good faith" offset and volume adjustment; and/or
       Consider non-economic incentives, such as raising the age oflegal purchase to 19 or 21 if
       youth targets are not met.

                                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion
III.     Size of Settlement Payments

        The industry agreed to an up-front lump sum cash payment of$IO billion, and $358.5
billion paid over 25 years as indicated below (dollars in billions):

Payment Year(s):      1       2      3       4          5     6-8   9        10-25

Base Amount:          $6      $7     $8      $10        $10   $12.5 $15      $15

Public Health Trust: $2.5     $2.5   $3.5    .$.1

Total:                $8.5    $9.5   $11.5 $14          $15   $15   $15      $15

       The annual payments are not fixed. They are indexed upward for inflation (3% floor),
increased sales, and profit increases, and adjusted downward if adult sales decrease. All
payments are tax deductible. The industry must pass the annual payment on to smokers in the
form of increased prices. The payment therefore functions like an excise tax estimated at about
60 cents per pack, and is expected to reduce smoking among adults by 15% and among teens by
about 20%.

         Under the settlement, 33% ofthe base amount would be made available to pay individual
liability awards. Any excess funds would go to the federal government. The settlement
proposes a $25 billion 8-year Public Health Trust Fund for tobacco-related medical research
and proposes designating $2-3 billion annually of the base amount for other public health
investments (including $1.0-1.5 billion for smoking cessation, $0.5 billion for an anti-smoking
media campaign, and $0.3 billion to fund FDA's regulatory effort). The remaining funds would
be used to reimburse states and the federal government for Medicaid costs.

        OMB estimates that the Federal revenue raised by the settlement will be substantially
lower than $368.5 billion. OMB adjusts the payments downward to account for: 1) an
expected drop in sales; 2) an "indirect business tax" (a standard accounting adjustment that
decreases scorable revenues by 25%); and 3) the loss of federal excise tax revenue associated
with the volume decrease. The 15 cent per pack tax just enacted will reduce the payments
further by about [$50 billion].

        So, for example, in year 4 the industry has agreed to pay $14 billion (assuming industry
payments are not reduced by the new 15 cent tax). The volume adjustment reduces the payment
by $4 billion, and federal revenue offsets reduce the net revenue by an additional 4 billion.
Inflation increases the payment by $1 billion. That leave $7 billion to pay for compensation and
public health investments. The settlement proposes $4 billion in spending for the public health
trust fund, and earmarks $2 billion for individual compensation claims. That leaves $1 billion to
spend on public health programs and state and federal Medicaid reimbursements -- substantially


                                                    3
less than the what was envisioned in the settlement.                  Hex-Dump Conversion

        There are at least three arguments for seeking an increase in the settlement payments.
First, an increase will raise the price of cigarettes -- the most reliable way to decrease smoking,
especially among kids. Leading public health advocates recommend a $1-$2 per pack price
increase. Second, the proposed net revenues leave states with far less money to settle their suits
than anticipated and potentially under-funds promised public health investments. Third, CEA
and Treasury believe the industry will benefit significantly from the deal. They argue that the
proposed payments simply leave too much surplus profit on the table given that the settlement
will provide the industry unparalleled liability protection and will facilitate collusion.

        Options for increasing revenue include: undoing the 15 cent excise tax offset; indexing
the payments by health care costs increases rather than by the Consumer Price Index; eliminating
the volume adjustment; and/or increasing payments to offset the loss of federal tax revenues.
Treasury estimates that these changes together would bring industry payments to about $700
billion over 25 years.

IV.    Document Disclosure

        The settlement creates a public national depository of tobacco health and youth marketing
documents in Washington, DC. A panel of three Article III judges would review all industry
trade secret and attorney-client privilege claims. The panel would undertake in camera reviews
of privilege claims without the traditional prima facie showing of evidence of crime or fraud.
The panel's decision regarding privilege claims would be binding on federal and state courts.
The panel does not appear to interfere with FDA's authority to request and inspect documents for
regulatory purposes.

        The proposal would provide a national resource for researchers, regulators, and litigants.
But as structured it raises several concerns. First, it could slow litigation -- the 3-judge panel
would have less of an incentive to review documents rapidly than trial judges hearing specific
cases. Second, it raises fairness issues -- centralizing review would preclude trial judges from
weighing privilege claims in the context of specific trials and would bind future litigants not
party to the settlement.

        Some have argued the settlement should alter sub~tantively the requirements industry
must meet to sustain a privilege claim for certain types of documents. For example,
Congressman Waxman has proposed that certain health research-related documents should not
be subject to any privilege claims. The Justice Department opposes abridging the attorney-client
privilege, in part because doing so may compromise criminal cases.

        The timing of, as well as the process for, document disclosure is also raising concerns.
Senator Leahy, Congressman Waxman, Attorney General Humphrey, and key public health
leaders have stated that the industry's health and youth marketing documents should be made


                                                 4
                                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion

public prior to deciding about a settlement. The industry has apparently systematically misused
the attorney client privilege to improperly conceal health and youth-related documents.
Anti-tobacco advocates argue that the appropriateness of any settlement can only be accurately
evaluated after such documents are in the public domain.

         We should seek to facilitate document disclosure to the greatest extent possible. We
could maintain and enhance current document disclosure procedures while adopting the best
aspects of the settlement's proposed national depository. Specifically, we could establish a
national depository with non-binding judicial review of privilege claims. Further, we could
facilitate plaintiffs discovery in litigation by eliminating the need for plaintiffs to make a prima
facie showing of crime or fraud prior to gaining judicial review of privilege claims.

v. Civil Liability
        The settlement would resolve Attorney General actions and class action suits, prohibit
future state suits and class actions; prohibit joining, consolidating, and aggregating individual
suits; prohibit punitive damage awards for past actions. The settlement does not abridge the
rights of individuals to sue, but it caps industry's total annual liability payments at about $5
billion (it designates 33% of the industry's "base payments" for a compensation fund and
augments the fund with 20% inqustry copayments). If individual judgments exceed available
funds in any year, no individual would receive more than $1 million in that year. If the
compensation fund exceeds claims, the federal government receives the remainder.

         The cap on liability payments, the prohibition on punitive damage awards, and the
prohibition on class actions and consolidations are obviously significant concessions that must be
balanced against the settlement's benefits. It is an especially high price given the troubling
evidence revealed by FDA's investigation. The provisions potentially limit plaintiffs' abilities to
recover damages, discourage plaintiffs' lawyers from suing, and lower the industry's incentive to
avoid future hanns. How much impact these provisions would have in part depends on what
would happen absent a settlement. To date, the industry has lost only one liability case and
settled one other, but some believe the recent disclosure of damaging industry documents -- and
the impending disclosure of many more -- will tip the balance in future litigation toward
plaintiffs. If that occurs, than the liability provisions will significantly impede recovery.

         We could consider a number of modifications to this provision, including removing the
cap on punitive damages for future misconduct; dropping the prohibition on class actions; and/or
dropping the prohibitions on consolidations. It is unclear, given the proposed annual cap on
liability and the requirement that unspent funds under the cap revert to the government, why the
industry is seeking to prohibit class action suits and punitive damage awards. But changes to
these provisions may be deal-breakers for the industry.

VI. Advertising Provisions / National Protocol

        The settlement codifies the advertising restrictions in FDA's final rule and makes some
significant additions, including banning all outdoor tobacco advertising and advertising on the
Internet. More important, the settlement significantly increases the likelihood that the
advertising restrictions would withstand legal challenge by incorporating the advertising and
marketing provisions in a voluntary "protocol," implemented through consent orders signed by
states and participating companies. At least theoretically, participating companies would be
bound by the agreements regardless of whether non-signatories (e.g. the advertising industry)
bring First Amendment challenges. However, placing the provisions in a protocol rather than in
legislation may make the provisions unenforceable by the federal government. Hence, the
innovative protocol is one of the most important but uncertain benefits of the settlement. We
are exploring the best way to structure it to walk the delicate line between constitutionality and
enforceability.

VII. Tobacco Farmers

        The proposed settlement is silent on tobacco farmers and tobacco-dependent rural
economies. Grower representatives were not invited to the negotiating table. We have worked
with Secretary Glickman to reach out to farmer representatives and members of Congress from
tobacco growing states to make it clear the Administration will insist on meeting the needs of
small farmers and their tobacco-dependent communities.

        We are consulting with farmers and their representatives about possible solutions. In a
White House meeting, Gov. Jim Hunt set forth three possible objectives: maintain tpe current
tobacco quota and price support program; require industry to use mostly U.S.-grown tobacco; and
provide transition assistance as the demand for cigarettes falls. Fifty officials from 7 southern
states and farm groups recently sent a draft proposal to tobacco-state Congressmen. It spelled
out a 10-point plan that would cost tobacco companies $15 billion over 25 years. In our meeting
with democratic members of Congress from tobacco growing states, members agreed to provide
us with a plan based on this proposal.

VIII. Environmental Tobacco Smoke

        The settlement would put in place the first national restrictions on environmental tobacco
smoke. The ETS provisions, modeled on legislation sponsored by Representative Waxman,
would restrict indoor smoking in "public facilities" -- defined as facilities ten or more people
enter at least one day per week. The restrictions are similar to those you have placed on
government buildings, permitting smoking indoors only in rooms ventilated directly to the
outside. The provisions would affect most private and public workplaces and fast-food
restaurants, but would exempt certain facilities, such as bars, clubs, prisons, and casinos.

       The ETS provisions are a clear advance over the status quo and a major benefit of the

                                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion

settlement. ETS restrictions have proven to be an effective means of motivating smokers to
quit. The provisions could be strengthened, however. The broad exemption for the hospitality
industry (a departure from your Executive Order and OSHA's proposed rule) leaves those
workers most exposed to ETS unprotected.

IX. International Issues

As you know, the settlement does not address international sales oftobacco products. Public
health groups are pushing for the US to take a leadership role in fighting tobacco's rapid global
growth. Worldwide, there are 3 million tobacco-related deaths annually, and the World Health
Organization expects that number to rise to 10 million by 2025, with 75 % of annual deaths
occurring in developing countries.

We have begun an evaluation of the Administration's international tobacco policies in three areas
-- trade policy, export and business facilitation, and public health.

o      Trade Policy - the US treats as presumptively valid any foreign country's
       non-discriminatory health-based tobacco control measures. To ensure the health
       implications of trade actions are well considered, HH8 participates with USTR in trade
       negotiations. Consistent with free trade principles, USTR's policy is to fight
       discriminatory barriers on behalf of all industries, including tobacco. Some believe
       USTR should not provide such assistance to tobacco companies, however, since the entry
       of US tobacco companies into foreign countries has arguably increased tobacco
       consumption. Weare continuing to review this issue.

o      Export promotion and commercial facilitation -- State and Commerce are working
       with HHS to develop new guidelines limiting the involvement of U.S. ambassadors and
       their Foreign and Commercial Services staffs in tobacco marketing and export promotion
       activities.

o      International Public Health Initiatives -- There is a general consensus we should
       strengthen the Administration's leadership role in global and bi-Iateral efforts to reduce
       smoking. HHS is developing a proposed action plan for consideration in the context of
       -- or separate from -- the settlement.

Additional Considerations
other claimants (e.g. asbestos)
bankruptcy protections
reduced risk products
licensing
non-participating tobacco manufacturers (smokeless, Liggett)
state preemption
fire-safe cigarettes
