TEXT:
Bruce/Elena,
FYI.  I just spoke with Eric Falls from Sen. Robb's office. Robb and
Kennedy's offices are putting together a "Dear Collegue" letter in support
of the President's EEOC budget request.  They should have a draft by the
end of the week, which they will fax over to us.  They are shooting to get
this out early next week.
