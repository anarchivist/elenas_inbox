                              Question and Answer on Fathers Count Act
                                            June 12, 1998

        Question:   Does the Administration support HR 3314, the Fathers Count Act of 1998?

        Answer:     We certainly support the general goal of encouraging states and communities to
                    help fathers become more involved in their children's lives afld share the eefleems
                    abeet werkiflg families, beth methers aFId fathers. The Administration has
                    always placed a high priority on supporting strong and healthy working we pareflt
                    families and on strengthening the role of fathers. This track record includes:
                    family friendly policies such as the Family and Medical Leave Act, expansion of
                    the Earned Income Tax Credit and the new Child Tax Credit; initiatives to
                    promote father involvement in child health immunization and early education;
                    demonstration projects to promote responsible fatherhood; and employment
                    programs for non-custodial parents of children on welfare so they can help support
                    their children. We remain ready to work with Congress on initiatives that will
                    help hard pressed families meet their needs, including child care.

                    We would be glad to work with Congress on the specific provisions of the Fathers
                    Count Act at an appropriate time. Funding for the initiative would need to be
                    considered within the context of other priorities and within the context of the
                    balanced budget.

                    Background
                    The bill was introduced by Clay Shaw on March 3 and now has 7 Republican
                    co-sponsors. It would authorize $2 billion over five years for block grants to states
                    for projects to encourage fathers to become better parents. Funding levels grow
                    from $200 M in 2000 to $500 M in 2004. The funds would be distributed by HHS
                    to states based on their share of total population, and would be targeted to private
                    organizations (75 percent) and to fathers below the state or local average income
                    of male earners (80 percent). The bill specifically declares religious
                    organizations eligible to receive funds under the act.

                    Funds could be used to: 1) encourage unmarried or prospective fathers to get
                    married, and encourage better parenting both by fathers who are living with their
                    children and those who are not and 2) help fathers obtain gainful employment or
                    increase their skills in order to qualify for higher paying jobs. The bill also
                    specifies that a state who receives a Fathers grant may use Welfare-to-Work and
                    Title XX (Social Services Block Grant) funds for the same purpose. Up to $10
                    million annually is earmarked for research and evaluation, with another $10
                    million annually earmarked for technical assistance.

                    While the bill has not moved to date, it is possible that the National Fatherhood
                    summit on June 15th may generate new momentum.
