TEXT:
I am checking to see if there is anything more current from Education, but
the most recent version of this initiative that I am familiar with would
have the following elements:

FY 99 Funding: $320 million

Competitive grant program open to roughly the largest 50 or 100 school
districts with a large central city.

Grants would be for 3 years, with approximately 10 - 15 awards being made
in the first year, worth approximately $15 million to $35 million apiece.

Funds would be used to address urgent needs in the following areas:

Strengthening accountability and management

Fixing failing schools and rewarding successful schools.

Building instructional ahd leadership capacity in schools, with intensive
professional development for teachers and especially principals
Expanding public school choice, either system-wide or partial system-wide

ED also contemplates allowing districts to use funds for other local
priorities, such as summer programs to provide extra help for
low-achieving students, and perhaps efforts to improve the racial climate
in inner-city schools.

We will need to continue working with ED to bring their actual proposal
more in line with the school reform priorities identified in our "Pillars"
submission -- for example, focusing on no social promotion, removing bad
teachers, etc ..
