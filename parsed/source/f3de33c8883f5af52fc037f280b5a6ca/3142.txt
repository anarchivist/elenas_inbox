Elizabeth

We're looking for a good domestic, family/consumer-oriented radio address
topic for the July 4th weekend ... Is there anything solid and definitive
we could do on airbags, which you had said was coming back? If not, any
other ideas?  (Our model for a good July 4th radio address is last year's
food safety -- a good holiday angle)
