TEXT:
Yesterday the House Judiciary Committee began marking up a revised version
of Rep. Hyde's Class Action bill (markup is to continue July 28th
according to the Congressional Record -- Sarah Rosen of the NEC is getting
a full report). At a recent meeting, we agreed, as had Bruce urged, to
oppose the bill based on our non-tobacco objections (no reason to transfer
most class actions to federal court, concern about burdens on the federal
court system, etc. '). DOJ is going to draft a letter outlining their concer
ns (it will be an update pf a June 18th letter -- the bill has been
improved since then but not by enough).   You should know that anti-tobacco
advocates were emailing their contacts yesterday to urge them to call
House members to oppose the bill (see excerpt below) .




H.R. 3789 would allow tobacco companies, along with other
defendants in class action lawsuits, to remove cases from state
to federal courts -- giving federal courts jurisdiction over virtually
every class action claim.

H.R. 3789 will lead to interminable delay for class action cases
against the tobacco industry.   The federal courts are already
overburdened arid are not equipped to handle the flood of cases
that will be shifted from state courts to federal courts.   In addition,
federal courts are not expert in the state statutory and common
law claims brought by most tobacco plaintiffs.

H.R. 3789 could effectively wipe out most class action litigation
against the tobacco industry, limiting an important avenue of
redress for consumers.

Class action lawsuits are one of the only ways that injured
consumers can bring legal claims against tobacco companies.
That is why Big Tobacco tried to wipe out class actions in the
June 20, 1997 deal.



As Dick Daynard, Chairman of the Tobacco Products Liability
Project at Northeastern University School of Law, has pointed out,
H.R. 3789 could wipe out "the Engle case, the class on behalf of
diseased Florida smokers presently in trial in a Miami state court,
and would effectively discourage the filing of cases similar to
Engle in the remaining 49 states.  In addition, the Broin case, a
class action on behalf of afflicted nonsmoking flight attendants
which was tried in a Florida state court and partially settled last
year for $300,000,000, would probably have been dismissed in
federal court or would, at best, still be in pro-trial skirmishes.
H.R. 3789 would discourage other groups of afflicted nonsmokers
from following suit."
