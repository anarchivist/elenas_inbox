TEXT:
Just a little while ago, in a Senate hearing on Education with Secretary
Riley, Sen. Coverdell stated that he looked forward to discussing his
proposal with the President directly on Thursday.  I'm not aware that this
cat had been out of the bag previously, so we might get some inquiries
about this.
