TEXT:
FYI, OIRA is now clearing two documents for the Federal Register, and will
send one of their heads-up notes to Erskine about them.  They'll be
published around Monday. They are:

1. Definition of federal public benefit:   Elena, Rob Weiner, and I worked
with HHS on this.  It is HHS's binding guidance as to which of its
programs are federal public benefits. Under the welfare law, illegal
immigrants are not eligible for federal public benefits.   The guidance
clarifies that about 30 HHS programs are off-limits to illegals, most of
which are very small. The big ones are 'adoption assistance/foster care,
CSBG, LIHEAP, Medicare, Medicaid, SSBG, CHIP, and TANF. The two most
noteworthy decisions are that community health centers are not federal
public benefits (major good news for immigrant advocates, who argued that
shutting off these centers to illegals would be dangerous to the public
health and to citizen children; Lamar Smith may react); and that child
care funds are federal public benefits (bad news for the child care
community, which will now have to verify children's status, as below).

2.   INS Verification Rule:  This proposed rule is required by welfare
reform.   It tells providers of federal public benefits how to make sure
that they are providing benefits only to those who are eligible for them
-- i.e., how to screen out illegal immigrants. This will be seen as a
tougher interpretation than Item 1, so the immigrant groups may be
unhappy.   (That's why we decided to release these together.)  It requires
providers to look at documents for everyone, including citizens, which
providers will see as a major burden, but the law is pretty clear on this
point.   "Charitable organizations" are off the hook, though, as are
programs like food stamps that have existing rules on how to verify.

I'll try to write a short, coherent item on these for the weekly. We are
not looking for press on these, needless to say.  I'll tell HHS and INS to
do a good rollout with the Hill and the groups.
