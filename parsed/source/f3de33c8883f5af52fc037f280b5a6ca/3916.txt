RSenator asks public to back tax break for private-school parents

    WASHINGTON (AP)    The Republican sponsor of a bill to provide
tax breaks for parents of children in private schools asked
Americans to tell President Clinton his opposition to the idea is
wrongheaded.
    "With your help, we can convince him to put the interests of
school kids ahead of the special interests that oppose parents'
rights in schooling, " Sen. Paul Coverdell of said Saturday in the
GOP's weekly radio address.
    During budget negotiations in July, Clinton warned in a letter
that he would veto the balanced-budget agreement if Coverdell's
proposal were included. The plan would allow parents and
grandparents to contribute up to $500 per child per year to an
education savings account similar to the Individual Retirement
Account.
    The account could have been used to help send children to
private school, from kindergarten through high school, or to pay
the costs of home schooling.
    " I would veto any tax package that would undermine public
education by providing tax benefits for private and parochial
school expenses,"   Clinton said then.
    But Coverdell, R-Ga., urged the public to help change the
president's mind. He portrayed Clinton's veto threat as " a sneak
attack, almost a Pearl Harbor for education reform. ' ,
    "President Clinton has aligned himself with those who have a
vested interest in the system remaining the same, " Coverdell said.
"with your help, we can get Mr. Clinton to reconsider his veto
threat. ' ,
    In response, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Clinton
"supports school choice within the public school system"    and


"has been a leader in the charter school effort."
    Lockhart denied that the president acted sneakily. "Our
position was well known and was made clear under the bright
sunshine of the balanced budget negotiations, " he said. "The
letter was requested by the Republicans late in the process, but
our position's been consistent and clear all along."
