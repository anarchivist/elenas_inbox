 'State of Cities' Study Released

 PAUL SHEPARD Associated Press Writer

 RENO, Nev. (AP) - A new study that checks the pulse of American cities
 warns that poor urban
 schools and middle-class flight threaten the strongest economic
 performance cities have witnessed in
 a decade.

 The second annual "State of the Cities"   report released by the U.S.
 Housing and Urban
 Development Department at the U.S. Conference of Mayors national
 convention offers both a
 soo~hing and sobering picture of the urban landscape.


 Simply put, the patient is doing well but disease, in the form of growing
 concentrated poverty in the
 inner city, poses significant risks.

 Good news for cities abounds in the 75-page report.

 - The economy has produced 16 million new jobs and record low
 unemployment. And the number
 of employed people living in central cities increased by almost 3.7
·
     million people in the past five
     years.

     - Unemployment in central cities fell to an average of 5.3 percent early
     this year from 8.2 percent in
     1993.

     - Downtowns that just 20 years ago more closely resembled ghost towns in
     Cleveland, Baltimore,
     St. Louis and Washington have become tourist meccas thanks to sports
     arenas and arts centers.

     - Even crime, the age-old bane of city dwelling, has been tamed to a
     degree. Violent crime fell 19
     percent in big cities between 1993 and 1997.

     But despite the impressive gains, poor city residents are being left
     behind by growing numbers of
     middle-class residents.

     Since 1970, nearly 6 million middle-income and affluent families left
     central cities, according to the
     report.

     Poor schools are one of the most frequently cited reasons for the
     middle-class flight, according to
     the study. In 1994 and 1996, 60 percent of children in urban school
     districts failed to achieve basic
     competency on standardized reading and math tests.

     And in the nation's 20 largest urban school districts, more than half of
     the students never graduate.

     "For millions of urban youth, finishing high school and attending college
     seem an impossible dream -
     this in an era demanding high skills for high wages" the report says.

     It asks: "If we are not now ready to take on these challenges when the
     budget is in surplus,
     unemployment is at record lows and the stock market is at record highs,
     when will we be ready?"
