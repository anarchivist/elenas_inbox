TEXT:
hi elena, pat ewing asked me to follow up with you about the Pay Equity
issue. My understanding is that the two of you agreed that the VP would
not highlight the pay equity initiative in the MLK announcement so that
you could break it out later if desired ... given that, would you like the
OMB SOTU background document to delete the reference to the pay equity
initiative? (currently the civil rights enforcement section of the SOTU
background document includes a blurb that says:   " ..... (2) a $14 million
Equal Pay Initiative at the EEOC and the Department of Labor".)    or is it
ok as it stands? thanks very much for all your help. best, audrey

I talked to Elena yesterday. I told her that we did not highlight the pay
equity monies so that we or they could use them at a different date. She
thought that was great. I do not know if she has something specific in
mind, I did not ask. Call her or e-mail her, but she may want it to be
held. I do not have a burning desire for this, because I do not have venue
until Jan 26th -- or the 1st week of Feb after the budget has been
released. Why don't you talk to Elana and figure this out.

Pat,  given your earlier discussions with elena about potentially
preserving pay equity for a later event, how do you want to handle this?
please advise. thank you.

The civil rights enforcement section of the SOTU background document
includes a blurb that says:         (2) a $14 million Equal Pay Initiative
at the EEOC and the Department of Labor".
Do you want this highlighted here?

fyi, per discussions between elena and pat ewing, we are going to do the
cr enforcement package as discussed on monday     but will NOT highlight
the pay equity initiative so that that can be broken out separately at a
later date ... thanks again for all your help
