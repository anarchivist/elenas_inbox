Minority Home Ownership. As part of your Initiative, HUD and the National Association of
Realtors (NAR) created an historic partnership to help promote equal housing opportunity and

program open to more than 1.5 million real estate professionals across the country. The program
will train real estate professionals to implement Fair Housing Act principles and to make housing
markets more accessible to traditionally underserved populations, such as racial and ethnic
minorities. Although recent gains in minority home ownership are largely responsible for
pushing the national rate to an all-time high of 66 percent, only 45.8 percent of African
Americans and 43 percent of Hispanics own their own homes - compared with 72.3 percent of
whites.

Environmental Protection Agency

Environmental Briefing for African American Leaders. On November 19, Administrator
Browner and other Administration officials meet with 75 African American environmental
leaders to discuss the Administration's environmental priorities. Several environmental justice
leaders were in attendance and expressed frustration and serious concern about the
Administration's commitment to environmental justice. In particular, many attendees expressed
concern that they had not been invited to the White House for discussions on environmental
issues since President Clinton signed Executive Order 12898 on Environmental Justice in 1994.

Administrator Browner made it clear that environmental justice remains an Administration
priority and discussed several key environmental initiatives affecting the African American
community, including the new clean air standards, community right-to-know, Superfund, and
children's health protection. Administrator Browner was also asked about EPA's decision on
September 10 regarding the Shintech facility in Convent, LA. Administrator Browner ordered
Louisiana to stop issuance of air pennits for a proposed Shintech chemical facility because the
pennits have technical deficiencies which fail to regulate all potential sources of air pollution.
These issues must be resolved before the project can move forward. EP A is also conducting an
investigation oflocal citizens' civil rights complaint, which alleges that African American
residents would be disproportionately impacted by the pennitting of the Shintech facility.
