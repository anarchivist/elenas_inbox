TEXT:

The following is my most current cut at the top ten list.   We're
down to nine issues!!
I've included Chris/Pauline on this for the first time so you can
see where I think some of the Medicaid issues are.
Special Flags:
   * Elena: as far as I know still no movement on Means Tested,
right? Anything we can do?
   * Diana: December is here. will the disability reg on
naturalization get out this month?
   * Keith: I'll call you about this, but can HHS have go ahead on
questions 1,2,3,5 of the 10/23 Q/A?

Thanks.  Please email with corrections/updates.          Implementation
meeting will be tomorrow at 3:00 in room 211.
