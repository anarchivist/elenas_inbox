  REWARDING EXCELLENCE IN TEACHING TO STRENGTHEN OUR SCHOOLS
                     DRAFT -- October 23,1997
       To have the best schools, we must have the best teachers . .. We should reward and
       recognize our best teachers.
                                                -- President Bill Clinton
                                                     State of the Union Address, 1997

This week President Clinton continued to focus public attention on his comprehensive agenda for
strengthening public schools: high standards, accountability, and charter schools and public school
choice. Today the President focused on a critical aspect of this agenda: making sure every student
has a talented and dedicated teacher. The President contrasted the Administration's strong focus
on the basics of school improvement with the Congressional agenda of vouchers and similar
measures that would weaken public education.

THE PRESIDENT HONORS OUTSTANDING TEACHERS. Marking the tenth anniversary
of the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards, President Clinton praised close to 200
Board-certified Master Teachers from allover the country. These teachers met rigorous
standards and passed rigorous tests developed by the independent Board, comprised of teachers
and other educators, business leaders, governors, and state legislators. Chaired since 1987 by Gov.
Jim Hunt of North Carolina, to date, the Board has established assessments in seven fields of
specialization covering half the teaching population, including pre-kindergarten, elementary,
middle school/junior high English, and high school'mathematics and science. The Board
awarded the first national certification to 5 teachers in 1995; today there are nearly 600
Board-certified teachers.

A MASTER TEACHER IN EVERY SCHOOL. In his State of the Union Address, President
Clinton proposed a plan to help 100,000 teachers seek Board certification as Master Teachers
--one for every school in the country. In his balanced budget plan, the President requested $105
million over 5 years to help the Board complete assessments in 25 academic areas covering the
fields of90% of the nation's teachers and to help defray the cost to teachers of taking part in the
Board certification process. Today, President Clinton called on Congress to include funding for
this initiative in the FY 1998 appropriations bill.

THE PRESIDENT'S CHALLENGE: REWARDING EXCELLENT TEACHERS. Today,
President Clinton called on every state and school district to help teachers prepare for National
Board certification and to reward those who succeed. He held up the example of states lIke North
Carolina and Kentucky, and school districts like Los Angeles and New York City, that are
providing significant salary increases to reward National Board Certified Master Teachers.

RECRUITING AND PREPARING TEACHERS FOR HIGH POVERTY COMMUNITIES.
 The President also urged Congress to support his $350 million initiative, announced this
summer, to attract talented people of all backgrounds into teaching at low-income schools across
the nation, and to dramatically improve the quality of training and preparation given to our future
teachers. The initiative will help bring nearly 35,000 outstanding new teachers into high-poverty
schools in urban and rural areas over the next five years, and will upgrade teacher preparation at
rural areas.
