TEXT:
If the prov~s~on is'satisfied by asking the LPR an additional question,
that would not add much in time or money.  However, if it requires any
type of verification (that money is owed; the amount owed; whether there
has been a waiver, etc.), it becomes time consuming and expensive --
particularly if applied to the large majority of LPRs that leave the
country for less than six months at a time (as mentioned, tens of
thousands per month) that are not currently subject to any "admission"
inquiry.

Perhaps we just leave it to INS and HHS to sort out the technical
difficulties in administering this.
