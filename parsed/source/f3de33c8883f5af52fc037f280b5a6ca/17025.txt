Ken Apfel was confirmed (unanimous consent) by the Senate to be
Commissioner of the Social Security Administration.

bill (disapproving the two tax cancellations) was discharged from Senate
Finance Committee yesterday, 9/18.   The bill is now on the Senate

Means is likely to markup a compromise on the foreign tax provision next
week,and NEC is continuing to negotiate on the farmer coop provision.
