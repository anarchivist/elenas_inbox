 TEXT:
 Jenny Luray, the new director of the women's office, will start on
 November 30. As you probably know, she has been Rep. Lowey'S legislative
 director.  I am trying to set up a few meetings with key people for her
 that first week.  Is there a time that would be good for you?

 If you don't know her, she is terrific - and her appointment has been very
 well received in the women's community.
