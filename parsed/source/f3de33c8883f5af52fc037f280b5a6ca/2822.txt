                             PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
                             REMARKS FOR CLONING EVENT
                                   THE ROSE GARDEN
                                      JUNE 9, 1997

      Acknowledgments: Vice President Gore; Secretary Shalala; Dr. Harold Varmus, Dir.,
NIH; Dr. Jack Gibbons, the President's Advisor on Science and Technology; President's
Committee of Advisors of Science and Technology.

       I want to express my deep gratitude to Dr. Shapiro and the National Bioethics Advisory
Committee for preparing this report. As Dr. Shapiro mentioned, the time was short, the topic
was sensitive, and the ground to be covered was wide. I thank each of you for your commitment
and your courage to break new ground in public policy making.

        As the remarkable breakthrough in cloning we are here to address makes so clear, we are
living in a breathtaking era of scientific discovery. More and more, America's future -- and the
world's future -- depend on science and technology. And more and more, the scientific
community will influence the course of that future, and the lives our children will lead in the 21 st
century. As I said in my commencement address at Morgan State University last month, our
scientific explorations must be guided by our commitment to human values, the good of society,
and our basic sense of right from wrong.

        Just three months ago, scientists unlocked a profound mystery of human life ... and
unleashed the troubling possibility that this discovery could be used to create a child from human
genetic material. I said then and I believe just as strongly now that any discovery that touches
upon human creation is not simply a matter of scientific inquiry; it is a matter of morality and
spirituality.

        The possibility of creating a child through these new techniques mandates that we
proceed with caution, and with conscience. That is why I acted immediately to ban the use of
any federal funds for the cloning of human beings, and I urged the private sector to do the right
thing and observe this ban voluntarily. And that is why I asked the National Bioethics Advisory
Commission to prepare this report.

        For three months, the Commission has rigorously explored the scientific, moral and
spiritual dimensions of human cloning. You have talked to leading scientists and religious
leaders; philosophers and concerned families; patient advocates and the general public. And
from those many opinions and beliefs, one conclusion is clear: attempting to clone a human
being is unacceptably dangerous to the fetus and morally unacceptable to society.

         We are taking immediate action to prevent that possibility. Today, I am sending
legislation to Congress that prohibits anyone -- in either the private or the public sector -- from
                                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion

using these techniques to create a child for the next five years. Until the day I sign that
legislation into law, the moratorium I declared in March will remain in effect. Once again, I call
on the private sector to refrain from using these techniques to attempt to clone a human being.
There is still to much that we do not know -- and too much that we do not agree on -- to take the
risk of creating innocent children in this untested way.

        I want to make clear that there is nothing inherently immoral or wrong with these new
techniques. In fact, they hold out the promise of revolutionary new medical treatments and
life-saving cures; of better crops and stronger livestock. Cloning human tissues and cells is
already helping to improve the lives of millions of people, and this legislation will not prohibit it.
Finally, this bill will not ban the cloning of animals.

        What this legislation will do is give us time to continue the national dialogue we began
three months ago. It will give the scientific community time to investigate the viability and the
safety of these new techniques. It will give us time to reaffirm our most cherished beliefs about
the miracle of human life, and the God-given individuality that each person possesses. Or, it
will give us time to broaden those beliefs to include a new mystery, if to do so harms none and
benefits all.

       To make sure that all of our voices are heard as we explore the possibility of human
cloning, the legislation specifically requires the National Bioethics Advisory Commission to
continue to study the issue and report back to Congress after four and a half years. At that time,
we will decide whether the ban will continue, or whether we will enter a new chapter of human
life.

        We are still a long way from understanding all of the implications of this remarkable
breakthrough. But it is our obligation and our honor to confront the issues it raises -- as a
people. I am confident that the step we are taking today will continue that process. Once again,
I thank the National Bioethics Advisory Commission for the work you have done and will
continue to do in the coming years.

       Thank you and God bless you.
