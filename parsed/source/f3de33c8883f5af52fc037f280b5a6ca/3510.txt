TEXT:
fyi -- HR laS3, the Perkins Voc-Ed reauthorization bill, is expected to
pass by a wide margin on the House floor this afternoon.  Earlier this
week, subcommittee chairman Riggs and the Republicans reached a compromise
with Democrats on the bill's intra-state funding formula, heading off a
highly partisan vote. The bill would achieve several administration
goals, including streamlining the legislation from multiple different
set-asides to a single, flexible state grant program together with a
separate tech-prep program. However, there are still serious concerns
with the bill, including poor accountability for performance, limits on
the ability of states to implement programs for students to attain
industry-recognized skill standards (driven by the right wing), and
still-inadequate in-state targeting.   The Department of Education hopes
to be able to clean up some of these problems in the Senate.
