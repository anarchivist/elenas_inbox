Could you come up with some right-wingers? Any of the ones who got 3's
would be fine.  Or if you can think of some 4's or 5's. Let me know and
I'll respond.

Subject:         Reminder: Recommendations for Sylvia

Last week, I dropped a note off with Cathy that listed suggestions for
"super-types" that need to be addressed in the President's race
initiative. Sylvia would still like you to add recommended conservatives
to this list.  Please reply via this message or give her a call.

Many thanks.
