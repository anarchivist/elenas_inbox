        TEXT:
        Below is our weekly submission.

        We learned just recently that the amendment actually increased CCDBG by
        over $12 billion over 10 years -- $5 billion in the first 5 five years, at
        a billion a year, but in the second five years, it's over $7 billion, as
        it grows to $2 billion a year in the last year.    This amendment was done
        very quickly and the figures are related to spendout rates, so it's not
        clear that anyone really knew it was $12 billion over 10 years. However,
        the Republicans were mostly adament that the amendment increase funds at a
        lower level than the President's request, so Dodd's office believes that
        they'll be 'fine with a figure that is less than $15 over ten.

        The weekly submission has more information

        Children and Families: Child Care. With the strong leadership of Senator
        Dodd, the Senate passed an amendment to its budget resolution increasing
        mandatory funding for the child care block grant by $5 billion over five
        years, off-set by a reduction in the tax cut. This action is a signif
        icant demonstration of bipartisan support for boosting funding for child
        care subsidies, which your budget does by $7.5 billion over five years.
        The amendment also includes a non-binding provision stating that any child
        care tax relief for child care (i.e. expansion of the CDCTC), must benefit
        all working families (i.e. by making the credit refundable) and assist
        stay-at-home parents who care for an infant. After a motion to table the
        amendment was defeated, it won by voice vote. The twelve Republicans
        voting with the Democrats were Senators Abraham, Campbell, Chafee,
        Collins, Dewine, Frist, Hatch, Jeffords, Roberts, Snowe, Specter, and
        Warner.
