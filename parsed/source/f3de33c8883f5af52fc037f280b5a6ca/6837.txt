TEXT:
Elena,
At the meeting tonight, we agreed to try to get the executive summary to
the Hill tomorrow.   INS and Justice have given comments, and Michael is
looking it over.   If Michael thinks that it is o.k., it will go into the
LRM process for clearance and be circulated on the Hill as a draft.   If
this is not o.k., please let me know.   Thanks.

Julie
