Subject:         Car Seats Radio Address This Week

I spoke to Jen Palmieri and Mark Neschis in the Press Office about this
week's radio address on child safety seats. They would like to pitch this
to get people on Saturday morning shows, but need some draft paper in
order to do this.

Is it possible to get them draft paper, that they would use on an
embargoed basis (or they could just talk from it if we feel strongly about
not giving it on an embargoed basis) to pitch this? They would like to
have something by COB TODAY.

Let me know if we can do this.     Thanks!
