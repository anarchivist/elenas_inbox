research that produced an embryonic stem cell that is part human and part cow, we worked with
OSTP and Nlli to develop a recommendation to you for an appropriate, but strong response.
As you know, this work concluded with your approval of a letter to the Chair of the National
Bioethics Advisory Commission, Dr. Harold Shapiro, which outlined your serious concerns
about the most recent report. In the letter, you requested that the Commission analyze the
implications of the human/non-human stem cell research during their previously scheduled
meeting next week and to report back to you shortly thereafter. You also requested a
comprehensive review of other, more promising types of stem cell research, which appear to
have great treatment potential for illnesses such as cancer, diabetes and heart disease, "balancing
all ethical and medical considerations." This latter request has implications as it relates to the
Congress' current prohibition against any embryo research. If the human-only stem cell research
falls under this prohibition (as may well be likely), there will be growing pressure to develop a
more carefully constructed and narrow prohibition from the research community (including Nlli
Director Varmus) and many patients' advocates. If you have an interest in moving in this
direction, the Commission's findings and recommendations to your second request could well
provide the ethical and scientific justification for a change in current law.
