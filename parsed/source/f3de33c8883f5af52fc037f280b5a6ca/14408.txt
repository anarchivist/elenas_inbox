TEXT:
The West Wing server will be down between midnight tonight and 6:00 am for
"preventive maintenance".  You will be able to access only WordPerfect6.1 and
Lotus and will receive the following error messages if you try to login when the
server is down. You should follow these steps when prompted:
1. You cannot be authenticated on the server. Do you wish to be authenticated
to another server? SELECT NO.
2. Unable to load Central Profile.   SELECT NO.
3. A Domain controller could not be contacted.   SELECT NO.
Bottom line : **Please remember to power off your PC before you leave tonight**
