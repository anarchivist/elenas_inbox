TEXT:
BR/EK:

Spoke to Deich a short while ago.  He wanted our helping in solving the
Edley problem on new funds for states to focus more on civil rights
prosecutions.

Deich, providing we're fine w/it, wants to add a new $5 million civil
rights initiative that would give small grants to the states to better
coordinate civil rights enforcement. He has found new money, or an
accounting gimmick at least, so crime or civil rights funds already in the
budget won't be affected. The program will be overseen by OJP, and it
won't be linked to our prosecutors program. That said, he's hoping we
won't oppose him simply sneaking this new $5 million initiative to the
budget.

I told him that I would check w/you both, but -- with his assurance that
our budget items aren't impacted      he should go ahead and assume we'll be
okay with the addition ... so long as he called Edley for the flagrant
process foul.

Hope you folks are okay with this; if not, let me or Michael know.

Jose'
