TEXT:
I think our top message priorities for the next 10 days should be 1)
Release of afterschool money; 2) Patients Bill of Rights report; and
possibly 3) child care #'s.

We're just stupid if we don't put out the afterschool $ before the
election, since almost all of it will go to Democratic districts.  The
news value of the Patients report is harder to predict, but it would make
a good Halloween radio address (top priority for next year, etc.). The
child care #'s can probably hold till later -- or I suppose we could
release them in conjunction with signing Head Start.
