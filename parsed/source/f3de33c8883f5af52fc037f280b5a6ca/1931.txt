MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:                  Bruce Reed

SUBJECT:               Potential Policy Announcements for the Summit

DATE:                  April 23, 1997

The following are potential policy announcements you could make at the upcoming Summit on
service and in the radio address on Saturday.

RADIO ADDRESS
You will announce that we are sending our America Reads legislation to the Hill, and use that
opportunity to emphasize AmeriCorps' role in America Reads. You can also talk about your
vision of the Summit and highlight America Reads as a great example of meeting the Summit's
challenge on volunteering, tutoring, and literacy. In addition, you can announce that Federal
agencies are making a "commitment" to the Summit that they will expand the number of schools
that they have adopted or established partnerships with from approximately 1,500 schools to
2,000 schools by the year 2000. Working through partnerships established by their agencies,
Federal employees tutor, purchase equipment, and hold career days.

MONDA Y SPEECH AT SUMMIT
When you laid out your original vision of national service back in 1992, you set forth two
fundamental principles that captured the public imagination: first, that all young Americans
willing to give something back should have the chance to get help for college; and second, that
we should challenge those young people to help solve our toughest problems, "as teachers, police
officers, child care workers -- doing work our country desperately needs," as you said in the first
Georgetown speech.

AmeriCorps, though still a well-kept secret, has gone a long way toward realizing your overall
ideal of citizen service. But for budgetary and partisan political reasons, it will not become
universal anytime soon, and because of its decentralized structure, AmeriCorps has not
succeeded in marshaling a nation-wide effort to target a compelling national problem like
education or crime.

Your speech in Philadelphia is a chance to breathe new life into that original ideal. We can't
escape the budgetary constraints, but we can give more young people an incentive to serve, and
most important, we can set forth a clear national mission of the problems we need them to solve.
The following proposal are designed with that in mind.
                                                                     Hex-Oilmp Con1la:sion

1. Interest-free Year of Service
As you know, Rev. Tony Campolo has urged you to make it easier for college students and recent
graduates to take a year off for service. Thanks to your income-contingent loan program and to
earlier changes allowing loan deferments for service, students can already take advantage of
reduced loan payments if they take low-paying service jobs, and can take time off for service
without having to begin repayment of their loans. Your FY98 budget also includes a proposal to
encourage service by no longer treating loan forgiveness as taxable income, so that students who
universities forgive their loans will no longer have to pay taxes on it.

The only remaining barrier is the interest that accumulates on unsubsidized loans during the
period of service. The cost of having the Federal government pay that interest is minimal-- $7
million over 5 years. This is an inexpensive proposal, and the typical benefit is not enormous,
but it would make this policy universal, and it would allow any young person to take time off to
serve without increasing his or her debt burden. The Education Department has expressed some
concerns about this.

2. Police Corps
You can announce $20 million in grants to 17 states for the Police Corps program. The Police
Corps was created in your 1994 Crime Bill to increase the number of community police officers
with advanced education and training, and was one of your pledges during the 1992 presidential
campaIgn.

The Police Corps offers educational assistance to qualified college students who commit to enter
the police after· graduation and serve in the force for at least four years. Students accepted into
the Police Corps receive up to $7,500 in educational assistance for up to four years of
undergraduate study. In addition, Corps recruits receive 16 weeks of rigorous training to help
make them effective community police officers. As an incentive to police departments to take
recruits, state and local law enforcement agencies receive cash assistance for employing Police
Corps officers -- $10,000 per participant for each year of the recruit's service.

This announcement nearly triples the number of states that will receive Police Corps funds, from
6 to 17 states, and is double the funding appropriated in FY 1996 for the program. It will fund
about 650 recruits. Your FY 1998 budget contains $20 million in funding for Police Corps.

3. Teacher Corps
We believe your Summit speech should include a ringing call to service for young people to
teach in inner cities. Nothing would do more to breathe new life into the ethic of service than to
enlist young Americans in a national effort to transform inner-city schools that are crying out for
their energy, idealism, and talent.                          .

One way to do this would be to announce the proposal described below, which provides $400
million over four years in incentives for approximately 48,000 new teachers. If this seems too
costly to propose in the current budget environment, it could be ramped up more slowly at about
half the cost and impact. You could also propose a more modest expansion of AmeriCorps'
                                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion
                                                 3

support for Teach for America, as long as we also address quality concerns about that program.
Alternatively, your speech could simply include a strong call to young people to take up the
challenge of teaching in inner cities without proposing a new initiative to provide federal support.
 Such an initiative could still be included in the Administration's Higher Education Act proposal,
which will be transmitted this summer.

Over the next decade, the nation will need to hire some 2.3 million teachers. Of these,
approximately 15%, or 345,000 (approximately 35,000 per year), will be hired in central cities, in
schools with large concentrations of low income students. An additional 207,000
(approximately 20,000 per year) will be needed in isolated, and often poor, rural areas. These
types of communities face the greatest difficulties in attracting and retaining qualified teachers.
Urban areas in particular receive significantly fewer applications for positions than neighboring
suburban districts, and attrition rates in urban areas can often reach 30% to 50% in the first five
years. They are therefore most likely to fill classroom vacancies with teachers who lack
preparation, don't meet licensure requirements, or who are teaching outside their field. As a
result, the students in these communities -- who need the most qualified teachers in order to meet
higher academic standards -- often get exactly the opposite in the classroom.

We propose a new national effort to help attract and retain teachers in high poverty central city
and rural schools. This new initiative would be a part of the Administration's proposal for
the reauthorization of Title V of the Higher Education Act. The basic framework for this
initiative could be announced at the summit, while many of the details could be further
developed by the Education Department over the coming months.

This initiative would provide competitive grants to 100 local partnerships involving urban or
rural school districts and institutions of higher education, to be used to provide incentives for
individuals to prepare to teach, and to remain, in underserved schools. These would include
2-3 year fellowships for undergraduate students (including for a "5th year" program that provides
intensive and sustained classroom experience for undergraduates after they have acquired a
strong liberal arts background); one-year graduate fellowships for post-baccalaureate students,
including recent liberal arts graduate and mid-career professionals seeking to enter
teaching; stipends for teachers' aides and other education paraprofessionals seeking to
move up a career ladder into full teaching positions; and 1-2 year "residencies" for
beginning teachers that would provide a lighter teaching load coupled with additional time
for class preparation, being coached or mentored, or working in other ways with more
experienced teachers.

The incentives would range from fellowships that cover tuition and fees (which average
$3,500 at undergraduate public institutions) to forgivable loans to salary supplements for
beginning teachers. Successful competitors would have to demonstrate that they have a high
quality teacher preparation program, and that the program fits into a comprehensive, thoughtful
strategy for recruiting and retaining teachers.
                                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion ·
                                                  4

The Education Department proposes to fund this initiative at $100 million a year for five years,
beginning with the FY1999 budget. The Education Department estimates that this initiative will
help attract and retain at least 48,000 teachers into high poverty central city and rural schools.
This is approximately 17% of the estimated need in those communities. This is not an issue for
this year's appropriations battles, and we have not tried to identify a specific offset. However, it
will compete with your other discretionary priorities in the out-years. If you wish to proceed, we
will work with OMB to determine what funding level we can commit to right now, recognizing
that the parameters ofNDD spending may change before we submit the FY99 budget.

We are also exploring ways to link this initiative to AmeriCorps, which already provides
scholarships (but no stipends) to 1,000 teachers in Teach for America. As you know, Teach for
America has been fairly successful in capturing the imagination of the public and of college
students, but to this point has not provided the preparation and support those new teachers need
to succeed in the classroom and remain in the profession. We could use existing scholarship
funds to expand AmeriCorps' commitment to Teach for America, but we should also look for
ways to make sure that preparation needs are addressed.

4. Child Care Corps
You cquld also announce that you will expand AmeriCorps to include a new child care corps.
The child care field has great difficulty attracting and retaining qualified workers, especially
well-educated and trained workers who can go on to become leaders in the field. Your recent
conference on early learning was the latest confirmation that it is critical to increase the quality of
child care. Yet very few of our most talented young people enter this field.

The program would offer AmeriCorps scholarships to individuals who agree to work in child
care in low-income areas for two years. It would be open both to those currently working in the
field and to those seeking to enter. Members of the corps would not get a stipend from
AmeriCorps, but a scholarship of $4,725 a year for two years, which could be used either to
repay' existing student loans or to pay for further education. Some of these scholarships could be
earmarked to help people leaving welfare to get college training to become child care workers.

The Corporation for National Service estimates that it could support a corps of2,000 people a
year without any increase in their budget or permission from Congress, as long as these
individuals get only scholarships and not stipends as well. Under pressure from members of
Congress to reduce the cost of an AmeriCorps member, the Corporation has begun to emphasize
these "scholarship only" awards, and its scholarship trust fund has excess funds.

Non-profit groups would apply to become part of this program, and would have to demonstrate
that they could offer participants high-quality training and mentoring during their two years of
service, including development of management and leadership skills. In addition, corporations
could sponsor members by paying for their salaries, and universities that specialize in early
childhood education could match our scholarships.
                                                                        Hex-Dump Conve:Slon

5_ Mentoringffutoring 1 Million Kids
In preparation for the Summit, Federal agencies have joined their counterparts in the private and
non-profit sectors by making public "commitments" to the goals of the Summit. Agencies have
identified over 40 initiatives where they will work with partners in the volunteer or service
sectors to mentor and tutor kids, expand afterschool programs, and offer young people
opportunities to serve. We are trying to determine whether these commitments add up to an
additional 1 million kids being mentored or tutored as a result of Federal government efforts.

FIRST LADY SPEECH AT CLOSING CEREMONY
The First Lady will represent the Administration at the closing ceremony on Tuesday. We are
exploring the option that she could announce Kaiser Permanente's commitment of$100 million
over the next five years to provide health coverage to 50,000 children in California.
