Subject:         Boston Event

Nobody thinks we should go to a Boys and Girls Club, don't worry.  It
would be a horrible message. The problem is there are no policing/crime
alternatives. Therefore, I think it would be best if we go to neutral
territory -- U.MASS. -- and have a roundtable in one room, and then the
President will give a major speech to a crowd of 5,000+.

Also, following is the list of roundtable participants that I think would
work:
POTUS
RENO
MAYOR MENINO
POLICE COMMISSIONER PAUL EVANS
D.A. RALPH MARTIN (afric. amer.-extremely articulate/involved in Boston
strategy)
PROBATION OFFICER TANYA BROOKS (in uniform)
CHIEF PROBATION OFFICER BERNIE FITZPATRICK
JEFF FOEHM -ATF GUN TRACKING AGENT IN CHARGE
JOE CHERY - african american (son killed in gang crossfire)
BOSTON NUN
DORCHESTER YOUTH - met President at DOJ, turned away from gangs b/c of
community policing officer's intervention. Hispanic, mid teens.

OTHER ELECTED   O~FICIALS:
GOVERNOR
CONGRESSMAN
SENATOR
SENATOR

Please let me know what you think of the UMASS and this list.
