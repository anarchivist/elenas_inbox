TEXT:
Bruce/Elena:
As you know, the President has expressed interest in doing an event in
Indian country. Last Friday, Mary and I attended a meeting w/ Sylvia and
Lynn to discuss how this should be done.  Sylvia's idea was to have the
President, the First Lady, maybe the VP and various Cabinet members go to
different reservations (or areas of high Indian population) on the same
day, and link it to a PIR national day of dialogue.  The President would
participate in a roundtable discussion with tribal leaders.  Sylvia asked
that we (DPC) work with NEC to develop some ideas for economic development
in Indian country that could be announced on that day.  Mary has also
mentioned to Mike that we would likely want to have our executive order on
Native American education completed by then.  Richard Socarides is working
with Jen Palmieri to get a date sometime in late summer (likely August) .
