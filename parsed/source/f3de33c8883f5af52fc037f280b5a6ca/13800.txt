TEXT:
The following draft is based on the draft Presidential statement
you sent me.  If it looks OK to you, I will circulate it. If the
President does, in fact, issue a statement, I intend to convert
the SAP into a single sentence referencing (and attaching) the
President's statement.
s. 1219 - Senate Campaign Finance Reform Act
(McCain (R) AZ and __ cosponsors)

The Administration strongly supports Senate passage of S. 1219.
This bipartisan legislation includes many proposals that have
been endorsed by President since 1992. It will limit campaign
spending, provide free and discounted broadcast time to
candidates for Federal office, curb the influence of political
action committees and lobbyists, and put an end to the "soft
money" system. S. 1219 will open the political process and shift
power from special interests to ordinary citizens.
