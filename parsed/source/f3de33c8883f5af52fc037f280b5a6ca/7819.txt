    The final version is:  $150 million annually.   $50 million of that is
    guaranteed from the trust fund and guaranteed funding increases by $25
    million each year.  The reverse commute program will receive $10
    million of the guaranteed $50 million.   It is unclear whether the
    reverse commute funding increases over time as well.

    Janno, Linda, and I are thrilled!      We have come a long way since the
    idea was first proposed.
