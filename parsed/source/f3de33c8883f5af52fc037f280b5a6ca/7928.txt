DRAFT -- NOT FOR RELEASE

(House Rules)




H.J.Res. 78 -Joint Resolution Proposing an Amendment to the Constitution
of the United States Restoring Religious Freedom
(Istook (R) Oklahoma and 153 cosponsors)

The Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.J.Res. 78.  The
Nation currently has a constitutional amendment that protects religious
liberty.  It is the First Amendment.  Public school students are free to
voluntarily pray privately and individually at school.  Students already
have a right to say grace at lunchtime. They have the right to meet in
religious groups on school grounds and use school facilities like any
other school club.  They have the right to read the Bible, or any
religious text during study hall or other free class time.  Similarly,
people who wish to engage in religious expression on public property have
the same rights as people who wish to engage in comparable nonreligious
expression. For over 200 years, the First Amendment has protected our
rights to be as religious as we choose. Congress should not tamper with
this most precious liberty.  The First Amendment should not be rewritten.

(Do Not Distribute Outside Executive Office of the President)

This Statement of Administration Policy was developed by the Legislative
Reference Division (Schroeder) in consultation with the Departments of
Justice (Taylor) and Education (Riddle),  WHLA (Jacoby), WH Counsel
(Marshall), DPC (Fernandes), TCJS (Boden) and HRD (Mustain).

OMB/LA clearance:

The House Judiciary Committee reported H.J.Res. 78 with an amendment in
the nature of a substitute on May 19, 1998.

Administration Position to Date

The Administration has not previously taken a position on H.J.Res. 78.

On May 30, 1998, the President stated in his weekly radio address that
amending the Constitution is the wrong way to protect religious freedom.
The address further stated that "[f]or more than 200 years, the First
Amendment has protected our religious freedom and allowed ~any faiths to
flourish in our homes, in our workplaces and in our schools. Clearly


understood and sensibly applied, it works ..   It does not need to be
rewritten."

Background

According to the House Judiciary Committee's report on H.J.Res. 78, the
legislation was introduced in response to concerns that "the Supreme Court
and lower courts have misinterpreted the Co~stitution by issuing rulings
that severely restrict religious expression when other forms of free
speech are not so restricted, and which result in discrimination against a
religious viewpoint in public affairs."

Summary of H.J.Res. 78

H.J.Res. 78 would amend the Constitution to explicitly provide for an
individual's religious rights to worship on public property, including
schools, and prohibit the Government from requiring any person to: (1)
join religious activities; (2) initiate or designate school prayers; (3)
discriminate against religion; or (4) deny equal access to a benefit on
account of religion.

Pay-As-You-Go Scoring

According to BASD (Balis), H.J.Res. 78 does not affect direct spending or
receipts and, therefore, is not subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement
of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act.  CBO concurs.
