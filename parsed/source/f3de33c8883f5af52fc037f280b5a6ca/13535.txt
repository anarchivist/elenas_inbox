Is a judicial rejection (which is what it appeare to be) of a
settlement proposal appealable?  (I can't recall from civ pro or
wherever I should have learned this.) This is certainly highly
unusual, isn't it?

TEXT:
murkowski has a hearing scheduled on the tlmp on the 18th.   i
think overall, this is an opportunity for us to proclaim our
pro-timber, -fish, -tourism, -recreation message against the loud
cries of these old timber beasts ..... we're on the right side of
this issue.
but, want to alert you to some curveballs:
1. on our tongass settlement, the judge has basically declined to
even consider our settlement proposal that we reached with envtl
plaintiffs and instead has simply ordered us back to the table
with all parties -- including timber companies. he even has
directed that we must meet for at least 5 hours a day!   curiously
enough, he has decided that we should continue this just up til
april 17th--one day before murkowski's hearing.    now, i am of
course confident of the independence of the judiciary. but, this
judge is a r and has political ambitions.   i smell a rat.  i think
we are being set up to fail in settlement discussions just the
day before murkowski can then beat the hell out of us in his
hearing.
2. our dear forest service---we have not seen what the tlmp looks
like. but we are starting to hear loud howls from the enviros


that it is awful and calls for a god-awful level of timber
harvest. we are trying to arrange a briefing. but, i have a
crummy feeling about this ..... .
obviously, all of this is a major problem when we are beating back
all of the free world in the budget process in opposing the
tongass rider.
happy days.
