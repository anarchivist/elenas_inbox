POLL SHOWS MOST AMERICANS DISAGREE WITH SENATE MAJORITY LEADER TRENT LOTT'S
ATTACK ON GAYS

Poll Suggests Recent Republican Onslaught Against Gays Could Alienate Swing
Voters, According to HRC

WASHINGTON -- Anti-gay comments made by Majority Leader Trent Lott earlier
this month do not reflect the majority opinion in this country says a new
poll released today by the Human Rights Campaign.
         "Senator Lott might be scoring points with religious political
activists on the right, but his views don't reflect those of a majority of
American voters who believe in fairness and equality," said David M. Smith,
communications director and senior strategist for the Human Rights
Campaign.
        The survey conducted by Lake Snell Perry asked 931 registered
voters: Trent Lott, the Republican Majority Leader, recently made a
statement that said homosexuality is a sin and compared it to alcoholism
and kleptomania. Others say that homosexuality is inherent and not a
choice, and that all Americans should be treated equally and fairly by
lawmakers. Which of these statements comes closer to your own opinion: 24%
said homosexuality is a sin and a disease; 55% said that homosexuality is
inherent and that all Americans should be treated fairly; 14% said neither
or both; 4% said don't know; and 3% refused to answer.
        These numbers cut across partisan lines with 62% of democrats, 57%
of independents and 41% of republicans saying that homosexuality is
inherent and gay Americans should be treated equally. 18% of democrats, 21%
of independents, and 35% of republicans saying that homosexuality is a sin:
          "Strong majorities of democrat and independent voters and a
plurality of republican voters do not share Lott's views," said Smith, who
oversees polling for HRC. "This poll suggests that there could be a price
to pay with key middle ground voters who object to the Republican
Congressional leadership's stepped up campaign year attacks on gay people,"
cautioned HRC political director Winnie Stachelberg.
        The Human Rights Campaign is the largest national lesbian and gay
political organization, with members throughout the country. It effectively
lobbies Congress, provides campaign support, and educates the public to
ensure that lesbian and gay Americans can be open, honest, and. safe at
home, at work, and in the community.
