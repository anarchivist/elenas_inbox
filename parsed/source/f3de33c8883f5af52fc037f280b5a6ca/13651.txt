     TEXT:
     DOJ tells me there will be a White House announcement on Monday of
     a crime initiative. The announcement will describe several
     legislative proposals, most of which have not been received for
     clearance yet.  Justice would like to clearance of the concepts
     and provide language shortly.
     According to Justice, the announced package will consist of:
             4 legislative proposals that have already been cleared:
             the Enhanced Prosecution of Dangerous Juvenile Offenders
            Act; the Methamphetamine Abuse Strategy; Gun-Free School
            Zones Act; and the ....
             2 Congressional bills: a Biden bill to change the
            classification of a particular drug and a draft Schumer
            bill to create drug and gun courts for juveniles; and
             4-6 DOJ proposals that are still being developed.

     I will circulate the two Congressional bills this morning and the
     DOJ proposals as soon as I receive them.
     I also understand the intention is for the package to be
     transmitted shortly thereafter by the President.
     We will need to clear them by mid-afternnon Friday.
