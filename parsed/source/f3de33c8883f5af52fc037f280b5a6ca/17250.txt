FROM:      OMB LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS

DATE:      OCTOBER 6, 1997

SUBJECT:           LEGISLATIVE REPORT


Military Construction Act/Item Vetoes:   Following the PresidentO,s
line-item veto announcement of 38 cancellations in the Military
Construction Appropriations Act, Senators Stevens and Burns held a press
conference, where Chairman Stevens indicated his intention to introduce a
bill to disapprove some of the cancellations.
        Under the Item Veto ActO,s procedures, any disapproval bill
introduced in the House of Representatives must disapprove .all of the
PresidentO,s cancellations (although there are procedures for striking
some of the disapprovals on the Floor).   By contrast, in the Senate, a
disapproval bill need not cover all cancellations. Senators will have
until October 20 to introduce a disapproval bill -- i.e., 5 session days
following transmittal of the cancellations.

Acting Deputy Director for Management Ed DeSeve testified today before the
Subcommittee on Government Management, Information, and Technology of the
House Government Reform and Oversight Committee regarding the OMB
Strategic Plan.

On Wednesday, October 8th, Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan
will appear before the House Budget Committee to discuss long-term budget
challenges at 10:00am in 210 Cannon House Office Building.
