                   NATIONAL PEACE OFFICERS MEMORIAL EVENT

                             DATE:          May 15, 1997
                             LOCATION:      West Grounds of the Capitol
                             BRIEFING TIME: 12:30 am - 12:00 pm
                             EVENT TIME:    12:00 pm - 12:30 pm
                             FROM:          Bruce Reed/Rahrn Emanuel


I.    PURPOSE

      To honor the lives of officers who were killed in the line of duty in 1996 and their
      SUrviVorS.


II.   BACKGROUND

      You will be attending for your fourth consecutive year the National Peace Officers
      Memorial Event sponsored by the Fraternal Order of Police (FOP). This event will honor
      the 116 officers who were killed in the line of duty in 1996, the fewest officers killed
      since 1959. The names of those fallen officers are being enshrined on the National Law
      Enforcement Officers Memorial in Washington, DC and were officially dedicated on
      Monday, May 12 in a candlelight vigil. In 1993 you attended the candlelight vigil. The
      National Law Enforcement officers Memorial was built in 1991 and bears the names of
      more than 14,000 federal, state and local law enforcement officers who have died in the
      line of duty.

      In addition to honoring those that lost their lives, you will be making the following
      announcements:

      ·      NEW "BRADY" FORMS-- You will announce that by today (May 15, 1997) the
             ATF will have sent out revised "Brady" forms (Form 4473) to all Federal
             Firearms Licensees. In response to the Empire State Building shooting by a
             foreign visitor, you asked Secretary Rubin to change the federal regulations and
             existing Brady form to better restrict gun access to foreign visitors and to tighten
             up residency requirements. The revised Brady form requires a prospective gun
             purchaser to make an affirmative statement that they reside in the State of the gun
             dealer, and-- in the case of noncitizens-- show secondary forms of identification to
             prove State residency, such as a utility bill or lease.

                 ·      CHILD SAFETY LOCKS
                        You will announce that consistent with your March 5, 1997 directive, all FBI and
                        ATF agents-- nearly 13,000, or 20% of all federal law enforcement officers-- have
                        now been provided child safety locks to prevent accidental or unauthorized use of
                        their firearms. The remaining federal law enforcement officers will be provided
                        with child safety locks no later than October 15, 1997.
