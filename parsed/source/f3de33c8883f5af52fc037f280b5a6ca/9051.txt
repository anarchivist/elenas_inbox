welfare and Food Stamp recipients stating that the county will report to the INS undocumented
adults living in the recipients' home. Secretary Glickman and Secretary Shalala are concerned
that this will deter undocumented parents from applying for assistance for their U.S. citizen
children. Currently, San Diego's application form asks individuals to state their immigration
status (including a box marked "undocumented"), even if they are not applying for benefits for
themselves. While states have complete discretion to set T ANF eligibility standards, they must
follow national Food Stamp standards and must "provide timely, accurate, and fair service" to
applicants and recipients.

        Pending final review by the Justice Department, we believe we have the authority to tell
the county that this practice would violate the "fair service" requirement of the Food Stamp law
by making eligible children unable to access benefits to which they are entitled. The
Department could promulgate a regulation to buttress this legal argument. However, San Diego
could still proceed to obtain immigration status for TANF families, which may have an equally
chilling effect. In addition, an official letter to the county may ignite a public confrontation
which would make it harder for San Diego to back down.

         Thus, we propose as a first step to have USDA engage in low key conversations with the
county, asking questions and pointing out possible pitfalls of proceeding, i.e., the potential
budget costs to the county (more children relying on county-funded nutrition and foster care
programs, especially if their parents are deported) and the possibility that the county may need to
use more than one application form (for Food Stamps vs. other programs). USDA plans to
contact the county next week to make plans for a team to visit. If these discussions are not
fruitful, then a letter followed by a regulation could still be the next step.
