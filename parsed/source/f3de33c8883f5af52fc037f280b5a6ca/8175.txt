 MEMORANDUM FOR ERSKINE BOWLES

 THROUGH:                            Jack Lew

 FROM:                       Donald R. Arbuckle

 SUBJECT:                            HHSD,s interim final rule on
 Medicare+Choice program


         In the next few days, we will be completing review of a Department
 of Health and Human Services (HHS) interim final rule that establishes the
 new Medicare+Choice (M+C) program. The rule is very time sensitive
 because HHS has already missed its statutory deadline of June 1 required
 by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. The rule is expected to have budget
 savings of $30 billion over the next five years.

         One of the major provision in the rule is allowing Medicare
 eligible individuals who opt for this program a choice about the type of
 health care service they want.  The choices include M+C coordinated care
 plans -- from health maintenance organizations (HMOs) and preferred
 provider organizations (PPOs) to the new provider-sponsored organizations
 (PSOs); M+C Medical Savings Accounts plans; and M+C private
 fee-for-service plans. The regulation requires Medicare beneficiaries to
 receive comparative information to aid their plan selection. The Health
 Care and Financing Administration will .coordinate an annual election
 period, the first one will begin November 1998, for initiation of the
 program in January 1, 1999. In addition, the Medicare+Choice program will
 reimburse plans on a capitated basis.

         The health care industry is anxious for expeditious publication of
 this rule, since the plans must be prepared for beneficiary enrollment in
 November 1998. Many of the ruleD,s policies are identical or similar to
 existing Medicare HMO, private accreditation, and quality assurance
 policies. However, the implementation of these policies in the
 Medicare+Choice program is on a larger scale and the program marks the
 first time that different service delivery options (including the new
 PSOs) will be presented side-by-side to Medicare beneficiaries. We
 believe this isa good rule implementing important and beneficial
 policies. HHS expects significant comment on the rule, and anticipates
 that future refinements may be necessary.

            Please let me know if you have any questions.
