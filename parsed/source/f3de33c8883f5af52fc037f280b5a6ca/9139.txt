TEXT:
The food council got mentions on CBS and CNN. The stories in USA Today,
WP, and WT were ok, they got our headline out.   I was disappointed,
though, by Caroline Smith Dewall's quotes in the papers today.  FYI.  I
called her and made several points: that this is not consistent with what
she has said (she had sent me an email saying "thank you, thank you, thank
you, thank you"), and that it hurts the issue internally.  She said: she
was unhappy with the way she was quoted and was writing a letter to WT,
but doesn't feel confident about OSTP.
