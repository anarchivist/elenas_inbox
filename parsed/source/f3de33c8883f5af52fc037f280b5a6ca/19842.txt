                                                   May 10,1998


        Dear Majority Leader Lott and Speaker Gingrich,

                The report to be released today by the General Accounting Office calls on Congress to
        give the Food and Drug Administration the authority to ensure that food eligible for import to the
        United States is produced under food safety systems that will provide the same level of
        protection as the safety systems in place in the United States. This report is further confirmation
        of the need for Congress to pass the Safety ofImported Food Act, which I called for in October
        1997, and Senators Mikulski and Kennedy, and Representatives Eshoo and Pallone have
        introduced.

                 This important legislation will do what the GAO says is necessary: it will ensure that the
        FDA denies the entry of imports of fruits, vegetables, or other food from a foreign country or
        facility that does not meet U.S. food safety requirements or otherwise achieve the level of
        protection required in the United States. It will give FDA the authority it urgently needs,
        comparable to USDA's existing authority to prevent the importation of unsafe meat and poultry,
        to protect the safety of the food Americans eat.

                 I have taken several further steps to begin implementing standards to ensure the safety of
        imported food. My FY '99 budget committed approximately $25 million to enabling the FDA
        to dramatically expand its international food inspection force in order to implement the pending
        legislation. In March ofthis year I released a report on how the Secretary of Health and Human
        Services, in partnership with the Secretary of Agriculture, and in cooperation with the
        agricultural community, will develop guidance on good agricultural and manufacturing practices
        that will apply to both domestic and foreign producers.

                There is no more important task our government faces than ensuring the safety of the
        American food supply. That is why last year I announced my comprehensive new initiative,
        "Food Safety from Farm to Table" -- which detailed a comprehensive program including
        surveillance, outbreak response, education and research. The Safety of Imported Food Act is
        another vital step in working to protect the safety of all the food Americans eat, and I urge you to
        pass it promptly.


                                              Sincerely,
