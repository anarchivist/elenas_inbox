TEXT:
Elena, OMB and FDA told me the Food Safety 90-day report is completed.
Dr. Friedman wanted to mention that the report is completed and set to go
out during his congressional testimony on Wednesday.  This seems to be ok
-- it doesn't seem like much of an announcement for an event.  Let me
know, Mary
