TEXT:
A group of House Republicans led by Speaker Gingrich introduced a bill WEdnesday
that would force unions to divulge how workers' dues are being spent for
poitcial activities. A House GOP leadership source Wednesday morning described
the legilsation as "a bill that will asssert a worker's constitutional right to
be flly informed of how teir mandatory union dues are being spent to make the
straightforward, common sense and reasonable request that before workers'
coerced union dues are spent for political purposes that they a) be informed and
b) give permission." This is the bill based on Supreme Court's Beck-decision
that we had anticipated.
