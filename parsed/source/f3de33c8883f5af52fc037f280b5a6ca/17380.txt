EK:

Here a draft of a short memo recommending that the President support our
border coordination process, not the General's.  It's just a cover piece
-- no real options or substance.  Let me know if you need anything else on
this.

Also, I understand CR met with the AG, and she expressed her concern on
various issues -- border, Drug Blueprint, etc.  CR told her that you and
he would send a memo to POTUS setting the record straight.

Finally, as if it couldn't get any more exciting on this front, I found
out today that despite OMB's strong objects (and DPC's support of their
position), ONDCP sent the Drug Blueprint document out to hundreds of folks
in the field.  Deich is not happy and believes it violates the
Raines/McCaffrey agreement to keep the document in-house and in draft form
until the budget process was completed.  I'm not sure what will happen on
this, but can't help but think that GMc is starting to step on lot of toes
at once ...

Jose'

MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM BRUCE REED
          CHUCK RUFF

RE:         ONDCP's Recommendations for the Southwest Border Region


       Attached please find a memorandum from General McCaffrey outlining
recommendations on how to improve the Administration's drug interdiction
efforts along the Southwest border. Although we share the General's concerns,
we do not support his recommendations at this time -- and do not believe this
issue should be tasked to the Drug Policy Council for resolution. We have
several reasons for this.

       First, the Treasury and Justice Departments have strong reservations about
ONDCP's recommendations. In fact, less than a month ago, we met with
Secretary Rubin, Attorney General Reno and General McCaffrey to discuss
coordination of border-related issues. At that time, General McCaffrey was
preparing to send a report to Congress on the Southwest border that made the
same recommendations as the attached memorandum. Secretary Rubin and
the Attorney General expressed their opposition to this report being sent to
Congress without their input, and General McCaffrey agreed to hold the report.
 Rubin and Reno -- who oversee the various enforcement agencies that carry
out the drug, crime, trade and immigration laws along the border -- do not
necessarily agree with the General's characterization of the border situation or
with his proposed recommendations. Perhaps their largest concern is that the
assigning of a single, federal official at each point of entry to coordinate drug
interdiction will negatively impact or conflict with our immigration and trade
policies.

       Second, several other border-related issues are currently being discussed
in the White House and among the agencies -- and will need to be resolved
over the next few months. For instance, the Commission on Immigration Reform
recently released its final report recommending that the Immigration and
Naturalization Service (INS) be disbanded and its responsibilities -- including
border enforcement -- parceled out to various agencies. Also, Members of
Congress have introduced INS reform plans and included appropriations
language requiring the Administration to do the same by early next year.

     Lastly, at our recent meeting with Secretary Rubin, the Attorney General
and General McCaffrey, we proposed that all of border consolidation issues
                                Hex-Dump Conversion
should be coordinated by a White House-led working group because of all the
cross-cutting issues involved -- drugs, crime, immigration and trade. We have
already met internally and concluded that such a group would be led by DPC;
include Counsel's Office, OMB, NSC and NPR; and specifically reach out to all of
the impacted agencies. We are prepared to initiate these meetings
immediately and -- at OMB's request -- expect to have some initial
recommendations before the year's end and before the budget process is
concluded.

     Thus, we would recommend that you support our broader effort to
coordinate border issues.
