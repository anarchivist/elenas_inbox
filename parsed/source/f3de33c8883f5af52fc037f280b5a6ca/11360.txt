        TEXT:
    o   Q: How do you respond to Congressman Thomas' charge that the White House
        is directing the Presidential appointees not to compromise?

        A:  First, any suggestion that the White House has pressured its members
        to take any position is both inaccurate and insulting. As Stuart Altman
        said yesterday, any such charge is "nonsense." Our appointees are well
        respected health care experts who have long-standing opinions on this
        important issue. Their positions have not changed or altered at any point
        during the work of the Commission.

        The President's Commission members, particularly Dr. Tyson and Dr. Altman,
        have indicated an openness to new, competitive reforms, but they have also
        underscored their belief that: (1) there be new and substantial revenue
        dedicated to strengthen the financial health of the program, such as the
        President's proposal to allocate 15% of the surplus to Medicare, (2) any
        structural reform should retain a defined benefit and analysis be provided
        to understand its impact on beneficiaries and providers; and (3) there be
        a long overdue and affordable prescription drug benefit available to all
        beneficiaries.  To date, our Members have informed us that their minimum
        requirements have not been met. Our hope, of course, is that this
        situation will change. But, once again, we do not feel it serves any
        fruitful purpose for the White House to comment on every individual
        iteration of the Commission's recommendations. We look forward to
        learning about the final deliberations of the Commission.

        Q:  Senator Lott suggested that the White House should encourage its
        members to support Senator Breaux so that the Commission can get the 11
        votes it needs to report out its recommendation.  He also indicated that
        if there weren't 11 votes, the Congress would not be able to pass out a
        Medicare reform package this year. How do you respond?

        A:  First, we aren't asking our members to take any position other than
        that they believe is necessary to improve and strengthen the Medicare
        program. Similarly, we are not asking Senator Lott or Speaker Hastert to
        request that their Commission appointees to alter their position in a
        direction that more Democrats would support. We believe the Commission


should be given the leeway to analyze the best way to improve and
strengthen the Medicare program for the 21st century. We look forward to
their recommendations.

Finally, while we certainly would hope that the Commission could achieve a
broad-based consensus on Medicare reforms, we do not believe it is
essential in order for the Commission to have a positive impact on
sUbsequent Congressional deliberations on this .matter. The Social
Security Commission did not achieve consensus, but it had a remarkably
constructive impact on our ability to move forward on Social Security
reforms.  We are confident that Senator Breaux and his Commission will
also make constructive contributions as well.
