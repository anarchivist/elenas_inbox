Presription Drug Coverage and Medicare_ Prescription drug costs represents the highest
out-of-pocket health care expenditure for three out-of-four elderly. Many older Americans
"stretch-out" their supply of prescriptions to defray costs; their non-compliance with drug
regimens frequently results in additional, more expensive health care treatments. A number of
your Medicare Commissioners, as well as a host of outside validators (like Henry Aaron and Bob
Reischauer), have indicated their interest in exploring options to providing prescription drug
coverage for Medicare beneficiaries. They note that much of our future medical interventions
will be pharmacologically-based and, as such, Medicare's current lack of coverage of out-patient
drugs is antiquated. In response, DPCINEC is setting up a work group to review policy options
and costs. Costs will certainly detennine the viability of any drug coverage. However, more
studies are becoming available about the cost-effectiveness of drug coverage. Moreover, since
more than half of Medicare's managed care plans now offer some type of prescription drug
benefit, it is not inconceivable to contemplate required prescription drug coverage for at least
these plans. Such a recommendation could be bolstered by the fact that studies show that,
notwithstanding the BBA Medicare refonns, most managed care plans remain overcompensated
relative to the patients they serve. Finally, it may be advisable to raise this issue relatively early
in the debate to illustrate that the Commission's and our review of the long-tenn challenges
facing Medicare are focused on the need for program improvements as well as financing.

Patients' Bill of Rights Update. On Wednesday, Congressman Ganske and six other
Republicans added their names as cosponsors to the Dingell Patients' Bill of Rights legislation.
In a White House released statement, you praised these members for providing "new momentum
towards ensuring that a patients bill of rights will become the law of the land." Congressman
Ganske appreciated your comments and Congressman Dingell's office indicated that it has
helped place needed pressure on the Republican Leadership to move this legislation this year.
On Friday, we met with the disability advocacy community to encourage them to mobilize their
effective network to strongly push for passage of this bill. They have indicated that they are
going to make this a much higher priority. (NOTE TO ELENA: THIS IS A MEETING THAT
WILL TAKE PLACE TOMORROW AND I AM ASSUMING WHAT I BELIEVE THE
OUTCOME WILL BE .)
