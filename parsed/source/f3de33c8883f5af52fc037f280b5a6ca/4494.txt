TEXT:
I need you to clear this letter from the President to Christopher Cerf.
Chris wrote the President a post-resignation letter -- thanking him for
the opportunity to serve and saying he is most proud of his work on the
tobacco issue.  please feel free to change anything -- I didn't have much
information to work with.  Thanks. Sarah

Dear Chris:
Thank you for your kind letter of September 5, 1997.   I am pleased to
hear that you are doing well.

I want you to know that I will always be grateful for your committed
and very able work as my Associate Counsel. Your advice on a wide
range of issues -- from tobacco to information technology -- was a
great benefit to me and my entire staff. You deserve to be proud of
the important role you played in moving our country forward.

As you begin to address the responsibilities of your new position as
Executive Vice President and General Counsel of the Edison Project, I
am confident that your talent and insights will again serve you well.
I still consider you an important member of my team, and Hillary joins
me in sending our very best wishes for every future success and
happiness.
