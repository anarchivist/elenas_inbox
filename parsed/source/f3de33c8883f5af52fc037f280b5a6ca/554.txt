TEXT:
Bruce,
I met with Eli Segal this morning about the welfare to work CEO challenge. He
basically picked my brain on a lot of policy and research questions.  He is
talking to a lot of people and moving very quickly to get something done.   He is
shooting to have a proposal ready by next Friday (Jan. 24) and is under the
impression that it would be mentioned in the State of the Union.
Is this something you want me to work on with him? If Cheri and I work with him
to put the proposal together, is it legal for us to do so if he is considered a
volunteer? He'd like some help from the White House if possible.   I told him
I'd talk to you and get back to him.
FYI, I met with United Way and the NGA yesterday re: the 800 number. (This is my
first meeting with them since Jeremy turned the project over to me.)  This
alliance doesn't seem to be producing anything.  I think it might make sense to
scrap the model we have now and turn the number over to Eli's operation.
Thoughts?
