DECISION MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:                 BRUCE REED

SUBJECT:              POLICY ANNOUNCEMENTS FOR GRAMBLING SPEECH


         Your Grambling State University commencement address this Sunday focuses on the
need to empower parents in this new economy with greater tools to balance their responsibilities
to their jobs and their families. You will release a new study by the Council of Economic
Advisors that analyzes the "time crunch" that parents increasingly feel. In addition, you will
announce a new policy that addresses this challenge for federal workers. You will direct the
Office of Personnel Management to revise its regulations to allow federal workers to use up to 12
weeks of accrued sick leave to care for a spouse, child, or parent with a "serious health
condition," as defined under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA). Currently, federal
workers are allowed to use only 13 days of sick leave to care for an ill relative. This new policy
will enable federal workers to use the sick leave they have earned on the job to take care of a
loved one with a serious health condition.

         The DPC has also led a policy process to examine non-legislative options for action to
enable States on a voluntary basis to use their Unemployment Insurance systems to provide
benefits to workers on some form ofFMLA-covered leave. This year, four States with surpluses
in their UI trust funds - Massachusetts, Vermont, Maryland, and Washington - had bills
introduced in their State legislatures that would do this. Three of the four States, anticipating
conformity problems, have asked for comment from the Department of Labor (DOL). While
many question the prospects of State legislative efforts, DOL has been pressured from Senators
Kennedy, Dodd, Leahy, and Murray, the AFL-CIO, and women's groups to allow States this
flexibility; business groups have predictably weighed in strongly against opening up UI for this
purpose.

        Taking a non-legislative step to advance paid leave for American workers would be a
bold way to enable workers to spend more time with their families in important times. The 1996
FMLA Study, A Workable Balance, found that lost wages are a significant barrier to taking leave,
particularly for lower income workers. Even ifno State elected to use its UI system in this way
(as many argue is very likely), advancing a proposal that would allow State experimentation
would send a strong message that making leave affordable for workers is a new priority and that
States should consider creative ways to provide paid leave benefits.

       However, the challenges and risks to embracing an expansive change to the UI system are
considerable. First, the expense of such a system, if ever fully implemented in all States, would
                                                                          Hex-Dump Conversion

      be significant (estimates begin at $2 billion annually). Second, the breadth of purposes covered
      by the FMLA raises concerns. The majority ofFMLA-covered leave is taken by workers caring
      for their own serious health conditions, and advancing a policy of providing UI benefits for this
      category of leave might transform the VI system into it paid sick leave program and lead to
      significant and regressive substitution effects (employers may abandon their sick leave benefit
      programs). Third, while today most UI tax collection is "experience rated" (meaning that
      employers pay into the system based on their workers' use of it), the cost of this new policy
      should be borne as broadly as possible to guard against unintended labor force repercussions on
      women of child-bearing age.

               Your advisors have considered various ways of advancing the policy of paid leave while
      also mitigating the potential for unintended negative consequences. Ideally, we would issue a
      regulation that confines the allowance of new VI benefits to parents following birth or adoption
      (and, perhaps, other analogous, limited categories) and ensures that these new benefits are not
      "experience rated." The DOL Solicitor's office advises that, while issuing regulations will
      enable us to set important parameters for State programs, we may not have the authority to limit
      them in these ways (the question is under review). Even if we do not have this authority,
      however, we believe that we can accomplish much the same goal with a broader regulation
      encompassing all FMLA applications if (a) you focus on new parents in a directive to DOL
      initiating the regulatory process, and (b) DOL accompanies the regulation with model State
      legislation that guides States in program design, confining this program to new parents and
      ensuring that the new benefit is not "experience rated."

              This construct does not mitigate all danger of unintended consequences. We cannot
      ensure, for instance, that States would follow the model legislation we would propose and elect
      only to grant UI benefits to new parents, rather than the full category ofFMLA covered leave.
      However, we would send clear signals about what the Administration believes is an appropriate
      new use ofUI benefits and use the model State legislation to guide States in the right direction.
      Furthermore, you would only be on record as supporting this narrow new use ofUI trust funds,

               This option allows us the benefit of moving forward the important debate of making leave
      affordable for new parents, while also mitigating many potential downsides. All of the offices
      involved in this process - the NEC,OMB, DOL, CEA, and the First Lady's Office - agree that
      this is an exciting and responsible approach to addressing this issue,
