           Debate Opens Over HMO Rights

                                       By LAURA MECKLER Associated Press Writer

                                       WASHINGTON (AP)    Partisan differences over how
           far
                                       Congress should go to protect patient rights
           were on full display
                                       wednesday as the year's debate began in earnest
           over regulating
                                       HMOs and other managed health care plans.

                                       Democrats were sure to lose on every major point
           as
                                       deliberations began Wednesday in the Senate
           Health, Education,
                                       Labor and Pension Committee. The panel was
           expected to
                                       approve a GOP-backed bill as soon as Thursday.

                                       President Clinton said the GOP bill "falls far
           short"     of what's
                                       needed.

                                       "Today represents the first test of whether
           this new Congress is
                                       serious about providing Americans with a strong
           enforceable
                                     patients' bill of rights to assure quality
           health care,"  Clinton said in
                                     a statement. " I urge the committee to do
           everything it can to pass
                                     this test and give Americans the health care
           protections they
                                       need.' ,


                        But Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., was already
    looking past
                        the committee vote, promising reporters: "We'll
    win on the floor
                        of the Senate.' ,
