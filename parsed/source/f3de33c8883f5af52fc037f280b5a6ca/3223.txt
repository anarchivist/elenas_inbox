TEXT:
i'm sure this has been mentioned in the scheduling meetings, but the big
story this weekend will likely be the Independance Day landing on Mars and
the subsequent photos ... if the radio adresses don't work out or there is
a chance to call and congratulate NASA scientists if things work out, it
might be appropriate ...
