Subject:         Should I write a charter school/deseg Q&A?

If you want to include it in the weekly, I'll write a Q&A on the Clint
Bolick editorial on Bill Lann Lee on charter schools and deseg, and
Administration meetings to discuss a response to the letter as well as new
civil rights guidance that would be issued by the Education Dept.

Let me know if you want to include something on this, and I'll write it up.
