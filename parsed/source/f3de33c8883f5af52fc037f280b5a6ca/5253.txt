TEXT:
NEC decided to add this to the end of the Labor-H press paper on job
training/out of school youth.  It seems to me that this is more in their
bailiwick than ours, and it looks ok to me, but if you get this and have
concerns, please call (at 6-2803) or page Bob Shireman, because he is the
one who will get the final paper out to folks tonight (Gene still had to
look at it).

Thanks.

Here's the job training stuff I've added:

PROVIDING JOB TRAINING FOR ADULTS AND OUT-OF-SCHOOL YOUTH

Expands Job Corps and Other Job Training Programs. The bill provides an
increase of $497 million -- or 8 percent -- for employment and training
programs. This means more opportunities for adult training, youth
training, and JobCorps.  For Out-of-School Youth, the Labor-HHS-Education
bill provides $250 million in advance funding for 1999. This will mean
$250 million in competitive grants to selected high-poverty urban and
rural areas, including designated EZs and ECs, to increase youth
employment.

Serves More Than 600,000 Dislocated Workers.  The bill provides an
increase of $65 million for dislocated workers -- bringing the total to
more than double what it was the year President Clinton took office.  In
FY 1998, the Department of Labor will serve more than 600,000 dislocated
workers, compared to 300,000 in 1993.
