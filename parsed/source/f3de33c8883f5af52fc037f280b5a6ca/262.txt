TEXT:
I understand from Commerce staff that:
1. The letter has not been sent but Commerce staff and Peter
Jacoby have discussed it with subcommittee staff.
2.  Subcommittee staff have rejected the Counsel's Office
substitute language on removal of the Commissioner. Hill staff
have offered a floor colloquy saying that the intent of the
provision in the manager's amendment is notification of Congress
of removal by the President.
3. Subcommittee staff say that Justice's problem with section 604
of the bill - attorneys' fees - is for the Administration to work
out with Rep. Frost, the sponsor of the provision.
4.  Subcommittee staff are pressing for a letter of unqualified
Administration support for House passage of the bill, with the
current manager's amendment - without any mention of items 2 and 3
above.


Peter Jacoby may be contacting you and Justice to discuss.
