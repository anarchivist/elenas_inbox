TEXT:
Thank you so much for your helpful analysis. Here are several
thoughts and questions about these issues.
1.   I am very interested in your point that immigrants losing SSI
may not automatically lose Medicaid too.   Would this be true even
if the state chose not to exercise their option to keep Medicaid
for legal immigrants as of 1/1/97?
Your point about waivers being a vehicle to keep legal immigrants
is also very interesting.   I imagine we will want to pursue this.
You probably know that, on the food stamp side, we worked hard to
design a waiver to delay the implementation in several states so
that they have a bit more time to develop an interim verification
system for immigration status.
I




2.   If legal immigrants don't lose SSI until, say, June of next
year, when SSA gets around to looking at their case, but the
Governor of the state declares on 1/1/97 that his state no longer
provides Medicaid to legal immigrants, does the person have
Medicaid from January through June?    (I think the issue of legal
immigrants in nursing homes will become big on the radar screen
in the coming weeks, and this would be relevant to that.)
3.   On SSI kids, I am very interested in how many will be able to
keep Medicaid under Waxman and other provisions, and how many will
lose Medicaid altogether.   Is this a HCFA question only, or do you
guys have any thoughts here? DPC thinks we should be proactive in
reaching out to families here, so that those who have a right to
continuing Medicaid know about it.
4. On Medicaid vs. TANF eligibility, I understand your point.
So, if a woman now on Medicaid goes to work as a result of a work
program/work requirement and raises her income beyond the AFDC
level in effect on 7/16/96, then she is no longer eligible for
Medicaid beyond the one year of transitional Medicaid that the law
offers, right? Her kids may qualify under Waxman's provisions,
but probably not her.
At the NGA/NCLS/APWA conference, someone from one of those
organizations said they thought there was potentially a chance for
states to add a SECOND year of transitional Medicaid coverage.
But I have never seen any basis for that in the law, have you? I
assume this could be done through a (budget neutral) waiver,
though.
5. Also at the NGA conference, there was discussion of some
limitation in the law in Medicaid growth to the CPl.    Can you
explain how that works?
I have been pushing HHS/HCFA to sit down and meet with us on all
this soon. At the moment, Monahan has promised me a meeting on
October 1, with paper to arrive in advance.    (I will let you know
time and place as soon as I do.)   I am a bit concerned about
whether this is early enough, given that the State Medicaid
Directors are meeting 10/7-9, and people will certainly be
expecting some straight answers from HCFA by then -- not on
everything, but on some things. At the moment, I think HCFA is
not as far along in terms of giving NGA/NCSL/APWA guidance as
other agencies.
By the way, I hear from Monahan that HHS is discussing the
mechanism by which states can signal their intention on whether
legal immigrants are still eligible for Medicaid . . One option is
to make the default position that they ARE covered.    This way, a
Governor would have to take a proactive position to drop them.
I also assume the state legislature can get involved in this
decision if they pass a law, but otherwise the Governor's actions
control.
Hope someone from your unit is coming to our welfare reform
subgroup meeting tomorrow (Tuesday) at 3 in room 211. We are
going to try to make it at the same time every week.
Let me know if you think we need a WH/OMB meeting to take stock of
where we are on Medicaid, with counsel's office and
intergovernmental in attendance as well.
I am also going to send Mark and Nicolette a copy of a draft
timeline of critical dates that I am just beginning. Let me know
if you have any comments.
Sorry for the long note!
