 TEXT:
 We are pushing HHS to revise the evaluation plan to ensure we'll have
 something to report by January 1, 2001, as required by statute.
 Technically, OMB must approve the evaluation plan before it will apportion
 the $18 million research funds.  Barry White will shortly be sending a
 letter to HHS and the other agencies laying out our concerns with their
 evaluation plan, and asking for a revised plan before OMB will release the
 funds.  We've reviewed the letter and think its fine.
  It goes to the person at HHS in charge of reapportionment, but Olivia,
 Ray Uhalde and others are cc'd.

 Subject:         $3 billion welfare to work evaluation

 The statute provides 6/10 of a percent of the $3 billion funds -- or $18
 million -- for HHS in consultation with DOL and HUD to evaluate how the
 welfare to work grants have been used. The statute urges the Secretary to
 focus on job placements, retention, earnings, and average costs per
 placement. The Secretary shall submit to Congress an interim report by
 January 1, 1999 and a final report by January 1, 2001.

 HHS has proposed a plan, which neither we nor Barry White find
 particularly satisfying. The plan puts the bulk of the funds into a
 long-term, MDRC-type control group study which will add to the body of
 knowledge about what works for hard-to-employ welfare recipients, but
 will give us little to tell Congress in 1999 (it wouldn't be completed
 until about 2003).

 We are pushing back to get them to beef up the collection of data that


will give us a more immediate indication of what happened to people who
took part in the $3 billion program and how their outcomes compare to
similar long term recipients under TANF.  Under the current plan, they
will collect data to show what percent of people in the $3 billion program
went to work, which may appear low since the program serves long-term
recipients with multiple barriers to employment, but we won't know whether
those work rates are higher than they would have been in the absence of
this program -- until the completely rigorous study is finished in
 2003.

Of course, one could argue that we'd be better off not having too much
concrete data by 1999. What do you think?
