TEXT:
You sent Mary and I a memo from Bill Marshall about a bill to guarantee
religious freedom in the workplace.  It needs to get vetted.

We suggest a meeting calling in: DOJ, Commerce, EEC, Labor, SBA,
Education, (Treasury?) plus OPL, and Marshall from counsel's office.  We'd
tell them we need to know their concerns in two weeks (three weeks if the
Hill says this is moving quickly) .

The bill itself has diverse religious support, and is sponsored by Coats
(R-IN) and Kerry (D-MA).  I like the idea even though a good lawyer
probably wouldn't ...
