DATELINE: WASHINGTON

BODY:
    The number of people on welfare has fallen to its lowest level in 30 years,
President Clinton will announce Monday. But the new figures also show the
dramatic declines of recent years are beginning to slow in certain states.

   The president will also offer a package of programs aimed at helping more
people get to jobs and encouraging businesses to continue hiring them.

    Nationally, just under 8 million people remained on welfare at the end of
September, down 44 percent from 14.3 million in 1994. But state officials and
academics alike have long cautioned that, at some point, nearly all the people
who can move off welfare with relative ease will have left. That will leave
those with deeper problems like substance abuse, domestic violence and very
little education.

   "With welfare reform, the more you succeed, the harder the job becomes,"
said Don Winstead, who heads Florida's welfare reform program.

   Clinton hopes to make that job easier. Administration officials said he will
announce proposals included in the budget he will submit to Congress next month,
including:

   $1 billion to help 200,000 long-term: welfare recipients in high-poverty
areas move to work. It's the continuation of a two-year-old program with a new
requirement that 20 percent be used for low-income fathers.

  $430 million to give 75,000 housing vouchers that help people on welfare
move closer to a new job.

   $150 million in transportation money to help people get to jobs, often in
suburbs not served by public transportation.
                                                                              Automated Records Management System
                                                                              Hex-Dwnp Conversion

       $530 million to extend the tax credit for businesses that hire people off
     welfare.

        As he did in his State of the Union address, the president will also trumpet
     the falling welfare numbers.

       "On a national basis, the caseload drop has been remarkably steady," said
     Bruce Reed, the president's chief domestic policy adviser.

        But the figures show the drops in some states may have begun to slow in the
     final quarter of fiscal year 1998. In at least eight states, most of which have
     seen incredible drops since 1993, the reductions slowed to a trickle in July,
     August and September 1998.

        "There's a difference between the first three quarters of the year and the
     last quarter of the year," said Michael Kharfen, a Department of Health and
     Human Services spokesman.

        State officials say they are preparing to serve welfare recipients with
     tougher problems, moving beyond the "work first" approach that helps
     recipients look for work and then pushes them to take any job they can find.
     Under work first, states don't try to solve every problem or get people the
     education they may need. They simply try to find them jobs, reasoning that work
     experience will help them move up the economic ladder.

        But that isn't enough for everyone, state officials say.

        "We're past the situation where someone comes in who may need a little bit
     of confidence building, who may need a brush-up on skills and may need a new
     battery for the car all things we can do," said John Garlinger of the Kansas
     Department of Social and Rehabilitation Services. "We are left with the
     hard-core people."

         Kansas has cut its welfare rolls by 62 percent since 1993, but by the end of
     the last fiscal year, healthy quarterly drops of 8 to 10 percent fell to just
     1. 7 percent.

        Other states seeing dropoffs include Arizona, Arkansas, Connecticut, Florida,
     Massachusetts and North Carolina. New Mexico, after nearly cutting its roles in
     half, actually saw a 40 percent increase during 1998.

        Seasonal variations may explain some of it. In Massachusetts, the rolls
     always stay higher near September, when the state gives clothing vouchers for
     every child on welfare.
                                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion
   But other states say they have begun to ''bottom out."

   "We knew that after that wave of families went off the rolls, the somewhat
harder work would begin," said Joe Quinn, spokesman for the Arkansas Department
of Human Services. In Arkansas, the rolls fell just 2.7 percent in the last
quarter after drops of about 9 percent in previous quarters.

   In Kansas, officials are working with community mental health centers to aid
people with substance abuse problems. They are screening for learning
disabilities and training caseworkers to spot victims of domestic violence.

   Jack Tweedie, who tracks welfare reform for the National Conference of State
Legislatures, said states are financially prepared to work with harder-to-serve
people because of the money saved from fewer people getting checks.

   Reed, Clinton's adviser, isn't convinced the decrease has slowed, but says
the president's proposals will help when it inevitably does.

   "A lot of people thought we'd hit that point a long time ago," he said,
"and more of the people on welfare have responded more quickly than anyone
anticipated. "
