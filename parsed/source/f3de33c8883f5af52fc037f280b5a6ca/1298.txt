Subject:         Re: Washington State Option

From my small corner of the world it is too late to put something in the
bill.  I signed off on the final legislative specs last night.  I'll touch
base with Randy today and ask for a more formal opinion.  In a nutshell,
the lawyers are very uncomfortable with using the section of the food
stamp act which says something to the effect of, "The Secretary can issue
coupons to whomever he choses as long as it is in the public interest."

They don't feel that section 1.  is intended to override the other section
of hte Act that says states shall not issue coupons to ineligible
households, 2. provides for reimbursement, and 3. is in direct conflict
with the explicit prohibition on providing coupons to immigrants.

Essentially, while we are conceptually able to disaggregate the food stamp
benefit from the food stamp coupon, the law may not be able to do that.

But they were working hard to find way around it.   I'll get back to you
today.
