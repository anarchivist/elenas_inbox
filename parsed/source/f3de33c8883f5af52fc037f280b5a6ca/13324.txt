DRAFT 1 - ADMINISTRATION POLICY ON LOGGING RIDER

TALKING POINTS



?          The "logging rider" on the rescissions act has to be
changed.
?        We are deeply concerned by the rider's environmental and
social harm.
?        Ancient forests are being clearcut. Critical habitat for
fish and wildlife is being destroyed.    Wild places that
almost everyone in the Northwest and the country want to
protect are being lost forever. This has to stop.
?        Environmental damage isn't the only problem that has to be
fixed. We are very concerned about the renewed conflict
between people who disagree about forest policy.     The
logging rider has divided people and communities -- this has
to stop.
?        The Northwest deserves better.    Forest policy should be
predictable and fair.   Environmental protections should be
solid. Harvest levels should be sustainable. Agencies
should be accountable for their actions. Most of all, the
people who own the forests need to know that their values
and their voices are being heard.
?        We know and the region knows how to run forests right.
That's what this Administration's Northwest Forest Plan was
all about.    The Forest Plan is the right way to run federal
forests in the Northwest and we have to get back to that
plan.
?        The logging rider is a mess. The courts, egged on by some
in Congress and in the industry, twisted it to do things
that go way beyond what Congress intended or this
Administration agreed to. We fought for the correct
interpretations, but many of the key rulings went against
our positions.
?        We have to change the law. We have to get back to the
Forest plan.    The Administration believe's that we must:
         1.      Repeal the provisions of the logging rider that opened
up the Northwest's ancient forests and closed the courts;
         2.      Repeal the provisions that undermine or are
inconsistent with the Forest Plan
         3.      Suspend the salvage timber program in the Northwest for

enough time to allow a full, objective review of the program's
implementation, and
         4.     Get agreement from Congress to give the Forest Service
and BLM the funding and other authorities they need to buy
o
-back
or find substitute timber for old
o
-growth sales released under the
rider that simply shouldn't be cut.
?       We will work with the Northwest delegation to win passage of
these changes. We know there will be opposition.   But we
are determined to get Northwest forest management back on
track and to restore the balanced and reasonable approach
that is achieved under the Northwest Forest Plan.
