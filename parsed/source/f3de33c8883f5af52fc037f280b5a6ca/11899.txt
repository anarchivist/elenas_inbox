                                    March 22, 1999


Q.   When is your plan going to be introduced?

A.   You all know how dangerous it is putting a specific time frame on releasing a specific
     proposal. First, the new Trustees' report is coming out next week, which is likely to
     change cost estimates associated with Medicare reform options. Second, we want to
     review all viable options. Third, we need to consult with you. And, fourth, we need to
     strategically consider the best time frame for releasing the plan after the first three steps
     have been completed. Suffice it to say, it will be early enough to credibly argue that the
     Congress will have enough time to respond to it this year.


Q.   What is the process you are going to use to develop this plan, and will we be
     consulted?

A.   As this meeting indicates, we fully intend on consulting with you as the President
     develops his plan. We will also be reviewing the options put on the table by the
     Commission, to see which ones have merit. Also, we want to make sure that our
     proposals get assessed by the independent Medicare actuaries so we have a good idea of
     how these policies will affect Medicare.


Q.   Are you going to include premium support in your package?

A.   The President has always been interested in policies to make Medicare more competitive
     and efficient. Clearly, we do not pay managed care plans in Medicare in a rational way.
     HMOs continue to pick and choose locations to serve beneficiaries depending on the
     local payment rate. This should be addressed.

     However, the President will not support a voucher proposal or any proposal that
     undermines Medicare's defined benefits. He has serious concerns about the premium
     support model proposed by Senator Breaux and Congressman Thomas. It is not entirely
     clear that this proposal guarantees Medicare's defined benefits. It also would raise
     premiums for traditional Medicare by 10 to 20 percent for most beneficiaries, according
     to our actuaries. Although the plan attempts to address this problem for beneficiaries
     with no private plan options, those with limited or unattractive private options would be
     forced to pay more to stay in the system. We believe that this is unacceptable.
                                                                                   Hex·Dump Conversion
Q.   Secretary Shalala specifically said that raising the age eligibility is off the table. Is
     this true?

A.   Raising the eligibility age will not be in the President's package. The President believes
     that raising the eligibility age for Medicare without policies to prevent the uninsured from
     increasing is going in the wrong direction.


Q.   What is your prescription drug benefit?

A.   We are reviewing options. As you know, the cost of the benefit is directly linked to its
     design. Clearly, we want to provide the package that benefits the most people possible
     while still being affordable.


Q.   How much will it cost and how will you finance it?

A.   We believe that there have to be Medicare offsets that help pay for the Medicare drug
     benefit. It is not clear that, by themselves, these offsets will be enough to achieve this
     goal. We need to work with you closely on this issue.


Q.   Will you use the surplus to help offset the cost of the prescription drug benefit?

A.   As we've said, we believe that other offsets must contribute to the cost of this benefit.
     But before we even contemplate using the 15 percent of the surplus for anything other
     than extending the life of the program, we need to finalize the design of drug benefit,
     determine its costs, and assess whether the offsets are sufficient. We believe, however,
     that no one should rush into using the surplus for this or any other purpose.

Q.   Will your plan include an income-related premium?

A.   The President supported this policy in the past, including in his 1992 campaign, the 1993
     Health Security Act, and again during the Balanced Budget Act discussions in 1997. It is
     certainly being discussed, but, again, we have made no final decisions whether it is
     necessary or advisable to include in the President's package.
