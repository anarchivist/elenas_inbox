     TEXT:
     Here's the revised Murray amendment as we discussed this morning.  The
     shaded areas represent changes to our earlier version (you have to launch
     it to see the shading).

     Calculation of those subject to the work requirement.

     The Murray amendment would automatically reduce the number of people
     subject to the work requirement one-for-one by the number of individuals
     granted "good cause" family violence waivers. There would be no
     requirement for the waived people to participate in any specific
     activities.

     The DPC option would grant "good cause" waivers under family violence only
     to individuals who are participating in temporary services designed to
     ensure safety, promote independence and prepare for employment.  This
     would effectively lower a state's work requirement simply by counting
     these individuals as working, albeit for a "temporary" period.

     One way to ensure that there are no dramatic reductions to the work
     requirement would be to remove these individuals from the numerator and
     the denominator of the work requirement calculations.

     consider, for example, a state that has 100,000 welfare recipients and in
     FY98 is required to place 30,000 in work (i.e. 30% work rate).

     Under Murray's option, if 10,000 were exempt under the family violence
     option, this state would only need to place 20,000 of its recipients to
     meet the work requirement.

     Under DPC, the number would be the same so long as the waived individuals
     participate in temporary services that help them prepare for work (which
     may be less intensive than work activities) .

     Under our alternative, the 10,000 would be removed from the denominator,
     resulting in 30% of 90,000 (or 27,000) recipients who need to be placed in
     work. This would help guard against a "gutting" of the work requirements.

     While we think this option is least likely of the three to undermine the
     work requirements, other groups might later seek similar relief, arguing
     they too should be removed from the base for purposes of calculating
     participation rates, and therefore exempt from work requirements. This,
     of course, could lead to a large exempt pool as became the case under the
,.

                              Proposed Amendment
     (Additions to Murray Amendment are underlinedi deletions are st.riken)

     SEC . . PROTECTING VICTIMS OF FAMILY VIOLENCE.

     (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--

     (1) the intent of Congress in amending part A of title IV of the
     Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) in section 103(a) of
     the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act
     of 1996 (Public Law 104-193i 110 Stat 2112) was to allow States to
     take into account the effects of the epidemic of domestic violence
     in establishing their welfare programs, by giving States the
     flexibility to grant individual, temporary waivers for good cause
     to victims of domestic violence who meet the criteria set forth in
     section 402(a) (7) (B) of the Social Security Act (42
     U.S.C.602(a) (7) (B» i

     (2) the allowance of waivers under such sections was not intended
     to be limit.ed by ot.her, separat.e, and independent. provisions of part.
     A of t.it.le IV of t.he Soeial Seeurit.y Aet. (42 U.S.C. 601 et. seq.)
     undermine the law's goals of work and personal responsibilitYi

     (3) under section 402(a) (7) (A) (iii) of such Act (42 U.S.C.
     602 (a) (7) (A) (iii) ), requirements under the temporary assistance for
     needy families program under part A of title IV of such Act may,
     for good cause, be waived for so long as necessarYi and

      (4) good cause waivers granted pursuant to section 402 (a) (7) (A) (iii)
     of such Act (42 U.S.C. 602 (a) (7) (A) (iii» are intended to be temporary
     and directed only at particular program requirements when needed
     on an individual case-by-case basis, and are intended to facilitCi.te
     the ability of victims of domestic violence to move forward and meet
     program requirements when safe and feasible without interference
     by domestic violence.

     (b) Clarification of Waiver Provisions.--

     (1) In general.--Section 402(a) (7) of the Social Security Act (41
     U.S.C. 602(a) (7» is amended by adding at the end the following:

     ~(C) No numerical limits.--In implementing this paragraph, a State
     shall not be subject to any numerical limitation in the granting
     of good cause waivers under subparagraph (A) (iii) .

     ~ (D) Treatment of waivered individuals for purposes of certain other
     provisions of this part.--

     (1) A state will be eligible for a reasonable good cause exception
     as defined in Section 409(b) if it demonstrates that its failure

                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion

    to meet the requirements of 408 (a) (7) is attributable to its provision
    of good cause domestic violence waivers.

    (2) For purposes of determining compliance with the participation
    rate requirements set forth in section 407(a), a State may exclude
    recipients of good cause domestic violence waivers from the base,
    as defined in section 407 (b) (1) (B) (ii) (I) , in calculating its monthly
    participation rate.
