TEXT:
As you requested, I asked ATF to look into the Washington Times article
(May 22) stating that smuggling of Chinese cigarettes was a growing
problem in the State of Washington.    ATF contacted John Hough,
Washington's senior assistant attorney general, who was quoted in the
article, as well as Washington State's Department of Revenue.    They both
confirmed that the article refers to what was only a one-time event, where
they seized 6000 cartons of illegally imported Chinese cigarettes in
November that were headed for an Indian reservation known for selling
smuggled domestic cigarettes.    (As I am sure you are aware, the per pack
state tax on cigarettes is 81.5 cents so smuggling of domestic cigarettes
through Indian reservations is a problem in Washington). The Washington
State officials confirmed that there is no evidence that smuggling of
Chinese cigarettes is in any wayan ongoing problem, and John Hough was
very surprised that he was quoted in a manner to imply that there is a
ongoing "influx" of smuggled Chinese cigarettes into the state, or that
this is a "sign of things to come".
