                                                                             Automated Records Management System
    Dear Chainnan Hatch,                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion

    I am advised that the Senate Committee on the Judiciary may begin consideration of S. 605 soon.
     I am writing to infonn you that I will veto S. 605, or any similar compensation entitlement
    legislation, that may be presented for my signature.

    S. 605 is styled as a measure to protect private property rights. I support this laudible goal, and
    believe that legitimate property interests should be adequately protected. Indeed, my
    Administration has undertaken numerous refonns to address specific problems in the
    administration of federal laws affecting private property.

    S. 60?, however, does not protect legitimate property rights. At best, the bill creates a spoils
    system of rewards for the least responsible, most dangerous users and abusers of property. At
    worst, it is a thinly disguised effort to block implementation and enforcement of existing laws
    protecting public health, safety, and the environment. In short, S. 605 is not the right way to
    protect private property.

    S. 605 departs from our Constitution and runs counter to more than two centuries of
    jurisprudence by turning the very notion of citizenship -- that our freedoms go hand-in-hand with
    our responsibilities to each other and to the community -- on its head. It places the property
    interests of most Americans at risk by threatening the laws that protect our citizens from
    pollution, dangerous products, and irresponsible behavior

    Finally, at the very time we are working to balance the budget and streamline the size of
    govemment, S. 605 moves in the opposite direction. It creates new bureaucracies and
    innumerable opportunities for litigation, and will impose billions of dollars of costs on society.

    I remain committed to work with Congress to craft bipartisan legislation that improves those few
    regulatory arenas where private property interests may be unfairly burdened. My
    Administration's continuing efforts to refonn our regulatory system, and the recent passage of the
    Safe Drinking Water Act, demonstrate that we can reach common ground solutions to these
    difficult issues.

                                                  Sincerely,


                                                  William J. Clinton
