TEXT:
According to ED, the bill is expected to come up again in the House
tomorrow morning. Efforts are underway to reach a time agreement, but
it's an open rule and currently there are lots of amendments expected,
some of them goofy, but so far nothing that seems likely to threaten to
upset the bill., No word yet on whether GOP's will try to win back some of
last night's defeat through amendments, etc.

Also, we hear that they are likely to move slowly on a charter bill in the
Senate, with hearings, etc. next year.
