                                                           DRAFT
Harold Rogers
Chainnan
Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, State,
       the Judiciary and Related Agencies
Appropriations Committee
U.S. House of Representatives
Washington, D.C. 20515

Dear Mr. Chainnan,

        In the Subcommittee's Report accompanying P.L. 105-119, the Congress directed the
Attorney General to review the recommendations of the United States Commission on
Immigration Refonn (CIR) and develop a restructuring plan that would result in greater
effectiveness and efficiency in the perfonnance of the core functions of the federal immigration
system. That request prompted the President to designate the Domestic Policy Council (DPC) to
coordinate a top-to-bottom review of the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) to
detennine how the agency could be restructured to most effectively and efficiently accomplish
the duties that have been delegated to the agency by statute and practice. In conducting this
review, the DPC consulted with the Departments of Justice, Labor and State, the INS, staff of the
CrR, immigration advocacy groups, and other White House offices, including the National
Security Council and the Office of Management and Budget.

        The DPC review concluded that the CIR report correctly diagnosed many of INS's
problems -- insufficient accountability between field offices and headquarters, lack of
consistency and professionalism, ov~rlapping organizational relationships, and significant
management weaknesses.' These problems lie at the core of the INS's inability to
effectively pursue the tasks that Congress and the President expect the INS to perform: the
effective enforcement of our immigration laws both at our borders and in our nation's
workplaces, and the efficient provision of immigration and citizenship benefits and services
to those non-citizens who are here lawfully. Improving the ability of the INS to pursue
these critical priorities must be the guiding principle of any reform plan.

       After careful and thorough consideration and study, the Administration believes
that the most effective way to adhere to this guiding principle is to implement dramatic and
fundamental reforms within the INS. The Administration's reform plan would untangle
the INS's overlapping and frequently confusing organizational structure and replace it
with two clear organizational chains of command -- one for accomplishing its enforcement
mission and one for the provision ofservices. Additionally, the Administration plan
retains essential integrating functions for supporting and coordinating the enforcement
and service operations. The result will be an INS organization with strengthened
accountability and improved efficiency and effectiveness that allows each operation to
focus on the unique management, knowledge, skills, and abilities of its function.
                                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion

The key features of the Administration's plan are:

       Effect an operational split between enforcement and services, resulting in two
       distinct, clear lines of authority from the field to headquarters, with an INS
       Commissioner continuing to be responsible for overall agency operations;

       Eliminate the current "district" field structure, and replace it with a functional and
       geography-based organization which allows for the creation of service offices in
       areas convenient to their immigrant "customers" and enforcement sites in the
       border areas or at significant ports of entry;

       Improve the quality of the workforce by creation of separate enforcement and
       service career paths for INS employees to ensure that the best employees can move
       up the ladder and are rewarded for high standards of performance;

       Restructure management and strategic planning operations to ensure the efficient
       delivery of a "shared support" operation that will service both the enforcement side
       and the service side of the agency by providing records and data management,
       technological support, employee relations and administrative support.

·      Establish a Chief Financial Officer to address deficiencies in financial, accounting
       and budget execution systems.

       Apart from these primary recommendations on restructuring the INS, the
Administration will work with the INS and the Departments of Labor and State to address
concerns about duplication, overlapping responsibilities, and issues of coordination. In
addition, the Department of Justice has contracted with a consulting firm to assist in
making this plan "operational." A copy oftheir final report is attached.

        It should be noted that during its review, the DPC carefully evaluated the
recommendations of the CIR. The CIR concluded that the INS's dual responsibility of
welcoming immigrants who enter legally and deterring those who attempt to enter or stay
illegally has resulted in "mission overload." To address this issue, they recommended
disbanding the INS and reallocating its primary ,responsibilities to the Department of Justice
(DOJ) and the State Department. We believe those recommendations would only compound the
current problems within INS.

        First, such a real~ocation would require a six or seven-year transition, exacerbating
the existing concerns about long delays in processing basic immigration services. Second,
creating a separate immigration enforcement agency within the Justice Department could
ultimately result in hindering the coordination and communication necessary to maintain
the integrity and effectiveness of both immigration enforcement and service operations.
Moreover, moving immigration service operations to the State Department is inconsistent
with the Department's foreign policy mission. To be effective, immigration policy and
management should remain within one agency within the Justice Department. Severing
                                                                          Automated Records Management Sysle:
                                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion


         the link between immigration enforcement and services serves only to weaken both critical
         functions.

                 The Administration's plan is a fundamental change in the way the INS conducts
         business. This restructuring --from top to bottom --will address long-standing concerns
         about the lines of authority and responsibility, consistency of operations, and performance
         within the INS. It will result in improved enforcement coordination, career paths that
         support professionalism and measurable changes in the way INS provides services to the
         immigration community. More importantly, it will greatly improve the ability of the INS
         to effectively and efficiently perform the duties that Congress and the President expect.
         We look forward to working with you and other members of Congress to implement this
         restructuring plan and to ensure successful, long-term improvements in the Nation's
         immigration system.

         Sincerely,


         Franklin Raines
         Director
         Office of Management and Budget
