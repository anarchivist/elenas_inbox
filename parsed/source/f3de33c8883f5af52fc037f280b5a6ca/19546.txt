TEXT:
Friday morning -- there are no unemployment figures coming out, so there
won't be a departure statement that would work for an UNs Q&A.  If Riley
announces Administration earlier in the week, we could plant a question
earlier.

Friday afternoon - San Jose
NEC will take the lead on making this an international trade event,
possibly at a wharehouse of high tech suppliers or some industry that is
booming right now -- and exports a lot.

Monday morning - Los Angeles
Todd Stern and Jen Palmieri say the President wants to do a climate change
event, so they are preparing a decision memo for him on that event.  If we
have a tobacco option and/or Kaiser option by COB today we need to get a
proposal to Scheduling COB today so they can discuss it w/ POTUS tomorrow
morning.

FYI:
- Ann and Jen were concerned that POTUS would be uncomfortable doing
tobacco in LA before he sees entertainment industry leaders.
- They absolutely do not want to do any education events if UNs position
is announced earlier in the week.
- They think Kaiser is such a good announcement that if it is not ready,
we can do it in D.C. or next CA trip.
