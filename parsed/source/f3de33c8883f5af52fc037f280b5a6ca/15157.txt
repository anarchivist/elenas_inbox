TASK FORCE APPLAUDS APPOINTMENT OF THURMAN AS AIDS CZAR AND
URGES STRONGER WHITE HOUSE ACTION TO CURB DISEASE


Washington, DC---April 8, 1997----The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force
(NGLTF) commends the President's appointment of a Sandra L. Thurman as
Director
of the Office of National AIDS Policy.   Her background demonstrates
extensive
experience in and knowledge of HIV/AIDS issues. NGLTF urgesThurman and the
President to take decisive action now on a range of critical concerns.


>From 1988 to 1993, Thurman served as Executive Director of AID Atlanta, a
community based organization providing health and support services to
people
with HIV/AIDS, including HIV prevention programs. She is currently a member
of
the Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS and of the Georgia State AIDS
Task
Force, the Fulton County HIV Planning Council and the Executive Committee
of
Cities Advocating Emergency AIDS Relief (CAEAR).

"We applaud the President's appointment of someone who is clearly
experienced
and knowledgeable on HIV/AIDS issues to be the new Director of the Office
of
National AIDS Policy," said Kerry Lobel, Executive Director of NGLTF.   "The
Task
Force calls upon Thurman and the Administration to work with Congress to
lift
the ban on the use of federal funds for needle exchange programs, oppose
H.R.
1062, the regressive legislation introduced by Rep. Coburn, R-OK, that
would,
among other things require states to adopt mandatory HIV testing laws -
even
the
National Governors' Association has declared its opposition to this
legislation,
and work for full funding for AIDS research, prevention, health care and
housing
initiatives," she announced.  "We also urge Thurman and the President to
continue to oppose cuts or other changes to Medicaid--such as imposing a
cap
on
federal payments per beneficiary--which would eliminate access to health
care
for the poor, including people with HIV and AIDS," added Lobel.

According to Lobel, "this appointment is but one step in the process
toward a
bold and effective national AIDS strategy. We look forward to working with
the
new director and the Administration towards that end."

The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force is the oldest national gay and
lesbian
group and is a progressive organization that has supported grassroots
organizing
and pioneered in national advocacy since 1973. Since its inception, NGLTF
has
been at the forefront of virtually every major initiative for lesbian and
gay
rights.  In all its efforts, NGLTF helps to strengthen the gay, lesbian,
bisexual and transgender movement at the state level while connecting these
activities to a national vision for change.
