TEXT:
Heads up ... got my weekly call from Tim Dudgeon with Distilled Spirits
Council this morning and he really needed to hear from us this week
because he has held his folks off of a public campaign effort on this
issue about as long as he can ... as of next week he's not sure what will
happen. We REALLY need to focus on this and give them an answer to their
April letter to POTUS calling for him to convene a meeting of all sides.

HELP!
