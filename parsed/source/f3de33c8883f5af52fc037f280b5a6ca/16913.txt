DRAFT

Dear GDvernDr _ _ _ __

       The cDntinuing explDsiDn Df new technDlDgies gives us a grDundbreaking
DppDrtunity to. wDrk tDgether to. link our federal and state law enfDrcement effDrts
in ways we never thDUght pDssible even a few years ago.. FDr example, we are
nDW able to. track the whereabDuts Df cDnvicted sex Dffenders to. prevent them
frDm cDmmitting new crimes. If we begin nDW to. cDDrdinate Dur effDrts, I am
cDnvinced that American public safety will benefit significantly.

         From the histDric 1994 Crime Act thrDUgh the NatiDnal Crime PreventiDn
and Privacy CDmpact that I will SDDn submit to. CDngress, my AdministratiDn has
strived to. pass legislatiDn to. hamess cDmputers and Dther technDlDgy fDr the
public gDDd. Many Df Dur states' gDvernDrs have played crucial rDles in fighting
to. pass this legislatiDn, and I thank YDU again fDr that assistance. AlthDUgh these
laws are an impDrtant fDundatiDn fDr federal and state cDDperatiDn, the new
technDlDgies can do. Dnly what we cDmmit them to. do., and we still need to. do.
much mDre -- including exchanging criminal recDrds between states fDr
emplDyment checks Dn wDrkers in DccupatiDns that deal with children, and using
incident-based crime repDrts to. help pDlice sDlve specific types Dfrepeated crime,
such as church arSDn Dr serial murder. Federal and state gDvernments must fDrge
a clDse partnership to. reali'ze the full pDtential Df these new technDlDgies. I am
prepared to. take actiDns to. intensify Dur federal effDrts in the cDming mDnths, but I
will need YDur help in Drder to. ensure Dur success in several initiatives.

         In June Df 1996, I directed the AttDmey General to. develDp a natiDnal
sexual predatDr and child mDlester registratiDn system to. link the sex Dffender
registratiDn and nDtificatiDn systems being develDped in all 50 states. The
Interim natiDnal sex-Dffender registry became DperatiDnal earlier this year, and the
AttDrney General recently wrDte to. enlist YDur assistance. I am encDuraged that
ten states have already IDaded their infDrmatiDn Dn sex Dffenders DntD the system,
with many DfYDU pledging to. do. so. within the next few mDnths. I am grateful for
any help YDU can prDvide in making this national sex Dffender registratiDn system
a reality.

       To. mDve further ahead, I am directing the AttDrney General and Secretary
Df Defense tDday to. take steps to. expand the natiDnal sex-Dffender registry to.
include cDnvicted sex Dffenders being released frDm federal and military facilities.
 My directive will Drder the Federal agencies to. nDtify state authDrities when sex
Dffenders are released within their borders and to. take Dther steps to. improve the
infDrmatiDn abDut federally cDnvicted sex Dffenders included in the natiDnal sex
Dffender registry.

       I will SDDn submit to. CDngress the NatiDnal Crime PreventiDn and Privacy

                                                                          Automated Records Management System
                                                                          Hex-Dump Conversion
     Compact to facilitate the exchange of criminal records by establishing an FBI
     index of state-maintained criminal information that states can access nationwide.
     The Compact would standardize policies for sharing of criminal records for
     purposes such as pre-employment background checks for child care workers and
     school bus drivers. It would improve access to criminal records and save the
     states and the federal government money by avoiding duplication of effort. I
     hope I can count on your support of the Compact as it moves through your State
     legislature.

             Many Federal laws --including the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention
     Act, the Violence Against Women Act, and the National Instant Criminal
     Background Check System --include provisions to help states automate and
     improve their criminal records, especially to block handgun sales to prohibited
     gun purchasers and allow for easy identification of criminal offenders subject to
     "three strikes" laws. The Department of Justice's Bureau of Justice Statistics
     (BJS) stands ready to help states reach this goal through the National Criminal
     History Improvement Program. BJS has already awarded more than $112 million
     to states, with a total of $226 million authorized. I urge your State to take full
     advantage of this program.

             As you know, the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting Program gives us data
     that help us measure our progress in reducing crime. The next generation ofUCR,
     the National Incident-Based Reporting System, will usher in a new era of crime
     data -- so that we can tell for example, that a crime was a hate crime, an incident
     of domestic abuse, or a crime directed at a child. Such information will help law
     enforcement agencies identify local and national trends, and lead to quicker arrests
     of violent offenders. The Justice Department is working with states, counties,
     and cities to expand the NIBRS. I hope that you will lend your support to this
     effort.

              With your State's active participation, we can make significant progress in
     all of these initiatives. Your personal involvement is key in making this happen.
     I look forward to working with you to achieve our mutual goal -- using new
     technologies to make America safer for all our citizens.

     Sincerely,

                                           #####
