Ken would like to have a meeting tomorrow on waivers/budget neutrality.
Unfortunately, Ken is only available between lO:30 - 12:00. Ken will be out on
Friday and does not want to have this wait until next week.

Please let me know if you are available b/w lO:30 - 12:00.

Thanks.

P.S.      I apologize for the short notice, but I just found out a few moments
ago.
