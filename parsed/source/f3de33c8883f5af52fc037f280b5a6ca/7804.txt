Subject:         Senior Staff Coverage for Memorial Day

I will be collecting ihformation on Senior Staff office coverage for the
upcoming federal holiday: Memorial Day, May 25.  The Chief of Staff has
requested a complete list of senior staff (Assistants to the President and
Deputy Assistants to the President only) who will be working the hliday,
as well as the names of those senior staff on call and how they can be
reached.

Please submit your names to me as soon as possible. We will be submitting
this information to the Chief of Staff on Friday afternoon.

Also, please remind any staff members who plan to take time off for the      .6'
holiday, that they are required to take annual leave for those days that
are not the federal holiday.

Remember to provide the WHCA Signal Switchboard with information on how
the senior staff who will be out of town may be reached.

Thank you.
