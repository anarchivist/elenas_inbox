TEXT:
Bruce and Elena -- you both said this morning you would be willing to have
us take up Haskins' invitation to discuss a new, more effective penalty
structure for states that don't meet the computer systems deadline. OMB
agrees, but they want to signal this in the testimony Judge Ross will give
on Wednesday, by adding a paragraph --

"Given the enormity of the penalty under current law -- the loss of all
child support enforcement funding -- we believe that it may be worthwhile
to consider an alternative penalty structure that would provide the proper
incentives to help States be accountable.  Penalties should be tough,
automatic, and rapid when a State fails to meet the deadline for
certification of their automated system.  And penalties should continue to
increase as long as a State remains out of compliance.  Exceptions should
be extremely limited (e.g. natural disasters).  Only in this way can we
create a real incentive for States to comply while maintaining the
operation of the program.  The Administration would be willing to discuss
such an approach with the Committee."

What do you think?
