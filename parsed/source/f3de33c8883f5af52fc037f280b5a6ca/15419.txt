TEXT:
The candidate for Surgeon General has a rather extensive list of
publications to his credit.  In the absence of any special expertise in
our group on a candidate's particular academic specialty, I am trying to
enlist the aid of others in the complex to review publications.  For
example, someone in the NEC is looking at the publications of a Fed.
candidate with an academic background.  Is there someone in your office
who could review a list of publications, do triage, and help us review
them?
