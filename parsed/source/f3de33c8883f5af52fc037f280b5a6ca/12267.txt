TEXT:
    Q    I'm the only resident from Vancouver, Washington,
standing here, so -- (laughter.)   Mr. President, my question has
two parts. The first is, as you near the end of your second term
in office and deal with such issues as the Balkans, what legacy
do you believe you are leaving to the American public? Secondly,
would you be specific, sir, in telling us ways in which America
is better off for your presidency?

          THE PRESIDENT: Well, I think, first of all -- let me
answer the first question first.  I think others will determine
the legacy of this administration, and most of it will have to be
done when all the records are there and time passes and people
without an axe to grind one way or the other have a chance to·
have their say.

          I can only tell you what I have tried to do.  I have
tried to lead America into a new century and into a whole new era
in the way we work and live and relate to each other and the rest
of the world. And I have tried to help build a world that was
more peaceful, more prosperous and more secure.

           I think that among the things that people will say this
administration did and made progress on was, we gave the United
States a modern economic policy and got out of 12 years of
horrible deficit spending during which we quadrupled the debt.
I think that the work we did to support the solution of social
problems in reduclng the welfare rolls by half, and reducing the
crime rate, and putting 100,000 police on the street would be
important.   I think the work we did in education will be
important.
 ,.

           I think the systematic effort we made to promote
reconciliation among people of different racial groups will be
importa~t.   I think the work we have done in the Middle East to
Northern Ireland promoting peace will be important.   I think the
work we've done in Latin America, through the summit of the
Americas, and the work we've done with our other allies in
Central America will be important.   I think there are a lot of
things that will altogether add up to preparing America for the
21st century, building a stronger American community and
repairing the social fabric.

          And let me just say one thing. When I got off the
airplane today there were a bunch of young people who are
AmeriCorps volunteers. That's a program we started back in the
second year of my presidency. And one young woman said to me,
I'm 30 years old, you're the first President I ever voted for.
I've kept up, you did what you said you'd do and it's worked.
And her saying that to me meant more than just about anything any
American could say.

          When I was in New Hampshire for the 7th anniversary of
the New Hampshire primary, there were schoolchildren along the
highway waiting in the cold rain. And person after person said
to me, you had to come to these little town meetings in 1991 and
we listened to you and you've done what you said.

          So what I think what will also happen is people will
see Americans can solve their problems; government has a role to
play and it can produce.  So I think there's a sense of
possibility, a sense of optimism, a sense of eagerness about the
future that the present difficulties in Kosovo cannot begin to
overshadow. And I think the country is clearly better off than
it was six years ago.
