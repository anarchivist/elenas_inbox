TEXT:
Thank you. We've meet with Bill K. now and here are the steps I would
propose on Hopwood/209.

The problem bifurcates between litigation (overturning the decision/law)
and substance, ensuring actual diversity in higher education. The
litigation peice is going forward. We set ourselves the task of figuring
out ways to promote diversity in higher education-- no matter the strict
legal requirement.

This issue seems to break down into parts: longer term-- preparing
students to be ready for college and graduate school, and more immediate--
making sure they have access to those college/grad programs.

Thus, our urban/race agenda is very applicable to this problem as part of
our long-term solution. Listing changes to make sure students get the
preparation to be ready to take advantage, and compete in higher
education. We break this down to programs for pre-K, K-8, and high
school. (inner city teachers, head start, pell grants for 6th graders,
etc. )

For the access issue we are creating a laundry list of possible reforms
 (reaching out to talented minority students, universities partnering with
urban high schools, free AP tests, automatic admission if you are in the
top 10% of your H.S. class, etc) we can start looking at.

We'll put together a memo we hope to get to you by Friday, it should
include a very preliminary list of programs along the lines of above and a
suggested process: who we invite to our first meeting, what we are looking
for from them and by when.

This seems like a useful way to start the effort.

Regards, Tom
