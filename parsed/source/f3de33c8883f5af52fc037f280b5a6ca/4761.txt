Dawn Chirwa is sending us a document that the Department of Education wants to
release at ACE's conference on diversity in higher education tomorrow; the
document has been cleared by the civil rights division, and is currently being
ok'd by OLC.   My understanding is that the document is something along the
lines of guidelines for higher ed institutions to use in assessing their
practices in admissions, financial aid, etc.   As soon as we get a copy from
the counsel's office we will forward a copy to you.

Thanks.
