            Dear Hugh:

            Thank you for your thoughtful letter on the issue of police abuse and misconduct. I
            appreciate your recommendations on this difficult issue, and have forwarded your letter to
            the Attorney General for her consideration [as she continues to work with state and local
            law enforcement agencies on these matters].

            But I want to be clear: My Administration is committed to vigorously enforcing the law,
            including against those police officers who would betray the public's trust through
            lawlessness or brutality. We are equally committed to strengthening the bond between
            community residents and their local police, and making the criminal justice system more
            responsive to the public safety needs of all our people.

            Again, thank you for your letter.

            Be
