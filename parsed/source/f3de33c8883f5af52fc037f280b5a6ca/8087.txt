 TEXT:
 Below is the passage that raised red flags for Bruce.  Please take a look
 at it and let me know how you'd like to proceed.  It explains how existing
 civil rights laws would apply in the case of the new 5-year time limit.
 Eddie Correia of WH Counsel is OK on this; he suggested changes to an
 earlier draft that are reflected in this version.

 The overall document is the product of civil rights experts at HHS, DOJ,
 and several other agencies.  When we OK the document, i t will go out as
 draft guidance for states, advocates, and civil rights groups to comment
 on.  The general impetus is a desire to clarify how civil rights laws
 apply to new areas of welfare law, mostly welfare to work but also time
 limits.  The specific impetus is that Shalala told the Leadership
 Conference on Civil Rights that she would do this.

 Here's the current text:

  "Set forth below are examples of conduct that may violate Title VI:

 " ... The Act imposes a 5-year limit on receipt of TANF benefits.  However,
 a state may allow hardship exemptions from the time limit for up to 20%of
 its caseload.    State and counties may not use a racially neutral criterion
 that, nevertheless, excludes a disproportionately greater number of
 minorities than non-minorities to determine who will be granted this
 exemption, unless there is a substantial and legitimate justification for
 this criterion.    Even if there is such a justification, this criterion
 cannot be used if there is a comparably effective alternative to identify
 persons who qualify for this exemption that excludes fewer minorities."

  In answer to some of the questions you may have about the foregoing:

 Q:  In measuring whether a criterion excludes "a disproportionately
 greater number of minorities", is the base the welfare case load subject to
 the time limit or the population at large?   A:  The welfare caseload
 subject to the time limit.

 Q:  Is HHS prepared to give states technical assistance to define terms
 like "disproportionately greater" and "substantial and legitimate
 justification"?   A:  They're prepared to talk to and try to help states,
 but my understanding is that they won't offer any specific guidance or
 comfort such as "you're OK as long as your exemptions for minorities are
 within +5% of the percentage of minorities in the caseload." That's the
 nature of the beast and that's why it will be scary to states.



What do you think?
