TEXT:
FYI -- The American Council on Education, together with dozens of other
higher education organizations and associations, ran a 2/3 page
endorsement of diversity in higher education in today's Washington Post,
on page A9.  It is a nice statement of support and it will be helpful to
colleges and universities who seek to achieve diversity to further their
educational objectives.
