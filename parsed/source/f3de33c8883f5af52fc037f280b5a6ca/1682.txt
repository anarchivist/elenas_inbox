TEXT:
HHS had agreed to put more policy options together.  I haven't been
managing this -- have only weighed in vis a vis radiation event.     This
is OPL's event as I understand it, so I've assumed we're in a consulting,
not a driving, role.  I'll check w/HHS and OPL on status and take a look
at HHS's policy options and get back to you.
