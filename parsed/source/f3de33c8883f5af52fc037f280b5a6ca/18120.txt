TEXT:
Elena,

I wanted to follow up on your meeting earlier this week with Commissioner
Meissner.  Leanne talked the Bob Bach from INS today. Apparently, they
were concerned that OMB was moving forward with drafting chapters on INS
reform, and that this was going to somehow trump or co-opt our review.   I
spoke with Steve Mertens at OMB and sure enough, he was drafting such a
chapter. According to ·Steve, he was putting this in as a "straw man"
because he was sure that we wanted something in the budget document and
that he might as well put in his recommendations.  I asked Steve not to
include anything more than the most general statement (we are reviewing
recommendations) in the budget document until he heard otherwise from us.
This is the second time that Steve Mertens has made assumptions about our
process directly contrary to what we are telling him. At least for now,
we have spoken with INS and assured them that our process has not been
completed, etc. and that OMB was not driving what we do.

What should be our next step in all this? As this latest episode
indicates, OMB (or, at least Steve) is nervous about their budget
deadlines, and wants to have an idea from us if we are going to use the
document as a vehicle, how we are going to use it.  To make that
determination, we only nee~ to decide the broad questions, of course.

Thanks.

julie
