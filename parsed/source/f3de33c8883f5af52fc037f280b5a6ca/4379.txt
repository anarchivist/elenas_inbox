MEMORANDUM FOR ERSKINE BOWLES

FROM:           BRUCE REED
                MIKE COHEN

SUBJECT:        CONFERENCE STRATEGY FOR NATIONAL TESTS

Last evening we pulled together a meeting of White House and Education Department staff to
develop a conference strategy for the national testing initiative, in light of the fundamentally
different positions taken by the House and Senate. This memo outlines our basic approach, which
will be updated and refined regularly.

Basic Objectives
We must come out of the conference with a bill that provides both the authority and the funds to
proceed with the testing initiative, and with the tests under the control of an independent National
Assessment Governing Board. The Senate bill provides the NAGB provisions we need.
However, neither bill provides the funds. The Gorton block-grant amendment in the Senate
eliminated the funds for the Fund for Improving Education (the account from which test
development is funded), while the Goodling amendment prohibits the use of any funds for test
development.

 Further, at a minimum we must aim to assemble a veto-proof margin of support for these
 provisions in the House. This requires picking up X votes over the 124 who initially opposed
"Goodling [need to double check numbers here]. In addition, in order to put the testing plan on
 firm footing at the state and local level, even if not necessary for sustaining a veto, we will aim
 generally to secure broader support for initiative within the Democratic Caucus and among
 moderate Republicans in the House

Timing Considerations
The conferees are likely to be appointed and begin work next week. In addition to the
conventional practice of naming the subcommittee chairs, it is conceivable that Goodling will
push to be named as well. If so, this would clearly complicate the process.

Staff from Legislative Affairs predict that this will be a long conference, with the prospect of one
or more short-term CR's that will carry us through to mid-October before likely completion.

The testing issue will be one of the most difficult conference issue, along with the Gorton
amendment and funding levels for several specific programs including Goals 2000, Pell, and
America Reads. Outside of education, it appears that the Teamsters election will also be a
difficult issue. At this point, it is too early to determine the likely interplay among these issues,
the tradeoffs we may be forced to consider among them, or additional modifications to the testing
initiative itselfthat we will need to consider. As we continue to consult with our current and
most likely supporters in the House, we will have a better handle on these issues.
                                                                            Hex-Dump Conversion
3_ Communications
Our best strategy for achieving victory is to convince the Republicans that they will pay a heavy
price, again, for opposing our efforts to improve public education.                            .

Therefore, we will work to tie the House vote on testing, the Senate block grant vote, and the
anticipated DC voucher proposals together to support an overall message that the President is
trying to improve public education, while Republicans are once again trying to abandon and
weaken it.

We have several key opportunities to begin to hammer the message home over the next several
weeks, starting with this Saturday's Radio Address and Charter Schools event. The Education
Department is planning a press conference for Secretary Riley next week to amplify this
message, and we are working with the Vice President's office to develop events that would
enable him to carry this message as well. In addition, we will look for additional events for the
President and other principals in the next several weeks

The Education Department will continue its efforts to speak to editorial boards around the
country, now targeting key editorial boards in the states and districts of conferees.

We will again urge business leaders -- CEO's affiliated with the Business Roundtable, the
Chamber of Commerce, and the National Alliance of Business, as well as the high tech CEO's
who endorsed the President's plan last Spring -- to place op-eds in support of the tests and to
seek other opportunities to visibly highlight their support. In addition, we will ask supportive
Republican opinion leaders (e.g., Finn, Ravitch, Engler) to place op-eds. Both groups can be
particularly helpful in framing the Senate provision as a compromise House Republicans can and
should accept.

4. Legislative
White House and Education Department staff, as well as Secretary Riley, will work with our
friends in the House to determine how best to broaden our support on both sides of the aisle. On
the Republican side, Porter, Riggs and Castle are most likely to assemble moderate support
behind the Senate provisions, though it is not yet clear how they will deal with Goodling, who
remains dug in. We expect our business supporters to reach out to both the House Republican
leadership and targeted members who are most likely to be supportive.

On the Democratic side, we will continue to work to address concerns of Black and Hispanic
Caucuses. For the Black Caucus, the issue is school construction, and the best move we can
make on this front in the short-term would be to support the Daschle/Gephardt proposal. DPC
and NEC both support this move, Treasury has signed off on the offsets in their bill, and the issue
is now being considered in OMB.

We will continue to look for steps we can take to reduce the concerns of the Hispanic Caucus.
As you know, the central issue here is our decision to give the reading test only in English. We
are exploring a number of ways to address this. One would identify existing, commercially
available reading tests in Spanish that are based on the same national standards as our reading
                                                                                 Hex-Dump Converslol

test, and would therefore be highly comparable. We are addressing a number of feasibility
issues before we will be ready to discuss this option with the caucus and others in the Hispanic
community. This option may not be acceptable to the Hispanic Caucus. However, it would not
require Congressional approval, and therefore could not be easily blocked by Republicans. In
addition, we can offer one of the new slots on NAGB to an Hispanic mayor. Further, we are
working to develop some legislative options (e.g., to explicitly provide for the tests, to permit
NAGB to decide whether to provide them) and to determine if there are any 'that could be
acceptable to the Hispanic Caucus and neither lose Republican support nor precipitate an effort
to add language in conference that would prohibit a Spanish language test. the levels of support
and opposition they may stimulate.

5. Outreach
In addition to the steps above, we will work with our allies in the education and business
communities to continue to support the President's initiatives, oppose amendments that stop
them, and mobilize behind our overall message to support public education.
