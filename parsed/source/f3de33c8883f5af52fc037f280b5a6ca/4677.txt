TEXT:
Several members of the press are planning stories on progress in the 6
months since the service summit. The Times already did one, and the
Boston Globe is working on one that may not be positive; it may already
have been in the press this weekend.   Jonathan Alter will do one that
people suspect will be critical. America's Promise is trying to respond
by putting together a 6-month update that Powell will reveal in some
setting later this month.  They have asked all commitment makers for
media-oriented nuggets they could use.   (I am putting together a package
for them on federal agency commitments.) America's Promise remains in a
state of flux.  They still have not developed their tracking system for
commitments, and personnel changes continue.

Steve Silverman and I have talked about us doing a "6 month memo" that
would layout our own progress since the summit and talk about where we
want to be at the 1-year point. Let me know if you think that's a good or
bad idea.   Ideas we could develop are outreach on health insurance, both
Medicaid and the new program; and reauthorization of AmeriCorps.   You may
have seen that Harris just sent the President a memo -- it's a general
update on the Corporation, with a plea for making reauthorization a priori
ty by releasing it this year and pushing hard early next year.
