TEXT:
With regard to the charter schools paragraph, Terry Edmonds and I
discussed this with Michael Waldman.  Michael (1) admitted he doesn't know
anything about charter schools; (2) believes we need to say something
about how we are going to actually improve schools; (3) upon reflection
and after some discussion, admitted that giving them better teachers,
technology, better facilities and making them safer might qualify as steps
to actually improve schools; (4) doesn't think we should retreat from our
position just to placate the audience; (5) agreed to drop the charter
schools paragraph; and, (6) thinks the President will talk about it anyway.

It was a very satisfying conversation.

Terry and I otherwise made only a few changes.   We'll see the next draft
tomorrow.

By the way, does someone from DPC need to be on this trip, to brief POTUS
or the press on the teacher training piece? I'll go if needed, though I'd
prefer not to. Are you going, and, if so, can I do anything to help you?
In addition, Riley will be on the trip and should be able to handle the
press and POTUS if needed.
