TEXT:
This bill is on the House Suspension Calendar for next Tuesday.   It was
previously circulated to most of you, as well as the Departments of
Transportation and Justice, for comment on March 9th.   Both Departments
responded that. they had no objection to the bill, and there were no
internal objections.   In keeping with the Department of Transportation's
wishes on the bill (they do not object to enactment of the bill, but view
most of its requirements as unnecessary), we plan to communicate an
informal "no objection"   to the bill via LA.

The chief provision of the bill is a "good samaritan" provision limiting
the liability of individuals "providing or attempting to provide
assistance in the case of an in-flight medical emergency."  Such persons
would be liable, however, if "guilty of gross negligence or willful
misconduct" "while rendering such assistance." There is also a limited
exclusion for air carriers for "obtaining or attempting to obtain the
assistance of a passenger in an in-flight medical emergency, or out of the
acts or omissions of the passenger rendering the assistance if the
passenger is not an employee or agent of the carrier and the carrier in


 good faith believes that the passenger is a medically qualified
 individual. "

 Other provisions of the bill require the Department to reevaluate current
 requirements regarding medical equipment maintained at airports and on
 aircraft operated by passenger air carriers.

    It excluding "medically qualified individuals" who are "not agents or
 employees
