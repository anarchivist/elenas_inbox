TEXT:
Here is a a menu of compromises:

1.   Use LEAF but end the program in 15 years.  (Senator Ford caught
Dallas and I in the hallway and confidentially suggested he could go with
this.) We need to see if we can get any committed votes with this, we are
reaching out to Senate moderate R's.

2.   Do the buyout in 7 years for quota holders who don't grow, but less
money for other lesees etc. but who are getting permits. Dallas Smith and
Keith have written this one up and I will red dot it over to you.

3 and 4. Either a state run program or a privatized program.   Ford· is
drafting/has drafted this language. A state by state compact may have
constitutional problems, a federalized program helps those who want to
vote to end the governmental tobacco program, it may appear to be a double
standard to some farm state Ds.

4. Reduce the size of the Ford package (no Pell grants etc.), give money
to farm staters in emergencies like the Dakotas, reduce the time of the
buyout. Reducing the buyout helps with the Helms types, reducing the
size of the Ford package helps with non-tobacco types.  But it probably
doesn't actually change votes and it costs money.


We are pretty close to actually winning LEAF, and very close to being
confident about striking Lugar.  Ford is talking to Daschle today about
getting to go first, they are worried word of this plan will leak to Lott.
