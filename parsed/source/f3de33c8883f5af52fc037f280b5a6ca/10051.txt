TEXT:
I received a copy of the draft letter which is proposed to be sent by the
President to the NBAC.I offer one important editorial suggestion. In the
second sentence reference is made to "mingling of species". This reference
is likely to be more problematic than helpful. During the debate about
transgenic animal research this type of rhetoric was used by biotech
opponent Jeremy Rifkin. As a subsequent OTA report correctly pointed out
this notion is not scientifically relevant in the context of animal
breeding (or plant breeding) .

 As most of the NBAC witnesses who testified in the cloning hearings the
"special status" of certain cellular material is what is at issue. In the
published reports some of the research involved concerned cellular
material that could not become a fetus that could be brought to
term. Thus, it is important to correctly idenify the exact nature of the
experiments which are to be addressed.

 I think there are better ways to get this point across (see below). It is
'also important to separate the types of experiments involved here. There
 were legitimate and published work done on stem stems by Geron. There, on
 the other hand, have been press reports about work about claims from Dr.
West. It would be mistake to dignify the later claims with the former peer
 reviewed work.
 Having said that, it is important to clarify which experiments are to be
 examined. Is the intention to look at both of the published experiments
 and those claimed by Dr. West. If so, that should be stated.

My suggested amendment to the letter would be to state"

        " ... experiments involving stems cells, and other research on
material related to embryos".

I hope that this helps.
