     Subject:         Those Ed Dept folks are persistent!

     They've proposed to add the following language to the conferee letter:

       "The Administration strongly supports the goal of providing educational
     opportunities to enable enabling more welfare recipients to move from
     welfare to work."

     I plan to say no -- I assume you agree?

     Here is how the whole paragraph would read.

            The Senate bill contains a provision amending the
            Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program
            (TANF).  It would expand the type and length of
            education programs that may be counted toward a
            State's "work activity" participation rate. The
            provision would also extend the FY98 and FY99
            exclusion of teen parents from the cap on education
            programs that may be counted toward a State's "work
            activity" participation rate to FY2000 and beyond.
            The Administration strongly supports the goal of
            providing educational opportunities to
            enable enabling more welfare recipients to
            move from welfare to work. We look forward to working
            with conferees to ensure that the final legislation
            keeps the doors of college open to all Americans
            while still maintaining the welfare law's strong work
..
      requirements.
