TEXT:
How do you think it would sound to announce $240 million in competitive
Welfare-to-Work funds for welfare recipients with the greatest challenges
to employment, with highest priority for applications addressing:
         (I) limited English proficiency
         (2) disabilities
         (3) substance abuse problems
         (4) domestic violence
         (5) non-custodial fathers

This has the advantage of essentially earmarking the whole $240 million,
not half as we were discussing before (applications that focussed on these
populations would get 10 extra points, ensuring they would have a great
advantage over other proposals but also ensuring that we wouldn't fund
poor quality proposals -- e.g., those that were so bad that they weren't
competitive even with the 10 extra points wouldn't be funded).  It also
enables us to have fathers prominently featured (to show we're focusing on
them with this year's competitive $$, while we push for a stronger focus
for next year's formula $$). It also adds victims of domestic violence
which may be helpful given past criticism.  I think OMB and DOL could live
with this (both have pushed hard for no earmarking but if there is to be
earmarking DOL wants to ensure fathers are included and OMB wants to add
victims of domestic violence).   please respond ASAP -- because this
notice gets published in the Federal Register, we need to move to be ready
by Monday.

Regarding the overall event: in the Ann Lewis meeting people thought the
focus on fathers was the strongest message and were less concerned that we
show strong business support for welfare to work.  Current tentative'
speaking program:

           (I)   CEO
           (2)   Local elected
           (3)   Father
           (4)   POTUS

We're vetting candidates.
