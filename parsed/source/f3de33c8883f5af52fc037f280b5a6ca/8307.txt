DRAFT

                                          June 18, 1998


MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:          BRUCE REED
               LARRY STEIN (DO YOU WANT TO INCLUDE HIM ON THIS MEMO AS
               REQUESTED BY JANET?)

SUBJECT:       Bilingual Education


        On June 4, the House Education and Workforce Committee reported H.R. 3982, the
English Fluency Act, introduced by Rep. Frank Riggs. This bill raises many of the same
programmatic issues and political dynamics as the Unz Initiative in California. The purpose of
this memo is to update you on this proposal and the development of an Administration
alternative, and to present you with options for how to proceed.

I.     Overview of Riggs Bill

        The bill would eliminate the existing Bilingual Education and Emergency Immigrant
Education programs and would (1) distribute funds through a block grant that is not targeted
toward school districts with the highest quality programs and greatest funding need; (2) require
states to withdraw funding from local programs in cases where students do not master English
within two years and set a 3-year limit for serving any individual student, though it would not
provide any extra help for students or corrective action for programs that need it; (3) not require
States to maintain their own efforts; and (4) eliminate professional development programs
designed to prepared qualified ESL and bilingual education teachers. The bill also seeks to
sharply curtail the enforcement powers of the Education Department's Office of Civil Rights by
voiding existing voluntary compliance agreements between OCR and local school districts with
regard to educating LEP students and by requiring OCR to publish -- and the Congress to ratify --
new guidelines and compliance standards for Title VI enforcement. These provisions would
weaken enforcement of Title VI ofthe Civil Rights Act of 1964 and result in increased litigation.

II.    Development of Administration Alternative

        We are on track to have an alternative bill based on the principles you approved and
Secretary Riley articulated in his statement of opposition to the Unz Initiative completed and
ready for transmittal to Congress by the end of this week. This bill would amend (rather than
replace entirely) the existing bilingual education program. Specifically, it would require
participating school districts to (1) establish a goal of preparing LEP students to enter
                                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion

successfully regular English classrooms in not more than three years, (2) conduct annual
assessments of student's English proficiency; (3) provide additional help for students not on track
to English proficiency; (4) develop a corrective action plan, to be approved by the Secretary, if a
significant percentage of students do not meet the 3-year goal. If student performance does not
improve after a year, no additional funding would be provided. The bill would also provide
incentives for districts that make outstanding progress toward the three year goal, by providing
them with an additional 2-4 years of funding. In addition, the bill would guarantee local
flexibility by removing the existing cap on funding for programs that do not use the students
native language, and would remove the competitive priority currently given to programs designed
to maintain native language while helping students learn English.

This bill would be a solid first step to reform federal programs to help students become proficient
in English. The Education Department is working on a more thorough approach as part of its
planning for the reauthorization of ESEA. This approach would include a more thorough
overall of the bilingual education program, as well as an effort to make Title 1 a more effective
tool for helping LEP students learn English.

III.·   Congressional Dynamic

        H.R. 3892 was reported out of committee on a straight party line vote (22-17). While the
bill will certainly move in the House, there is no hint of movement on the Riggs bill in the
Senate. Barring unforseen developments, we do not expect either the Senate authorizing or
appropriations committees to take up this issue.

        The Republicans will include the Riggs bill as a rider to the Labor-HHS-Education
Appropriations bill when it is marked up in subcommittee on June 2x. Subcommittee
Democrats view this bill as so fundamentally flawed that they do not plan on offering any
amendments to try and improve it. The bill will provide approximately $2 [CK] billion less than
you have requested for overall education spending; it will make significant cuts in.
Administration priorities such as Goals 2000, and will contain a number of unacceptable riders
including a prohibition on national testing and the creation of one or more block grants out of
existing programs.

       House Democrats have not yet finalized a strategy for this bill at the full committee and
when it comes to the floor. They presume that you will issue a veto threat as the bill moves
forward. It appears likely that any amendments offered will be designed to promote a unified
Democratic message rather than to materially improve a bill will be still be fundamentally
flawed. We do not expect the Hispanic Caucus to mount an effort to strip Riggs from the bill.
Consequently, it is entirely possible that there will not be a vote or significant debate on bilingual
education on the House floor.

        It seems unlikely that the Republicans will completely pass up the opportunity to push a
debate on this popular issue, and we cannot rule out the possibility that Riggs will come to the


                                                  2
                                                                         Hex-Dump ConverSion


floor as a free-standing measure. Notwithstanding the success of the Unz Initiative, Committee
Democrats did not feel compelled to offer an alternative to Riggs's bill during committee
markup. Moderate Committee Democrats (e.g., Reps. Roemer and Kind) as well as the four
Members of the Hispanic Caucus on the Committee (Reps. Martinez, Romero-Barcelo, Hinojosa
and Sanchez) decided to vote against the Riggs bill even without a Democratic alternative.

         However, it is quite possible that House Democrats will feel compelled to offer an
alternative if and when the bill hits the floor so that they can vote for reform of bilingual
education. Leaders of the Hispanic Caucus, including Caucus Chairman Becerra and Education
Committee Member Hinojosa, have quietly acknowledged that, for the greater good of the
Democratic Caucus, such a floor alternative might become necessary. However, up until now
they have been adamantly opposed to a floor alternative, and remain to be convinced that one is
necessary for a successful floor strategy. In addition to their own apprehensions, Hispanic
Caucus members are under substantial political pressure from bilingual advocates to steer clear
of an alternative.    While moderate Democrats themselves were not clear at the time of
committee mark-up if they would need an alternative, there are now growing signs of interest in
one among moderates, and ongoing discussions about this with the Hispanic Caucus members.

IV.    Options for Leadership

        Regardless of how the Riggs bill moves forward over the coming weeks and months, the
national debate over bilingual education will continue. We believe that you must be an active
player in that debate, in order to shape Congressional action on the federal program, as well as
the broader debate that will affect state and iocal actions throughout the nation.

        We see three options for how you can proceed. Any of these options could be carried out
shortly after you return from China.

Option 1..     Transmit An Administration Bill

        Sending up a bill in the near future would demonstrate your clear corrimittment to
reforming bilingual education, and would position you in the reasonable center of the emerging
national debate, between those such as Unz and Riggs who are proposing extreme and punative
approaches on the one hand, and those who are defending the status quo that was rejected by a
large margin of the public, at least in California. From this point of view, it will be important to
transmit the bill as soon as possible in the event that the Riggs bill captures press attention as it
moves forward. It will provide House Democrats with a ready-made alternative to Riggs if
they feel the need for one. Even if this bill is not introduced or does not gamer much support
among Democrats, by staking out a clear and independent Administration position now, you
can have a significant impact on next year's debate, when legislation to reform bilingual
education is more likely to reach your desk.

       There are significant legislative downsides to introducing an Administration bill now, if


                                                 3
                                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion

House Democrats have otherwise concluded that they neither want nor need an alternative bill. In
particular, introducing an alternative at this time would be perceived by the Hispanic Caucus as
jumping the gun strategically, and preempting meaningful consultation regarding the substance
of an alternative. It would generate a hostile reaction from the Caucus, and is likely to recreate
the same divisions among House Democrats we saw last year on national testing. The prospects
that the Black Caucus would ally itself with the Hispanic Caucus and Republicans in opposition
to your bill are high. Under these circumstances, there is a good chance that your proposal
would not find a Democratic sponsor, or if introduced and allowed to come up on the floor as an
alternative to Riggs, would be defeated by a large, bipartisan margin. Opposition by the
Hispanic and Black Caucus would almost certainly spill over into renewed opposition to
continued funding for the national test (though the prospects of support from the two caucuses is
slim at best in any event), and perhaps to other legislative battles as well.

       Further, there is the outside chance that sending up an Administration alternative that
lacks support from Democrats could push Riggs to seek to narrow the differences between his
approach and yours. He has indicated privately that he does not see large differences between
his approach and the principles outlined in the Administration's opposition to Unz, and that he is
ultimately prepared to drop the civil rights enforcement provisions in his bill. If Riggs were to
modify his bill in order to more closely reflect the principles in ours, we would have a difficult
time opposing his bill and would risk infuriating Democrats if we cut a deal with him.

Option 2.     Defer to the Congressional Democrats on the Timing of Transmittal

        An alternative course of action would be to proceed immediately to consult with members
of the Hispanic Caucus and other Democrats on the shape of an alternative bill, using the
Administration bill as the starting point, and making our 3-year goal and strengthened
accountability as nonnegotiable principles which must be incorporated into any legislation we
would support. While there is no guarantee that Democrats in general and the Members of the
Hispanic Caucus in particular will endorse our approach, we can gain leverage in these
negotiations by making clear that a veto threat to Riggs remains dependent upon the introduction
of an alternative consistent with our principles. We can also make clear that we will transmit a
reauthorization bill next year that is fully consistent with these principles.

        If we determine together with House Democrats that an alternative is strategically
necessary when the bill comes to the floor or is taken up by the appropriations committee, we
could then introduce a bill consistent with our principles that would unite, rather than divide
Democrats. Alternatively, if House Democrats either do not want an alternative when the Riggs
bill or the Appropriations bill reaches the floor, or will not support an approach based on our
principles, we can reassess our position at that time and either send up our own alternative or
choose to wait until next year's reauthorization.

      This approach is more likely to unite the Democrats over a potentially divisive issue, keep
them united for the larger education and other battles over the coming months, and enable those


                                                4
                                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion

of us in the Administration to focus our time and energy on fights with Republicans rather than
on infighting within the Democratic Caucus.

       There are clear downsides to this approach as well. It places a large measure of control
over the timing and, to some extent the content, of your own proposal in the hands of Members
who do not share your views about the need or way to reform bilingual education.
Consequently, the chances are high that you would not transmit legislation at all this year, and
you would therefore be unable to position yourself or to effectively define the debate.


Option 3.     Announce a Comprehensive Plan to Help Students Learn English, with
              Legislation to be Sent up Next Year

        A third alternative would be to announce a package of steps, designed to advance a
comprehensive approach to helping LEP students receive a world-class education and become
proficient in English. The idea is to broaden the debate beyond the design of the bilingual
education program, and focus instead on a range of steps that would support the goal of helping
students leam English within three years. This package is still under development and may not
be ready until several weeks after you return from China. It would include:

·      A .Proposal to Overhaul the Federal Bilingual Education Program and Related
       Programs. You would announce that next year you will send Congress legislation that
       would complete overhaul federal efforts to help LEP kids learn English. The overhaul
       would set a 3 year goal for students to become proficient in English, hold schools
       accountable for results, provide communities with the flexibility to determine how best to
       meet the goal, and give parents greater choice. Legislation sent to Congress next year
       would be more sweeping than the package of amendments available at present. It would
       also address how the Title 1 program--which serves far more students than the bilingual
       education program--will also be redesigned to help LEP students become proficient in
       English, according to the same principles outlined above.

·      A Directive to Identify National and International Models of Best Practice. You
       would direct the Secretary of Education to produce a report by next Fall that would
       identify places in the U.S. and in other countries with sizeable immigrant populations
       (e.g., Canada and Israel) that help students become proficient in English (or another 2nd
       language as appropriate) within 3 years. The purpose of the directive would be to inform
       the development of our legislative proposal and to focus the attention of the public and
       educators on effective ways to help students more rapidly become proficient in English.

·      An Initiative to Strengthen Teaching for LEP Students. The existing bilingual
       education program provides strong support for the recruitment, preparation and continued
       training of bilingual and ESL teachers. We are exploring ways to better highlight and .
       strengthen this component. In addition to further expanding our investments in this area,


                                               5

                                                                           Autornated Records Management System
                                                                           Hex-Dwnp Conversion

           options under discussion include creating mentoring programs to help beginning teachers,
           providing additional incentives to recruit well prepared teachers, and strengthening the
           provisions in Title 1.

    ·      An Initiative to Promote School/College. Partnerships, Tutoring, and Other
           Community-Based Support for Helping Students Learn English. We are exploring
           how best to use existing programs, including America Reads, the 21 st Century Learning
           Program, and High Hopes as the foundation for promoting grass roots efforts to mobilize
           extra help for LEP students to learn English through after-school tutoring, Saturday
           programs, and other mechanisms to recruit adults, particularly bilingual adults, to help
           students learn English.

    ·      An R&D and Technology Initiative. We can strengthen efforts to help students learn
           English with an R&D initiative targeted to areas that have the potential for high impact.
           These might include continued studies and demonstrations of best practices, the
           development of technology-based assessments of language proficiency, and the
           development of programming to promote English language acquisition, for use as digital
           TV comes into widespread use. It might also include demonstration programs focused
           on the best ways of helping young adult (18-24) recent immigrants, who have not
           completed high school in their country of origin, do not emoll in high school in the U.S.,
           learn English.

    ·      A Proposal to Help English Speaking Students Learn Foreign Languages. This
           package provides an important opportunity to broaden the debate about bilingual
           education by recognizing the value of bilingualism in a global economy. In particular,
           we could propose an initiative to expand the existing $5 million program that promotes
           foreign language instruction, and focus it on encouraging more schools to provide foreign
           language instruction in the early grades, when students are best equipped to learn a
           second language.

           This more comprehensive approach would give you a strong basis for leading the national
    debate about bilingual education, while providing the time to fully develop a comprehensive
    Administration package as part of the FY 2000 budget process. By not transmitting legislation
    now; it avoids the prospect of creating a rift with and among Congressional Democrats.
    However, if there was agreement among Congressional Democrats that an alternative to Riggs
    was necessary in the short run, the package of amendments we have already drafted could be
    used.

           The primary downside to this approach is that it could be seen by the press as an effort to
    delay changing the bilingual education program, because legislation would not be sent until next
