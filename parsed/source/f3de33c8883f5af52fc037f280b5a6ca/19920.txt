                                       Statement by the President
                             (Embargoed until 6:00 pm, Sunday, May 17,1998)


        Today's announcement by the Justice Department that crime has fallen for the sixth year in a row
        is great news for the American people. Since 1993, violent crimes have dropped by nearly 20%,
        and murders are down by a remarkable 30%. These results show that our strategy of giving
        communities the resources they need for more police, tougher punishments and better prevention
        is working. But too many of our children are either killing or being killed because of the deadly
        mix o(gangs, guns and drugs that remains a serious problem in America today. And we cannot
        let up in our fight against crime and violence until that changes.
