TEXT:
Pauline Abernathy heard a rumor (via Carol Rasco) that the 1 million books
donated by Scholastic Books are not earmarked for America Reads.  It turns
out the rumor is wrong, and they are earmarked.  Pauline said that if the
books were up for grabs, she was desperate to steal them for the brain
conference.  She said the FL is trying very hard to come up with a book
donation so that docs can prescribe books to kids.  I am talking to the
Summit/Corporation people to see if there is a way to make everyone happy
   The purpose of this note was just to see if you had strong feelings
about this competition between America Reads and the brain.

FYI, Pauline said that Carol is really bad-mouthing the summit in
administration meetings.  I guess I should check in with her ....
