I suspect Major Owens may have done in his conversation with POTUS to
undermine the school construction initiative and advance the cause of
vouchers than he realized!

Janet wanted me to forward this information to you about Major Owens
conversation with the President.  I have forwarded this info to Sylvia
Mathews.

Representative Major Owens - Thursday, January 15, 1998


Major Owens engaged the President in conversation about school
construction and vouchers. He contends that while he and a majority of
the Congressional Black Caucus do not support school vouchers,  proponents
of the measure have started a grassroots effort in their districts.
Representative Owens feels this effort could possibly cause some CBC
members to change their view on school vouchers.  He told the President
that a commitment to school construction funds could alleviate much of the


pressure CBC members are receiving at home. With an increase in school
construction money, Members would be able to make an argument for
improving existing schools rather than abandoning them.

In subsequent discussions with Mr. Owens, he expressed his appreciation
for the AdministrationO,s efforts to secure educational funding in the
FY98 budget and for the school INTERNET access program.  However, he feels
more can be done and the upcoming legislative session will be the right
time to continue the good work.
