TEXT:
1. By Friday it seems likely USDA will have vetted and endorsed a
legislative proposal to: (1) increase its recall authority, (2) increase
authority for levying civil fines, and (3) be able to pull inspections
from repeat violators (essentially putting them out of business). USDA
doesn't seem to want much more money, and generally want to avoid looking
like they are doing a christmas tree. I'll pass this info along to
Jerry. The question is what involvement the POTUS should have.   I think
these sound like (and USDA says they are) pretty significant steps, and
the time of year is great. Of course, he's got no time.

2. Hate crime-- the conference sounds fine, they will get us paper next
week, the primary question will be Kennedy's bill-- how to expand hate
crimes to include women without floooding the fbi with investigating all
sexual assualts. The solution: DOJ needs to be encouraged to come up with
workable language to limit the reporting to relevant cases ...
