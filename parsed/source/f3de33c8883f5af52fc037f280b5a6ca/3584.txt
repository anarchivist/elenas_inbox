     TEXT:
     Tonight. Joan Huffer of Senator Dachle's staff gave me an update of their
     dicussions with Senate Parliamentarian Bob Dove (I believe she'd already
     filled you in. Barbara).

     I} Dove says he believes FLSA violates the Byrd rule and does not expect
     to see anything that would change his mind.

     2} Dove believes the new version of the privatization prov1s10n does not
     violate the Byrd rule.  He told this directly to Senator Phil Gramm based
     on the fact that the new provision had a cost and covers all states.
     Huffer thinks there are still grounds on which the provision violates the
     Byrd rule. and will try to argue them tomorrow. but believes Dove won't
     want to reverse himself on a statement he made directly to Senator Gramm.

     3} Huffer spoke to one of Dove's assistants on the House vocational
'.
      education provision. The assistant will recommend to Dove that he rule it
      violates the Byrd rule.

      4) SSI State Supplement. When Huffer told Dove that CBO couldn't decide
      if the provision had a small cost or a small savings, Dove told Huffer he
      thinks it violates the Byrd rule.  Now CBO has apparently changed its mind
      and plans to assign a small cost.  Huffer will go back to Dove with" this
      new news tomorrow and try to persuade him it shouldn't matter.
