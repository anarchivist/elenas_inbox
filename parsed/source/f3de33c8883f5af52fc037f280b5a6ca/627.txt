The Constitution and federal statutory law permit a greater degree of religious expression in the
federal workplace than many Americans may now understand. The government may not
discriminate in the workplace against private religious expression during the workday. Subject
only to the special restraints imposed by the Establishment Clause, religious expression,
including proselytizing, is protected by the First Amendment in the federal workplace in the
same way, and to the same extent, as other constitutionally valued speech. Like all private
employee speech, it must be permitted except where it has an impact on the actual operation of
government. At the same time, federal employers, supervisors and employees also may not use
the workplace to coerce the consciences of other employees, or to convey official endorsement or
disparagement of religion. Although application of the law might be complicated in some
specific factual contexts and will require careful consideration in particular cases, certain
principles are clear, and permit the promulgation of guidelines to apply to religious expression in
the federal workplace. To understand why this is so requires a full understanding of general
principles of anti-discrimination law as it applies to the federal workplace.
         Federal law prohibits employment discrimination on the basis of race, sex, national origin
and religion. That statute, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, affects religious (and
non-religious) employees' rights in the government workplace in two ways. First, it bans
discrimination on the basis of religion in employment. Second, it requires employers to
accommodate employee religious practices. These two obligations-which are sometimes not
easy to reconcile-are binding on the feder:al government acting as an employer. Among other
topics, these guidelines address the intersection of these two obligations.       .
         The federal government as an employer may not promote or refuse to promote, hire or
refuse to hire, or otherwise favor or disfavor an employee or potential employee because of his or
her religion. Thus, a federal agency may not refuse to hire Buddhists, or deliberately deny
promotions to Christians, or impose stricter discipline on Jews than others. Likewise, federal
agencies may not prefer Buddhists in hiring, give advantages to Christians in promotions, or
impose lesser discipline on Jews. Atheists, too, may enjoy no advantage nor suffer any
disadvantage because of their beliefs with respect to employment opportunities.
         Title VII, however, is not limited to banning discrimination against employees because of
their religion or lack of it. It also ensures the right of employees to be reasonably
accommodated in their religious practices-which will include the right to speak about
religion--except where accommodation would cause the employer more than undue minimal
hardship. The most common example of the sort of accommodation required is the adjustment
of work schedules to accommodate employee religious practices such as Sabbath or religious
holiday observances.(I) These same provisions cover a wide range of religious practices,
including dress. They also protect the employee's right to refuse to assist in carrying out
programs irreconcilable with the individual's faith, unless the government would suffer more
than minimal hardship in accommodating the employee.




        I.    Federal law permits federal employees to bank time to cover time lost for religious
observance, 5 U.S.C. 5550a.
                                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion


         Many religions impose upon adherents the duty to spread the faith at every opportunity, a
belief which encompasses the workplace. This duty is a protected religious activity which, when
it takes the form of speech, cannot be suppressed except where the government can prove that
the speech actually interferes with the efficient operation of the agency, intrudes upon the
legitimate rights of other employees, or creates the appearance of an official endorsement of
religion. (I) Because an employer has a legal duty to prevent the creation of a religiously hostile
work environment-just as it may not permit the existence of a sexually hostile
environment-employees may not proselytize in a way that creates such an environment (for
example, where a proselytizer refuses a request to stop when requested to do so), and the
employer must insist that those creating that hostile environment desist. The duty to comply
with the law is a sufficient hardship to excuse a refusal to accommodate excessive and harassing
proselytization. But not all proselytizing is harassing or creates a hostile environment.




        2.    "A claim of undue hardship cannot be supported by merely conceivable or hypothetical
hardships; instead, it must be supported by proof of 'actual imposition on coworkers or disruption of the
work routine'." EEOC v. Townley Mfg. & Eng'g Co., 859 F.2d 610, 615 (9th Cir. 1988).
