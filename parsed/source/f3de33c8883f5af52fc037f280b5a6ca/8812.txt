Laura:     Please include this note to Elena when you give her this weekly
item.

This is an odd leftover item that I always meant to send in.    You can
decide whether it's worth forwarding to the President. Months ago, he and
Harris Wofford met to discuss how to focus the work-study program more on
community service instead of washing dishes. At the meeting, they both
seemed to think there is no data on how much schools do this.    But it
turns out that the Education Dept. does have data, although there's a long
lag time in collecting it . . So this report tells him what the numbers
are.

It's possible this item will fire him up to say we should push colleges to
do a better job on this, but the education world thinks we are pressuring
colleges on enough issues as it is.  But Harris disagrees.  It's also
possible that Bruce will be interested in this.

Bob Shireman of theNEC knows a lot about this issue, fyi.       I will make
sure Tanya gets my files on this.

Using Work-Study Funds for Community Service -- Some time ago, you and Harris Wofford
discussed how to encourage schools to use work-study funds for community service by college
students. We thought you would be interested to know that, for the past three years, colleges
and universities have been required to report how much of their federal work-study funds are
spent on community service. According to the data, the average college/university spent 10% of
its work-study funds on community service in 1996-97, which is up slightly from 7% in 1994-95.
Out of a total of 3,250 schools, only 12% use more than 20% of their funds for service, and only
2% of schools use more than half their allocation for service.

Under a 1992 law, schools must spend at least 5% of work-study funds on community service.
In 1996-97, 9% of all schools, or 290 schools, failed to meet this requirement. This is down
significantly from 24% two years earlier, but still high. The law defines community service
broadly for the purposes of the 5% minimum. Any job that is designed to improve the quality of
life for local residents or solve a local problem qualifies. For example, jobs in a college library
may qualify depending on whether there are other libraries in the community. The Education
Department does not penalize schools that fail to meet this requirement.

We will not know the impact of America Reads on these numbers until October, when data from
1997-98, the first year of that program, is complete.
