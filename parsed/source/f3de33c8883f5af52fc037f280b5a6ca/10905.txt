This editorial is at the Post now, we are trying to get it in ASAP, but
aren't optimistic. Apparent·ly, DLC hasn't had one in five years.  So,
either we are due or out of luck.

If they don't take it, we will remove the pegs to the Broder column and
try to place it elsewhere.

                              Aecountability not Accounting

David Broder rightly lauds the role the nation's governors play in education reform, but
his criticism of President Clinton's school accountability plan misses the point and the
magnitude of the proposal (Two Bill Clintons, Jan 21). By conditioning federal school
aid on specific outcomes, with real consequences for those who fail to perform, Clinton
is boldly recasting Washington's role in public education for the next century.

In his State of the Union address, Clinton proposed using the federal government's
almost $20 billion contribution to public elementary and secondary education as
leverage to spur measurable improvements in student performance and teacher quality.
 Specifically, he called on the states to stop promoting students based on seat time
rather than subject mastery, enforce discipline, inform the public about how schools are
doing through report cards, and turn around chronically failing schools.

Congress has a vehicle for adopting such an approach: the Elementary and Secondary
Education Act (ESEA) which is up for reauthorization this year. First passed in 1965,
ESEA programs come with extensive requirements for accounting, but little in the way
of actual accountability for results. If coupled with a long overdue consolidation of
programs and increased flexibility for local authorities, Clinton's "pay for performance"
strategy could be the catalyst the states and localities need to get serious about raising
school quality.

As Broder points out, many states are already pursuing reforms similar to those Clinton
has outlined. They are doing so because these are proven reform strategies. So why,
Broder asks, should Washington playa major role in education? For the following
reasons:

First, federal support for elementary and secondary education is not trivial.      Broder
cites the common statistic that federal aid constitutes only 8 percent of public school
spending. This is true on average, but averages often mislead. Most federal aid to
schools is targeted; some districts get a lot and others receive little or none at all.
School districts receiving substantial amounts of federal aid tend to have the highest
concentrations of impoverished students and often the lowest test scores; it is here that
Clinton's call for real accountability is most likely to stimulate improvement. In fact, a
strong case can be made that federal dollars should be even more concentrated on the
most impoverished areas; nonetheless, the current arrangements do provide
Washington with real leverage.

Second, Washington has a special responsibility for low-income school districts. In
fact, Title I, the largest federal education program, is focused on students in these
districts. Unfortunately, two recent U.S. Department of Education evaluations confirm
that Title I has failed to significantly close the achievement gap between poor students
and their more affluent peers. This is despite $118 billion in federal spending since
1965. If simply spending money were the key to equity, Title I would have produced
more encouraging results than this. It seems that the unintended effect of this
                                                            Hex-Dump Conversion

spending made the federal government an accomplice in dysfunction by substituting
federal dollars for real reform and keeping afloat failing systems. As a result, many
districts seem to be simply not capable achieving higher standards without an external
jolt. A pay for performance system means that Washington starts rewarding success
rather than failure.

Third, despite the commendable efforts of reform-minded governors, the states cannot
do the job alone. America's students still do not achieve at the levels required by
increasing globalization and the emerging information based economy. Specifically,
the abysmal state of many urban school districts demands more action. Moreover,
state education bureaucracies are often notoriously change-averse themselves. We
need to break down bureaucratic barriers to school reform, not simply transfer control
over public dollars from one set of bureaucrats in Washington to 50 around the country.

Last, a world-class school system is a vital national interest. It's time for Washington
and the states need to hammer out a new deal on education that plays to each sides'
unique strengths and responsibilities. Washington should playa more active role in
bench marking quality and measuring performance. It should playa less active role in
operating top-down programs and micro managing how local school officials raise their
students and teachers to higher levels of performance. The federal government
should get out of the business of accounting for programmatic inputs and instead focus
more strategically on empowering citizens with information, setting broad standards and
goals, measuring and comparing results, and researching effective strategies for school
improvement.

In practical terms, this means consolidating the myriad federal education programs into
broad, performance-based funding that defines desired purposes and outcomes without
prescribing how state and local authorities get there. Critics will characterize
consolidation as a call for spending cuts, this is wrong. It is a call for more effective
use of public funds. Block grants, the GOP's preferred instrument of devolution, are
the wrong approach because they grant flexibility without demanding accountability.

The formula for better public schools is not complicated. Adequate resources, coupled
with high standards and real accountability, add up to a quality education. President
Clinton has been tireless on the first two issues and now is taking on the hardest of the
three . .The interest groups that cheered while he worked to increase federal funding
for education will not greet his accountability proposals with the same enthusiasm. For
their part, Republicans who claim to support reform are already deriding the proposal as
violating the sacred principle of local control. In truth, Clinton and Riley are trying to
strike a new and better balance between national goals and standards, and local
control of public schools.
