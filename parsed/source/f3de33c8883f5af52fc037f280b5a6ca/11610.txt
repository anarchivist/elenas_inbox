     TEXT:
     Have a hankerin' for Honduran history? Try visiting www.honduras.com.
     This one-stop site, will provide you with a veritable bonanza of
     Honduran-related information.  Try this, for example: have you ever
     wondered what those five blue stars arranged in an X pattern centered in
     the white band of the Honduran flag represent? It's no mystery -- they
     represent the members of the former Federal Republic of Central America -
     Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua.  But don't
     get so lost in the site's sea of knowledge that you forget to submit your
     updates for the President's Daily Report.  Like yesterday, they're due
     today (3/9) at 4pm.
