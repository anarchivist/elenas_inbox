                               AAUW STUDY ON SINGLE-SEX EDUCATION



            Question:   Today's New York Times reports that the AAUW has released a new study on
                        single-sex education that finds no overall evidence that single-sex education was
                        better for girls than coeducation. In light of these findings, does the
                        administration continue to support the establishment of single-sex schools, such
                        as theYoung Women's Leadership Academy which is currently the subject ofa
                        complaint filed with the U.S. Department of Education?

            Answer:     We agree with the AAUW on the point that single-sex schools are not a silver
                        bullet -- and that challenging standardse essential elements of good education.
                        And that's why the President has been fighting to get these crucial reforms into
                        every school in this Nation. The President also belives that parents ought to have
                        expanded choices in the public school system, including the option to have their
                        children attend single-sex schools.                  .
