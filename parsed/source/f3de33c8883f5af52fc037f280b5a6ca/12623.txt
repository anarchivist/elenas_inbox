TEXT:
Attached is the draft transmittal letter for ESEA.  I wanted to check in
with you and see whether you are comfortable with highlighting the fact
that we are phasing in eqaul treatment for Puerto Rico in the ESEA funding
formulas.  (ED does not want this in the letter, but Jeff Farrow (IGA) is
pushing hard to include the language below) .

"My proposal for reauthorizing Title I, for example, would require States
to hold districts and schools accountable for student performance against
State standards, including helping the lowest-performing students
continually improve.  The bill also would continue to target Federal
elementary and secondary education resources on those students furthest
from meeting State and local standards, with a particular emphasis on
narrowing the gap in achievement between disadvantaged students and their
more fortunate peers.  In this regard, my proposal would also phase-in
equal treatment of Puerto Rico in ESEA funding formulas, so that poor
children in Puerto Rico are treated the same as those in the rest of the
country for the purpose of formula allocations."

I am also giving OMB some comments on other portions of the letter e.g.,
the section on the need for safe, disciplined and drug-free schools
focuses on the new high school reform initaitive -- before a much shorter
description of how we are strengthening the   Safe and Drug-Free Schools
program.

OMB needs comments back tonight.

TO THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES:

        I am pleased to transmit today for your immediate consideration the "Educational
Excellence for All Children Act of 1999," the Administration's proposal for reauthorization of the
Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA) and other elementary and secondary
education programs.

        My proposal builds on the positive trends achieved under current law. The Improving
America=s Schools Act of 1994, which reauthorized the ESEA five years ago, and the Goals
2000: Educate America Act gave States and school districts a framework for integrating Federal
resources in support of State and local reforms based on high academic standards. In response,
48 States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico have adopted State-level standards. Recent
results of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) show improved performance
for the economically disadvantaged and other at-risk students who are the primary focus of ESEA
programs. NAEP reading scores for nine-year olds in high-poverty schools have improved
significantly since 1992, while mathematics achievement has also increased nationally. Students in
high-poverty schools and the lowest-performing students-the specific target populations for the
ESEA Title I program-have registered gains in both reading and math achievement.

        I am encouraged by these positive trends, but educational results for many children
remain far below what they should be. My proposal to reauthorize the ESEA is based on four
crosscutting themes reflecting both lessons from research and the experience of implementing the
1994 Act.

        First, we would continue to focus on high academic standards for all children. The
underlying purpose of every program within the ESEA is to help all children reach challenging
State and local academic standards. States have largely completed the first stage of
standards-based reform by developing content standards for all children.      My bill would
support the next stage of reform by helping States, districts, schools, and teachers use these
standards to guide classroom instruction and assessment.

        My proposal for reauthorizing Title I, for example, would require States to hold districts
and schools accountable for student performance against State standards, including helping the
lowest-performing students continually improve. The bill also would continue to target Federal
elementary and secondary education resources on those students furthest from meeting State and
local standards, with a particular emphasis on narrowing the gap in achievement between
disadvantaged students and their more fortunate peers. In this regard, my proposal would also
phase-in equal treatment of Puerto Rico in ESEA funding formulas, so that poor children in Puerto
Rico are treated the same as those in the rest of the country for the purpose offormula allocations.

          Second, my proposal responds to research showing that while qualified teachers are
critical to improving student achievement, far too many teachers are not prepared to teach to high
                                                                             Automated Records Management System
                                                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion
     standards. Teacher quality is a particular problem in high-poverty schools, where it is often
     exacerbated by the use of paraprofessionals in instructional roles.

              My bill addresses teacher quality by holding States accountable for stronger enforcement
     of their own certification and licensure requirements, while at the same time providing substantial
     support for State and local professional development efforts. The Teaching to High Standards
     initiative in Title II would help move challenging educational standards into every classroom by
     providing teachers with sustained and intensive high-quality professional development in core
     academic subjects, supporting new teachers during their first three years in the classroom, and
     ensuring that all teachers are proficient in relevant content knowledge and teaching skills.

              The Technology for Education initiative under Title III would expand the availability of
     educational technology as a tool to help teachers implement high standards in the classroom,
     particularly in high-poverty schools. The bill also would extend, over the next seven years, the
     Class-Size Reduction initiative, which aims to reduce class sizes in the early grades by helping
     districts to hire and train 100,000 teachers. And the Title VII Bilingual Education proposal
     would help ensure that all teachers are well trained to teach limited English proficient students,
     who are found in more and more classrooms with each passing year.


             Third, my bill would increase support for safe, healthy, disciplined, and drug-free learning
     environments for all students. The recent tragedy at Columbine High School in Littleton,
     Colorado, reminds us that we must be ever vigilant against the risks of violence and other
     dangerous behaviors in our schools. Our reauthorization bill includes several measures to help
     mitigate these risks.

             My High School Reform initiative would support innovative reforms to improve student
     achievement in high schools, such as expanding the connections between adults and students that
     are necessary for effective learning and healthy personal development. Particularly in our large
     high schools, students too often feel nameless and faceless due to a lack of regular contact with a
     caring adult in the school. This new initiative would provide resources to help transform 5,000
     high schools into places where students receive individual attention, are motivated to learn, are
     provided with challenging courses, and are encouraged to develop and pursue long-term
     educational and career goals.

              We would strengthen the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act by
     concentrating funds on districts with the greatest need for drug- and violence-prevention
     programs, and by emphasizing the use of research-based programs of proven effectiveness. A
     new School Emergency Response to Violence program would provide rapid assistance to school
     districts that have experienced violence or other trauma that disrupts the learning environment.
                                                                          Automated Records Management System
                                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion
        Fourth, in response to clear evidence that standards-based reforms work best when States
have strong accountability systems in place, my proposal would encourage each State to establish
a single, rigorous accountability system for all schools. The bill also would require States to end
social promotion and traditional retention practices, to phase out the use of teachers with
emergency certificates and the practice of assigning teachers "out-of-field," and to implement
sound discipline poliCies in every school. Finally, the bill would give parents an important new
accountability tool by requiring State, district, and school-level report cards that will help them
evaluate the quality of the schools their children attend.

        The Educational Excellence for All Children Act of 1999 provides a solid
foundation-based on high standards for all students, high-quality professional development for
teachers, safe and disciplined learning environments, and accountability to parents and
taxpayers-for raising student achievement and narrowing the achievement gap between
disadvantaged students and their more advantaged peers. More importantly, it will help prepare
all of our children, and thus the Nation, for the challenges of the 21 st century. I urge the
Congress to take prompt and favorable action on this proposal.


                                                     WILLIAM     J.   CLINTON
