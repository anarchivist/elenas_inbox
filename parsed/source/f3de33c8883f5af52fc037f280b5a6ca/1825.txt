    TEXT:
    Here's the background which I will condense for distribution.
    Sheila Amaning:
    Sheila is the Co-President of the Charlotte Mecklenburg Schools Early
    Childhood Parent Teachers Association. This Early Childhood PTA gives
    parents of pre-school age children the opportunity to share ideas with
    each other and become involved in their children's learning from the
    start.   Sheila has participated in this Early Childhood PTA since it was
    first created almost three years ago.  Last May, she became the
    Co-President. Sheila was awarded the States Advocates for Children's
    Award at the National PTA Convention in Washington, DC last June for her
    project which provided hospitals with a packet of materials on parenting
    that was distributed to new mothers. The packet included booklets such as
    "Helping your child to read," and "Helping your child on social studies."

    Sheila worked for a local Community Development Partnership Project called
    "Success by Six," to provide information and guidance to parents of
    children under six years old.  She currently works as a Family Involvement
    Coordinator for Childcare Resources, Inc., a non-profit organization which
    provides resources and referrals to parents of Mecklenburg county on child
    care, education, parenting, etc.
    Her son, Asante, is now 5 years old.

    She is a graduate of UNC Chapel Hill.      She is married and her husband is a
    VP with Nationsbank.

    Sheila will talk about the value of having a PTA for parents of 0-3
