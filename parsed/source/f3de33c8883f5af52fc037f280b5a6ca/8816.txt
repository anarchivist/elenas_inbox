      TEXT:
      Bruce/Elena:
      Late last night, we got a copy of the final version of the Rep. compromise
      on H-IB legislation. According to Peter, thought the Reps. initially
      intended for this to be introduced on the House floor today, it now looks
      like it will go tomorrow.  Gene is going to try to arrange a principals
      meeting today to discuss what the Admin. 's reaction to this bill should be.

      We sat down with Labor last night to do an analysis of the bill.   It is
      very similar to the draft version -- in some ways better, in some ways a
      little worse.  In the better category, it does not include the provision
      to allow for the use of private wage surveys, even in the face of DOL
      determinations that they are no good.  In the worse category, it now
      exempts all employers that employer fewer than 50 workers from the
      attestations. DOL is going to report back to us on what percentage of
      employers and current H-IB employers this would exempt.

      The bill, like the draft, exempts from the H-IB calculation (both for
      purposes of having to attest and in calculating the % H-IB of the
      population) all employees who earn more· than $60K in wages and bonuses and
      all workers with a MA or equivalent.

      The lay-off language is quite narrow (limited to displacement from the
      "essentially equivalent job," defined as:  a job with the same
      responsibilities, held by a U.S. worker with substantially equivalent
      qualifications and experience, and in located in the same area of
      employment.). This, though, is not that different from the Kennedy
      language on lay-off and appears to cover most lay-off cases that we have
      heard about.

      Disputes over whether a U.S. worker was not offered an employment
      opportunity b/c of a preference for an H-IB worker would be first made to
      the INS commissioner.   She would then refer the matter to an arbitrator
       (paid for by INS) who would made a finding and send back an opinion. The
      commissioner could then accept, modify, or reverse the determination and
      the whole thing could be appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals. Other
      enforcement (lay-off and whether the recruitment was generally adequate)
      is done by DOL investigation pursuant to a complaint.

      Finally, this bill, like the draft, transfers authority to review the
  '"
Labor Conditions Application (LCA) to the AG.
