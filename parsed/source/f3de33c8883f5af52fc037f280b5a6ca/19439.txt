 School Crime Report

. Q.   The report released by the Justice and Education Departments this weekend
       contains some troubling findings about crime in schools: a doubling of gangs,
       increased availability of drugs, and the presence of guns. How does the
       Administration propose to address these serious problems?

 A.    First of all, it should be noted that the report found little or no change in the overall level
       of school crime. The overall level of crime in schools in 1995 was similar to that in 1989
       (14.6% versus 14.5%). Violent crimes increased slightly, and property crimes decreased
       slightly.

       The report does confirm that some of our schools continue to have serious problems
       involving gangs, guns, and drugs. That is why President Clinton and his Administration
       have fought to keep our schools safe and reduce youth crime and violence. [To this end,
       the Education Department will be making $5 million available from the Safe and
       Drug-Free School program to develop innovative strategies to reduce drug use, and
       violence, and prevent weapons from entering our schools.]

       But clearly, the problems raised by this report, and the broader problems of gangs and
       juvenile crime require a comprehensive strategy and significant, targeted resources. That
       is why the President has repeatedly called on Congress to enact key components of his
       Anti-Gang and Youth Violence Strategy, including:

              - $255 million for juvenile crime legislation to help cities hire more prosecutors
              and probation officers, establish special court programs and generally implement
              comprehensive youth violence strategies like Boston's;

              - $200 million to provide a five-fold increase in funding for after school programs
              to help keep kids in school -- and supervised by responsible adults that can teach
              them right from wrong -- between 3 and 8 p.m. when most violent youth crimes
              are committed;

              - $195 million for a national youth anti-drug media campaign that teaches kids
              about the dangers of drugs;

              - $50 million to expand the Safe and Drug-Free Schools Program by hiring drug
              and violence prevention experts to help schools reduce violence and drug use; and

              - $28 million to hire 162 new ATF agents and expand the President's Youth
               traffickers.

'Q:    The increases in gangs and drug availability occured under this Administration's
       watch. What has the Administration done to date to promote school safety and
       help reduce violence in and near our schools? Has the Administration paid enough
       attention to this issue?

A:     Absolutely. While we have proposed comprehensive juvenile crime and youth violence
       legislation to the Congress, school safety has been a priority since the start of this
       Administration. Some of the important steps we have taken include:

       Improving Safe and Drug Free Schools -- In 1994, we expanded the Drug-Free
       Schools Program to include security and violence prevention as key parts of the program.
       Now, the new Safe and Drug-Free Schools Program provides support for violence and
       drug prevention programs to 97 of the nation's school districts, and helps keep violence,
       drugs and alcohol away from students and out of schools.

       Enforcing Zero Tolerance for Guns and Other Weapons in Schools -- President Clinton
       signed into law the Gun-Free Schools Act and issued a directive requiring all schools that
       receive federal funds to enforce "zero tolerance" for guns. If a student brings a gun to
       school, that student will be expelled for a year. Now, every state in the nation has now
       passed a tough "zero tolerance" policies, and an estimated 6,000 students have been
       expelled for bringing guns to schools.

       Encouraging Schools and Localities to Promote Discipline -- Studies show that schools
       with serious discipline problems are more likely to have serious crime problems. That is
       why-this Administration has encouraged innovative policies that promote discipline and
       respect in our schools. We have distributed guidelines and studies on successful efforts by
       communities to require school uniforms, enforce curfews, and crack down on truancy.

        Keeping Handguns Out of the Hands of Our Children -- As part of the 1994 Crime Act, the
        President signed into law the Youth Handgun Safety Act that makes it a federal offense to
        transfer a handgun to a juvenile, or for a juvenile under the age of 18 to possess a
        handgun or handgun ammunition in most circumstances. And to make sure adults
      . complied, last year we required all federal gun dealers to post signs and issue written
        notices about the provisions of this law.

Jonesboro

Q.        How do the findings of this study relate to what recently happened in
Jonesboro?

A.     The study does not directly relate to the Jonesboro incident -- particularly since that type




                of incident is extremely rare. The study does provide some useful information on the
                level of overall crime, street gangs, guns, and drug availability in nonmetropolitan area
                schools, such as Jonesboro. The report indicates that in the two years studied (1989 and
                1995), students living in nonmetropolitan areas reported a slight decrease in the
                availability of drugs (65.7% versus 64.5%, respectively), a small increase in violent crime
                (2.9% versus 3.5%), and a pretty significant increase in the presence of street gangs
                (7.8% versus 19.9%).

                Few students reported guns in schools. In 1995, no students in nonmetropolitan areas
                surveyed reported taking a gun to school; 4.8% of students reported seeing a student with
                a gun at school; and 11.1 % reported knowing a student who brought a gun to school. It
                should be noted that all of these levels are lower than the levels reported by students
                living in suburbs and central cities.


        Vouchers

           Q:       If these findings show that crime in public schools is signi/icandy higher than in
                   private schools -- and increasing-- why shouldn't vouchers given to the children in
                   these unsafe schools to allow them to go to the private school of their choice?

          A:       We must continue to invest and strengthen our nation's public schools. This
                   means reducing class size, raising academic standards, modernizing our
                   schools, expanding after-school programs, and connecting schools to the
                   Internet so that all of our children can get the education they need and
                   deserve. Vouchers would drain resources from our nation's public
                   schools --schools that are attended by 90% of our children --to subsidize
                   private schools.

                   The right way to help children in failing or unsafe schools isn't to drain those
                   schools of resources --it is to take drastic actions to fix and turn around the
                   entire school for the benefit of all of the children in the school. We owe it
                   to our children to preserve this nation's time-honored commitment to public
                   education and our commitment to provide a good education to all of our
                   children.
