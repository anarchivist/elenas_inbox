TEXT:
I thought that we would put the Varmus update in next week's weekly b/c it
would follow our conversation with him and would be in time to precede the
actual testimony. Re Massachussetts, we do have the plan's submissions
which have reduced (but not terrible) drug benefits, and we could do an
insert. However, Kennedy's office is still trying to work out options
with HHS to encourage wrap around drug benefits from either the HMOs or
the Medigap market.   In other words, the whole story has not been comple
ted. Having said this, if you want a quick insert, i will do that for
you.   (In fact, assuming that you do, I will start one now.)
