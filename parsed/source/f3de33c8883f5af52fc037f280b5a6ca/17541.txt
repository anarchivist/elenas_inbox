                             QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
                                  October 27, 1997


Q:   THE NEW YORK TIMES INDICATED TODAY THAT YOUR NOMINEE FOR
     HCFA ADMINISTRATOR, NANCY-ANN MIN DEPARLE IS BEING HELD UP
     OVER SENATOR KYL'S MEDICARE AMENDMENT. WHAT IS YOUR
     RESPONSE?

A:   Iftnie, I am very disappointed that Senator Kyl or anyone else would hold up a
     well-qualified candidate from being confirmed as Administrator of the Health Care
     Financing Administration. The Medicare and Medicaid programs and the millions of
     Americans they serve cannot afford to have a delay in Nancy-Ann Min DeParle's
     confirmation.

     With regard to Senator Kyl's proposal, which would allow physicians to privately
     contract with Medicare beneficiaries, I do have some concerns. First, it is premature to
     open up the Balanced Budget Act and all of the carefully constructed Medicare policies
     we passed.into law just two months ago that will modernize the program extend the life
     of the trust fund for at least a decade. We should implement all of these reforms before
     opening up this debate. Second, representatives of the elderly, including AARP, have
     raised serious concerns about the Kyl Amendment citing the potential for fraud as well as
     reduced access to much needed physicians in rural communities. These and other
     concerns about Kyl's proposal deserve careful consideration before any modification to
     current law is made.

Q:   IN RECENT TESTIMONY BEFORE THE SENATE LABOR COMMITTEE,
     DONNA SHALALA INDICATED THAT THE ADMINISTRATION INTENDED
     TO SEND LETTERS TO STATES WHO HAVE MADE SETTLEMENTS
     THROUGH THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY THAT AFFIRM THE FEDERAL
     GOVERNMENT'S STATUTORY AUTHORITY TO ITS PORTION OF ANY
     MEDICAID SAVINGS?

A:   The Medicaid program is funded by both the Federal and State governments. (Federal
     government funds on average 57 percent of these costs). The law provides that the
     Federal portion of any recaptured Medicaid expenditures by the states, whether it be for
     fraud and abuse cases or other provider overpayments, must be returned to the Federal
     government.

     While we must enforce the law, we also well recognize that a national legislative
     agreement on tobacco will inevitably raise Federal/state allocation issues that must be
     addressed through the legislative process. We look forward to working with the states
     on this important issue.
                                                            n..Dump ConvmJon

Q:   CAN YOU GIVE US ANY INDICATION AS TO WHO YOU ARE
     CONSIDERING TO APPOINT TO THE MEDICARE COMMISSION?

A:   As you know, we have to announce these appointments on December 1. I am still in the
     process of considering a range of highly qualified candidates with a wide variety of
     backgrounds and expertise in health care and the Medicare program. I have yet to make
     any final decisions at this time.


Q:   WILL YOU BE APPOINTING ANY MEMBERS TO THE COMMISSION?

A:   There are obviously lots of members who could add a tremendous amount to this
     Commission. However, I have not made any final decisions.
