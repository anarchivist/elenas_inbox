Elena, do you know whether anyone in the industry or (less likely) among
the AGs, or any pro-tobacco caucus in Congress, is drafting proposed
legislation to implement the settlement? Have you/Bruce/anyone else given
any thought to the FORM of our response? I.e., a critique, a
counter-proposal, a draft bill, a press conference?
