BR/EK/Rahm:

I spoke to Staff Sec. about the McCaffrey scheduling memo. All they need
is a reaction from us -- e-mail would be fine -- so they can incorporate
it in a quick cover note.  They'd like to send it in to the President
during his office time tomorrow.  If the following is okay w/you, I'll cc
staff sec. and tell them to work from this ... jc3

Subject:         McCaffrey Memo

BR/EK:

Here are my comment/recs on McCaffrey's scheduling memo to the President,:

1. National Rollout of the Youth Media Campaign.   We should support a
roll-out of this signature anti-drug initiative.  However, for the
President not to be disappointed, we need to make sure Rahm takes the lead
in getting ONDCP to come up with some specific announcements -- i.e., new
anti-drug ads, additional private sector partners and commitments, results
from the 6-month/12-city pilot, etc.

2. U.N. Special Session on Drugs.   I understand scheduling has already
committed to do this, and that NSC is taking the lead.  There is very
little of our stuff here.
,..    .
       ........




      3. Drug-Free Communities Rollout. The President just signed off on the
      proposed candidates for the Drug-Free Communities board, and Personnel
      says that it will take another 4 to 6 weeks to fully vet these folks.   I
      would not, however, recommend this as a stand-alone event. The board does
      not include any really big names, and the grants are so small ($10
      million). Moreover, the Hill Dems were not happy when we did a signing
      ceremony with the R's on this. They hate that the R's vote against
      funding for virtually every other community-based drug program -- to the
      tune of hundreds of millions of dollars -- and then turn around and
      support these tiny grants for community organizations.  If anything, we
      should roll this into the media campaign announcement.  It will allow us
      to say we're linking our national ant-drug message with action at the
      grass roots.

      4.  President's Drug Advisory Council. This is a bit of a problem. As
      I've mentioned, OMB -- for themselves and on behalf of various agencies
      has expressed serious concerns about ONDCP wanting to discuss its
      performance measurement system at this meeting.  I would defer to them on
      when it's appropriate to do this.
