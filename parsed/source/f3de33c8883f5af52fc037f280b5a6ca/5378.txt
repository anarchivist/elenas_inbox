Thought you might like to see this note from John Gomperts regarding Gen.
Powell's nice comments today about the Administration'S efforts on
service. Good job all. P.S. The report itself has great sections
reflecting the Administration's commitments. Also, Gen. Powell really
appreciated the Potus letter. Steve

Thought you all would find these excerpts from Powell's speech quite
interesting. Good on the President and other WH principals, good on the
President's initiatives, and good on the Corporation and our friend
Harris.
 All together, good for the good guys.


Excerpts from Colin Powell's Statement
Report to the Nation Press Conference (Unofficial Transcript)
November 25, 1997

n · · · We're also letting you have today a Presidential ietter that I

received


yesterday from President Clinton. President Clinton, Mrs. Clinton, and
Vice-President and Mrs. Gore have been solid supporters of America's
Promise
ever since the Summit and this congratulates us on what we have done so
far
and also gives us a report on the activities of the federal government and
commitments for future activity on the part of the federal government.
And
so these reports are what's available to you. And this is just the tip of
the iceberg."

" ... The final objective is a little different, it's essentially an
opportunity for our children to serve. And one of the leaders in that is
the
Corporation for National Service, headed by Harris Wofford, who's one of
our
cosponsors along with the Points of Light Foundation for the Summit. And
both of these organizations I continue to support. But in this case the
Corporation for National Service has added 9,000 new AmeriCorps members,
and
they have engaged 800 colleges and universities to work with schools in
terms
of mentoring and tutoring. And this is all part of the President's plan
to
increase the number of children who are able to read by putting one
mi"llion
tutors into our school systems over the next several years. So this shows
you how you can work, government and the profit sector, government and the
nonprofit sector. It's not a question of are we substituting for the
government or is the government falling down on the job. It's a question
of
partnerships and those of us with assets and bringing those assets to the
problem at hand."
