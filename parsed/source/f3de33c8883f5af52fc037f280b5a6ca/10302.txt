TEXT:
        This case deals with the question of whether the NCAA is covered
by Title VI and Title IX even though it does not generally receive federal
funds directly. The civil rights groups, including the women's groups,
feel strongly that there should be coverage.
        The SG's brief in the Supreme Court, which is due Tuesday, is not
yet final. However, the SG will argue for coverage, probably on two
theories: First, the NCAA itself receives a small grant (though this can
easily be dropped by the NCAA, so it is a temporary solution). Second, and
more importantly, an entity that controls an educational activity of a
covered university, is itself subject to Title IX and Title VI, if the
controlling entity can actually cause discrimination. Since the NCAA sets
rules for athletic activities, they would be covered under this theory.
        The second theory has the advantage that it provides a means for
distinguishing coverage in this case from many other cases where
universities are members of associations.The SG will also be careful not
to undermine theories that other amici may argue. In general, I think they
are headed in the right direction and one that is consistent with the
civil rights groups position.

Subject: DOJ brief in Smith v. NCAA



        Leslie, Eddie, Mike,

        On Monday, we expect DOJ.to finish its Supreme Court brief stating its
        reasons that it believes that NCAA is currently obligated to comply
        with Title IX. The brief will be filed at the same time as the
        Women's and civil rights' organizations' briefs on Tuesday.  The brief


    will likely draw major press attention, and I recommend calls go to
    DOJ.

     Steve informed me this morning that as 'a result of m
ore conversations last night with Gornstein and Underwood in the
Solicitor's
office at DOJ, Steve is more comfortable that DOJ has sharpened its
arguments so
that the list of impacted associations is limited to those education
assocations
that conduct educational programs.  I agree.

     This morning, Steve and I briefed Mike Smith about the legal and policy
implications of the Government's position.    Mike supports the position
that
NCAA is currently a recipient, knowing that the various legal theories for
advancing this position are still be clarified by DOJ over the weekend.

        FYI,  please see Steve's memo below framing the issues. Steve
prepared
the memo for a briefing of Secretary Riley scheduled at 2:30 p.m. for
Monday,
December 7th.

Subject: 2:30 meeting Monday
Author:  Steve Winnick a:t WDCE01
Date:    12/4/98 4:11 PM



     The meeting for 2:30 Monday is to discuss a brief that the Justice
     Department plans to file Tuesday with the Supreme Court on the issue
     of whether the NCAA is subject to the civil rights jurisdiction of the
     Department and liable to lawsuits by individual plaintiffs under the
     civil rights statutes. The issue arises in a lawsuit filed by a young
     woman student who claims the' NCAA discriminated against her based on
     sex in not granting her a waiver that would have permitted her to
     participate in intercollegiate athletics although she was at the
     graduate school level. The Government is not a party in the case.

     HIstorically, this Department has taken the position that the NCAA is
     not a recipient of funds and therefore not subject to our
     jurisdiction. However, the Solicitor General's office has prepared a
     brief that takes the position that the NCAA is subject to these laws,
     irrespective of whether it is a recipient, because it operates for
     recipients education programs that do receive federal assistance.

     This is a plausible argument and there is some policy merit to being
     able to investigate NCAA decisions directly. However,

     -- It is likely that the Supreme Court took the case to narrow, not
     expand, civil rights jurisdiction. Recent decisions by the Court
     suggest that this is an uphill argument.

     -- The position may be criticized in some quarters as overreaching by
     the Government, particularly because it reverses ED's past position.


    -- We have some concerns that the this could be too broad a precedent
    that would subject many associations to civil rights coverage.
    However, we can work with Justice in the next couple of days to state
    our position in a way that does not create too broad a precedent.

    --Justice has indicated that it intends to take this position unless
    it hears major objections from us.

    --the Leadership Conference for Civil Rights met with us this
    afternoon and pushed us very strongly to take the position that the
    NCAA is subject to the civil rights laws.
