TEXT:
There will be a Headwaters strategy meeting in Katie's office on
Monday at 3:30 p.m., with J. Garamendi, Lois Schiffer (a/o Peter
Coppleman), Jack Williams (FDIC Dep. GC), and Ag (not sure who,
yet, since Rich Rominger is out of town)--as I discussed with
Dawn, it's to figure out our next step in light of the fact that
Hurwitz has filed a takings claim against us (Fish and wildlife
Service). Hope to see you there.
