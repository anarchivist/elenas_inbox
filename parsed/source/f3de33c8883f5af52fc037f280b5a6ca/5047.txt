TEXT:
Jose just sent me the OMB request for views on a child exploitation
sentencing enhancement bill (Feingold and DeWine) reported from Senate
Judiciary on October 9 that increases penalties for use of a computer to
exploit a child. The idea had come up in earlier meetings with Bruce and
the Post reported that there weren't appropriate penalties ... I think we
should consider stealing it.
