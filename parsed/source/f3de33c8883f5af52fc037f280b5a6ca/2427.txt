TEXT:
I am starting to get calls from our liberal friends expressing concerns

about the Congress waiving the fedl claims to the state settlements.      I

have pretty much told them to forget it, but there is carping out there.



One point that I cannot easily waive off:      fears that the federal release

will be "conditioned" on the states agreeing to limit attorneys fees.

This would be a political problem for us.      Let me know if this is looming.
