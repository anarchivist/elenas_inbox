    greater risk of losing coverage.

    and Mrs. Tipper Gore will attend an East Room event to preview an historic child care initiative

    departure the President may make a brief statement.

    Friday (1/9): President Clinton will spend the day in Texas. Overall the day will be focused on
    college opportunity for All Americans. And, he will discuss education in the emerging new
    economy and the significance of its role in preparing America for the challenges and
    opportunities of the 21 st century. During the day the President will make remarks at each stop
    of McAllen, Brownsville, and Houston. In McAllen, the President will discuss increased
    investments, proposed in the new balanced budget, in the work-study programs. In Brownsville,
    the President will address the people of that area on the Administration's continued commitment
    to investing in students. And, lastly, the stop in Houston will give the President the opportunity
    to stress the importance of post-secondary education and the priority of education for all our
    children who are willing to work hard.

    Saturday (1/10): President Clinton Radio Address will be broadcast. Topic to be
    determined.
