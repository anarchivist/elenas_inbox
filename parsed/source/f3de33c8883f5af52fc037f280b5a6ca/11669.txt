Subject:         Police Brutality address

This past Tuesday, Chicago Police office James. H. Camp was shot and
killed during a routine stolen-car check. The officer was killed with his
own gun during a struggle after he approached a suspicious car in front of
a South Side elementary school. He was the second Chicago Police Officer
to be killed in the line of duty this year, and the third since August
1998. Police believe the alleged shooter was looking to sell the stolen
tires to buy drugs. You may want to consider mentioning this tragic event
 in the radio address and offer our condolence to all officers slain in
the line of duty. This may offset any ill feelings on both sides of the
issue.
