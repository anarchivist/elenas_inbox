TEXT:
Fund for a Feminist Majority, National Abortion Federation, NOW Legal
Defense, and Planned Parenthood met with Attorney General Reno and her
staff yesterday about clinic violence. Marylynn Buckham, the director
from Dr. Slepian's clinic, also attended the meeting.   Susan Dudley from
NAF reports that it was an excellent meeting.  Reno asked her staff to
look into the program changes they suggested and the budget implications
and to report back to her promptly.  She promised the groups a follow-up
meeting, as soon as she gets her staff recommendations.
