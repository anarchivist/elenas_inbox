PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
REMARKS ON SENATE GUN LEGISLATION
THE WHITE HOUSE


May 14, 1999

        It is now clear that the tragedy in Littleton has helped create a
broad, common sense consensus that we must act to keep .guns out of the
hands
of criminals and away from our children.  The question is whether the
Congress will write that national vision into law 0) or seek to block it.
Thus far, the answer given by the Senate is not promising.

         I am pleased that on Wednesday, a bipartisan majority in the
Senate
backed two important measures I introduced [two] weeks ago.   First, they
agreed to ban the import of high capacity ammunition clips that are used
to
evade the 1994 ban on assault weapons.   Second, they agreed to ban
juvenile
possession of semi-automatic assault rifles and large capacity magazines

weapons designed only for mayhem.  There is no good reason for a child to
own an AK-47. And there is no good reason for anyone to use a 15 round
ammo
clip.

         I applaud the Senate for taking these two steps. However, on
Wednesday, a narrow Republican majority squandered an important
opportunity
to close the gun-show loophole through which tens of thousands of guns are
sold each year without background checks.   Yesterday, I called on the
Senate
to reconsider this vote.   It makes absolutely no sense to let criminals
continue to use legitimate gun shows as a convenience store for their
weapons.

        Today, the Senate will vote again on a measure purporting to
address
this issue. But the Senate Republican is riddled with high caliber
loopholes.  It won't stop criminals from buying guns at gun shows.   And at
the same time, it will let them buy guns at their local pawn shop.   That's
worse than current law.   I simply cannot believe that the Senate is going
to
make the same mistake twice.   So, once again, I calIon the Senate to
reject
this phony proposal and to pass real legislation that prevents criminals
from
buying guns at gun shows.

        This should be a moment for national unity.  I was very pleased
today
to receive a letter from the major gun manufacturers supporting our
efforts
to pass a real, enforceable, mandatory background checks at gun shows.
They
recognize that law abiding citizens don't need a gun show loophole; only
criminals do.

        For six years, America has made strong and steady progress in the
fight against crime. We have done so by elevating results over ideology.
Today, we have a chance to put aside the partisanship, political
divisions,
and raw special interest power that has dominated the debate on guns for
и
    so
    long.  For the sake of our children, I hope the Senate changes its mind
    and
    takes strong action to keep guns out of the wrong hands.==================== ATTACHM
