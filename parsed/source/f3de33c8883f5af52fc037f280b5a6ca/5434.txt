TEXT:
DoJ and HHS are ready to meet with us on 4th Circuit strategy. As Tom
noted, we could do the meeting as soon as tomorrow at 3:15. I think it is
important that one or both of you are there. My questions are: can you
be there from 3:15 to 4 (the regularly scheduled strategy meeting will be
taking place from 2:45 to 3:15)? Who else from the WH should be at the
4th Circuit· strategy meeting (Lindsey and Rahm came to a similar meeting
we did before Greensboro)?
