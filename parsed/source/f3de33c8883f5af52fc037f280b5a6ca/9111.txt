                                  STATEMENT OF THE PRESIDENT


      Today's data released by the Transportation Department brings encouraging news on our efforts
      to protect all Americans from drunk drivers. Last year, the number of people killed in
      alcohol-related crashes dropped to an all-time low, representing a decline of over a third since
      1982. For the first time since we started keeping track in 1975, drunk driving deaths accounted
      for less than 40 percent of all traffic deaths. A decade ago, few people thought we would ever
      be able to lower drunk driving simply by strengthening our laws, toughening enforcement, and
      raising public awareness. But we took on the drunk drivers and we are winning. Thirteen years
      ago, we raised the national drinking age to 21. Three years ago, I fought for and signed
      legislation to help ensure zero tolerance for underage drinking and driving. And today's data
      shows that zero tolerance is working: in 1997, alcohol-related fatalities among 16 to 20 year-olds
      dropped by 5%.

      But there is more for us to do. We could help save even more lives by passing a tough national
      standard of impaired driving at .08 blood alcohol content (BAC) -- and I continue to challenge
      the Congress to enact this life-saving measure. Ifwe work together, we can spare thousands of
      families from the grief and anger of losing a loved one to a preventable drunk driving crash, and
      make our roads, highways, and communities safer for all Americans.
