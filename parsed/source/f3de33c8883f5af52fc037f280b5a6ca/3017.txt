      quickly review decision and clear statement.
          * Day of decision: statement should reflect updated Brady #s (250,000 sales blocked)
          * Schumer bill: Are we comfortable with his approach? (Schumer bill requires FFLs to

                        expansion to 15 more cities in FY 1998 will cost approx. $40 million.
    Treasury and        OMB currently working to find several million $ in-house to start up
    expansion.          We will still need to ask for appropriation.

          * ONDCP and Justice still have not reached consensus.

    this?
