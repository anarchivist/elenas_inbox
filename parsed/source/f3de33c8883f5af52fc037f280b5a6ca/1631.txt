FYI.  The President will be taping a video for the National School Boards
Association Annual Conference on April 21 (Maria and Ann Lewis submitted
proposal), and a Message to the American Association of Community
Colleges' Annual Convention on April 12 (submitted by Kitty Higgins).
I'm sure speechwriting will be calling on you all to provide talking
