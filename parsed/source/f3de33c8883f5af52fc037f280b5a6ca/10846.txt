       TEXT:
       given that Minyon and Bob are OK with African American father, and that
       our African American small business owner is out-of-pocket in Arizona
       today, we're proposing to go w/ the following line up (order and length of
       each remarks needs to be determined):

        - Governor (Ridge, Carper, Carnehan or o 'Bannon)
       - County Commissioner (McLaughlin from Hennepin County, Minneapolis)
        - Robert Higgins, President of Fleet Bank (will bring a diverse group of
       3 women who have moved from welfare to work in his company _c can
       acknowledge in his or POTUS remarks, sit on stage or in audience)
       - Father (either Af Am or Hispanic from either LA, Wisconsin, Colorado or
       Chicago. Minneapolis is a long shot. may have White just in case since
       people are hunting now)
       - POTUS

       We'll keep trying to locate Sam Bishop, the Af American businessman,just
       in case, and we could always invite and acknowledge him as an example of a
       small, high tech business that is hiring welfare recipients

According to Jocelyn, Minyon feels the same as I on the issue.  This is a
positive story about a welfare father that goes against the stereotype of
abandoning responsibility.    We believe It will work. You can go with a
black father.  I also checked with others in the black community and they
agree on this approach as well.
