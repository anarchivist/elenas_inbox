     EXPAND HEALTH CARE COVERAGE TO MORE CHILDREN?

     I do not oppose the tobacco tax to be used as a financing mechanism for more health
     coverage, nor do I oppose the goals of the Hatch-Kennedy legislation. In fact, I am
     committed to building on the $16 billion we have achieved in the balanced budget
     agreement. I look forward to working with Senator Hatch, Senator Kennedy, and other
     members in this regard.

     My primary concern with the budget amendment offered yesterday was that I feared that
     it would severely undermine the possibility of a balanced budget agreement, including the
     $16 billion investment for children. My commitment to health care coverage is well
     known, and I will fight this year and beyond to expand health care coverage.


Q:   REP. GEPHARDT CRITICIZED THE BUDGET AGREEMENT BECAUSE AT
     THE SAME TIME YOU STRESS THE IMPORTANCE OF INVESTING IN
     CHILDREN'S COVERAGE YOU CUT MEDICAID SPENDING, WHICH HELPS
     HOSPITALS THAT SERVE UNINSURED CHILDREN. HOW DO YOU
     RESPOND TO THIS CRITICISM?

A:   Studies have shown strong evidence that our Medicaid disproportionate share spending is
     not being appropriately allocated to hospitals that serve a greater portion of low-income
     and uninsured populations (e.g. Urban Institute). It is for this reason that even the public
     hospitals have said that we can get more savings from DSH if we better target this
     funding to these types of hospitals. We are currently working with the public hospitals
     to push the Congress to do just that.

     Moreover, since we are investing $16 billion to cover millions of uninsured children,
     these hospitals will treat more children who have health care coverage, thereby reducing
     their need for DSH funding to help offset uncompensated care.


Q:   DOESN'T YOUR CHALLENGE TO DEVELOP AN AIDS VACCINE IN TEN
     YEARS RING HOLLOW SINCE YOU ARE NOT INVESTING ANY
     ADDITIONAL FUNDING IN THIS EFFORT?

A:   According to National Institutes of Health Director, Dr. Varmus, and Director of the
     Office of AIDS Research at NIH, Dr. Paul, challenging the scientific community greatly
     enhances the likelihood that we will develop an AIDS vaccine. Moreover, we have
     backed this challenge with a series of investments and initiatives to increase the
     likelihood that we will reach our goal. In the last two years, I have increased funding for
     the AIDS vaccine by 33 percent, and my FY 1998 budget increases spending for AIDS
     vaccine research by $17 million.

                                              HeX-Dump Conversion
     m_edical and scientific leaders believe that uniting scientists in immunology, virology, and
     vaccinology will create a highly collaborative effort to help develop an AIDS vaccine. I
     am also asking the leaders of the eight major industrialized nations meeting at the Denver
     summit in June to support a worldwide AIDS vaccine research initiative. To fully
     commit ourselves to developing an AIDS vaccine, we need to make sure that the best
     minds throughout the world are working together towards this goal.


Q:   FOLLOW: WHY ARE YOU ISSUING THIS CHALLENGE NOW? AND WHY
     ARE YOU FOCUSING ON AN AIDS VACCINE RATHER THAN OTHER
     DISEASES?

A:   In the last twelve months we have made tremendous progress in our understanding of the
     AIDS virus. The leaders at NIH have told me that we are moving forward on developing
     a vaccine for AIDS and that we have an opportunity now to focus our efforts on
     developing an AIDS vaccine. They believe that by issuing a challenge to the scientific
     community, bolstered by our new investments and initiatives, will greatly increase the
     likelihood that we will be able to develop a vaccine in the next decade.

     Scientific leaders have also told me that we have made progress in our understanding of
     immunology. They believe that bringing together all of this new knowledge will not
     only increase the likelihood that we will develop an AIDS vaccine but also could provide
     a new paradigm for vaccines that will help develop effective vaccines for other diseases.


     While developing an AIDS vaccine is an important priority, it in no way undermines our
     commitment to biomedical research in other areas. Since I took office, we have
     increased overall spending at the National Institutes of Health by 16 percent, including a
     76 percent increase in breast cancer research. My FY 1998 budget allocates $13.1 billion
     for NIH.

     It is also important to note that this commitment in no way undermines our investments in
     AIDS treatment and prevention, both of which have consistently received increased
     funding since I have been in office. We recognize that millions of people around the
     world already have AIDS, and we must continue to develop treatments and provide them
     to as many people as possible, while at the same time stressing prevention. I will
     continue to bolster our efforts in those areas.
     PREMIUM ESTIMATES WERE TOO LOW AND THE ACTUAL INCREASE
     WILL BE TWICE AS HIGH AS PREVIOUSLY PROJECTED (ABOUT A
     DOLLAR A MONTH). IS THIS TRUE?

A:   While original preliminary CBO projections may have been slightly off, we still
     estimate that the Part B premium will be only about $1 more in 1998 than under
     current law. In subsequent years within the 5-year Budget Agreement, the annual
     increase should be no more than about $2 more per month. As a result, by 2002,
       we project the premium being approximately $8 more than it otherwise would have
     been without the home health reallocation.

     Regardless of the final projection, the Part B premium will be almost $20 per month
     less than it would have been if it was set at the same 31.5 percent level that I vetoed.
     The monthly premium under the 1997 Budget Agreement will be about $69 in 2002. If
     the policy were a 31.5 percent premium instead of 25 percent, the premium would be
     about $87. In 2002 alone, this would equate to about $215 a year more for a single
     beneficiary, $430 for a couple.

     Low-income beneficiary protections are expanded. Unlike the 1995 Budget
     Agreement that I vetoed, which eroded current-law low-income protections, the 1997
     Balanced Budget Agreement invests $1.5 billion to expand premium assistance to
     low-income beneficiaries. We believe this commitment will help many of the estimated
     2.5 million Medicare beneficiaries who have incomes between 125 and 150 percent of
     poverty-- just above the current eligibility level for Medicare premium protection.

     Savings from the new premium are offset by investments in beneficiary
     improvements. The $9 billion in savings that comes from gradually including home
     health in the 25 percent premium is virtually identical to the amount of money dedicated
     to the investment in new benefits. Specifically, the 1997 Balanced Budget Agreement
     invests $3-4 billion in new preventive benefits (which will, for example, detect breast and
     colon cancer, and cover the management of diabetes), $4 billion to limit excessive
     hospital outpatient coinsurance to beneficiaries, and $1.5 billion in premium protections
     for low-income Medicare beneficiaries. (This contrasts with the vetoed 1995 balanced
     budget agreement, which reinvested virtually none of its much greater beneficiary savings
     for benefit enhancements.)
