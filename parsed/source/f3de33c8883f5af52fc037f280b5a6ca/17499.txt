          TEXT:
          You wrote me earlier this week concerning Superfund. Right now
          negotiations between Administrator Browner and the Senate are on hold.
          They have been unable to reach a compromise on the liability issue. Bruce
          and I attended a meeting with Browner, McGinty, Raines, and Hilley about
          two weeks ago to discuss strategy. Now, Katy is trying to reassert her
          control of the issue.   She has called a deputies meeting for next Monday
          in Room 472 at 2:00 pm.   I could use any assistance in trying to regain
          our share of the issue.
