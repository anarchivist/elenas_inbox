1.    I still want to come pitch for my ideas and/or hear what you think of
them.

2.  Interesting idea coming from VA homelessness, tell me what you think
about this applied to the whole government: many agencies have property
they don't use, but under Mckinney Act if they don't want it, they have to
offer it to homeless groups. with no incentive, predictably, agencies
just sit on the property. VA/OMB have a pilot program to let VA keep 90%
of the revenue from selling property for various do -good VA activities,
and channel 10% of sales money to local homeless grants. Advocates get s
omething rather than nothing, agencies get to help fund their own
programs, the taxpayers doesn't carry thousands of useless properties. We
need to get some advocates to sign on, but the idea of encouraging the
government to get rid of property it doesn't need is great~  It is still
confidential, but what you think?

3.   Escheveste is going over to meet with Glickman tomorrow on SOTU
stuff, do you want to see the list USDA gave NEC?
