TEXT:
The intent for this event is for Delaine Eastin to indicate that
California intends to particpate in the national testing initiative for
4th grade reading and 8th grade math the President announced in his state
of the union address.  It would be great if the technology CEO's, along
with other business and education leaders Delaine has offered to gather
(e.g., the Cal. Business Roundtable) could endorse both the President's
national standards and testing initiative and California's participation
in it.

Delaine offered to do this about 2 weeks ago.  I have tried over the past
36 hours or so to reconfirm with her, but we have not been able to
connect.  I will keep trying today, and get back to you as soon as I have
talked with her.

If you need paper on the testing initiative, let me know.   We have a short
press packet I can give you.
