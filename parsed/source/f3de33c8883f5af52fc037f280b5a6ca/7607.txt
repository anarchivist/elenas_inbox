TEXT:
Diana, why don't you ask Kay Casstevens to discuss this with Ron -- not to
endorse it, just to sound out the chances.  I.e., what if we were to drop
our opposition etc.

I still don't think this is good policy, and it's better if they tell us
no -- but this way the VP could get points for trying.
