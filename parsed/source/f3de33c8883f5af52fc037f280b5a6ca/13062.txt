 Hi!
 Gosh!   It seems like ages since I've sent a general e-mail to you
 all! Did you miss me?
 There is a social whirl in the White House lately. Here's the
 latest:
          Aug. 3 - Happy Hour at Capital City Brewing Co.
          Aug. 9 - Softball on the Ellipse
          Aug. 10 - Counsel's Office Summer Party
'(You should have received an invitation already, if not, check
 your in-box.    If there isn't an invitation sitting in your box,
 callie-mail me) Anyway, as of today, I have received exactly ZERO
 responses, so whether or not you can attend, I need to know by
 Friday. We're trying to get real Texas BBQ (overnighted from the
 Lone Star State itself), if the cost is reasonable. It should be
 a lot of fun, so I hope you all can come.    If the Judge can't make
 it, I hear there's someone at St. Elizabeth's who probably doesn't
 have plans ....
 Also, a general announcement: On Thursday, August 10 the Red
 Cross will be conducting a blood drive in the Indian Treaty Room
 from 9:00am-12:00pm and 1:00pm-3:00pm.
 That's about it. Again, please RSVP to me by Friday for attending
 the.Aug. 10 party. Talk to you soon!

 Marna   :-)
