                          CHARTER SCHOOLS: RAISING STANDARDS
                          AND EXPANDING PUBLIC SCHOOL CHOICE


 [EJvery state should give parents the power to choose the right public school Jor their children. Their right to
choose will Joster competition and innovation that can make public schools better. Our plan will help America to
create 3,000 oj these charter schools by the next century ... so that parents will have even more choices in sending
their children to the best schools.
                                                     President Clinton, State oj the Union Address, February 4,1997

Today President Clinton visited San Carlos Learning Center, one of the nation's first charter
schools, for a roundtable discussion with charter school principals, teachers, students, parents and
community supporters.

PRESIDENT CLINTON ANNOUNCES $46 MILLION IN NEW AND CONTINUING
GRANTS FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS. These grants are going to 21 states, the District of
Columbia, Puerto Rico and three individual schools to support the planning and start-up costs of
charter schools of about 500 additional schools. In addition to start-up costs, grants will also be
used for curriculum development, teacher training, technology, assessment development and
dissemination of best practices between charters and the rest of the public school system.

CHARTER SCHOOLS HAVE EXPERIENCED TREMENDOUS GROWTH UNDER
PRESIDENT CLINTON'S LEADERSHIP.                       In 1993, President Clinton proposed a public
charter schools program, which was enacted in 1994, as part of the reauthorization of the Elementary
and Secondary Education Act. With the President's leadership, the charter school program has
grown from $6 million in FY 1995 to $51 million in FY 1997. The President has requested $100
million from Congress from FY 1998 to support the development of approximately 900-1000 charter
schools. Under this program, the Education Department:
·       Provides funds for planning and start-up of charter schools. Since 1995, 19 states
        and the District of Columbia have received a total of about $22 million to help launch
        over 450 charter schools. A number of studies, including the latest report from a
        national study of charter schools funded by the Department of Education, shows the most
        dire need facing charter schools is a lack of access to planning and start-up funding. The
        federal investment in charter schools helps meet this need.
·       Serves as a clearinghouse of information on charter schools for parents, teachers
        and policymakers. The Education Department provides technical assistance, organizes
        conferences and informational meetings, and has established a Charter Schools Website
        (www. uscharterschools.org).
·       Conducts research and evaluation on charter schools. The Education Department has
        contracted for a 4-year independent evaluation of charter schools nationwide that includes
        an annual survey of all charter schools that provides researchers and the public with most
        comprehensive data on the nation's charter schools and a long-term study of achievement data
        from 92 charter schools and 32 comparison schools. In addition, the Education Department
        is supporting research on charter schools in areas such as assessment and accountability,
        special education, school finance, equity, and leadership training.

As a result ofthese efforts and the President's continuing leadership, there has been a
                                                                              Hex.Dump Conversion
tremendous growth in the number of charter schools. When President Clinton took office, there
was one charter school in operation nationwide and only one state with a charter law. This year,
over 700 charter schools are expected to be in operation. Likewise, the number of states with
charter laws continues to grow -- 29 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico have passed
enabling legislation.

CHARTER SCHOOLS PROVIDE FAMILIES WITH MORE OPTIONS WITHIN
PUBLIC EDUCATION. Every parent should be able to choose what public school their child
will attend. The administration's support for the development of high-quality charter schools is
increasing the choices parents have about their child's education. Charter schools are run by
groups of teachers, parents or other community leaders that operate with a contract -- or charter.
 Charters explain how the school will operate and how well its students will perform. In many
states, as long as the school meets the terms of its charter it is freed from many of the rules and
regulations covering traditional public schools.

CHOICE WITH PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY. Charter schools are schools that are free to
innovate and to demand high standards -- but they are schools that survive only if they produce
results. Like all public schools, charter schools are nonsectarian, cannot charge tuition, are open
to all students, and must still comply with health, safety and civil rights requirements. Charter
schools are held highly accountable: if students fail to perform at levels described in their charter,
or if the school breaks rules that have not been waived they can be closed.

CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE PART OF OUR OVERALL STRATEGY FOR
EDUCATION REFORM. Charter schools are not a magic bullet, but are piece of a larger
strategy of promoting high standards and accountability. A hallmark of President Clinton's
effort to improve American education has been that we should have high expectations for every
student. He has urged states and school districts to adopt challenging academic standards in all
core subjects, and to adopt high national standards in the basics of reading and mathematics.
The President has strengthened existing federal programs and fought for new resources to
improve local schools and help students reach those standards. Charters are promising vehicles
for raising academic standards, empowering educators, involving parents and communities,
increasing accountability and expand choice within the public school system. Lessons learned
by charter schools can enhance accountability for all public schools, and can reinforce -- even
accelerate -- other education reforms.

CHARTERS ARE EVIDENCE OF THE KIND OF INNOVATION THAT RESULTS
WHEN WE COMMIT TO IMPROVE - NOT ABANDON - OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS.
Charter schools are examples of genuine public education reform -- they provide a mechanism
for change with real public accountability for promised results. Unlike charter schools, private
school vouchers offer no public accountability -- there are no standards to meet, and no way to
shut them down.

Update on BNR/Erskine memo to agencies;

We have finally received responses from all the agencies (except for a
delinquent Commerce Department) on their policies to carry out the
President's 1994 directive on Government-to-Government relations. Most of
the responses were better than I thought, although some were
disappointing-- especially the Education Department response.

I met with Lynn Cutler on Monday and we agreed that a document which could
boil down the policies to maybe 20-30 pages of highlights with an
executive summary would be useful.  I plan on working with Office of
Tribal Justice at the Justice Department to get this done.   Lynn would
like to brief the President on the document in late October and use it to
pitch for possible funding increases for certain Indian programs in the
FY99 budget or legislation, if needed.

I've also talked to communications research about using these responses to
update our accomplishments documents.

Please let me know if there is any other follow up you would like for me
to do on this.  Thanks!
