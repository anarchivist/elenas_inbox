TEXT:
Sorry I missed our follow-up meeting on yesterday.    I was pulled into some
crisis management for the President's trip today.    (shocking)

Please let me know what I need to do to help move the ball forward.     I am
still on board the team ... smile!


Also, due we have a process in place for people who are interested in
getting involved.  Is there a point person who is handling this?
