 MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

 FROM:                     . Bruce Reed
    Elena Kagan

 SUBJECT:                   DPC Weekly Report

        Crime/Guns -- House Republican Bill: While we have yet to see actual bill language,
Chainnan Hyde and Rep. McCollum released some preliminary details on the juvenile crime bill
they intend to move in the next two weeks. The legislation will build on McCollum's current
juvenile crime bill -- a significantly scaled-back version of a bill passed in the House two years ago
-- which now has bipartisan cosponsors.

Juvenile provisions: The current version of the McCollum bill creates a $500 million juvenile
   accountability block grant for states and localities to fund numerous activities, such as:
   graduated sanctions programs, juvenile drug and gun courts, and the hiring of additional
   prosecutors, probation officers and juvenile court judges. Instead of requiring states to
   prosecute juveniles as adults as a condition of receiving block grant funds, the McCollum bill
   allows states one year to for states to adopt graduated sanctions for juvenile offenders in order
   to receive funding.

Gun provisions: Unlike the previous bill, the juvenile crime bill will contain a number of
   gun-related measures -- many which are similar to those recently passed in the Senate (e.g.,
   background checks at gun shows, juvenile Brady, child safety locks, juvenile ban on assault
   weapons). The House bill will likely reach beyond the Senate to include additional provisions
   -- some from our bill -- to require background checks for explosives purchases; prohibit
   bomb-making instructions on the Internet; ban all long gun sales to juveniles; increase penalties
   for gun traffickers and individuals who transfer guns to juveniles; and require mandatory
   sentences for juveniles who use guns to hurt others on school property.

Other provisions: The bill will also likely include provisions from the Senate bill to address the
   "culture of violence" issue, including studies and investigations into the marketing and effects
   of violent television shows and games on children. The House Republicans will also include
   the contentious IDEA provision opposed by Senator Harkin, to allow school officials to
   discipline disabled children in the same manner as other students for bringing guns to schools.

         Crime -- Gun Free-Schools Report:           The Education Department will soon release the
  Gun-Free Schools Act (GFSA) report for the 1997-98 school year. The report will show that there
. were over 3,000 students expelled for bringing a gun to school -- almost half the number of expulsions
  as compared to the previous school year. While Education is generally confident about the report,
                                                                          Hex-Dump Conversion


there is some concern about under-enforcement by school districts of the GFSA, particularly in
California. Education will be working with the state and relevant school districts about these
concerns.

         Children and Families - Media Violence: Over the last week there have been a number of
decisions by various television networks that reflect a more concerted effort to limit the level of
violence in their programming in light of the recent school shootings. Studios USA, the studio that
owns "The Jerry Springer Show," announced that it would no longer include violence, physical
confrontation, or profanity in its show, and this week it pulled shows that included those three
elements. The Wamer Brothers network pre-empted its season finale of "Buffy the Vampire Slayer"
-- which featured students killing their principal after he was transformed into a serpent -- with a
re-run, though it plans to show the episode later this year. Finally, CBS has rejected a pilot about the
Mafia in part because of its heavy gun violence. However, at the same time, the Fox network
unveiled a full schedule that features shows with unprecedented levels of violence.

        Education -- D.C. College Access Act: .Acting on a concept proposed in your FY 2000
Budget, the House has passed a version of the D.C. College Access Act. Under this bill, the Federal
government would be authorized to pay the difference between in-state and out-of-state tuition for
any qualified D.C. undergraduate attending a public college or university in any of the 50 states.
The bill would also provide grants of up to $3,000 annually to D.C. residents who choose to attend a
private college or university in D.C., Maryland or Virginia, as well as authorize financial support for
the University of the District of Columbia (UDC). Initial projections show that this proposal could
cost more then double, or even triple, the $17 million included in your FY 2000 Budget. Secretary
Riley sent a letter to the Senate expressing the Administration's support for the intent of this bill, but
also our reservations regarding some of the provisions. Instead, the Secretary urges them to
consider a bill introduced by Senator Jeffords - one that the Administration was involved in drafting.
 The Jeffords proposal limits the tuition assistance to D.C. undergraduates attending public colleges
and universities in Virginia and Maryland, whose family income is less than $50,000 annually. It
would also limit the grants for students attending area private colleges and universities to $2,000
annually. While we support additional funding for UDC, we prefer that they receive the additional
funding they are entitled to as an Historically Black College or University (HBCU) under Title III of
the Higher Education Act.             .

         Education - School Uniforms: Per your request for an update on the percent of school
districts adopting school uniform policies, we have requested additional data from the Department
of Education and will forward that to you as soon as possible. As of July, 1998 the Department of
education estimated that 3% of all public schools have mandatory uniform policies. A survey of
principals in 10 states showed that 11 % of elementary schools require uniforms, and 15% are
considering a policy. Some of the nation's largest school districts have adopted school uniform
policies, including New York City, Dade County, San Antonio, Houston, Chicago, Boston and
Albuquerque. In Washington, D.C., the District School Superintendent has requested that the
principals of the city's 146 public schools consider the adoption of a policy that would require
students to wear school uniforms or adhere to a strict dress code. In Massachusetts, the Governor

has proposed legislation for next year that would require all public schools to adopt unifonns unless
their local parent councils vote to opt out.

   Education - Republican Teacher Empowerment Act: Congressman McKeon has introduced
a version of Title II (Teacher Quality) of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) that
has some similarities to your proposal, including a focus on high-quality, sustained professional
development and a an effort to improve alternative certification methods and teacher pension and
credential portability. However the McKeon bill differs from your proposal in many important
ways. McKeon's bill:

Would weaken the Class Size Reduction Initiative by giving districts the option of using their Class
  Size Reduction funds for professional development. It also does not maintain the focus on
  reducing class size in the early elementary grades.

Does not encourage States and districts to continue their efforts to develop and implement content
   and perfonnance standards and curricula and assessments aligned to those standards - an
   essential part of advancing the Goals 2000 agenda.

Does not target funds to high-poverty districts as effectively as your proposal.

Would prohibit Federal support of the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards.

Does not expand the Troops-to-Teachers program to non-military mid-career professionals -- which
   your proposal does.

At this point, the bill does not include the kind of clear, enforceable accountability provisions
   included in your Title XI proposal.

        Health Care - Senator Breaux and Congressman Thomas Testify on Medicare
Reform: On Wednesday, Senator Breaux and Congressman Thomas testified before the Senate
Finance Committee in support of their Medicare Commission proposal. Notably, Senator Breaux
indicated that he would now advocate dropping his proposal to raise the eligibility age to 67,
change his Medicaid prescription drug coverage proposal to include a subsidy for all Medicare
beneficiaries, and indicated his openness to modify his graduate medical education provision that is
so problematic for Senator Moynihan and the academic health centers. His office is indicating that
Senator Breaux hopes that his modifications will help begin to bridge the gap between the
Administration and the Senator's priorities for modernizing the Medicare program.

        Health Care -- Patients Bill of Rights Discharge Petition Resolution Filed: On
Thursday, Congressman Dingle filed a resolution beginning the process for a discharge petition that
(if successful) would bypass the House Committee process and lead to a House floor vote. On the
same day, Senator Lott opened up negotiations with Senator Daschle to detennine if a time an
amendment agreement could be reached to enable Senate floor consideration of its version of the

Patients Bill of Rights. Congressman Dingell filed the resolution because there seems to be little
movement from the House leadership on proceeding with this legislation. He hopes that it will
lead to either an expedited Committee markup or provide legislative a vehicle to obtain the
necessary 218 cosponsors necessary for a vote. Congressmen Norwood (R-IA) and Ganske
(R-GA) did not cosponsor the resolution because they first want to determine whether the filing of
the resolution will force Commerce Committee Chairman Blilely to mark up and pass out a Patients
Bill of Rights Bill. They will likely join the Democratic effort if they determine that the
Republican leadership is not ready to move on this legislation. Speaker Hastert immediately
charged the House Democratic leadership with politicizing this issue, but is clearly worried that this
effort will lead to an embarrassing vote on the House floor.

         Health Care - Jeffords-Kennedy-Roth-Moynihan Worker Incentives Improvement
Act is set to pass the Senate: On Thursday evening, the Senate leadership agreed to schedule a
vote on the final passage of the Work Incentives Improvement Act. Although Senator Gramm
(R-TX) has objected to proceeding because of concerns about some of the offsets, we anticipate
that this legislation will be passed out of the Senate soon after the Senate returns from its Memorial
Day recess. We believe the progress in the Senate, as well as that in the House (the Commerce
Committee marked up a bill that appears headed for final House consideration sometime in June),
can be highlighted by you wheri you deliver the President's Award of the Committee on
Employment of People With Disabilities next Friday.

        Health Care - Update on the status of Arkansas' 1915(b) waiver proposal: You had
asked for an update on the status of "Benefit Arkansas", the State of Arkansas' proposal to use a
managed care delivery system to provide intensive case management services to children with
special mental health needs. This demonstration was designed to assure that these children receive
inpatient, outpatient, and rehabilitation services in a coordinated and cost-effective fashion. Last
week, HCFA requested that Arkansas momentarily halt the review of their application in order for
the State to assure that beneficiaries mandatorily enrolled in managed care have access to
specialists, are guaranteed a choice of providers, or have access to an effective complaints and
appeals process. Following our inquiry into this matter, HCF A has concluded that the Arkansas
proposal meets the necessary standards and expects to approve the Arkansas waiver by mid June.

        Health Care -- Update on the dissemination of polio vaccine contaminated with monkey
(simian) viruses and the associated spread of other diseases: You had asked for an evaluation of
Walter Kyle's contention that the distribution of contaminated polio vaccine is responsible for the
spread of a variety of viruses that cause cancer and immune depressive diseases, such as HlV. Mr.
Kyle also asserts that in 1977, the FDA released additional batches of polio vaccine contaminated with
many simian viruses, including SlY (the simian version of HlV), that he believes are associated with
the spread of AIDS. Mr. Kyle is correct that from 1955 to 1963, FDA did release several batches of
vaccine that were contaminated with a simian virus called SV40. However, research experts at FDA
and Nlli have definitively concluded that after more than 30 years of follow-up, exposure to polio
vaccines that was contaminated with SV40 is not associated with a significantly increased rate of
cancer. In addition, last year, in response to the assertion that FDA had released polio vaccine

                                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion

contaminated with SN, FDA tested 12 lots of polio vaccine from 1977 and the years surrounding it for
the presence ofHN or SN. The results of the test were negative, and FDA has been unable to find any
additional corroborating evidence for Mr. Kyle's claims. The majority of the scientific community,
including John Coffin, a senior editor of the Journal of Virology and Jonathan Allan, a well respected
and internationally known AIDS researcher, stand solidly behind FDA's contention that the polio
vaccine is safe. As for the issue of informed choice on the use of the polio vaccine, researchers and
physicians at the Centers for Disease Control believe that parents should be informed about the
potential risk of the polio or any other vaccine before vaccinating their children. However, they believe
that the polio vaccine is completely safe as far as retroviruses are concerned, and believe it is therefore
unnecessary to discuss the issue of contamination by simian viruses.

         Disabilities -- Employment of People with Disabilities in the Federal Workforce: We
have been working with the Vice President's office to prepare two executive actions to help
increase the employment of people with disabilities in the federal workforce. The first will be a
directive to federal agencies to implement an employment plan for people with disabilities prepared
by the Office of Personnel Management at the Vice President's request. The directive will ensure
agencies 1) recruit widely people with disabilities for positions at all levels; 2) establish
agency-wide reasonable accommodation policies and procedures for applicants and employees with
disabilities; 3) provide career opportunities for people with disabilities, including equal opportunity
to obtain managerial and executive training and compete for promotions; and 4) collect and
maintain data to monitor the success in achieving a higher percentage of adults with disabilities in
the federal workforce. The second action will be an executive order, to be followed by regulations,
which will change the civil service rules to ensure that people with psychiatric disabilities 1) will be
covered by the same appointing authority which facilitates hiring of individuals with other
disabilities and 2) will be allowed to acquire competitive civil service status after two years of
service as individuals with other disabilities now can. These stricter standards for mental
disabilities were put in place over 20 years ago, and Mrs. Gore, in a speech at Dartmouth in
January, announced that OPM would examine ways to eliminate these disparities. We are
discussing with the Vice President and Mrs. Gore's office when to announce these, including
possibly at the disability awards discussed [abovelbelow], at the mental health conference, or
elsewhere.

        Welfare -- Ways & Means Hearing on Welfare Outcomes: Last week, the Ways and
Means Human Resources Subcommittee held a hearing to review the effects of welfare reform and
the Republican members held a separate press event to celebrate the success of what Clay Shaw
called "the most successful piece of legislation in this half century." GAO provided testimony on
state welfare reform implementation and reported a dramatic increase in the number of people
moving from welfare to work. Summarizing seven state studies of those who have left the rolls,
most of which we have reported to you previously, GAO found that between 61 percent
(Tennessee) and 71 percent (Washington) of former recipients were working at the time of follow
up and between 63 percent (Maryland) and about 85 percent (Indiana, South Carolina, Washington,
and Wisconsin) had worked at some point since leaving welfare. We will review the entire GAO
report on which the testimony was based and the other information presented by a range of panelists

and will provide you a more comprehensive report shortly.
