TEXT:
Chris -- pasted below is self-explanatory. Elena and I touched upon this
briefly this morning, and she mentioned it at senior staff. As it stands
now, any NBAC statement will not come today, but rather on Wednesday.
We'll keep you posted and in the loop from our end ... please let us know
if you hear anything. Thanks.
