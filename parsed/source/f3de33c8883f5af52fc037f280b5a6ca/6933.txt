TEXT:
Florida's state legislature passed a law requiring a small privatization
demonstration as part of their welfare reform plan. USDA has a legal
deadline to act -- this Monday, April 6. Options are (1) approve, (2)
deny, or (3) ask more questions. USDA proposes (3) ask more questions, as
we did with Arizona. 'I think this is the right course of action.  I will
tell them we have no comment on their plans if I don't hear any objections
from all of you close of business Friday.

This is the state legislature's initiative. The Governor's staff told me
off the record that they will not be greatly disappointed if this is not
approved.

The demo would privatize food stamp and Medicaid eligibility determination
for about 1% of the state's caseload.

Keith:  I wasn't sure who the right person was at OMB, so I'm sending this
to you.  I sent Anil the paper on this issue.
