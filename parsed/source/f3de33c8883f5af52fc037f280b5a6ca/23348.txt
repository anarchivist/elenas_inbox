TEXT:
The following are my comments to the sections of the race book that I was
asked to review:

PART I: THE AMERICA WE SEE
1. Page (1)-17 the third sentence in second paragraph is misleading.
It seems to indicate that there are 19 Asian Pacific American Members of
Congress.     While it may be true there are 19 ·members of the Congressional
Asian Pacific Caucus - sadly only 7 members Gf Congress are Asian Pacific
Americans and the other members are non- Asian Pacific Americans who
represent large Asian Pacific American constituencies. Therefore this
sentence should be deleted and the new sentence should read:
        "There are now 7 members of Congress who are Asian Pacific
Americans ...

2.  Page (1)-25 - footnote 10 & 11 references- The    referenc~   for footnotes
10 & 11 does not exist.

PART III: THE OPPORTUNITY WE DESERVE
1. Page (111.4)-46 - The section in the box about the Executive Order
should be changed to reflect the decision whether an Executive Order or a
guidance will be issued and should be limited to the first bullet and a
revised third bullet - to reflect the decision that is made with regard to
our policy on race profiling that is still under review.

2. Pages (111.4)-48 -49- Delete the entire paragraph that starts at the
bottom of page 48 that begins with "I believe ... " and continues on page 49
ending with the words" of these concerns." This is the offensive
paragraph that seeks to justify the use of race profiling by the border
patrol.

Please let me know if you have any questions.   Thanks.
