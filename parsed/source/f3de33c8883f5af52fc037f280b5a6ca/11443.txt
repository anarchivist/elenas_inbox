        This year, we have an important opportunity to work together, across party lines, to bring
true progress to America's public schools. We should start right now to make the reforms and
targeted investments we need to prepare our children for the 21st century.

        I welcome the idea of greater flexibility in education for states and school districts, tied to
greater accountability for results. For this reason, I urge the Senate to pass an Ed-Flex bill this
week that provides both expanded flexibility and strengthened accountability in education.

         But we must do more to give our children a world-class education. That is why I
strongly support the amendment that Senators Kennedy and Murray will offer this week to build
on our bipartisan efforts of last year to reduce class size in the early grades. As you recall,
Congress voted across party lines to provide a down payment on my class size reduction
initiative in the FY 1999 budget, by appropriating $1.2 billion to help communities hire about
30,000 teachers. The Kennedy-Murray amendment would finish the job by authorizing $11.4
billion more over six years to help communities hire 100,000 well-prepared teachers to bring
class size in the early grades down to a national average of 18 students.

        As parents and teachers across America understand, smaller classes can make a profound
difference for our children. Studies show that teachers in smaller classes give more personal
attention to students and spend less time on discipline; as a result, students in these classes learn
more and get a stronger foundation in the basics. Across the country, students in smaller classes
outperform their peers in larger classes. And reduced class size makes the greatest difference for
minority and disadvantaged students.

       It is important that we act now on a long-term commitment to reduce class size, because
communities will soon begin to receive the funds we appropriated last year for this purpose.
Communities' will not be able to use these funds as effectively as possible unless they have
confidence that Congress will provide continued support to reduce class size for years to come.
Passage of the Kennedy-Murray amendment will ensure effective local planning as school
districts move to put this new initiative into effect.

        I am asking you to show continued and long-term support for this effort to reduce class
size across the nation. There can be no better way to demonstrate a commitment to work
together in this Congress to strengthen the quality of education.
