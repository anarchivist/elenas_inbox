 H.R. 3525 - Church Arson Prevention Act
 (Hyde (R) Illinois and 79 cosponsors)

The Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R. 3525.
Religious freedom is one of the founding principles of our
democracy, and it is imperative that attacks upon that freedom do
not go unpunished. This bill is a bipartisan effort to remove
unduly restrictive statutory requirements in 18 U.S.C. ?247 that
currently inhibit the prosecution of persons who destroy or
deface religious property.   The Administration unequivocally
supports that effort.
H.R. 3525 will make victims of Section 247 violations eligible
for compensation from the Crime Victims Fund. The Administration
also strongly supports that effort. The bill should be
construed, consistent with the Establishment Clause of the First
Amendment, to require States participating in the Fund to offer
compensation to individuals injured by violations of the Federal
law, and for the Federal Government to provide matching funds for
that purpose. The bill should not be construed to require or
permit participating States or the Federal Government to provide
monetary grants to pervasively sectarian institutions or for
religious uses.
