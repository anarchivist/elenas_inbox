TEXT:
I've attached below information from a press advisory sent out by NETWORK,
a National Catholic Social Justice Lobby, about a briefing they are doing
tomorrow.  It's not clear exactly how much data they'll release tomorrow
since this is just the first phase of the study to be completed in
December 1998. At least they allege to have a balanced perspective--the
study's purpose is "to determine the efficacy or damage of" PRWORA.   They
are targeting targeting 10 states with largest welfare populations, and
collecting information through a network of groups who have "illustrious
tradition of service" to the poor.   Michael Kharfen was unable to get any
additional information about what the study says, but ACF is sending
someone to the event and will let us know if it's anything
earth-shattering.  If so, I'll. do Q&As.


NETWORK, a national faith-based social justice lobbying organization, will
hold a press briefing to present findings from the first phase of the
Welfare Reform watch Project, a far-reaching 16-month scientific field
study of the effects of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity
Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA).

When:      Tuesday, April 7, 1998
           9:30 * 10:30 a.m. (Refreshments will be served)

Where:     Room SH-708, Hart Office Building
           2nd & C Streets, N.E., Wash., DC

Why:    NETWORK is committed to developing effective public policy that
helps people move from poverty to economic productivity. The study will
provide credible statistical and anecdotal feedback to drive
subsequent anti-poverty and safety net programs. After completion
of the study in December 1998, final results will be made available
to the public, including legislators, lobbyists and the media.

Dr. Douglas Porpora, who designed the study and is analyzing the project
findings, will be available to answer questions.  Dr. Porpora is Associate
Professor of Sociology at Drexel University in Pennsylvania.

OVERVIEW
NETWORK Welfare Reform Watch Project

NETWORK's Welfare Reform Watch Project is a focused study of the effects of
the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996
(PRWORA).   Participating agencies and welfare Reform Watchers are
collecting both statistica,l and anecdotal data from a sampling of those
affected by
the legislation.

NETWORK, a national faith-based social justice lobby, has a 27-year history
of lobbying, organizing and educating to develop public policy that
promotes justice for all, especially for those in our society who are
poor.  For the
Welfare Reform Watch project, NETWORK is collaborating with national
NETWORK member groups that have illustrious traditions of service to those
among us
who are poor: the Sisters of Mercy of the Americas, the Daughters of
Charity United States Province, the U.S. Federation of the Sisters of
Saint Joseph
and Pax Christi USA.

The purpose of the project is to determine the efficacy or damage of the
Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act and, where
necessary, to make recommendations for subsequent legislation that will
promote authentic anti-poverty and safety net programs.   Each of the
collaborating groups has designated its own service agencies in 10 states
with high welfare populations (California, Florida, Illinois,
Massachusetts,
Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas) to
participate in the project.  Using a professionally designed
questionnaire, the
agencies are monitoring the effects of PRWORA on the agencies and their
program
participants.  During the 16 months of the Welfare Reform Watch Project,
the respective agencies will gather data in three phases.

This information is being channeled to a central location for analysis by
Dr. Douglas Porpora, Associate Professor of Sociology, and his department
at Drexel University in Pennsylvania, as well as the NETWORK staff.

Timeframe: The research study period ends December 1998. Final results
will be summarized and made available to the public, including legislators,
lobbyists and the media.
