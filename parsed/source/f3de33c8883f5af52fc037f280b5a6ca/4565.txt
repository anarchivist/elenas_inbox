              Comments about Start of the State Children's Health Insurance Program


     Before starting, I want to point out that today marks the first effective day of the new Children's
     Health Insurance Program -- a $24 billion initiative that could not have been fully funded without
     the tobacco tax we enacted into law in August. Not only does the tobacco provision help fund
     the children's health initiative, but the increase in the price of cigarettes will help prevent
     children from smoking in the first place. I thank many of the Congressional leaders here today
     who have made this much-needed investment possible.

     Starting today, the Federal and state governments will begin a partnership to help provide
     affordable coverage for millions of uninsured children. On Monday, we learned from the
     Census Bureau that the problem is even greater than we thought. Nearly 11 million American
     children now have no insurance, an 800,000 increase.

     I am gratified to learn that many Govemors and state legislators, as well as consumer advocates,
     business leaders, health care providers and insurers are working hard to establish new health
     insurance programs for children. But much more needs to be done. Today, I call for a
     redoubling of our efforts to ensure that we never receive another report that the numbers of
     uninsured children are increasing. And just as the new children's health initiative improves the
     health of our nation's children, the next step we must take to is to pass a national tobacco
     agreement that discourages our children from smoking.
