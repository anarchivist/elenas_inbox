TEXT:
FYI.-
Justice (Smith) reports that S. 1887 may go to the Senate floor
next week. Justice is continuing to work with Sen. Kohl to get a
court secrecy provision deleted from the bill before it is brought
to the floor.  The provision would require judges, before
restricting acess to court records, to find that the order would
not affect public health or safety.
In addition, OLC has constitutional concerns with a magistrate
judge provision. This provision would permit magistrate judges to
conduct trials for petty offenses without the consent of the
defendants. Justice does not think that the AG would recommend
veto of the bill over this provision - but they are still vetting
the provision with their policy officials.
