TEXT:
Under the INA the AG does not have discretion to allow those who have been
convicted of aggravated felonies to adjust their status (to become an
legal permanent residents or citizens).   However, the AG has wide
discretion to grant stays of deportation.   The Irish advocates want us to
support legislation that would create an exception for these folks -- thus
allowing them to become legal permanent residents or citizens.
