        Subject:         Housing Bill

        The SAP actually opposes the bill, unless certain amendments are made.
        They list 8 different areas we want changed, but they probably don't all
        rise to the level of a veto.

        The most important are fixes to the assistance targeting in the House
        bill, and the most important targeting fix we want is a Section 8 income
        limit for new admissions (90% at or below 60% median income, 40% at or
        below 30%). We want tighter targeting requirements for PHAs and
        tenant-based assistance as well, although at least some OMB folks concede
        that the argument against tight PHA targeting -- it creates clusters, and
        cultures, of poverty -- makes sense.

        Of the other fixes,   there are only two I think you might be interested in.

        First, we want to delete requirement of a self-sufficiency agreement
        between PHAs and tenants or assistance recipients. In the House bill,
        this has two components: the 8 hour service requirement, and a contract
        with adults that sets a targeted graduation date. Our bill includes the
        service requirement, but not the contract; instead our proposal
        "clarifies" that "it would be the PHA's job to assist State welfare
        agencies, "presumably on the logic that housing offices shouldn't be
        welfare offices ...

        Second, we want to delete the requirement that private owners of federally
        assisted housing are provided with conviction information about applicants
        and tenants.  Hmmm ...

        Of other interest: HR2 (and our alternate as well, I assume) includes a
        $290 million for 98 and 99 for a new grant to fight crime in and around
        public or assisted housing; expands access to NCIC, and Rahm's sex
        offender registry; and mandates 3 years of ineligibility if a family is
        evicted for a drug-related crime.

        Let me know what else you want to know.
