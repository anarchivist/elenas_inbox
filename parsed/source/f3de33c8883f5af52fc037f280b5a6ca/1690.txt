TEXT:
Everyone at the WH is eager for the rollout to Eli Segal's group -- as you
know, we've been waiting for Eli to say he had enough business commitments
to move ahead.

Now, Eli and Kate Carr tell Lyn and me that they are ready to schedule and
have proposed dates, of which we think April 23rd, 24th, or 30th are
workable (May 1 and 2, which they also mentioned, would coincide with one
year anniversary of the teen pregnancy prevention group the President set
up and would invite unwelcome comparisons.)

The idea would be to have the CEOs on the board of directors (5 companies
mentioned in State of the Union -- Sprint, Monsanto, UPS, Burger King and
United Airlines -- and hopefully Marriot) meet with POTUS in the Oval,
then have a ceremony in the Roosevelt in which 25 additional companies
"commit" to 'hire and retain welfare recipients without displacement' and
formally launch the group.   (Kate Carr thought setting the Roosevelt room
up theatre style would work -- I'll leave that stuff to the experts.)    By
then the organization will be incorporated and had its charter ratified by
the board of directors; they will have applied for, but probably not yet
received, non-profit status.

Kate says they want to give the CEOs as much notice as possible (hopefully
3 weeks), so it will help if we can schedule as soon as possible.
