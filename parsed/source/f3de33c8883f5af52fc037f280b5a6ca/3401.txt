TEXT:
I will have the briefing on the genetics      event for you tomorrow by noon
for you to review. We should turn it in       by 2pm.  Is that okay? In
addition to the briefing, Sarah is doing      a one page fact sheet, executive
summary, and Q&A for the press office by      COB today -- so you can look at
them tonight or tomorrow morning. Sarah       will get those drafts to you, but
please give me the edits. Thanks.   Page      me if you have any concerns.
