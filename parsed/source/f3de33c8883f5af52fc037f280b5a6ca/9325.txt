NSC said McCaffrey heard Chuck had gotten involved and, against the advice
of ONDCP staff who's talking/working with NSC, picked up the phone and
gave Ruff his two cents.   I don't know how or what McCaffrey knew about
our meeting last week.

Want to reconsider how we're approaching the Safe and Drug-Free Schools
Reauthorization?
