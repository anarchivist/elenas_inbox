TEXT:
Based on discussions with the Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy, we've
got the makings for a good event on 4/30.  This would coincide with the
kick-off of Teen Pregnancy Prevention Month in May.   The Campaign would
be thrilled to have the President, the VP, and/or Mrs. Gore (apparently
the First Lady is not available). Do you think we should forward this on
to VP? Note 4/30 is also 50th anniversary of Israel and "Erase the Hate"
day.

We would:
Announce new research information and Campaign publications about the
importance of adult nvolvement in reducing teen pregnancy, including a
summary of research, tips for parents and adults, and new posters on this
theme.
CalIon all adults to do their part and specifically challenge the
entertainment industry to be part of the solution.
Announce a White House meeting for entertainment media leaders in the Fall
at which they would showcase examples of innovative programming and
announce new commitments.   (Campaign staff and others believe focusing on
the media has great potential. This would be a huge motivation to push
forward the media work the Campaign has begun) .
Recognize the eight 1998 Campaign honorees who will have received awards
at a dinner the night before (NBC, Teen Outreach Program, Governor Carper,
SADD, CDC-funded conflict resolution program in San Bernadino, Jerry Tello
and Geoffrey Canada for their work on male involvement, and a busines) .
Estimate up to 150 attendees including: honorees, Campaign Board and task
force members, and other key supporters.    Preferred time is late
morning.  If the new data and publications are not released at a White
House event, the Campaign is planning a Hill briefing that same day.   If
we do release here, we could also invite key Congressional members to
attend (Sen. Lieberman and Snowe, and Reps. Castle and Lowey co-chair the
Senate and House Advisory Panels for the Campaign) .

We can also do a May 1998 Teen Pregnancy Prevention Month presidential
proclamation/message on the adult involvement theme.
