TEXT:
Elena--
     Unless you have any major objections to it, I going to tell Karen
Houlebak at FDA that Dr. Friedman could mention that the food safety
90-day report is completed and set to go out during his congressional
testimony on Wednesday. wendy Taylor at OMB said that would be ok. The
final copy with the transmittal letter is being delivered this afternoon.
Let me know, Mary
