TEXT:
FYI: Rahm has expressed interest in getting this signed tomorrow before
the President leaves or the day he returns from his trip. The version
that I last circulated has been cleared by all the necessary parties
(including Staff Secretary) and is with Phil Caplan.  Phil is aware of the
timing and I think we're all set.

I'll let you know if I hear anything more about timing.

Leanne
