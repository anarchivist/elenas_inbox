TEXT:
Per my earlier e-mail, I probably didn't give you enough information. You
two gave me the go ahead to work with the Coopers & Lybrand rep. to draft
welfare to work questions for their quarterly survey to small and mid-size
companies.  I met with Coopers & Lybrand this morning. We are going to go
through a couple of drafts of questions and then share them with both of
you.  If you aren't happy with the questions, we can always cancel this
exercise.  However, once we approve the questions and they start their
field work, we are committed.
