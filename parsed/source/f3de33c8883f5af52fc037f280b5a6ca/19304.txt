TEXT:
FYI, Greyhound will try to get an amendment (through Schuster) to the ADA
during the ISTEA conference to exempt Greyhound from a DOT ruling that
requires accessible lifts on their buses.  We will oppose it.  The
disability community takes very seriously any amendment/weakening of the
ADA on the camel's nose theory.
