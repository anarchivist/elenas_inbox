TEXT:
The last email I sent you was a little incomplete. The new phone line in
218 will hopefully be installed today.  If not today, then Monday, but I'm
pushing for this afternoon.

As for your second computer, I think it will be ready sometime next week.
Once computer services can nail down a date to install it, we will plan
your move around it.

I'm working on getting you a more appropriate computer table and bookcase
for the ww space.

Thanks for your patience.
