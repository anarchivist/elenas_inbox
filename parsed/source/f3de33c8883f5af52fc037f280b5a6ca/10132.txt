 Melissa Skolfield insisted on having this, and Rob said it was OK to send
if we had to and he thought it was a good summary of the brief.

        Now Melissa's called me and says you and she specifically spoke
about not including the 'race to the bottom' stuff and she wants to know
if you've changed your mind? ==================== ATTACHMENT    1 ==============~===

                                         Q&A on Anderson v. Roe
                                            November 17, 1998


     Q:   What is the Administration~ position regarding CaJifornia~ policy ofpaying new residents less
          in welfare benefits than current residents?

     A:   The Administration's position is that the federal welfare reform statute (PRWORA) is
          constitutional, and that its residency provision, like other sections of the statute, simply
          gives states additional flexibility to establish welfare policies that best meet their needs.
          The brief argues that the purpose of the provision is to ensure that the new federal law
          would not create new incentives for interstate migration and would not encourage states
          to lower benefits, launching a "race to the bottom." The brief then argues that the
          federal district court erred in not examining whether California's statute was narrowly
          tailored to serve these purposes that underlie the federal law, and that it is doubtful
          whether the California statute can meet that standard. The brief urged the Supreme
          Court to remand the case to the federal district court to explore that issue.

     Q:   Why did the United States file a brief in the matter given that the U.S. is not a party to the
          suit and the 1996 federal welfare reform statute is not under review?

     A:   The United States filed a friend of the court brief because a clear question was presented
          about what, if any, effect the federal welfare reform act had on states' adoption of different
          benefit levels for new state residents. The U.S. also filed a brief because the case           .
          implicates important constitutional precedent concerning the right to travel.

     Q:   Does the evidence show that people move from state to state seeking higher welfare benefits?

     A:   There is mixed evidence on this point -- while there are no definitive studies, some
          studies indicate that higher benefits may encourage moving. Certainly, Congress could
          reasonably have determined that a provision of this kind would prevent welfare recipients
          from moving in search of higher benefits and states from engaging in a "race to the
          bottom." So far, the evidence indicates that no such race to the bottom has occurred
          and that in fact states are spending more per person than they were under AFDC.

     Q:   How many states currently provide a different benefit to new residents?

     A:   Thirteen states provide differential benefits to new residents (California, Florida, Georgia,
          Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, North Dakota, Pennsylvania,
          Rhode Island, Washington, and Wisconsin).
