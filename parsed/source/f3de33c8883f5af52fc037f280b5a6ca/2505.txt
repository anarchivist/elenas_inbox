     MEMORANDUM FOR ELENA KAGAN



     FROM:      Gary S. Guzy



     SUBJECT:            EPA POLICIES TARGETED TO CHILDREN IN THEIR EARLIEST YEARS



                Below is a preview of new plans and proposals EPA is exploring in

     response to the President*s February 24 Memorandum:



     THE ISSUE:



                Children today need significant and unique protection from a wide

     range of environmental hazards.      A series of diseases,   known or suspected

     to be of environmental origin, are increasing in children:



     *          Asthma: Rates are increasing sharply, and asthma has become the

     leading cause of admission of young children to the hospital.


*         Cancer: Incident rates of leukemia and brain cancer, the two most

common types of cancer, have been increasing steadily for two decades.

*         Birth defects: The incidence of certain birth defects has doubled

over the past fifteen years.

*         Lead poisoning: Despite significant advances,   lead poisoning still

affects thousands children.



THE RESPONSES:



1.        Executive Order to Protect Children From Environmental Health

Threats



          EPA has been working with White House offices and other agencies

to craft an Executive Order on Children*s Environmental Health and Safety,

which would recognize and address the oftentimes greater impact that

environmental pollutants have upon the

    health of children, by committing the government to set health and safety

standards tailored to protecting children wherever possible, and by

coordinating areas where additional research is necessary. To oversee the

implementation of these requirements,

the Executive Order would establish the Children*s Environmental Health

Working Group, composed of representatives of each federal department or

agency that bears responsibility for the regulation of activities or

substances that may affect children*s hea

lth or that conducts research on issues related to children*s health and

environmental risk.



2.        Principles for Family Right-to-know Legislation Providing Consumer

Information Labels


           EPA has proposed that the Clinton Administration challenge

Congress to pass legislation that would provide enhanced labeling

information to assist families in making informed choices about consumer

products exposing children to toxic chemicals.      W

e have been working with White House offices and other agencies to develop

these principles.      The basic approach would require manufacturers of

consumer products to provide information labels on those products that are

reasonably expected to have a unique

 and potentially detrimental effect upon infants and children due to their

toxic constituents.



3.         Protecting Urban Children from Health Threats, such as Lead

poisoning and Consumption of Contaminated Fish



           Children living in urban areas are exposed to urban pollution due

to factors such as the high concentrations of industrial activity. For

example:



           *        Lead poisoning remains widespread at low levels among

American children, affecting as many as 1.7 million children age five and

under.         Pregnant women poisoned by lead can pass that on to a developing

fetus.



           *        Contaminated Fish and Polluted Waters:   Polluted waters

not only affect children when they swim in our lakes and streams, but also

when they eat fish.      Children whose mothers are exposed to cancer-causing

PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) w

hen pregnant may develop learning disabilities and experience delayed

development, and chemicals such as PCBs also tend to accumulate in breast

milk.




         Building on the President*s February 24 Memorandum and his

Kalamazoo commitment to provide improved information for families on

toxics, EPA will pursue a number of administrative steps to ensure that

parents living in urban areas are armed with th

e information they need in order to take action to solve local

environmental problems that affect the health and safety of their infants

and small children.



4.       Protecting Children from Carcinogens, Neurotoxins and Reproductive

Toxins



         Children are more heavily exposed to these three classes of toxics

than are adults and they are especially vulnerable to them.     To protect

children against cancer, birth defects, developmental delays,

neurotoxicity, and reproductive impairment cau

sed by environmental chemicals, EPA proposes an expanded program of toxic

tests that takes into account the special vulnerabilities of young

children.     Also, EPA is enhancing the already ongoing research to

characterize the toxic effects of environmental

chemicals on children*s early development.



5.       Protecting Children from Secondhand Smoke



         Infants and young children whose parents smoke are among the most

seriously affected by exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, or

secondhand smoke, which is a carcinogen and presents significant health

risks to children.    Children are at increas

ed risk of lower respiratory tract infections such as pneumonia and

bronchitis.     EPA estimated in a 1992 risk assessment report that


secondhand smoke exposure is responsible for between 150,000 and 300,000

lower respiratory tract infections in infants and

 children under 18 months of age annually, resulting in between 7,500 and

15,000 hospitalizations each year.



       EPA proposes to collaborate with other federal agencies and

departments to educate and encourage parents to reduce their children*s

exposure to secondhand smoke.   EPA is also planning to develop a media

campaign on secondhand smoke and children in

 cooperation with a nationally recognized citizen group.
