TEXT:
Capitol Police became eligible to collectively bargain as a result of the
passage of the Congressional Accountability Act at the beginning of the
last Congress which subjected all legislative branch employees to existing
federal labor laws ie.) Fair Labor Standards Act.

The Capitol Police Board filed a suit (to the appropriate authorities --
still checking on whether it was brought in court or to the Labor Dept.)
arguing that the Capitol police should not be able to collectively
bargain.  They lost and now the Capitol Police have clear collective
bargaining rights, and approximately 10 percent have been exempted b/c of
national security concerns.  Currently, the Capitol Police are voting on
representation -- the teamsters, the FOP, and IUPA (International Union of
Police Associations) are contenders.
