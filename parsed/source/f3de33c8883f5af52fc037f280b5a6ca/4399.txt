TEXT:
fyi -- This week in the business section of the Post there was an article
indicating that some families would be prevented from taking full benefit
from the new education tax cuts because of the alternative minimum tax.
NEC is checking this out further with Treasury, but it looks like out of
11 million folks who would qualify for HOPE/Lifetime Learning, and the 27
million who would qualify for the child care tax credit (some of these
people may overlap), approximately 200,000 will be subject to the alterna
tive minimum tax in FY 98 (although more will have to do the calculation
to find out, which is annoying) .

The sense is that this is nothing that should prevent us from doing the
event, since the impact is very small in terms of percentage of
beneficiaries, and we can see that we are studying the problem and will
with work with congress to address it.
