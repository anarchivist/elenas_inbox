I gave them our preliminary OK, telling people we may want to add McCain
news if we had any -- but I don't think we do, do we? These are for the
Cabinet Secretaries and surrogates to use on Thursday, but Cabinet affairs
needs to go final today.  Would you care to review?

The following quotations are taken from internal industry documents released by the tobacco
companies under protest:

"It's a well known fact that teen-agers like sweet products. Honey might be considered."
-Brown & Williamson internal documents, 1972

"Today's teen-ager is tomorrow's potential regular customer, and the overwhelming majority of
smokers first begin to smoke while still in their teens."
-Phillip Morris internal documents, 1975-1988

"To ensure increased and longer-term growth for Camel filter. The brand must increase its share
penetration among the 14 to 24 age group, which represent tomorrow's cigarette business"
-RJR Reynolds internal documents, 1975

"The success of Newport has been fantastic during the past few years. The base of our business
is the high school student."
-Lorillard Tobacco Company internal documents

"Comic strip type copy might get a much higher readership among younger people than any other
type of copy."                                                             .
-RJR Reynolds (creator of Joe Camel) internal documents, 1973

The cigarette companies want you. They want you to start smoking early, as early as 12
and 13 years old, and keep smoking until you die.

·      90% of smokers became addicted before they were 18 years old; before they were
       even old enough to buy cigarettes. The tobacco companies have known who they
       were selling to for decades-young people like yourselves.

·      Everyday 3,000 young people will become regular smokers. 1,000 of them will die
       early because of their new habit.

·      Smoking kills more people every day than AIDS, alcohol, auto accidents, murders,
       suicides, drugs, and fires combined-400,OOO people annually

·      Where do you see tobacco ads? In Sports Illustrated and Rolling Stone Magazine. At
       (local professional teams) games. On billboards on the side of the road as you are
       coming to school. Everywhere.

·      You are here today because you understand that cigarettes kill.. You see what
       tobacco companies are trying to sell you. You have been smart enough to stand up
       and say that you will not let cigarettes control you and you will not let cigarettes kill
       you.

·      But how many of you have friends that smoke? A lot. That is why the President is
       fighting to decrease smoking in young people. To make sure that you and your
       friends have the same opportunity to live a long and healthy life.
                                                                      Automated Records Management System
                                                                              Hex·Dump Conversion
    . The means we can stop almost 3 million young people from beginning. That means
      we can prevent almost 1 million early deaths.

·   The President wants to sign a law that reduces teen smoking based on five principles:

    Raise the price on a pack of cigarettes as much as $1.50.

    Raising the price of cigarettes will put tobacco out of reach for most young people.
    Studies show that a 10% increase in the price of cigarettes results in a 7% reduction
    in the number of kids who start smoking.

    Money collected from tobacco company payments should be used to help our
    children and improve the public health. Both have been hurt by the tobacco
    industry
    for decades. The money should not be locked away-·too many lives are at stake.

    Reaffirm the government (through the FDA) to regulate tobacco products.

    Tobacco company documents confirm what independent scientists already know:
    nicotine, the active ingredient in cigarettes, is addictive. The Food and Drug
    Administration must have full regulation authority to prevent cigarette makers
    from
    manipulating nicotine levels to addict more kids.

    Stop marketing and promotion to children.

    The most heavily advertised brands of cigarettes-Camel, Marlboro, and
    Newport-are
    also the most frequently chosen by underage smokers. Advertising legitimizes
    smoking as a social activity (i.e. makes smoking look cool) in the eyes of kids who
    are tempted to smoke.

    Advance public health by funding more medical research, reducing second hand
    smoke, and promoting smoking cessation programs.

    Smoking has crippled the public health of America's children for decades. The
    result has been higher rates of cancer, emphysema, and other illnesses. Still, 70%
    of
    smokers want to quit, but fewer than 3% successfully do so each year. We need
    to
    help smokers who want to quit and save those who have gotten sick from smoking.

    Protecting tobacco farmers and their communities.

    Most tobacco farmers live and work on small family farms; in many cases, their
    families have been growing tobacco for generations. We will not abandon these
    families and their communities-communities like yours, except their main industry
    is tobacco farming. They will not be punished for the actions of the cigarette
    producers.                                                                       IS t
                                                                     Automated Records Managemen ys em
                                                                             Hex-Dump Conversion
    The President is calling for comprehensive, bipartisan tobacco legislation now. A piece
    meal approach will not meet our .overriding goal of dramatically reducing teen smoking.
    All five of these principles must be addressed, otherwise the tobacco companies will win the
    fight for our children and an historic opportunity will have been lost.
