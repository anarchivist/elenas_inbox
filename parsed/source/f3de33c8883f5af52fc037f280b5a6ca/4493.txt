            I wasn't sure if a one pager was still needed in addition to talking
           points.  This is a draft one-pager that is a full rip-off of Elena's
           talking points for today.  I added a sentence at the top, and cut language
           about fast track at the bottom.   ==================== ATTACHMENT    1 ==============

                       The President's Initiative to Ensure the Safety of Imported
                                    Fruits and Vegetables

                                      September 23, 1997


       The president will announce next week a major initiative to ensure the safety of fruits and
vegetables consumed by the American public, especially those coming from foreign countries.
Today, 38% of the fruit--and 22% of the vegetables--consumed in the UIiited States is imported.
The initiative has three parts.

        First, the President will direct the FDA and USDA to issue guidance on good agricultural
practices and good manufacturing practices for fruits and vegetables. The guidance will deal with
matters such as sanitation, workers health and water use. By providing the first-ever specific
safety standards for fruits and vegetables, the guidance will improve the agricultural and
manufacturing practices of all those, foreign and domestic, seeking to sell produce in the U.S.
market.

         Second, the President will propose legislation to give the FDA authority to bar food
imports from any country that does not protect food safety at least as well as the United States
does. The USDA already has this authority for meat and poultry products and uses it to refuse
meat imports from many countries. The legislation will give the FDA the same power over
fruits, vegetables, and other food products, so that the FDA can prevent countries that do not
protect food safety as well as the United States from importing their products.

        Third, the President will call for an increase in FDA funding in FY 99 to allow the FDA
to expand dramatically its international inspection force. The budget request will enable the
FDA to deploy inspectors in all foreign countries seeking to import fruits and vegetables into the
U.S. Based largely on their inspections, the FDA will decide whether to allow imports from
foreign countries.

        This initiative builds on the President's prior actions on food safety--including a new
early warning system to detect outbreaks of food borne illness as quickly as possible; advanced
safety standards for meat, poultry, and seafood; and a recent legislative proposal to increase the
FDA's and USDA's recall authority.
