TEXT:
I heard from Gerri Ratliff of Gorelick's office that DOJ has
completed its list of non-means-tested programs that will be
exempt from the immigrant ban (the subject of the memo we sent
around), in case you want to check in with them.   She said
agencies had been pretty responsive in their help.
