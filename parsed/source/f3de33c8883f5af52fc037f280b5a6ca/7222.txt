I just called Tom (left voice mail) . We have drafted the two pagers that
he's looking for .. you two have hard copies, and need to review them to
see if they're ready to go public.

Subject: asap ... 5pm Conrad/McCain mtg.

Conrad's staff has called for help before a 5pm meeting today between
McCain's and Conrad's staff. Conrad's staff would like to coordinate with
us.  Specifically they were asking for feedback from the our meeting with
McCain yesterday, and advice on which issue they should push with McCain's
staff in their meeting today.

 Conrad's staff also asked for help with talking points on the following
·issues: bankruptcy, black markets, regressivity, constitutional concerns
about ad restrictions and look-backs.   They were looking for a one-pager
on each of those five issues. Finally they made a more general plea for
better coordination -- they are smarting from Monday when we stepped on
 the news they were trying to make with their hearing.

Could one of you please call Tom Mahr before 5pm (224-5473) or provide me
with answer and I will pass it on. Thanks.
