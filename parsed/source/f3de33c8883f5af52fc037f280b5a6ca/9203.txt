TEXT:
Maria/Elena:
I met with Bob Bach and John Fraser today to discuss next steps in
developing a revised MOU between INS and DOL re: 1-9 inspections. John F.
is going to draft a revised MOU that limits DOL's 1-9 inspections to
non-complaint cases (so-called "directed" cases). The idea, as you know,
is for labor complaints from workers not to serve as the trigger for an
1-9 inspection. This MOU will also give the DOL concurrent authority
(with INS) to sanction employers for failing to adequately fill out 1-9
forms.  John hopes to get us a draft by the end of next week.
