Subject:         H-1B and Washington Post

We may have a press opportunity for Gene.  Bill Branigan of the Washington
Post is writing a story on H-1B from the worker's perspective.  He talked
to John Frasier at DOL (who administers the program} largely to get some
factual information on what's legal.  (The workers complain about being
"put on the bench" (that is hired and then they sit around because there
is no work and they only get paid a minimal amount of money during that
time), about hefty breach of contract fees (upwards of $10,000), and havi
ng to work 60-80 hours/week without receiving overtime.

Most importantly, in the course of the conversation Branigan said, "I've
heard that the Administration is softening its position on the reforms.
Is this true?" Frasier gave the party line but this may be an opportunity
for Gene to reinforce that the Administration has NOT changed its position.

 (In addition, Branigan asked, "Is it true that employers don't have to
advertise for the jobs into which they hire the H-1B workers?"   Frasier
responded, "Yes, that's why we're seeking the "recruitment" attestation.)

DOL believes that Branigan is writing today and tomorrow, but is not sure
when exactly the story would run. They are looking into it.
