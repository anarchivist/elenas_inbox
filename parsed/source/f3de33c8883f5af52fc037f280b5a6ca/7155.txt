TEXT:
Just a reminder:  I know you're planning to speak to Podesta on the timing
of the FICA/workfare notice.   This Friday, the Exec Comm of NGA is
meeting (I believe you're meeting with Democratic Governors that day as
well). Charlie Salem of Gov. Chiles office has suggested that Chiles may
find it difficult not to raise this at the NGA meeting this Friday, so we
should deal wtih this soon.

Subject:         FICA/workfare

Charlie Salem of Gov. Chiles' office says Chiles is itching to start
banging the drum again on the FICA/workfare notice issue with his fellow
Governors. He has been holding back after we quietly consulted just him
and Carper on the specifics of the notice right before the Feb. NGA
meeting. But there is an NGA executive committee meeting in DC on April
24 (where they will focus mostly on tobacco), and Charlie says it may find
its way onto the agenda by then.  So perhaps that gives us a deadline in
pushing Podesta .

. (By the way, Treasury says their desire to do the notice is not affected
 by Rubin's chat with Sweeney. Rubin wants to be briefed on the issue, but
 Scholz is certain that that briefing will just be informational and won't
 alter their position.)
