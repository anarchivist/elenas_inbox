I couldn't get into the EOP computers, so I'm sending via my father-in-law

and the Inet:



As I mentioned when we met Wednesday, OMB passed back funding we believed

sufficient to fulfill the President's statement.     However, the budget

office at HHS allocated the funds 80% to domestic initiatives.     We have

informed them that this is inconsistent with the President's announcement.

We hope this will resolve the issue and will report back if it doesn't.

Please let us know if you hear otherwise.



And thanks for the heads up.

Subject:           FDA & CDC Funding for Food Safety Activities



You asked that we provide you with an assessment of the OSTP staff

complaint that FDA and CDC have not been provided enough funding to meet


the Administration's stated goals in the President's Food Safety

Initiative.



FDA's Food Safety Import Funding Level



        The passback for FDA included $24 million in FDA's base to

continue food

safety initiative activities begun in FY 1998 and an additional $25 million

to fund food import inspection activities and some expanded domestic food

safety activities, for a total food safety initiative level of $49 million.




        When we passed back. the $25 million for FDA (we also passed back $5

million for CDC food safety), we advised HHS that this was all the

additional funding they would be getting to cover additional FDA food

safety initiative activities and the President's food safety commitments.

We did not passback a split for domestic and international food safety and

left it to HHS' judgment, assuming that HHS would allocate the funds to

meet the President's most recent import inspection commitment.



        In previous discussions with FDA, we determined that FDA could

reasonably

obligate in FY 1999 at least $15 million to develop a comprehensive

international import inspection program and hire over 60 international

import inspectors (FDA currently has roughly four FTEs doing international

inspection).    With such an increase,   FDA will be able to

evaluate/investigate the food safety systems of 50 to 55 countries phased

in over two years.



HHS Advised FDA to Spend Less on Imports




          Instead of adequately funding the food import inspection

initiative to

meet the President's commitment to "dramatically expanding" FDA's    food

import inspections, HHS apparently advised FDA that of the $25 million we

passed back, $20 million was for domestic food safety and $5 million for

the President's Food Import inspection initiative.



          We spoke to Bill Beldon today at ASMB and advised him that the HHS

split

for domestic and food import was not sufficient to meet the President's

commitment for food import inspections and that FDA would need at least $15

million, although we were not precluding HHS from allocating more than $15

million to import inspections of the total $25 million passed back for food

safety.   Bill acknowledged our concern and said he would communicate this

concern to the rest of ASMB and FDA.



          It is our considered judgment that the additional $25 million

(+20% over

the FY 1998 enacted level for FDA food safety activities) that was passed

back to FDA will be enough to meet the Administration's commitments on food

safety in FY 1999, but the funds need to be allocated according to

Administration priorities i.e., the majority of the $25 million should go

to import inspection.




Analysis of OSTP Concern Re: CDC Food Safety Funding



        In the attached e-mail OSTP staff states that "$5 million would

not enable

CDC to put in place the early warning system the President promised last

January."    We assume OSTP is referring to the "Food Safety: From Farm to

Table" initiative announced to support the FY 1998 Budget.     If this is the

case, the statement is not accurate.



            The Food Safety initiative announced by the President last

January (and

subsequently summarized in a May 1997 report prepared by EPA, HHS and USDA)

outlined specific policies and resource levels for FY 1998. While the

interagency report identified some "long-term" activities, it did not

identify specific resource levels for FY 1999 or other out years.

Specifically, the initiative proposed an additional $10 million for CDC in

FY 1998 (a 222% increase) over FY 1997 to expand from five to eight the

number of "Foodnet" active surveillance sentinel sites that conduct

epidemiological research on foodborne pathogens, as well as expand the use

of molecular "finger-printing" technology to identify the source of

infectious agents.



Congress enacted the resources proposed in the FY 1998 Food Safety

initiative for CDC.    The OMB recommended level for FY 1999 is a $5 million'

(+34%) increase over the level proposed by the President in FY 1998 for

CDC, but lower than the $21 million (+145%) increase requested by HHS for

FY 1999. The OMB recommendation would allow CDC to build upon the

activities that CDC will conduct in FY 1998, although not to the level that

HHS would like.    HHS is appealing for an additional $5 million over the OMB
·

        recommendation in FY 1999.
