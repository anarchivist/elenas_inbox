                     To clarify the topics for Friday's 12:30 meeting on a variety of
                     welfare reform topics, the agenda items are:

                     1.  "Allor none":   this is the question, I believe, of whether
                     the law allows states to pick and choose among classes of legal
                     immigrants as they make their Jan. 1 Medicaid/TANF/SSBG
         decision.
                     (Elena, I'd be interested in your take on this.)

                     2. $500 million:   this is the HCFA admin money for eligibility.
                     HCFA has promised to share their approach with the states next
                     week (no paper).  This is the issue where the states will want a
                     straightforward formula distribution of this money, but HCFA
         wants
                     to use some of the money to reward states that do a good job on
                     eligibility/outreach. So states may not be happy.

                     3.   1931 b vs. d waiver issue:   This once-major issue has boiled


              down to having a very minor impact (really just Nebraska)
              regardless of the legal theory HHS chooses to interpret the law,
              but there is still a political overlay, in that the states will
     be
              mad if they choose one interpretation; and Chafee/advocates will
              be mad if we choose another.

              4.   The issue formerly known as "the California issue":   they
     will
              have a preliminary take on whether they think states can become a
              TANF state and get the money early, but defer compliance with
     time
              limits, etc., until the first Federal dollar is drawn down.

             (Note to the Medicaid types:   we are getting a copy tomorrow (at
             the meeting) of their draft manual issuance. They want to share
             it with states on Wednesday of next week, so are seeking our
             comments by COB Monday.  I don't know what issues are lurking in
             it. I assume the health division will come to tomorrow's
             meeting. )
