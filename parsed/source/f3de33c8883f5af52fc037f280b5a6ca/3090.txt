TEXT:
As I mentioned last week they've been holding off making calls to your
offices.   I've just received another call from Tim Dudgeon, head of
Federal Gov't Relations, Distilled Spirits Council, requesting an update.
They are almost to the point of unleashing a public campaign on their
request for a WH meeting. We need an answer to their letter to POTUS.
I'm sure they will start calling you by end of week if I don't tell them
something.

In addition, according to Dudgeon, Sen. Daschle is getting ready to call
Erskine on this.

We need to do something and I need to give them some kind of update today
if at all possible.

Please help.
