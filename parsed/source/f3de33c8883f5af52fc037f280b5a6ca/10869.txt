       The press office asked for guidance, since the state of NY's deliberations
       were featured prominently in the NY Times today. This is the same answer
       as we gave to a different Q on 1/12

                                        January 25,1999



    Q:   What does the Administration think of New York state's plans to spend their
         portion of the tobacco settlement? Is the Administration still going to claim a share
         of the recent tobacco state settlement?

    A:   The President has always said that tobacco settlement funds should be spent to promote
         public health and assist children. Under current law, the federal government is obligated
         to recoup a portion of these tobacco recoveries, and the Administration will proceed in
         accord with that statutory obligation. The President, however, has made clear that he is
         open to working with the states to resolve these federal claims in exchange for a
         commitment by the states to use tobacco money for specified activities including public
         health and children's programs.
