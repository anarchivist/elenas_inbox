TEXT:
Wendell is floating an idea to W&M staff to allow TANF and WtW funds to be
transferred to Access to Jobs to meet the ATJ match. Apparently the
motivation is so that the transportation initiatives funded through ATJ
(and its match) not have time limits and other TANF requirements
attached. Also, this would make administration of ATJ simpler.   This all
arose out of what were supposed to be technical/clarifying amendments on
ATJ match. HHS and DOT are going to want to know our views on transfer,
should Wendell actually get the committee staff to propose it. While we
support ATJ and the need to invest in welfare to work transportation,
seems to me we'd have problems with the transfer proposal on both process
and policy.  Process:  it's way beyond technical and this is not the right
place to address it.  Policy: Mary Bourdette tells me DPC has historically
opposed transfers out of TANF. Also, this new transfer is not
necessary--a state could transfer TANF funds to SSBG and use this as ATJ
match and achieve the same goals (though we don't necessarily need to
promote this).   Your reaction?

At the same time, W&M has drafted some clarifying language to attach to
child support bill that clarifies that TANF funds used to match ATJ cannot
be spent on capital, must be spent on new mass transit services (not
current operations), should supplement not supplant other State spending
on transportation, and must benefit TANF recipients and help them engage
in work activities (as defined in Sec 407 of TANF).  I'm OK with the
general intent, but have some questions about specifics. DOT and HHS are
reviewing that proposed language and will get back to me later today to
see if it all makes sense.   At this point, committee language does not
deal with transfer at all.
