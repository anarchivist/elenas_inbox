TEXT:
A rump group of AGs is meeting in Chicago next Tues from 12-5 to discuss
how to build support around the President's 5 principals - and away from
the June AG agreement. The group includes Doyle, Miller, Nixon, Udall,
Blumenthal and one or two others. I have urged them to try and expand to
incluse Repubs.
