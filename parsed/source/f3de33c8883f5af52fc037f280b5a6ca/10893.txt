EARLY WORD: Facing the threat of federal lawsuits, executives at
                  Philip Morris (MO) soon will float the idea of a food
business spinoff,
                  investment professionals say. The tobacco company's
spinoff could create
                  one of the world's largest publicly traded food
companies. The U.S.
                  Justice Department says it intends to file a multibillion
suit against U.S.
                  tobacco companies to cover health-care costs. The tobacco
and food
                  company's board of directors will meet this week.
