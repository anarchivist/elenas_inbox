Elena, Sally and Ceci:
According to the INS, they have approved 57,093 petitions for H1B visas as
of April 15th. They anticipate hitting the cap by the middle of May.
Their plan is to publish a notice that suspends the receipt of new
petitions as of the notice's publication date, because they believe that
they have enough petition applications in the pipeline to meet the
65,000.  INS wants to brief the Hill on their proposed procedure on
wednesday (prior to the Thursday mark-up). They are preparing press
material on this procedure and will forward it to us for review.

Julie
