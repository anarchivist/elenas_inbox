US to unveil five-year plan to end drug trade along Mexican border
MIAMI, Florida, Dec 11 (AFP) - The US government will unveil a detailed
plan next month to drastically curb drug-trafficking along its border
with Mexico within the next five years, officials said Thursday.
The initiative will be officially announced on January 27, during
President Bill Clinton's State of the Union speech to Congress.
Still, White House officials were willing to share a few early details
about the plan.
"We're going to try and stop drug smuggling into the United States
across the Mexican-US border in the next five years, substantially stop
it, while still allowing our second biggest trading partner to continue
economic cooperation," said US drug "czar", retired general Barry
McCaffrey.
Each year, millions of people cross the US border with Mexico, which
stretches some 3,000 kilometers (l,860 miles.)
But the US southern border also has become one of the country's main
points of entry for illegal drugs, McCaffrey said, pointing out that it
is "the biggest open border in the world."
"There's nothing like it anywhere on the face of the Earth," McCaffrey
observed.
McCaffrey said details about the anti-drug program would be made public
next month, but said one idea under consideration is to employ new
X-ray technology that,can peer into the interior of metal, and even
concrete receptacles, which might conceal illicit drugs.
"We said, 'let's use them on trucks, let's use them on rail cars.' They
work. They absolutely work," McCaffrey said.
