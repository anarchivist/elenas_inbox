           WELFARE CASELOADS DECLINED 39 MONTHS [check] IN A ROW
                              October 7, 1997



       Today, President Clinton announced that welfare caseloads had declined 39 months
[check] in a row, to just under 10.5 million. The welfare rolls have fallen by 1.7 million since
the President signed welfare reform into law and by 26 percent or 3.6 million since he became
President. For the first time since 1969, less than 4 percent of the U.S. population is on welfare.
49 out of 50 states have lowered their welfare rolls; 13 states by 40 percent or more.

      Later today, Vice President Gore will announce that the federal government has made
tremendous progress in fulfilling its commitment to hire 10,000 welfare recipients by the year
2000.

       These new caseload numbers underscore the success of the welfare reform law as it
begins its second year. Prior to the Clinton Administration, the welfare caseload had dropped by
more than a quarter million only twice in six decades. Today welfare case1oads, which fell by a
record 1.9 million in the President's first three-and-a-halfyears in office, are on course to have
dropped ed by 2 million more in the year since he signed the law. The numbers released today,
from June 1997, reflect 10 months of the first year of welfare refonn.

         President Clinton has made welfare refonn a top priority of his Administration. During
his first four years in office, the President granted federal waivers to 43 States to require work,
time-limit assistance, make work pay, improve child support enforcement, and encourage parental
responsibility.     In August 1996, President Clinton signed into law the Personal Responsibility
and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA), a comprehensive bipartisan welfare
refonn bill that establishes the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program.
Since signing the bill into law, the President has focused on efforts to create jobs to move people
from welfare to work, which include fighting for and winning an additional $3 billion for welfare
to work in the Balanced Budget Act, mobilizing the business community to hire welfare
recipients, working with civic, religious and non-profit groups to mentor families leaving welfare
for work, and hiring our fair share of welfare recipients in the federal government.
