          PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
          REMARKS FOR ANTI-DRUG EVENT
          THE OLD EXECUTIVE OFFICE BUILDING
          WASHINGTON, DC
          February 8, 1999

                   Acknowledgments: VP Gore; AG Reno; Sec. Shalala; ONDCP Dir. Gen. McCaffrey
             Jessica Hulsey [HULL-see]; Rhode Island AG Sheldon Whitehouse.

                  I want to start by thanking Jessica Hulsey for sharing her story.
          Just finding the courage and strength to survive and even thrive in a home
          where drugs -- not parents -- are in control is remarkable.    But your
          commitment to make sure that no other child has to live through the fear
          and uncertainty you endured is an inspiration for us all.   You are a truly
          exceptional young woman, and I thank you for being here today.

                  I know from my own experience what it feels like to have a family
          member caught in the deadly grip of drugs.  My own brother nearly died of
          a cocaine addiction -- and I have asked myself hundreds of times why I
          didnD,t see it -- and what I could have done to stop it if I had.  I know
          that my experience is not unique -- that thousands of families suffer
          through that nightmare of powerlessness and frustration.

                      But one of the most important things that JessicaO,s story and the


ads from our media campaign teach us is that we do have the power to fight
drugs.  If each of us takes action, at every level of government, in every
community, in every house of faith, and in every home ... if we reach out
to our young people -- as parents, mentors, and peers -- before drug
dealers reach them ... if we join forces, united and relentless in our
determination to win this war, we can make our nation stronger than ever
in the 21st Century.

         For years, it seemed that crime was an insurmountable and ever-increasing
problem.   But we put in place a tough, smart anti-crime plan, with police,
tougher punishment, and better prevention.   Six years later, we know that
our strategy is working     beyond our expectations. Around the country,
in cities large and small, crime is down to its lowest rates in 25 years.

        We are beginning to win the war against crime, and we can win the
war against drugs -- by marshaling the forces and resources of our
nation.  Year after year, my administration has secured the largest
anti-drug budgets in history, with more money for drug enforcement agents,
for border and customs control, for education and outreach, for treatment
and prevention. under the leadership of General Barry McCaffrey at the
Office of National Drug Control Policy, our efforts have begun to pay
off.  Overall drug use by adults has dropped to more than half of its
highest levels in 1979. Even drug use by our young people -- which seemed
to be getting worse every year -- has finally begun to decline.

        But when drug dealers still roam our streets and rob our children
of their dreams, when drug-related crime still ravages our neighborhoods,
we know we must do more. With our economy the strongest in a generation
and our confidence rising, we have a rare opportunity -- and an obligation
-- to redouble our efforts in the war against drugs.

        We must start by recognizing that our nationD,s drug problem was
not born in isolation and does not exist in a vacuum.  It is an
interconnected problem -- so our solutions must also be interconnected.

        To deal with the drug problem, we need to do more to expand opportunity
and create jobs for young people, especially in communities that have too
often been passed by in good times.  That means bringing the spark of
enterprise to inner cities, with more tax incentives for businesses and
investors, and expanded credit for low-income entrepreneurs.  It means s
trengthening the summer jobs programs that help so many young people build
a brighter future.

         To deal with the drug problem, we need to do more to improve our schools
and help all of our students to reach high standards. We need more
afterschool and summer school programs to keep young people learning in
the classroom in the hours between when school lets out and parents come
home from work -- the hours when young people are more likely to fall prey
to drugs.

        And to deal with the drug problem, we need a comprehensive anti-drug
effort that fights drugs on every front and uses every weapon we possess.

        That is why I am so pleased to release our 1999 National Drug
Control Strategy. This is not a short-term plan designed to produce
short-lived results.  It is a comprehensive, long-term strategy, with more
money for drug testing and treatment ... better drug-law enforcement in
our communities and better drug control on our borders ... and better
anti-drug education for young people, including our media campaign.


        And our plan is backed by the largest anti-drug budget ever
presented to the Congress: My balanced budget for 2000 -- the first budget
of the 21st Century -- includes nearly $18 billion to keep drugs away from
our borders, off of our streets, and out of our chi1drenD,s reach.

        I want to say a special word about our National Youth Anti-Drug Media
Campaign. We launched this campaign last year because we knew that when
it comes to fighting drugs, attitudes drive actions.  Young people who
understand the damage drugs can do to their lives -- and the lives of the
people they love -- are simply less likely to use them.

        Since we kicked off the campaign in July, we have reached
literally millions of young people with a powerful message: drugs are
illegal, drugs are wrong, and drugs can kill you. Although it is too
early to fully measure our success, we are seeing evidence that our
anti-drug message is getting through. And with ads in 10 languages, we
are reaching young people of every ethnicity and national origin.

        One big reason for this success is the remarkable response of the private
sector to my challenge to join our fight against drugs.  In six months,
our campaign has generated more than $165 million in matching
contributions for paid anti-drug ads. Virtually every major network has
produced high profile anti-drug public service announcements with their
best known celebrities -- you just saw a few of those -- and donated air
time to scores of non-profit organizations for their own anti-drug PSAs.

        I am very proud of everything we are doing -- especially at the
ONDCP -- to fight drugs.  But making our anti-drug strategy work is not a
job for just one agency, but for every agency, 365 days of the year.  That
is why I have called on my Cabinet to redouble their efforts in our fight
against drugs.

        I have asked Education Secretary Riley to build on our efforts to keep
our schools safe, by strengthening the Safe and Drug Free Schools
initiative, and encouraging more school districts to start afterschool
programs.

        I have asked Health and Human Services Secretary Shalala to help our
young people stay off of drugs by increasing our efforts to promote drug
treatment and prevention programs around the country.

        I have asked Attorney General Reno to push forward with more drug testing
of prisoners and parolees, and more police on the streets of our
communities, to break the deadly cycle between crime and drugs.  I have
also asked her to redouble our efforts against drug trafficking by
organized crime groups.

        I have asked Transportation Secretary Slater to maintain the vigorous
maritime interdiction operations against drug traffickers that are such an
important part of our supply-side anti-drug strategy.

        I have asked Treasury Secretary Rubin to 'step up anti-money laundering
efforts and work harder than ever, along with the Justice Department, to
keep drugs from crossing our borders.

        I have asked Defense Secretary Cohen to intensify his on-going efforts to
use the unique capabilities of our military to support our drug law
enforcement efforts, especially along our Southwest border.

        And I have asked Secretary of State Albright to continue our partnership


     with other nations -- particularly in the western Hemisphere Drug Alliance
     -- to fight the global drug problem.

             Next week, I will travel to Mexico, one of our strongest and most
     important partners in the fight against drugs. A major portion of the
     drugs that come into our country come through Mexico, across the 2,000
     mile border we share.   This illegal drug trade endangers Mexicans and
     Americans -- and it is in our nationsD, mutual interest to work together
     to shut it down.

              The Alliance Against Drugs that President Zedillo and I adopted
     together in 1997 is beginning to make progress -- and I am committed to
     building on that progress, sharing resources, information, and
     experience.    I am very pleased that last Thursday, the Mexican government
     announced it will be spending $400 to $500 million over three years to buy
     new planes, ships, radar and law enforcement equipment.   I look forward to
     discussing ways we can extend our cooperation when I meet with President
     Zedillo.

             Our battle against drugs is a fight to the finish -- and it is not
     a job for government alone. It will take all of our efforts and energy,
     all of our courage and compassion.  It will take everyone of us, looking
     ahead to a day when the scourge of drugs no longer threaten our children,
     our communities, or our collective future.   I believe that we will reach
     that day, working together, and I look forward to working with all of you
     to build a stronger nation for the 21st Century.

             Thank you.

                       1999 National Drug Control Strategy
                                   Questions and Answers
                                    February 8, 19998



Q.   What is the President announcing today?

A.   President Clinton will release the 1999 National Drug Control Strategy. The ONDCP
     Reauthorization Act of 1998 requires the President to submit a long-term plan to reduce
     illegal drug use and availability and its consequences. Within the Strategy is a detailed
     report on the nation's drug abuse profile and a comprehensive plan to cut drug use by
     50% by 2007.

     The President will also highlight the extraordinary efforts of the private sector to join
     forces with the successful Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign to get the right message to
     kids, parents, and teachers on drugs. In just six months, the private sector has committed
     $165 million in matching contributions to our media campaign.


Q.   What are the highlights of the new Strategy?

A.   The 1999 Strategy builds on the President's previous national strategies. It refines the
     mid- and long-term targets presented last year for reducing drug use and availability by 50
     percent by the year 2007. It also sets the target of reducing the criminal consequences of
     drug abuse by 30 percent and the health and social consequences by 25 percent by 2007.
     The 1999 Strategy will serve as a strong guide in our national drug control efforts for the
     next five years.


Q.   Why isn't the Strategy more ambitious? Can't we do better than cut drug abuse by
     50 percent by 2007?

A.   Reducing and stopping drug use requires fundamental changes in the attitudes of millions
     of Americans, and that shift in attitude is more gradual than we would wish. The
     Strategy promotes a steady pressure against drug use and underscores why drug control
     must be lifted out of partisan conflict. The Administration's long-term plan to reduce
     drug use by 50 percent to the lowest levels ever in our national experience is based on an
     historical perspective that is essential in the campaign against drug abuse -- not on
     simplistic solutions and sound bites that won't impact this difficult problem. .

    Q.   Doesn't your budget fall short of what is needed to implement your strategy and the
         corresponding performance measures?

    A.   No. The President's FY 2000 budget supports the goals and objectives ofthe National
         Drug Control Strategy through increases in areas identified as funding priorities. The
         proposed FY2000 anti-drug budget is $17.8 billion-- $735 million (+4.3 ) over FY 1999
         regular, non-emergency appropriations. Our budget provides increases of $210 million
         (+3.6 in FY 2000 over FY 1999 regular appropriations) to support drug education,
         prevention and treatment, and increases supply reduction programs by $524.8 million
         (+4.7 in FY 2000 over FY 1999 regular appropriations). Interdiction resources, mostly
         for one-time capital acquisitions, will increase significantly in 1999 as the result of a
         Congressional appropriation of $870 million for international drug-control and
         interdiction spending.


    Q.   Isn't this Strategy deferring accountability to future years? Why not issue an
         annual report card?

    A.   The 1999 Strategy provides a detailed annual update on progress in reducing drug abuse
         and its consequences. Among the 1999 report's principal conclusions are that drug use
         among the general population remained statistically unchanged between 1996 and 1997.
         Drug use among 12-17 year aIds declined slightly in 1997 and 1998. In 1996,
         drug-related deaths leveled off at about 9,300 after climbing throughout the 1990s.
         Drug-related medical emergencies remained near historic highs but were statistically
         constant in 1997. The costs of illegal drug abuse were estimated $110 billion in 1995, 64
         percent higher than in 1990.      And consumer spending on drugs declined by 37.3
         percent from $91.4 billion in 1988 to $57.3 billion in 1995.


    Q.   Can the federal government really accomplish these long-term targets established by
         this Strategy?

    A.   We can, but to do so, we will need the support of the fifty states and four U.S. territories
         as well as the thousands of city, county, and local governments threatened by illegal
         drugs. State governments, for example, have enormous potential for addressing the drug
         problem. They administer the school systems, exercise far-reaching jurisdictional power,
         channel money and resources to specific needs, and educate citizens about the dangers of
         illegal drugs. States' funds account for much of the spending on drug prevention and
         treatment, providing funds to thousands of community-based treatment programs and
         prevention providers. Counties and cities play an equally important role, providing
         essential services such as emergency medical care, education, and law enforcement. . All
         levels of government must become partners with the federal government in countering
         illegal drugs.

Q.   What makes you think you can cut drug use in half by 2007? Did you pick a ten
     year marker since President Clinton will no longer be in office by that time?

A.   After much research and consultation, General McCaffrey recommended the goal of
     cutting drug use in half over ten years as a tough, but attainable goal. From 1979 to
     1996, the number of people using drugs dropped by 49 percent, and the number using
     cocaine dropped by 70 percent. The critical part of meeting this goal is preventing the
     next generation of young people from ever starting to use drugs. Ifwe can do this, we will
     achieve the goal. That is why the Strategy reflects the need for an enduring
     commitment. The long-term marker reflects the fact that there is no quick fix to
     America's drug problem. Studies show that drug use patterns occur within generational
     cycles -- drug use falls off, and unless there is ongoing education, young people forget the
     dangers of drugs. To help us chart these drug use patterns this Strategy includes -- as
     did the 1998 Strategy -- a report on the nation's drug abuse profile.



Q.   Why doesn't the spending match the rhetoric? The Strategy identifies demand
     reduction as the priority, yet doesn't it invest more in supply reduction?

A.   No. We hope that Congress will support this record drug-control budget. If enacted,
     spending on prevention will have increased by 53 percent since FY1996 while spending
     on treatment will have increased by 26 percent. Overall, spending on demand reduction
     will have increased by 36 percent and outpaced the growth of spending on supply
     reduction, which will have increased by 30 percent.


Q.   Why are congressional critics saying that your drug-control budget doesn't invest
     sufficiently in supply reduction? And what ab~ut the charges that this failure is
     the reason why youth drug use increased during the 1990's?

A.   We are continuing to seek increased funding to reduce the supply of drugs -- our FY 2000
     request for supply reduction is over 30% more than in FY 1996. And though we have
     sought even greater increases during that same period for prevention -- our Strategy's top
     priority -- we believe that our proposal for supply reduction is more than sufficient. For
     instance, our Western Hemisphere cocaine control efforts have been extremely
     successful. Cocaine production in South America has plummeted by 280 metric tons
     (MTs) since 1995.' Coca cultivation has declined by 56 percent in Peru. Expanded
     Colombian cultivation slightly offset significant reductions in Bolivia and Peru. In 1997,
     an estimated 289 MTs of cocaine were available in the U.S., the lowest amount since the
     1980s and far below the peak of 529 MTs in 1992. And in 1998, 145 MTs of cocaine
     were seized en route to the U.S.

     However, if you really believe that the ready availability of drugs fueled the 1992-1996
                         Hex.Dump Conversion


    increase of drug use rates among 12-17 year-olds, you would target domestically grown
    marijuana, not South American cocaine. Just 0.6 percent of seventeen-year-olds were
    using cocaine in 1997, whereas marijuana usage accounts for about 90 percent of illegal
    drug use among juveniles.

                                The 1999 National Drug Control Strategy
                                          February 8, 1999

        Today at Presidential Hall, President Clinton will release the 1999 National Drug Control
        Strategy, a comprehensive long-term plan to reduce drug use and availability to historic new
        lows. The Strategy is backed by a $17.8 billion counter-drug budget -- the largest ever presented
        to Congress. The President will also highlight the extraordinary efforts of the private sector to
        join forces with the successful Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign to get the right message to
        kids, parents, and teachers on drugs.

        A long term commitment to fight drugs. Year in and year out, the Clinton Administration has
        proposed the largest anti-drug budgets ever, helping to increase federal counter-drug spending by
        nearly 40% between FY 93 and FY 99. Our sustained effort is having an impact: overall drug
        use is half the level it was at its peak in the 1970's; drug-related murders are down by 40 percent
        since 1992; the first-ever paid anti-drug media campaign has been launched nationwide; and
        youth drug use is on the decline for the second year in a row. The 1999 National Drug Control
        Strategy builds on this progress and takes the next steps to reduce drug use and availability
        across the board.

        Keeping kids the number one priority. If our children can make it to adulthood free of
        substance abuse, the vast majority will avoid addiction for the rest of their lives. That is why the
        first goal of the Strategy is to educate and enable kids to reject drugs. And while recent studies
        show declining youth drug use in 1997 and 1998, we have more work to do. The President's
        Strategy and FY 2000 budget reflect a strong commitment to meeting this challenge:

        ·   $195 Million for National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign. The President's budget
            continues this unprecedented, 5-year campaign to use the full power of the mass media to
            educate millions of young people, parents, teachers and mentors about the dangers of drugs.
            In just six months, the private sector has joined our national effort and made over $165
            million in matching contributions -- helping us to reach even more people by creating their
            own anti-drug ads, producing shows about drug prevention, and giving scores of non-profit
            organizations free air time to run their drug-related messages.

        ·   $590 Million for Safe and Drug-Free Schools. In addition to calling for increased funds; the
            President is committed to reforming the Safe and Drug-Free Schools Program to make it even
            more effective. The President's proposal will require schools to adopt rigorous,
            comprehensive school safety plans that include tough, but fair discipline policies; safe
            passage to and from schools; effective drug and violence policies and programs; annual
            school safety and drug use report cards; and links to after school programs.

        Breaking the iron link between drugs and crime. A third of state prisoners and one in five
        federal prisoners commit their crimes under the influence of drugs. Nearly 20 percent of state
        prisoners and 15 percent of federal inmates commit their crimes to buy drugs. The President's
        budget provides new resources for states and localities to break crime-committing addicts of their
                                               Automated Records Management System
                                               TIex-Dump Conversion

           addictions and reduce recidivism:

           ·   $215 Million for Zero Tolerance Drug Supervision. The President proposes the most
               comprehensive drug supervision ever to help keep offenders drug- and crime-free: $100
               million in new funds to help states and localities to drug test, treat, and sanction prisoners,
               parolees and probationers; $50 million to expand innovative drug courts; and $65 million for
               residential drug treatment for prisoners with the most serious drug problems.

           Strengthening law enforcement. One of the Strategy's goals is to increase. the safety of
           America's citizens by substantially reducing drug-related crime and violence. To help keep
           crime coming down to record low levels, the President's budget includes:

           ·   $1.275 Billion for a 21 st Century Policing Initiative, to help communities hire, redeploy and
               retain up to 50,000 law enforcement officers with an effort to target crime and drug "hot
               spots"; to equip officers with the latest crime-fighting technologies; and to engage entire
               communities to work together to prevent and fight crime.

           ·   $22 Million Increase for DEA Drug Intelligence, including $13 million to assist the Drug
               Enforcement Agency (DEA) with its efforts to automate and improve access to critical law
               enforcement and intelligence information, and $9 million to support investigations to
               dismantle drug trafficking organizations.

           Closing the treatment gap. Dependence on drugs exacts an enormous toll in individuals, their
           families, businesses, communities, and the nation. Treatment can help end dependence on
           addictive drugs -- and its destructive consequences. To help make treatment available to more
           Americans in need, the President's budget provides:

           ·   $85 Million to Increase Drug Treatment. The President's budget provides an additional $55
               million in Targeted Capacity Grants to expand the availability of drug treatment to meet
               existing or emerging needs, and $30 million more for the Substance Abuse Block Grant -- the
               backbone of federal efforts to help states and localities reduce the gap between those seeking
               treatment and the capacity of the public treatment system.

           Stopping drugs at the border and breaking foreign sources of supply. The Strategy will
           help shield our borders and strengthen multinational cooperation on drugs by including:

           ·   $50 Million Increase for the Southwest Border. The President's budget includes additional
               funds for INS to deploy "force multiplying" technology, such as infrared and color cameras
               and ground sensors to aid Border Patrol enforcement and drug interdiction efforts.

           ·   $29 Million More for International Programs, to fund the State Department's International
               Narcotics Law Enforcement Affairs' efforts in the Andean countries, and Mexico, and to
               provide assistance to enhance multinational cooperation in our anti-drug efforts.
