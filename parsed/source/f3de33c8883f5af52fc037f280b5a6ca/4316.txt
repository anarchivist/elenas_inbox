          Clinton announced broad executive action to protect our nation's young people from the dangers
          of tobacco by sharply restricting the advertising, promotion, distribution, and marketing of
          cigarettes to teenagers, The President authorized the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to
          initiate a broad series of steps all designed to stop sales and marketing of cigarettes and
          smokeless tobacco to children,

          Strong FDA Action. One year later, on August 23, 1996, the President's program was launched
          with the unveiling of the FDA final rule on tobacco and children. The FDA's actions were aimed
          at reducing the appeal of tobacco products to teenagers.

          Cracking Down on Youth Access to Tobacco. On February 28,1997, the FDA made 18 the
          minimum age to purchase tobacco products nationwide and required photo LD.s for anyone
          under the age of27.

          Courts Affirm the Clinton Administration's Efforts To Protect Our Children from
          Tobacco. On April 25, 1997, a Federal District Court in North Carolina affirmed the FDA's
          authority to regulate tobacco as a drug and restrict children's access to tobacco products.

          Protecting Federal Employees. On July 31, 1997, President Clinton announced an executive
          order to protect federal employees from environmental tobacco smoke. This executive order
          banned smoking in and around federal Executive Branch facilities.


                 "Bill Clinton has shown more guts on this issue of tobacco, children and health
                 than any president in the history of the country. "
