Children's Health Implementation. We are pushing HHS to quickly move to disseminate
information and guidance to states regarding implementation of the new children's health
initiative. In the last week and a half, the Department has already released a regulation
providing the state funding allotments for participating programs, distributed a question and
answer document, and circulated a state plan "template," which lists the type of information
states will need to provide in their applications for funding. In addition, NGA, the Congress,
and the interest groups have received detailed briefings on the current status of the program.
Much more needs to be done, however. We are working to distribute additional useful materials
to the states, consumers, providers, and other interested parties during October, the first month
the children's health program fully goes into effect. In addition we are also pursuing options for
potential events to highlight information about this new program.

FDA Reform. After months of delay, the Senate is scheduled to take up FDA on the floor next
week and is likely to pass its version of reform. This week the House Subcommittee of
Jurisdiction (Commerce) reported out its version of the FDA reform legislation and it is expected
to come before the full committee next week. There is a great deal of interest in signing an FDA
reform bill this year since failure to enact a bill will result in the expiration of the user fees that
fund new drug product reviews and have been extremely successful in expediting drug approvals.

There are two primary outstanding issues related to Administration approval of the bill. First,
the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) trigger as proposed in the Senate undercuts the
balanced budget agreement by requiring new increases that would interfere with HHS' s ability to
allocate resources appropriately. Second, section 404 of the bill would lower the review
standard for marketing approval by precluding FDA from reviewing new medical devices for
uses other than that which the manufacturer says is intended. It is our hope and expectation that
these issues can be resolved prior to the bill being sent to you for signature, which we expect will
be sometime in October.

AZT Trials. This week an article in The New England Journal ofMedicine criticizized the
clinical trials of medical interventions designed to discover ways to reduce maternal-infant
transmission ofHIV in developing countries. Although this article did receive a significant
amount of coverage, we believe it does not have "legs" as so many well respected ethicists and
scientists have suppoqed this research. More specifically, in 1994, international experts
convened by the World Health Organization thoroughly reviewed the studies and determined that
they are scientifically well-founded, ethical and essential to advance the fight against AIDS.
You should also know that Dr. Varmus, Director of NIH, Dr. Satcher, Director of CDC, and
Dr. Shapiro, Chair of the National Bioethics Advisory Commission, conducted a thorough review
to assess the scientific need and the ethics of these studies.

These studies are being conducted solely to find a treatment for AIDS that can be extended to
poorer nations. Because poor economic conditions and low standards of public health care in
participating countries, the women who take part in these studies are not able to afford the
expensive protease inhibitors and other AIDS drugs available in the United States. Unless we
conduct these much needed studies, we may never develop affordable AIDS treatments that can
be extended to all nations. These studies must include a placebo so that we make a comparable

     analysis of their effect.

     Dr. Satcher. Starting with your announcement last week, Dr. Satcher's candidacy for Surgeon
     General has received a great lift off. This week Dr. Satcher made many courtesy visits on the
     Hill which were very successful. Senator Frist, Senator Jeffords and many other members
     issued positive statements about him. Senator Lott said he saw no reason why Dr. Satcher
     should not be confirmed as Surgeon General. We will continue to keep the momentum up and
     increase the number of endorsements from Members and advocacy organizations. Weare
     hopeful that the confirmation hearings will begin in the next couple of weeks.

     Medicare Commission. We met this week with Erskine and others to narrow the list of
     candidates for the Medicare Commission. We will be sending you a memo through Gene
     Sperling and Bob Nash with the updated list for your consideration early next week.
