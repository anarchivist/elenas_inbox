 TEXT:
 The House Rules Committee is scheduled to meet tomorrow, Tuesday (6/23) at
 2:30pm regarding the Defense FY99 Appropriations bill.  Please provide
 comments/clearance no later than 10:30am tomorrow (don't worry about
 spacing - the conversion from WP to lotus notes sometimes makes the
 alignment off).  Thank you.

        DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS BILL, FY 1999
 (Sponsors: Livingston (R); Louisiana; Young (R), Florida)


         This Statement of Administration Policy provides the
 AdministrationO,s views on the Department of Defense Appropriations Bill,
 FY 1999, as reported by the House Appropriations Committee.  Your
 consideration of the AdministrationO,s views would be appreciated.

         The Committee has developed a bill providing requested funding for
 many of the AdministrationO,s priorities.  We appreciate the CommitteeO,s
 decision to fully fund the military pay raise and to fund critical


 readiness programs at sufficient levels. Also, we are pleased that most
 of the modernization priorities of the Department of Defense (DoD) are
 funded at or near requested levels. The Administration, however, is
 disappointed that the Committee bill provides      million below the
 President's request in order to increase funding for lower priority
 military construction projects. Also, as discussed below, the
 Administration has serious concerns about certain provisions included in
 the Committee bill, which must be addressed satisfactorily as the bill mo
 ves through the process.

         The Administration strongly opposes any provision in the Committee
 bill that could be read to require prior congressional authorization of
 actions taken by the President pursuant to his authority under the
 Constitution. The President must be able to act decisively to protect
 U.S. national security and foreign policy interests. This provision would
 send the wrong signal to the world, including U.S. resolve regarding Iraqi
 compliance with its obligations with respect to weapons of mass
 destruction, the SFOR operation in Bosnia, and efforts to deter Serbian
 President Milosevic from attacks on the people of Kosovo.  The
 PresidentD,s senior national security advisers would recommend veto of a
 bill with a provision such as this one that could be interpreted to
 restrict the PresidentD,s exercise of constitutional authority.

 Funding for Bosnia

         The Administration regrets that the Committee has not included
 funding for our ongoing operations in Bosnia. U.S. military presence,
 albeit at lower force levels, is critical for continued progress in
 implementing the Dayton Peace Accords. Moreover, a secure funding source
 for these operations at the start of the fiscal year will allow the
 Department to manage its readiness accounts effectively throughout the
 year. Although funding requirements for operations in Bosnia were not
 known when the FY 1999 Budget was prepared, the Administration created a
 funding reserve in the budget to cover these costs, and on March 3, 1998,
 the President requested funding for this purpose. The Administration
 strongly urges the Congress to provide emergency funding in the Defense
 appropriations bill to support the U.S. troops in Bosnia.

 Year 2000 Reserve Funds

         The"Administration appreciates the emphasis that the Committee has
 placed on Year 2000 (Y2K) computer conversion activities.  In the FY 1999
 Budget, the President requested $364 million for Y2K computer conversion.
 We recognize, however, that ensuring DoD compliance may require the
 flexibility to respond to unanticipated requirements. As such, we would
 intend to employ the contingent reserve set aside by the Committee only to
 the extent necessary, in order to ensure funds are available to address
 emerging needs.

         The Administration would strongly oppose efforts to strike the
 emergency contingency fund from this bill. The value of the emergency
 mechanism approved by the House Appropriations Committee is the
 flexibility it provides in the event that we determine that additional
 resources are required. We have only 557 days until January 1, 2000. We
 want to solve this problem as soon as possible.  By delaying approval of
 emergency funding and reopening the issue of the use of the emergency
 spending authority, the House will create controversy and delay. We hope
 the House will reconsider.                                 .

 Operation & Maintenance (O&M) Adjustments



          The Administration appreciates the CommitteeO,s emphasis on
 preserving military readiness by funding critical O&M programs.     Force
 readiness could be threatened, however, by the billO,s undistributed
 reductions to other O&M programs, such as civilian personnel pay, travel,
 and headquarters activities . . The PresidentO,s request is tightly
 constructed within the discretionary caps agreed to in the Bipartisan
 Budget Agreement. Any adjustments must be carefully evaluated to ensure
 that 000 has sufficient funding available for its operations and support
 programs.   The Administration is extremely concerned about reprogramming
 restrictions on O&M accounts that would hinder a field level commanderO,s
 abilities to meet emerging mission requirements.    Prior to final action
 on the bill, the Administration would like to work with the Congress to
 develop reprogramming guidelines that avoid restrictions that would impede
 commandersO, actions to maintain force readiness yet satisfy Congressional
 oversight responsibilities.

 Funding Levels

         The Committee bill funds unrequested programs at the expense of
 DoDFY 1999 requirements. Also, the Committee provides funds for programs
 that, due to higher priority military requirements, are not in the Future
 Years Defense Program (FYDP). These increases include $86 million for
 modifications and upgrades to B-2 bombers, $398 million for seven
 additional C-130J airlift aircraft, $60 million for two unrequested F-16
 fighter aircraft, and $120 million for National Guard and Reserve
 equipment.  Instead of funding these unrequested programs, the
 Administration urges the Committee to restore disruptive decreases for key
 000 modernization programs, including the following:

  $70 million 'decrease for the F-22 program, the $220 million decrease for
 the F/A-18E/F program, and the elimination of funding for the Aerostat
 program ($103 million);

 reduction for research and development funding of two. important Navy
 programs:  the next generation aircraft carrier (CVX-78) and the land
 attack destroyer (00-21).  The Committee would reduce aircraft carrier
 development by $90'million, a 47-percent decrease from the PresidentO,s
 request, and research funding for the 00-21 next-generation destroyer by
 $69 million, an 81-percent decrease from the President's budget.
 Reductions of this magnitude would jeopardize the NavyO,s ability to
 design new technologies, to deliver these new technologies on schedule,
 and to achieve life-cycle cost reductions -- a major goal of both
 programs;
  $59 million cut from the PresidentO,s request for Chemical Agents and
 Munitions Destruction. This reduction could delay a program that is on
 schedule to meet the obligations of the Chemical Weapons Convention;

 $5.5 million cut to the anti-personnel landmine alternative research and
 development (R&D) program (the Remote Anti-Armor Mine System) and the $9
 million .cut to the humanitarian de-mining R&D program; and,

 $10.9 million reduction made to the Global Combat Support System (GCSS).
 This system will provide technical systems, common technology, and shared
 data standards that are required for the 000. electronic commerce (EC)
 initiatives, a key reform objective.

 Theater High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD)

         The Administration urges the House to support the Ballistic


 Missile Defense OrganizationD,s request for Theater High-Altitude Area
 Defense (THAAD).  The THAAD program remains the DoDD,s most mature
 upper-tier missile defense program. Recent test failures indicate a need
 to restructure the program, but a complete review will be necessary before
 this can be accomplished. The Administration intends to work with the
 Congress on an appropriate funding profile.

 Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR)

          The Administration urges full funding of the FY 1999 request for
 the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program (CTR).   Furthermore, we oppose
 restrictions, imposed in the House authorization action (H.R. 3616) and
 approved by the Appropriations Committee, that prohibit the use of CTR
 funds for construction of a chemical weapons destruction facility in
 Russia.   These restrictions would institute a minimum one-year delay in
 the current project schedule, thereby slowing the construction of a safe,
 secure, and ecologically sound method of destroying these dangerous
 munitions.

 Commercial Operations and Support Savings Initiative (COSSI)

         The Committee has provided $62 million for COSSI, instead of the
 $103 million requested. This program inserts commercial technologies in
 existing defense systems, thus lowering support costs and increasing
 performance while enabling already fielded systems to modernize quickly.
 The Administration urges full support of this program.

 High Speed Networks

         The Committee makes a reduction of $34 million to networking
 research in the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency based on alleged
 duplication of effort. However, any overlap was removed in FY 1998 as a
 result of an interagency review mandated by Congress.   Accordingly, the
 Administration urges restoration of funding to ensure the security and
 survivability of future military networks and systems.                .

 Advanced Concept Technology Demonstrations (ACTDs)

         The Committee has cut the request for core ACTD funding by $35
 million, to $81 million. This program supports work on new and innovative
 defense system concepts, and it could provide the basis for systems
 yielding a decisive military edge over adversaries in the next century.
 The Committee's funding level for this program would not provide
 sufficient funds to support ongoing ACTDs and would preclude initiation of
 any new ACTDs in FY 1999. The Administration urges the Committee to fund
 the program at the requested level.
