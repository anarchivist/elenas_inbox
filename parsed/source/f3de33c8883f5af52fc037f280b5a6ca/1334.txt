 In our efforts to make your lives easier , improve our tracking of
 scheduling requests, and provide you with more time to conduct policy
 work, we have developed some new procedures regarding Presidential
 scheduling requests:

 Bruce Reed (after discussions with the relevant policy staffer if needed)
 decides to submit a scheduling request;

 Relevant policy staffer and Christa Robinson meet to discuss scheduling
 memOj

 Scheduling request is drafted by Christa Robinson;

 Relevant policy staffer reviews;

 Scheduling request is either approved or disapproved by Bruce Reed and
 Elena Kagan;

 Request is submitted;

 Christa Robinson tracks scheduling request at short-term scheduling
 meeting;

 Christa advises DPC if request has been approved or disapproved.
