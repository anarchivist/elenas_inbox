     INSERT FOR WEEKLY:


     On Sunday, the American Cancer Society will recommend that healthy women receive annual
     mammography screenings starting at age 40. This announcement will precede the now
     scheduled (but not public) final recommendation of the National Cancer Institute's National
     Cancer Advisory Board (NCAB) this Thursday.

     Today, NCAB secretly voted out a recommendation consistent with that of the American Cancer
     Society. This comes as somewhat of a surprise since they had previously recommended that
     women between 40 and 50 get mammography screening only in consultation with their
     physicians. The news out ofNCAB is good in the sense that there will not be two well-known
     bodies with conflicting recommendations.

     As currently planned, the NCAB will make its announcement by itself, i.e. not with any other
     Administration representative. However, Donna Shalala plans to concurrently release a written
     statement that she has modified our Medicare language in our balanced budget proposal to reflect
     this recommendation. (It should have a very small cost impact since Medicare covers very few
     disabled women between the age of 40 and 50). She also plans to release a letter to Medicaid
     Directors advising them that the Federal Government will match any Medicaid expansion of
     coverage in this area. Currently unresolved is the question about whether you would like to be
     involved with the HHS ~nnouncement.
