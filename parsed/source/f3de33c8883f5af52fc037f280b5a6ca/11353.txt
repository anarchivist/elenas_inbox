         ADVANCE For Release Wednesday, Feb. 24
         /ADVANCE/ CHICAGO, Feb. 24 /U.S. Newswire/ -- According to a new
     national survey, 80 percent of Americans believe that "in spite of
     its problems, the American justice system is the best in the
     world. " The survey also suggests that perceptions of some
     components of the system have improved over the past 20 years, when
     compared to a similar survey conducted in 1978.
         "Perceptions of the U.S. Justice System"    found that the root
     of this support seems to lie in the jury system, with 78 percent of
     respondents saying it is the fairest way to determine guilt or
     innocence. More than two-thirds -- or 69 percent -- believe that
     juries are the most important part of our justice system.
         The survey results will be presented at an American Bar
     Association (ABA) symposium, "Public Understanding and Perceptions
     of the American Justice System, " at the J.W. Marriott Hotel in
     Washington, D.C., Feb. 25-26.
         The survey asked respondents to rate their confidence in 17
     different institutions in American society, including particular
     components of the justice system, other professions and
     institutions, and the media.
         Respondents had the most confidence in the U.S. Supreme Court,


  with 50 percent "extremely or very confident"     in this
  institution. A similar (but not identical) Yankelovich survey
  conducted in 1978 found 36 percent of respondents expressing
  confidence in the Supreme Court. Thirty-four percent of respondents
  in the ABA survey expressed strong confidence in other federal
  courts, and 28 percent expressed strong confidence in state courts.
       In contrast, only 18 percent expressed strong confidence in the
  U.S. Congress, while 14 percent expressed strong confidence in
  lawyers. The media fared the worst, with strong confidence
  expressed by only 8 percent of the respondents, and slight or no
. confidence by 60 percent.
       Knowledge of the justice system comes primarily from social
  studies classes in grade school (83 percent) or high school civics
  or government class (82 percent), and personal experience (67
  percent). Sixty-one percent of respondents want to learn more about
  the justice system, and of those, 75 percent want to learn from
  current or retired judges.
       When asked to rate the importance of various sources of
  information, a majority -- 63 percent -- considered personal
  experience to be extremely or very important, followed by school or
  college courses at 59 percent. Fifty-seven percent of respondents
  cited serving on a jury as an extremely or very important source of
  information.
       Lower importance ratings of media as a source of information on
  the justice system parallel confidence levels in the media itself.
  Respondents rated the importance of television news at 41 percent,
  daily newspapers 36 percent, radio news 31 percent, Internet 23
  percent, televised trials 20 percent, magazines 16 percent,
  television court programs 11 percent, television dramas 9 percent,
  and movies/videos 7 percent. However, the higher the level of
  knowledge of the respondents, the less reliant they were on news
  media as a source of that knowledge.
       The survey results also indicate that people's knowledge of the
  justice system is quite uneven. Virtually all respondents (99
  percent) know that "anyone accused of a crime has the right to be
  represented in court by a lawyer, " and 96 percent know that "a
  defendant found 'not guilty' in a criminal trial can still be sued
  for money damages in a civil trial."   Yet more than a third of the
  respondents -- 37 percent -- believe incorrectly that a criminal
  defendant has to prove his or her innocence.
       When asked to identify the branches of government, only 39
  percent could identify all three unaided; 25 percent could not
  identify even one branch.
       The survey was commissioned by the American Bar Association, and
  conducted by M/A/R/C Research in Westchester, Ill. The survey
  sample consisted of 1,000 adults, age 18 or older, interviewed by
  telephone. The demographics of the sample closely match the profile
  of the United States population.
       Complete survey results will be available at

    The American Bar Association is the largest voluntary
professional association in the world. With more than 400,000
members, the ABA provides law school accreditation, continuing
legal education, information about the law, programs to assist
lawyers and judges in their work, and initiatives to improve the
legal system for the public.

symposium. ABA media credentials will be required and may be
