TEXT:
The Senate cloakroom this morning reports that Lott may still bring the
Cloning bill up today around 11:00am, despite clear objections from the
Democrats.   If the bill does come to the floor today, Members will debate
the motion to proceed, and likely file cloture, with a vote to occur on
Tuesday.   (The Senate is not in tomorrow.)  We'll aim to have our SAP in
place by Monday, in case we should need it.
