Subject:         CDC Initiative Funding

At your meeting with the DAD's last Wednesday (12/30), you said that Elena
Kagan wanted further clarification about the CDC Tobacco Funding ($27
million) and the general CDC Initiative funding ($60 million).    The
following text   (which has been cleared by Dan) provides additional
information on these two items, which you can forward to Jack and Elena.

please note two things:
 The current amount carried on the 12/30/98 Initiatives table for CDC is
less than the incremental increase for CDC in FY 2000.  Since we do not
have a specific program initiative that aligns exactly with the $60
million shown, we have listed all of the major increases for CDC that
people might want to highlight as initiatives;
The 12/30/98 BRD Initiatives table still includes a $15 million stub line
for tobacco education; we understood that this line was supposed to
disappear and the funding included in the CDC line.  We'll continue to
work with BRD to see that this happens.

CDC Tobacco: $27 million
The increased funding for FY 2000 is $27 million (36%) over FY 1999
enacted to support CDCD,s efforts to stop the increase in youth smoking.
The majority of this funding increase will be directed towards expanding
CDC state tobacco control grants (e.g., ASSIST).  Additional funds will
also support surveillance, research and policy coordination activities.

CDC Funding: $60 million
This dollar amount represents a portion of CDCD,s increased funding of
$173 million (on a comparable basis) over FY 1999 enacted'. Funding
increases, other than for tobacco, race and health, which are captured
elsewhere on the "Initiatives" table, include:

 +$65 million (47%) for a Public Health Surveillance Initiative to help


improve state and local health department sO, ability to rapidly detect an
infectious disease or foodborne disease outbreak, or bioterrorist
incident, and provide a communication bridge between state/local health
departments and the local medical community. The $25 million increment
for the emerging infectious disease initiative is within this increase;
  +$77 million (17%) for Childhood Immunizations to finish global polio
eradication efforts (+$17 million), continue measles eradication efforts
 (+$8 million), and to provide some of the newly recommended routine
immunizations such as rotavirus;
  +$12 million (6%) for the National Institute for Occupational Safety and
Health research;
  +$11 million (17%) for Violence Against Women research and.prevention
efforts;
  +$10 million (1.5%) for HIV Prevention activities

Please contact us if you have any further questions.
