 MEMORANDUM FOR ERSKINE BOWLES

 THROUGH:                             Jack Lew

  FROM:              Donald R. Arbuckle

  SUBJECT:                   Heads-up Consumer Confidence Rule

         EPA will issue by the statutory deadline of August 6th a final
 rule requiring all community drinking water systems to provide their
 customers with D&consumer confidenceD8 reports.   These reports must
 contain information on contaminant levels detected in the systemsD,
 drinking water, as well as on the EPA standards against which the detected
 levels are compared to determine if they pose a" health risk.  The reports
 must also contain various health warnings and information on the potential
 sources of detected contaminants.

          In this final rule, EPA has added a number of requirements in
 response to criticisms at the proposed stage by the environmental
 community. These changes include additional mandatory health warnings and
 a requirement to report the range of detection levels as well as the
 annual average (the average is generally used to determine compliance with
 the standards). We understand that environmental groups have held press
 conferences today (Tuesday) in more than 20 cities heralding the as yet
 unpublished final rule but describing it as weak, and urging states and
 local governments to go beyond the minimum requirements.

         We concluded review yesterday so that EPA could meet its statutory
 deadline.  The rule is a high priority of Administrator Browner who was
 personally involved in its development, and is tentatively scheduled as
 the subject for next SaturdayD,s radio address.
