TEXT:
If we were going to invite academics in for "new idea" meetings, who would
be on your list? I would start with someone like Ben Barber.

Also, the mystery of what the new USDA food safety mascot will be unveiled
at the food education event has been solved,      it is "Bac", a little green
figure that represents bacteria .... this was told to me in confidential
tones.
