TEXT:
FYI re attached, Cabinet affairs wants to be quite involved in the
interagency process of determining the federal commitment.  I think I can
manage this, but let me know if you think I should be more wary.   I think
you said Steve S. was in the meeting with you and Erskine and Harris the
other day.

You should also know that Harris wants to come to the f~rst interagency
meeting with Federal agencies (which is Tuesday morning).  I think this is
OK, too, but I made it clear to them that they aren't in charge of the
process -- i.e., they said they have some ideas they want to present for
the Federal commitment, but I told them they can't present ideas to the
assembled masses without us OK'ing them in advance.   They agreed to this.

I am putting time on your calendar to discuss where we are in advance of
Tuesday'S meeting.

Sounds good. How's 11 am, here in 160? Let's talk about Tuesday meeting,
who should come, what we want to achieve there, agenda, structure going
forward (should we meet weekly with agencies), request for paper and
ideas, should Wofford come? see you tomorrow. Let me know if 11 doesn't
work. Steve
