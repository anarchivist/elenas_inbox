TEXT:

Appropriations bill tomorrow around 11am.  please note: Potential
amendments are listed on the last page and include 1) sunsetting the tax
code: Sect. of Treas veto recommendation; & 2) transfer of satellites to
China: Senior advisors veto if amendment is included - need WW decision
(NSC feels strongly about seniors advisors veto).  Please provide
comments/clearance by lOam Tuesday. Thanks.

H.R. 4104 -- TREASURY AND GENERAL GOVERNMENT
                                 APPROPRIATIONS BILL, FY
1999
(Sponsors:  Stevens (R), Alaska; Campbell (R), Colorado)


        This Statement of Administration Policy provides the
AdministrationO,s views on S. 2312, the Treasury and General Government
Appropriations Bill, FY 1999, as reported by the Senate Appropriations
Committee.   Your consideration of the AdministrationO,s views would be
appreciated.

        The Administration appreciates efforts by the Committee to
accommodate the PresidentO,s priorities within the 302(b) allocation. The
President's FY 1999 Budget proposes levels of discretionary spending for
FY 1999 that conform to the Bipartisan Budget Agreement by making savings
in mandatory and other programs available to help finance this spending.
In the Transportation Equity Act, Congress -- on a broad, bipartisan basis
   took similar action in approving funding for surface transportation
programs paid for with mandatory offsets. We want to work with the
Congress on mutually agreeable mandatory and other offsets that would be
used to increase high priority discretionary programs, including those
funded by this bill.  In addition, we hope that the Senate will reduce
funding for lower priority and unrequested discretionary programs.

        Below is a discussion of our specific concerns with the
Committee-reported bill. We look forward to working with the Senate to
resolve these concerns as the bill moves forward.

Year 2000 Computer Conversion

        In the FY 1999 Budget, the President requested more than $1
billion for Year 2000 (Y2K) computer conversion.  In addition, the budget
anticipated that additional requirements would emerge over the course of
the year and included an allowance for emergencies and other unanticipated
needs.  It is essential to make Y2K funding available quickly and flexibly
as new needs arise. The Administration appreciates the Committee's action
to provide $3.25 billion in contingent emergency funding for this purpose.
 We urge Congress to leave as much as possible of the reserve unallocated
so that funds are available to address emerging needs.

Obligation Delays

        The Administration strongly objects to language in the Senate Committee
bill that would impose $592 million in obligation delays on Treasury
programs. These provisions would prevent expenditure of funds before


September 30, 1999, effectively reducing program levels for FY 1999 and
seriously hindering Treasury program operations.  For example:

 For the IRS, the obligation delay of $175 million for Tax Law Enforcement
would result in a six-percent reduction in personnel and a loss of
substantial tax collections. The $69 million obligation delay for
Information Systems would effectively halt IRSD, modernization efforts
until the following fiscal year, jeopardizing efforts to refocus the IRS
on providing good customer service for taxpayers.

 For Treasury Enforcement, the obligation delay of $28 million for
CustomsD, Salaries and Expenses would hinder CustomsD, efforts to combat
drug smuggling across the southern tier of the United States and to detect
shifts in trafficking patterns, and would inhibit maintenance of essential
equipment. The $23 million obligation delay against CustomsD, Operations
and Maintenance, Air and Marine Interdiction Programs account would lead
to a reduction in interdiction flight hours, cripple essential maintenance
for air and marine fleets, and result in a deterioration of air and marine
fleet assets.  The $14 million in obligation delays for the Secret Service
would cause unacceptable risks to Presidential safety.

Internal Revenue Service

        The Administration appreciates congressional support for IRS
information technology investments. However, the Administration urges the
Senate to adopt the $210 million for modernized information systems
provided in the House bill.

U.S. Customs Service

        The Administration is concerned about the funding level for
CustomsD, Automated Commercial Environment (ACE). Without major revisions                  o
to the existing system, Customs cannot keep up with increasing trade
volumes nor can it be responsive to the requirements stated in the 1993
Modernization Act and the needs articulated by industry. The Committee
has funded only $8 million of the requested $56 million level, and has
imposed an obligation delay against the $8 million provided, which would
cause the modernization effort to come to a halt. To accommodate the full
amount requested, the Administration has proposed funding the majority of
ACE requirements through a user fee paid by those who stand to benefit
most from this system, the trade community.

Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF)

        The Administration appreciates the efforts of the Committee to
fully fund the President's Youth Crime Gun Interdiction Initiative. This
initiative is an important part of the Administration's overall strategy
to curb youth gun violence.

        The Administration requests reconsideration of funding for the
Violent Crime Coordinator initiative, as the U.S. Attorneys have requested
additional ATF support for bringing cases involving violent crimina1s to
the Department of Justice for prosecution.

       We are concerned about the CommitteeD,s lack of support for ATF
headquarters relocation.

U.S. Secret Service

        The Administration is concerned that by redirecting $13 million to


Secret Service travel costs, the Committee has effectively undermined
other Secret Service funding needs, resulting in a probable deterioration
of critical equipment and an undermining of the Service staffing needed to
provide for the protection of the President and foreign dignitaries.

Law Enforcement Vehicles

        The Administration objects to the elimination of funding for
Treasury law enforcement vehicle replacement.  Replacement funds are
critical from a public safety perspective, as aging vehicles present an
inordinate risk to the lives of both Treasury personnel and the public.

Federal Law Enforcement Training Center

        The Administration urges the Senate to adopt the funding level for
the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) proposed by the
President.  In particular, the Committee makes no provisions for funding
of a dormitory for FLETC's Glynco campus. This dormitory is needed to
help FLETC absorb the increased law enforcement training needs of the
Immigration and Naturalization Service and the Bureau of Indian Affairs.

Unanticipated Needs

        The Committee bill fails to provide the requested $1 million to
enable the President to meet unanticipated needs in furtherance of the
national interest, security, or defense.  The Administration urges the
Senate to include this amount to ensure that the President has the same
ability to meet such needs as previous Presidents have had.

Pay Raise for Federal Judges and Senior Executives

        The Administration is disappointed that the bill includes a
proposal to eliminate the 1999 pay raise for Federal judges and employees
paid under the Executive Schedule. Failure to provide pay raises for
senior executives is eroding the value of their pay and causing severe pay
compression in the executive ranks.  Pay adjustments have been made for
such individuals only once in the last five years.  If continued, this
failure will affect the Government's ability to attract and retain the
executive talent that it needs. We urge the House to restore the pay
raise for Federal judges and employees paid under the Executive Schedule.

Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP)

        The Administration appreciates the support the Committee has
provided for drug control efforts in general, and for ONDCP in
particular.  The Administration encourages the Senate to provide the full
amount requested for ONDCP's Special Forfeiture Fund, especially the
national youth anti-drug media campaign. The Senate could fully fund the
budget request for the media campaign by reducing amounts earmarked by the
Committee for unrequested ONDCP programs. The Administration opposes bill
language that would bar funding for:  new ads, Internet programming, joint
efforts with the entertainment industry, partnerships with community and
other organizations, and evaluation of the effectiveness of the media
campaign. Unless the Senate rectifies these problems, our efforts to meet
the targets established in ONDCPO,s performance measures would be
negatively affected.

Federal Buildings Fund

       The Administration is pleased that the Committee has provided $14


million for the design of a new Department of Transportation
Headquarters.  Providing for a Government-owned building would save
taxpayers appL'oximately $190 million, in present value terms, compared to
the cost of entering into a lease.

         The Committee bill would delay the availability of funding until
September 30, 1999, for the repair and alterations program ($324 million),
rental of space program ($52 million),   and building operations program
($31 million). The Administration is concerned that a delay in
obligations would essentially eliminate the FY 1999 basic repairs and
alterations program, which provides for emergency repairs and ensures the
operational continuity of facilities.

        The Administration is also concerned that the Committee bill
provides over $500 million for 15 unrequested Federal courthouse
construction projects.

Morris K. Udall Foundation

        The Administration is concerned about the lack of funding for the
Morris K. Udall Scholarship and Excellence in National Environmental
Policy Foundation, particularly the lack of funding for the U.S. Institute
for Environmental Conflict Resolution, as authorized in PL 105-156. The
Administration believes that the Institute would provide valuable
assessment, mediation, and training services to Federal agencies to
resolve environmental disputes, thus reducing expenses due to lengthy
litigation costs.

Federal Election Commission

        The Administration urges the Senate to fully fund the Federal
Election Commission (FEC) at the level requested by the President and
provided by the House, $36.5 million.

Paperwork Reduction Act and Congressional Review Act

        The Administration shares the CommitteeD,s interest in improving
the implementation of the Congressional Review Act and the Paperwork
Reduction Act.  However, we have concerns with several provisions of the
Committee bill. We would like to work with the Committee to resolve these
outstanding issues.

Language Provisions

 The Administration strongly objects to section 117 of the Committee
bill. This provision would undermine the authority of the President to
use assets of countries under economic sanctions pursuant to the Trading
with the Enemy Act or the International Economic Powers Act as leverage
when economic sanctions are used to modify the behavior of a foreign
state, or are used in negotiations with that state in an effort to
normalize relations.

 The Administration objects to language tying obligation of funds for
Customs automation modernization improvements to GAO certification to
Congress that measures have been established "to enforce compliance with
the architecture." The Administration has no control over the nature or
timing of any prospective GAO review and certification.

 The Administration is concerned that section 115 of the Treasury General
Provisions could limit the Secretary's discretion in determining how best


to stimulate increased electronic tax filing, which reduces IRS errors,
permits more timely refunds to taxpayers, and lowers IRS tax processing
costs.

 The Administration supports the Joint Financial Management Improvement
Program and urges the Senate to include language in Title VI that was
included in the House Committee-reported version of the bill that would
provide up to $3 million from Government-wide credit card rebates in
support of that program.

 There are several provisions in the bill that purport to require
congressional approval before Executive Branch execution of aspects of the
bill. The Administration will interpret such provisions to require
notification only, since any other interpretation would contradict the
Supreme Court ruling in INS vs. Chadha.

Potential Amendments

 It is our understanding that an amendment may be offered to the bill that
would repeal the current tax code effective December 31, 2002 and require
Congress to pass legislation establishing a new tax system by July 4,
2002.  It would not be responsible for Congress to enact legislation to
terminate the tax code without having already provided a reform plan to
replace it. Many families, for example, would refrain from buying homes
because of the uncertain tax treatment of mortgage interest and property
taxes (as well as other State and local taxes).  Many businesses would
hire fewer workers and make fewer capital investments because of
uncertainties in how taxes would affect the return on productive assets.
Furthermore, the uncertainty of the size of future receipts would raise
the specter of increased Federal deficits which in turn would raise
interest rates and weaken or destroy economic growth. The Secretary of
the Treasury has stated that he would recommend to the President that he
veto this bill if it contains this amendment.

 The transfer of commercial satellites from the Commerce Commodity list to
the munitions list will adversely impact the u.S. satellite manufacturing
industry with no benefit for national security. The current system for
licensing communications satellites contains a more robust national
security review process than was previously in place under the State
Department system. If the amendment proposed would be contained in the
final bill sent to the President, his senior advisors would recommend that
he veto the bill. [Need decision on veto level - NSC feels strongly about
senior advisors veto.]
