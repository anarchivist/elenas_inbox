TEXT:
I wanted to make you aware, that tomorrow, the National Women's Law Center
will send a letter to the EEOC asking that guidance be issued to employers
stating that not providing contraceptive coverage would be a violation
under Title VII. According to the EEOC, it will take a couple of months
before they determine whether they should issue such guidance.  If EEOC
were to find in favor of the Law Center's analysis, EPICC would still be
necessary (for the 14 million or so in firms under 15, and the 16 million
or so whose insurance is not provided by their employer) However, Lowey's
office and the other choice groups are not pleased with the Law Center's
timing since EPICC is on track to be introduced tomorrow (press conf. at
11:00 in Senate Swamp)

Upshot -- Know about the NWLC letter in case we get questions. While the
NWLC strategy is not ideal, I think we can work with it.
