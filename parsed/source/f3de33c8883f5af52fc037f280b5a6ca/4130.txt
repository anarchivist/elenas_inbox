TEXT:
As I think you know, DC has written HHS a letter arguing that HHS's
approval of DC's welfare waiver should not have been rescinded, because DC
did in fact meet the public notice requirements.  HHS has sent us its
draft response for our comment, and would like any comment asap. HHS's
draft concludes that the arguments in DC's letter don't work, and the
waiver is still invalid.

The draft seems good to me and I am prepared to sign off , but given the
weird history here I wondered whether you want to take a look at the
response yourself. Do you?
