This draft concerns the treatment of the territorial areas in the
President's recently-announced initiatives that would not automatically
apply to the areas. It suggests ways of treating them in the case of a few


initiatives and explains why they would not apply in others. ==================== AT

Q's and A's on the application ofthe President's national Initiatives to the territories


Q. Will the President's proposal to adequately fund Medicare end the unequal treatment of
Puerto Rico in in-patient hospital services payment rates?

A. In 1997, the Administration initiated two measures to treat Puerto Rico more equally in
Medicare hospital services rates. One changed the formula in the law based 25% on the rates
applicable elsewhere in the country and 75% on local costs to 50% of the national rates and 50%
local costs. The other changed the regulation that provides the wage index that is a major factor
in the calculation oflocal costs. Each measure increased Medicare hospital payments in Puerto
Rico [close to $25 million] in 1998 with commensincreases in succeeding years.

The President's proposal to adequately fund Medicare would use funds obtained by taxation from
residents of the States -- but not residents of territories -- to supplement the Medicare tax (which
Puerto Ricans pay). However, the proposal will include changing the rate formula to base it 67%
on national rates and 33% on local costs.


Q. Will the President's proposal to reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act end
its unequal treatment of Puerto Rico?

A. The limitations on Puerto Rico's funding are a result of Puerto Rico's historically low per
pupil expenditures as well as the special formula for the islands. Even under the formula, Puerto
Rico, which has a population less than that of half the States, receives more funds than all but
eight States although it does not contribute the revenue which funds the programs. Applying the
national formula would increase Puerto Rico's share of the funding to a percentage greater than
all but three States.                                                               .

Puerto Rico's treatment is equitable in that the islands do not contribute to program costs, but we
will consider any other specific proposals its representatives may wish to make concerning
reauthorization.


Q. Will the President's proposal to enable disabled workers to buy into Medicaid apply to the
territories?

A. Medicaid is capped in the territories. In 1997, the President proposed annual increases in the
cap through FY02. The Congress essentially approved the significant first year increase but not
those proposed for subsequent years in spite of strong efforts by the Administration. At the same
time, it created a new area of unequal treatment of the territories in health care programs in acting
on the President's proposal to ensure health care insurance for needy children. It provided them
one-sixth of the share proposed by the Administration. Providing more equitable treatment in the
new Children's Health Insurance program has been our health care funding priority since then.
Last year, we obtained a quadrupling of the funding for the territories for FY99.
                               Hex-Dwnp Conversion

The President's FYOO budget again proposes continuing this over the longer tenn.

The proposal to enable disabled workers to buy into Medicaid will exempt such buy-ins from the
cap to enable the proposal to apply to disabled workers in the territories.


Q. Will the proposed increase in the cigarette tax apply to the territories?

A. The purpose of the proposal is to discourage health damaging and budgetarily costly cigarette
use, especially among teenagers, and generate revenue for programs that incur those costs.

We should discourage health damaging and budgetarily costly smoking, especially among teens
in the territories as well as the States. The territories are covered by the programs that would be
funded by the tax. The territories should be treated equally in this proposal.


Q..Will the proposal to increase Empowerment Zones funding include the territories?

A. The territories have not been eligible to be Empowennent Zones because, in tenns of taxes --
a major aspect of Empowennent Zone benefits, they have been super empowennent zones, with
tax incentives for investment greater than those that apply in Empowennent Zones. These
incentives are Sections 936 and 30A -- which provide tax credits based on income attributed to
territories and based on wages, capital improvements, and local tax payments in Puerto Rico
respectively. With the repeal of these incentives effective in full as of 2006, there will not be the
rationale for not enabling the territories to be eliible for Empowennent Zones designation. The
Administration is proposing to extend Section 30A beyond 2005 but the Congress has not
accepted our Sec. 30A extension proposals twice already.

We, will, therefore, propose Empowennent Zone eligibility for the territories as the Secs. 936
and 30A benefits end.


Q. Will the proposal to provide additional relief to Caribbean and Central American areas
devastated by recent hurricanes include additional aid for Puerto Rico, which endured its worst
disaster in 70 years?

A. We are already providing special assistance for the recovery of Puerto Rico. The President's
commitment is to be with Puerto Ricans every step of the way to full recovery. Some of the
measures will be outlined in a long-tenn recovery plan prepared by a presidential task force --
one of the few times such an effort has ever been undertaken -- to be released shortly.

We will address needs that cannot be met through existing appropriations in our legislative
proposal for additional relief.

     Q. Will the President's proposal to increase the national minimum wage apply to the Northern
     Mariana Islands and American Samoa?

     A. It would phase in coverage of the Northern Marianas consistent with the Administration's bill
     on the issue.

     The minimum wage law includes a special process for determining wage rates in Samoa,which
     is very underdeveloped economically -- much less developed, for example, than the Marianas.
     There is some concern that the committee process for developing wages in Samoa to the national
     level is not accomplishing its purpose. We are going to work with Delegate Faleomavaega and
     Governor Sunia to ensure the intent of the law is being met and wages are increasing adequately.


     Q. Will the President's proposal to obtain traditional trade negotiating authority include
     provisions to provide a role for the territories, which do not vote for President or have votes in
     the Congress, on agreements that substantially affect them?

     A. The territories do not have votes in: the selection of the President, who negotiates trade
     agreements: the Senate, which approves treaties; or the Congress, which approves
     implementation legislation. They are also treated differently than the States in many trade laws
     and substantially affected by trade agreements, especially those with their Caribbean and Pacific
     regional neighbors. But it is important part of our constitutional system that the United States as
     a country speaks with one voice -- that of the President -- in dealing with other countries.

     Still, the Administration will explore ways of increasing consultation with the unrepresented
     territories in trade matters that would substantially affect them consistent with preserving other
     national interests.


     Q. Will the President's proposal to support the rights of workers apply to the tens of thousands
     offoreign workers in the Northern Mariana Islands, who are paidfar less than the national
     minimum wage and who have been abused by employers to a shocking extent?

     A. The Administration has proposed phasing immigration and minimum wage laws into the
     islands, consistent with the agreement they made when joining the U.S. family. This would
     eliminate the unique problem in the islands. We have also taken a number of initiatives to
     increase Federal enforcement of the rights that do apply, including increasing the access of the
     workers to Federal enforcement personnel specially detailed to the islands. These measures are
     detailed in a report released last month by our interagency task force.

     We will also include measures to ensure the rights of workers in the Northern Marianas in our
     proposal.

    Q. What will the Administration do to make up for many of the benefits of the President's
    initiatives not applying in Puerto Rico because they are provided by tax credits? Some examples
    are the Welfare to Work Tax Credit expansion, the expanded Child and Dependent Care Tax
    Credit, the Long-term Care Credit, the Stay at Home Credit, the Disabled Workers Credit, the
    Workplace Education Credit, and the New Markets Credit.

    A. The tax code exempts Puerto Ricans from having to pay tax on local source income. They pay
    a locally-determined tax to the insular government instead. The benefits of the President's
    initiatives would only be appropriate to apply to the extent Puerto Ricans paid the underlying tax.


    Q. What will the Administration do to make up for the revenue that the Virgin Islands and Guam,
    which already face major deficits, will lose because the tax credits the President has proposed
    would automatically apply in the islands since their income taxes are a 'mirror' of Federal rates
    by Federal law?

    A. Guam and the Virgin Islands have the authority to enact local taxes to make up the revenue.
    The social and economic benefits of the President's initiatives should apply to these U.S. citizens
    as well as to the citizens of the States.
