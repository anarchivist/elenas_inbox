TEXT:
VA has a demonstration project that would allow them to sell 30
properties, keep 90 percent of the proceeds, and give the remaining 10
percent to the homeless.   Currently, the homeless receive property, not
cash, through the McKinney Act process.    Both the House and Senate
Veterans committees have included their own versions of this VA
proposal.    While the homeless groups prefer to receive property not cash,
there are a few reasons why we should let this demonstration go forward.
First, the Veterans Committees on the Hill are very favorable on this
proposal.   (In fact, both the House and the Senate have already introduced
their own versions of this and we would like to replace the Hill version
with the Administration version).   Second, VA, unlike most other agencies,
does give property to the homeless through other programs.   In fact, VA
has conveyed more properties to homeless groups than the entire government
in the past 12 years.

HUD, while initially objecting to this proposal, has agreed to it on the
condition that a more broad-based GSA proposal to reform the Property Act
include the homeless groups "right of first refusal" to receive actual
property.   I am working to make sure that happens.

However, Reps. LaFalce, Vento, and Frank (all of the House Banking
Committee) have written a letter, expressing their support for the
homeless groups to maintain a "right of first refusal" to receive surplus
government property.  Legislative Affairs is checking whether these
congresspeople would be OK to let us send up the VA demo because we will
preserve the right of homeless groups to receive property in the broader
proposal.
