The New Hampshire Governors Office, after having meetings with our advance
staff, has renewed its concern that the New Hampshire message has too much
of a tax message. They are spooked - given the hyper sensitivity to tax
issues in New Hampshire - and are telling me they may want to have her
step out of the event.  I don't think it would get to that point, but it
does underscore how sensitive they are about this.  I have assured them
that we are sensitive and will do everything we can to prepare this event
to focus on health care issues, not tax policy.

    Chris, the COS to Gov Shaheen called me after your conversation with their
    policy folks regarding the President's trip to New Hampshire. They very
    much appreciate your reaching out to them - but have some issues and
    concerns they have asked me to bring to your attention.

    As you know, they originally wanted us to emphasize the small business
    health insurance issue but understand that it is too "small" for our
    purposes and that we are looking to do something broader in health
    care/long term care. Their strong concern is that we do not slide into a
    tax cut message. Taxes is a very volatile issue in the state and for the
    Governor. As you may know, New Hampshire is, for the first time,
    considering the first state wide tax. She is very anxious that we avoid
    the tax issue and focus as much as possible on the health care side of the
    issue.

    Thnaks.
