TEXT:
In an article on the possible budget surplus in the Sunday NY Times, Peter
Passell reported:

"Mr. Clinton has already proposed to invest a chunk of the prospective
surplus in day care services, while House Speaker Newt Gingrich is
appealing to conservative Republicans with calls for 'at least a small tax
cut every year' when the budget is in the black."

Should we try to clear this up for the press?
