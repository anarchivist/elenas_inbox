   FYI -- the chronology of the Administration's position on the child
   custody
   bill in the 105th Congress was as follows:

   June 24, 1998 - Justice letter (the one that is being circulated for
   clearance)
   was sent to the House Judiciary Committee. The letter opposed the bill as
   drafted.

   July 8, 1998 - Chief-of-Staff Bowles sends a letter to Sen. Leahy on the
   Senate
   version of the bill strongly opposing the legislation.

   July 14, 1998 - SAP noting that if the bill fails to address the
   Administration's concerns, the President's senior advisers would recommend
   that
   he veto it.

   Last year's bill passed the House 276-150, but went no further in the
   Senate.

   Subject: Justice letter on Child Custody Bill

   You will shortly receive via fax Justice's proposed letter for tomorrow
   morning's markup of HR 1218, the Child Custody Protection Act.   This
   legislation would make it illegal to transport minors across state lines
   to
   obtain an abortion in order to circumvent parental consent laws.

   The Justice letter opposes the legislation and attaches its letter from
   last
   year on HR 3682, an almost identical bill from 105th Congress.

   Comments are due at 5:30 p.m.
