TEXT:
The DPC Working Group has two executive orders ready for review, one on
Indian education and one on Indian youth.  The working group members from
Interior, Education, and HHS have asked for a DPC position on whether we
should go ahead with the executive orders. On the one hand, the orders do
not do as much substantively as we would like; on the other hand, the
Native American groups feel that the orders would indicate a strong
statement of Administration concern for Indian issues.  Can we all sit
down for a few minutes to make sure we are on the same page on this? Let
me know. Thanks, Mary
