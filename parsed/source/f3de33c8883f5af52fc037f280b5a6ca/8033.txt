TEXT:
In trying to accomodate the VP's wishes for this event and press
deadlines, Ann Lewis and Jen Palmieri are proposing that we let the VP
make the policy announcements for this event. Jen P. believes the
President will be fine with this.  If we are okay, they will pose this to
POTUS and VP.  Please let me know what you think.

Background:
The VP's office scheduled the program to be as follows:
VP welcomes
Roundtable takes place
VP concludes roundtable
All 4 principals make formal remarks at podium, ending w/ POTUS.

We had proposed that the President make remarks at the top of the
roundtable (following the VP's formal introduction) and keep the rest of
the program the same including closing remarks.  This is important b/c not
only should POTUS make our announcements up front to give them more
meaning and to help frame the event, but b/c by the end of the 3 hour
event it will be 4pm and past press filing time.  The VP's office was
going to pose this to the VP, but Ann and Jen thought it might just as
easily solve our press problem if the VP make the announcements in his
welcoming statement.

(I still stick w/ our original suggestion to simply add POTUS to the
beginning of the roundtable, but I won't fight it if you all don't care.
This is the way we normally do it, these are Presidential announcements,
and I think it's strange to have him there for over 2 hours and not make
remarks till the end.)
