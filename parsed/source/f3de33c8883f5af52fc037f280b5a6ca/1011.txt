Subject:         Technicals to welfare bill; please look at this today

House Ways and Means has a draft technicals bill for welfare reform that
they want to drop on Thursday. Olivia has been asked to testify on it on
Thursday.  I met with HHS and OMB today on this, and the following are
some highlighted issues.

HHS feels strongly that our best opportunity to influence Shaw's bill is
now, before it is introduced. Therefore, we went over these items with an
eye toward identifying any issues we should raise in the next day or two
to House Democrats and quietly suggest that we will make a big stink if
they don't do what we want.

1. HHS doesn't want to highlight, in testimony or otherwise, our proposed
new fixes on how the work requirements apply to state-only programs; or
the child support issue.  They say it's not technical, they already
mentioned it in testimony last week, it's too complicated, etc.  Ken
agreed with them, but I told them we want them in.  They will probably
call Bruce or Elena to appeal.

2. The Shaw bill includes two items that could be seen as weakening work
requirements, but they are pretty minor.  They are (1) allowing 2-parent
families to share the 35-hour work requirement between them; and (2)
holding the number of hours of work required for teen parents flat at 20
hours, rather than allowing the hours to increase as with adults.  Bruce:
what do you think of these? The first one seems innocuous to me; Ken told
HHS he was fine with them. So the onus is on us to complain about this.
Tarplin points out that these won't be put under a spotlight since the
Republicans are proposing them (unless the press does so) .



3. There are 3-4 changes that would significantly weaken the MOE
requirements.   These are the ones Ken wants to complain about
immediately.   T.hey would do things like let states count child support
payments passed through to families toward MOE; and let states spend TANF
money on juvenile justice facilities, which is something HHS outlawed
under AFDC/EA.

The states like these and probably fought hard to get them included.   I
assume DPC would agree with OMB on these.

 4.   Others:

They would let states transfer up to 10% of their TANF money to Title XX
without having to transfer money to child care.  Ken wants to continue to
oppose this.  Does DPC have a dog in this fight?

Our Cuban/Haitian fix is not in their package.

Our religious affiliated providers/charitable choice fix (pushed by DOJ)
is not in their package.  HHS doesn't care about this, because they think
it isn't worth it.  Haskins is very firm on this.

 I may be missing a few items one way or the other; and will let you know
 if I find anything else.
