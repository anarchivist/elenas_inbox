TEXT:
On Friday, Sept. 6th, I circulated (under LRM#5484) Education
talking points on the Gallegly amendment compromise that may be
included in the immigration conference report.  A draft version of
the talking points was given to some Hill staff on Friday with a
promise that we would get them any revisions today, Monday, Sept.
9th.
Please provide any comments or your sign-off ASAP.
Thanks
