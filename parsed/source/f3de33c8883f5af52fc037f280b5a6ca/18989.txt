TEXT:
Scott Ballin from the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids called today asking
if the President could give a statement to be read at their press
conference with farmers and public health groups announcing their core
principles. There are no members invited.   I'll drop off the Campaign's
draft release for the press conference. Attached is a draft statement.

I've talked to Ford and. Robb's offices, as well as OPL and USDA who are
fine with doing it.  I also talked to the NC Farm Bureau which didn't sign
on. The Farm Bureau wasn't really against the coalition and principles,
and wouldn't be unhappy if we gave a general statement of support. They
didn't sign on because they think the principles should include immunity
and they are worried that the public health groups may end up in a
different place then farmers so they "don't want to get in bed now."

The main objection I can think of might be from Lugar (the principles come
out in favor of continuing a tobacco program, he doesn't).   But the
statement I've attached would just applaud the coalition for working
together and trying to get a bill, I don't think we need to say more than
that.  I talked about it with Tarplin and he thought the attached
statement would be fine.==================== ATTACHMENT    1 ====================

                                 DRAFT
             STATEMENT OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
                              MARCH 16, 1998



         I congratulate representatives of public health and tobacco producer organiz~tions for
their work in promoting effective legislation to reduce disease caused by tobacco products and
protect American farmers and their communities. Their efforts are a step in the right direction
towards enacting bipartisan, comprehensive tobacco legislation. I am firmly committed that
tobacco legislation protect farmers and their communities, and have made this commitment one
of the five key elements that I will insist upon before signing tobacco control legislation. I hope
you will continue your efforts to expand your coalition and to enact comprehensive tobacco
legislation this year.
