TEXT:
Maayor Finkbeiner and several members of his team on the Jeep location
issue would like to meet with NEC on February 21.  I told the mayor we
would respond promptly to his request for a meeting.  The meeting would be
introductory and might involve some identification of potential issues.
Please advise
