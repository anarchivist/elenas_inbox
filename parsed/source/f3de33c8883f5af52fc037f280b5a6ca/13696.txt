TEXT:
The House and Senate are scheduled to begin conference tomorrow on
their respective versions of omnibus parks and public lands bills.
The Snow Basin land exchange is part of the package, and that
provision still includes the broad override of environmental law
and numerous other features that severely hamper USDA's land
management authority.
You'll recall that the Snow Basin bill involves a transfer of some
USFS land near Ogden, Utah, to a private owner to assist in
development of a Salt Lake City winter olympic venue.
The USDA report on the bill notes that the Administrations
"strongly opposes" the Snow Basin provision.
I have not been lobbied hard by any of the environmental groups on
this issue, and I really don't know whether they will get aroused
as the conference proceeds. This is a very local issue, but like
all overrides of federal law has national implications. I am
concerned that we're facing another "sufficiency" situation which
seems somewhat innocuous, but may come back to haunt us.
As veterans of the sufficiency battles, do you have an opinion on
whether we should take a harder line?
Shall we discuss?
