MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:         Bruce Reed
              Elena Kagan

RE:           DPC Weekly Report



        Tobacco -- Senate Commerce Committee Activity: Erskine, Larry, and Bruce met
with Senator McCain on Monday to discuss our views on a comprehensive tobacco bill.
McCain said that he was pleased with our efforts to cooperate and work with the Commerce
Committee as it moves forward in crafting a bill that we can support, and he appreciated that he
was not reading reports of our conversations in the press. We have held several long
conversations this week with McCain, Hollings, and other key Senate staff regarding FDA
authority -- particularly on the issue of whether there should be a separate FDA title governing
tobacco products or whether they should be regulated as a device, as we would prefer. On
Wednesday, McCain and Hollings convened a bipartisan group of members and charged them
with working with us to resolve this issue (Hatch, Jeffords, Kennedy and Conrad). We have not
yet persuaded them that creating a new tobacco title is undesirable, but we will continue to work
on this. McCain still plans to begin marking up a bill on March 25th.
                                                              ,
        Tobacco -- State by State Num'bers: On Monday, the Vice President will speak to the
PTA and unveil new Treasury Department statistics demonstrating that every state will have a
significant reduction in youth smoking under your tobacco plan. This is a follow up to the
numbers you announced in February demonstrating that your plan will prevent 3 million teens
from starting smoking over the next five years and will prevent one million premature deaths
nationwide. We also plan to give these new state-by-state numbers to the Attorneys General and
encourage them to make similar announcements in their states to promote the idea that
comprehensive, bipartisan tobacco legislation is needed at the federal level to reduce teen
smoking.

       Education -- Coverdell vote in the Senate: The Coverdell bill is stalled in the
Senate, at least temporarily. Democrats have defeated a cloture motion, because of their
frustration at the Majority Leader's decision to bar many of their amendments from
consideration. If a compromise is worked' out, Democrats will proceed with our plan to
our school modernization proposal as a substitute. While many in the education
                                                                       Hex-Dump Conversion

community are working hard to gain support for this, we expect it will be defeated on a
party-line vote. If that happens, the Democrats do not have enough votes to sustain a
filibuster, and we therefore expect Coverdell to pass. However,. we do appear to have a
firm 38 votes to sustain a veto.

        Education -- National Tests and Ending Social Promotion: In our recent education.
strategy memo we indicated that House Democrats might include a provision to bar the use
of tests for high stakes purposes in legislation they would propose to authorize the tests.
You asked how we would square that with your advocacy for an end to social promotions.
A ban on using the high stakes test would clearly conflict with your message about ending
social promotion. If such a provision were added to a test authorization bill, we would
recommend that you indicate support for the overall biJI without, if possible, taking a
position on specific provisions. If a such a bill made it to conference, we would not expect
to see a similar provision from the Senate, and would work to help the Senate provision
prevail. As a practical matter, states and school districts would be very unlikely to use the
tests for high stakes purposes in the foreseeable future, in large part because the failure
rate would be too high. For example, 40% of all 4th graders fail to meet the NAEP basic
level of performance (which NAEP considers below "passing"). This figure would be
significantly higher in every one of the 15 big city districts that have signed up for the test.
Chicago uses the Iowa Test of Basic Skills for its "no social promotion" policy, a test with
much less demanding content standards--and it hold students back at the third grade level
only if they are performing at below the 2nd grade level.

        Education -- Teacher Training Provisions in the.Higher Education Act Mark-Up:
The House Education and Economic Opportunity Committee marked up the Higher
Education Act this week. In doing so, they rejected your teacher training proposal, which
would have created partnerships between high poverty school districts and institutions of
higher education to recruit and prepare teachers. Instead, they included a much smaller
provision (approximately $18 million per year) to provide grants to Governors to address a
range of teacher preparation issues (such as raising certification standards and helping to
provide alternative certification procedures) for teachers. While there is nothing
objectionable about the activities in Mr. Goodling's proposal, it is considerably smaller and
less focused than yours. Further, it funds these activities by eliminating federal support
for the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards. We have been working with
Gov. Hunt and the National Board staff on a strategy to reverse this action, including
through a strong demonstration of bipartisan gubernatorial support for the Board. We
believe we have a better chance of reversing the Committee's action in the Senate than on
the House floor, and wiJI work to strengthen the bill when the Senate Education and Labor
Committee marks it up in the next several weeks.

       Political Reform -- Free Television Time: This week we achieved a small but
important victory by convincing Senate Republicans to remove language from the Supplemental
Appropriations bill that would prohibit the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) from


                                              2
                                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion

establishing a system of free television time for candidates for federal office. Unfortunately,
Republicans are already preparing similar language to place into the IMF Supplemental or into
the Commerce, State, Justice Appropriations bill.
         Senator McCain remains the key to a settlement. Legislative Affairs is meeting with his
staff this week to discuss possible compromises, including delaying the timing of the rulemaking
and in the meantime ask the FCC begin a Notice ofInquiry (N0l) until the completion of the
work later this year of your Advisory Committee on Public Interest Obligations of Digital
Television Broadcasters.

        Community Empowerment -- Brownfields: This week the Vice President announced
the 16 winners of EPA's $28 million Brownfields Showcase Communities program. The
selectees were Baltimore, MD, Chicago, IL, Dallas; TX, East Palo Alto, CA, Southest Florida,
Glen Cove, NY, Kansas City, KS;' and MO, Los Angeles, CA, Lowe1\., MA, Portland, OR, the
State of Rhode Island, St. Paul, MN, Salt Lake City, UT, Seattle, WA, Stamford, CT, and
Trenton, NJ. This program was extremely popular, over 231 communities submitted applicants.
 Therefore we are exploring the possibility of funding a second round.

        Disability Issues -- Legislative Action: There was action on the Hill in the past week
on the disability community's two highest priorities. We are sorting out whether the
Administration will be able to support these initiatives, in full or in part. First, the House held a
hearing on how to allow more people with disabilities to live in their communities instead of
nursing homes. Disability advocates, led by the group ADAPT, are pushing legislation known
as CASA. Advocates do not expect CASA to become law because of its cost ($10-20 billion per
year), but they hope it will start a dialogue on the subject. HHS witnesses testified that we have
concerns about the cost, but said we are pushing to achieve the goals of the legislation through
demonstrations and other more modest steps. Speaker Gingrich testified in favor of this
concept, although without endorsing CASA itself. The disability community is disappointed
that we have not been more supportive. We have proposed that you send a letter to Speaker
Gingrich describing what progress HHS has made and stating your agreement with the
legislation's goals, but OMB has expressed reservations about such a letter.

       Crime -- Probation Study -- Late Sunday, the Department of Justice will release the first
national representative survey of the U.S.'s 3.2 million probationers. Specifically, the survey
found that:. Other key findings of the survey are:

       -- More than half of all probationers were under the influence of alcohol or illegal drugs
       at the time of their criminal offense. Fully 40% were under the influence of alcohol
       when they committed the offense for which they were sentenced, and 14% were on drugs.

       -- Almost 70% of probationers reported past drug use, 32% during the month of their
       arrest. Overall, 67% had used marijuana, 31 % crack or other forms of cocaine, 25%
       stimulants, 20% hallucinogens, 15% barbiturates, and 8% heroin or other opiates.



                                                 3
                                                                           Automated Records Management System
                                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion         .

              -- Almost ha]f of all probationers reported having been tested for drug use while on their
              current probation sentence. This rose to 65% among those who had used drugs during
              the month before their offense and to 74% among those who committed their offense to
              obtain drug money.

              -- About 17% of all probationers reported participating in a drug treatment program
              during their sentence to probation, but those percentages rose as the severity of their prior
              drug use increased. More than half -- or 52% -- of probationers who reported being on
              drugs when arrested had participated in a drug treatment program.

              -- On various other issues: 64% had driven a car while drunk or ~rugged; 50% had been
              involved in a domestic dispute while drunk or high; and 35% had consumed as much as a
              fifth of a gallon of alcohol in one day.

            Crime -- COPS: On March 26, the COPS Office will announce $58 million in hiring
    grants tb 285 police departments to fund approximately 900 additional officers. This
    announcement will put the total number of officers funded through the COPS Program to over
    72,000:

             Drugs -- Conference on Drug Treatment for Offenders: Next week, ONDCP, HHS,
    and the Justice Department will hold a three-day conference on drug treatment in the criminal
    justice system. The conference will explore effective drug treatment services, obstacles to their
    adoption, and gaps in scientific knowledge on drug addiction. The Attorney General will unveil
    a new legislative proposal -- developed pursuant to your January 12, 1998 directive -- to allow
    states to use their Federal prison construction and substance abuse treatment funds to provide a
    full range of drug testing, treatment, and sanctions for offendets under criminal justice
    supervision.

            Welfare Reform -- Impact on Public Housing: This week, in response to a request
    from the House Appropriations Committee, HUD sent a report to the Hill on the potential
    budgetary impact of welfare reform on the public housing program. Because public
    housing residents pay a portion of their income towards rent, with the remaining rent costs
    subsidized by the federal government, changes in family income levels do have federal budgetary
    impacts. The HUD study provides a preliminary forecast of how increases or decreases in
    family income as a result of welfare reform could affect rent revenues at eight public housing
    authorities in California, Ohio, Texas, and Virginia. Depending upon the assumptions used,
    HUD forecasts that welfare reform could increase or decrease annual rent revenue for these eight
    housing authorities by a total of + $5.2 million to - $3.9 million. This equates to a 36% increase
    or 27% decrease in total rent revenues from welfare recipients. The report finds that the impact
    will vary depending on the employment prospects of welfare recipients in these areas, as well as
    each area's public housing rent and welfare policies.

                                                                            Hex-Dump Conversion

             Health Care -- Meeting with Congressman Norwood: On Thursday, Larry Stein and
     Chris Jennings had a very positive meeting with Congressman Norwood, the Republican House
     sponsor of the patients' rights legislation. We agreed that because of the limited number of
     working days left in this Congress, we would like to pass a final bill by July or no later than the
     August recess. We also agreed that the House had to move first to pass a bill to create the
     momentum to push the unmotivated Senate into action. Congressman Norwood believes there
     is strong bipartisan support in the House to pass this legislation and will work with us to that end.
      With regard to policy, there are two things worth noting. First, Mr. Norwood and his bipartisan
     cosponsors will continue to advocate for a remedies provision to enforce these patient provisions
     (which they believe is imperative to maintain the strong support of consumers and the American
     Medical Association). Second, he indicated that while he and his Republican colleagues agree
     with the consumer protections we have advocated, they adamantly oppose mandating "body part"
     coverage requirements. He concluded the meeting by informing us that he greatly appreciated
     our visit and our willingness to offer technical assistance throughout the legislative process.

             Health Care -- Approval of Ohio, New York, and California's Children's Health
     Plans: On Friday, HHS announced the approval of Ohio' s children's health program. Also,
     next week the time runs out for HHS's approval for the state children's health plans for New
     York and California. California's proposal has relatively few outstanding issues. Because this
     program is non-controversial and because of its size, we may want to highlight its approval at the
     White House, possibly with the Vice President participating in your absence. Also in the next
     week, HHS will make a decision on whether or not to approve New York's children's health
     proposal. New York's application has more controversial provisions which potentially will lead
     to either a disapproval of the state's plan or a contentious approval. Specifically, New York
     continues to rely on a provider tax that was subject to the line-item veto last year but was recently
     overturned. In addition, New York is trying to collect Federal dollars for children's health
     retroactively and is not adequately responding to the Administration's request that Federal dollars
     not substitute for health insurance currently covered by the private sector. Because New York
     often raises controversies, we are doubtful that it would be worthwhile to announce their plan
     even if it is approved.

             Health Care -- Update on Regulation of Controlled Substances and Impact on
     Terminally III. We met this week with representatives of the Catholic Health Association
     (CHA) to discuss options to respond to the Justice Department's likely ruling on Federal
     oversight over controlled substances. As you know, Justice is expected to conclude that
     current law cannot support DEA's desire to declare that "delivering, dispensing or
     prescribing a controlled substance with the intent of assisting a suicide would not be under
     any current definition a legitimate medical purpose." CHA informed us that
     Congressman Hyde and Senator Hatch are planning to introduce legislation providing
     DEA with the necessary legal authority immediately after the expected Justice Department
     ruling. They also advised us that the Republicans might well charge that the
     Department's ruling proves that we are weak on the assisted suicide issue. Finally, they
     reiterated their strong desire to avoid a big public fight over this issue because of their fear


                                                      5
                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion

that it will further discourage physicians from appropriately prescribing pain killing
medicines for the terminally ill.

        Keeping their comments in mind, we are recommending that we strive to delay the
expected release of the Justice Department's ruling until we develop a roll out strategy that
is designed to: (1) reiterate our strong opposition to assisted suicide: (2) to support a
legislative fix that gives DEA the authority it seeks while incorporating language that
assures the medical and consumer community we have no intention of undermining the
appropriate use of controlled substances for the terminally ill; and (3) to implement a
substantive process with the medical, r~ligious, ethics, and patients' rights communities
that invests them in the development of the necessary, but extremely complicated language
that achieves the appropriate balance. We have not yet determined whether it would be
advisable to risk giving Hyde and Hatch a heads up on our strategy in an attempt to get
them invested in and supportive of our approach.

         Health Care -- Whistleblower Protection and Democrats Patients' Bill of Rights:
On Thursday, Mr. Gephardt directed Mr. Dingell to include "whistleblower" protections
in the Democratic Leadership's version of the patients' rights legislation. Mr. Gephardt's
office inaccurately suggested that his interest in including this provision exactly mirrored
that of the White House. Despite his strong labor ties, Mr. Dingell has stated that he
strongly believes that this provision could undermine the bill's chances, since its inclusion
would likely serve to sever the otherwise strong support the bill would receive from "Blue
Dog" Democrats like Stenholm, Tanner, and Barry. Mr. Dingell feels so strongly about
this issue that he is reconsidering whether he wants to still be the lead sponsor in the
House. (Such an outcome could be devastating to our chances of passing a bill.)
Although most Democrats (the White House, Dingell, Daschle, and Kennedy) are
sympathetic to and supportive of the whistleblower concept, we fear it could weigh down
the chances of a bill passing a bill this year. It has already been the primary cause of the
delay in introducing this bill. Early next week, we will work with Congressman Dingell
l!-nd the Blue Dogs -- one more time -- to determine if compromise language, acceptable to
