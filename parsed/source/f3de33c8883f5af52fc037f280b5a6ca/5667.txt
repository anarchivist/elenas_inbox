TEXT:
For 21st Century Learning Center program, OMB uses the following numbers
(from DOE) :

$40,000/yr per site
$800/yr per child

So, for the 2 options in the OMB memo:

(1) $60 million increase in FY99 (100 million total), 1,500 additional
sites would be reached and 75,000 additional school-age children served;
and

(2) $160 million increase in FY99 (200 million total), 4,000 addtiional
sites would be reached and 200,000 additional school-age children served.

Also, one additional question from OMB reo Early Learning Fund. For OMB's
options memo, they included, per your discussion with Barbara, $400
million per year. Did you anticipate that to be phased up in the out
years?
