TEXT:
randy from justice just told me· that the state of ca sent justice a letter
asking for its legal opinion on whether the "ineligible legal alien provisions
take effect immediately". randy says his incliniation was to answer by saying
that the justice dept only gives legal advice to its client, the fed gov't. this
sounds absolutely right.  elena--can you get a copy of the letter and talk to
randy? wilson is looking for a place to lay blame. we should be smart about
this.
