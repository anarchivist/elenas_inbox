TEXT:
Folks--due to unforseeable demands I have been requested to go on the trip
to Las Vegas tomorrow--the meeting with the AILA lawyers'   executive board
is important--I am asking if anyone of you could do the meeting for 45
minutes it would be greatly appreciated--truth be told they prefer to
meet with the policy shops (little knowing that OPL in fact has a voice in
the policy process thanks to you all)--please look at your schedules--if
one of you could please just meet with these folks and listen, I would be
eternally grateful (at least until one of you needs a favor).   please talk
to Miriam Vogel in my office---thanks.
