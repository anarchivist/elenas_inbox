     TEXT:
     AMA's Board of Trustees quietly released to selected Members of Congress
     today a new study reviewing the scientific literature on abortion and
     making 5 recommendations.

     The following are highlights.

     *       AMA reaffirms current policy regarding abortion:  the early
     termination of pregnancy is a medical matter between the patient and
     physician subject to the physician's clinical judgement, the patient's
     informed consent.

     *       The term 'partial birth abortion' is not a medical term and won't
     be used by the AMA. They will use the term "intact dilatation and
     extraction. "

     *       According to the scientific literature, there does not appear to
     be any identified situation in which intact D&X is the only appropriate
     procedure to induce abortion, and ethical concerns have been raised about
     intact D&X The D&X procedure not be used unless alternative procedures
     pose materially greater risk to the woman.  The physician must, however,
     retain the discretion to make that judgement, acting within standards of
     good medical practice and in the best interest of the patient.

     *       The viability of the fetus and the time when viability is
     achieved may vary with each pregnancy.

     *          That abortions not be performed in the third trimester except in


cases of serious fetal anomalies incompatible with life. Although
third-trimester abortions can be performed to preserve the life or health
of the mother, they are, in fact, generally not necessary for those
purposes. Except in extraordinary circumstances, maternal health factors
which demand termination of the pregnancy can be accommodated without
sacrifice of the fetus, and the near certainty of the independent
viabiltiy of the fetus argues for ending the pregnancy by appropriate
delivery/

*       The AMA will work with ACOG, AAP to develop clinical guidelines
for induced abortions after the 22nd week of gestation.

*       AMA urges CDC and state health dept to develop expanded, ongoing
data surveillance systems of induced abortions.

*       AMA will work with appropriate medical specialty societies,
government agencies, private foundation, and other interested groups to
educate the public regarding pregnancy prevention strategies.
