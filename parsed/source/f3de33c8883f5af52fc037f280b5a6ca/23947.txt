TEXT:
Heads Up -
The House Judiciary Committee is scheduled to markup HR 1852 tomorrow.
This bill expands in a very narrowly defined category of cases - mass tort
litigation arising from a "single event or occurence."

Last Congress, HR 1252 - The Judicial Reform Act - included an identical
prOVlSlon. The 3/10198 Justice letter on H.R. 1252 stated that "we would
consider supporting such a provision separate from this legislation."

Justice expects to submit a short letter to OMB for clearance supporting
HR 1852 for quick clearance (in time for transmittal before tomorrow's
lOam markup) .
