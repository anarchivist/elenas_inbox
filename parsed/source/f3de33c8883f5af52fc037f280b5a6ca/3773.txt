TEXT:
Friday evening we discussed getting some polling data that could help with
the Hispanic testing issue and the Goodling battle. Here are my
sugg.estions:

1. Would you like to know how well your child is doing in reading in
English at the 4th grade and math at the 8th grade compared with national
standards of excellence?

2. Would you like to know how well your local school is doing in reading
in English at the 4th grade and math at the 8th grade compared with
national standards of excellence?


3. Should the U.S. Congress prohibit your local school or state from
having the opportunity to give a 4th grade national reading test and an
8th grade national math test, in order to tell if students are meeting
national standards of excellence?

4. For students who have immigrated to the U.S. within the last (3
years? 2 years?), should they have the opportunity to show how well they
can read in their native language, such as Spanish, as well as in English,
since they haven't had the chance to learn English well?


I don't know if Penn usually does or can provide breakdowns by subgroups,
but it would be great to see breakdowns by urban/suburban/rural; parents
of school-age kids (and maybe grandparents); Hispanic, African-American,
White; and something like fundamentalist Christians.

It will be especially helpful to see how Hispanics react to the last
questions, and if white Americans care much one way or the other.  It will
also be helpful to see how fundamentalilst Christians respond to the first
three--it would be helpful if we can pass around some data that shows that
even that group thinks the schools should have a right to use the test.
