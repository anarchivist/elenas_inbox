TEXT:
This is the event Q&A with an additional Q&A on the juvie bill. We may
want to change the A on the Louima question depending on the senior staff
reaction to the case in the morning.  (It's kind of hard to get a sense of
how these things are playing out at this time of night ... )

Thanks.

                               Questions and Answers
                                    June 9,1999


Q:   Instead of simply collecting data, why didn't the President ban racial profiling
     outright?

A:   As the President said today, racial profiling is wrong. Stopping or searching
     individuals on the basis of race is not consistent with our commitment to equal justice
     under law and is not effective law enforcement policy. But in order to really take on the
     problem of racial profiling, it is critical that we have the hard facts -- instead of mere
     anecdotes -- about when and where it occurs. Having"hard data can help guide future
     proposals to combat this problem. That is why the President the ordered the federal
     agencies take leadership on this issue and start to collect and report data on the race,
     ethnicity and gender of persons stopped and searched by federal law enforcement agents.

     Once the agencies have collected and reported on the data for a year, we will review their
     recommendations on how we can expand and make permanent such data collection
     systems as well as ensure greater fairness in federal law enforcement's procedures.

Q:   Do you have any comment on the Louima decision yesterday?

A:   We are please with yesterday's decision. It sends a strong signal to abusive and
     corrupt cops that illegal behavior and excessive use of force will not be tolerated.

     The vast majority of law enforcement do their jobs fairly and with honor -- which is
     why it is important for us to support these dedicated officers and acknowledge our
     gratitude to them for their service. But as a society, we must continue to send the
     message that we will not ~olerate those officers who breach the public's trust by
     abusing their positions of authority. Yesterday's jury decision clearly conveyed this
     message.


Q:   In March, the President announced new initiatives to help build trust between police
     and the communities they serve. What is the status of these initiatives?

A:   These initiatives are part ofthe 21st Century crime bill unveiled by the President
     last month. During consideration of the juvenile crime bill, the Senate missed an
     important opportunity to move forward on these important police integrity
     proposals. On a party line vote, the Senate defeated an amendment by Senator
     Biden to authorize these and other policing initiatives proposed by the President.
     We will continue to urge the Congress to pass our police integrity proposals and
     21st Century Policing Initiative as part ofthe appropriations process.

                                                                      Automated Records Management System
                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion
     the President's directive?

A:   While the President's directive is meant to combat racial profiling by instructing the
     federal law enforcement agencies to collect and report data, the Conyers legislation
     seeks to encourage state and local law enforcement agencies (who comprise the vast
     majority of law enforcement in this country) to collect and report similar data on
     traffic stops. The Conyers legislation also requires the collection of additional data
     not specifically called for in the President's directive, such as the age and
     immigration status of the driver pulled over for a traffic stop. The data collected
     under both the President's directive as well as the Conyers bill will give us a better
     national picture and understanding about different kinds of law enforcement stops
     and searches, and the individuals who are subjected to them.

     Additionally, while we announced our overall support for the Conyers legislation,
     the Administration supports some modest, but important revisions to the bill to
     ensure that the data collected for the study is used for research purposes only -- and
     cannot be used in future lawsuits against police departments.


Q:   Your directive refers to the creation of "field tests" to begin to collect data. Does
     this mean that the federal agencies don't have to cover all of the law enforcement
     agencies under their control? Can they exclude whole sub-agencies such as INS or
     Customs from the data collection directive?

A:   The directive grants some discretion to the agencies in deciding the exact scope of
     their data collection and reporting systems. And while we do not expect all federal
     law enforcement agencies to be initially covered, we certainly expect agencies such
     as the Immigration and Naturalization Service, Drug Enforcement Agency, and
     Customs Service -- all of which conduct stops and searches of individuals as a
     matter of course -- to be part of the first "field tests" implemented by the agencies.


Q:   Can you comment on the status of the Diallo case?

A:   The FBI, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York and the Justice
     Department's Civil Rights Division continue to work closely and actively with the Bronx
     District Attorney's Office on this investigation. However, given that this is still an active
     investigation, we cannot say anything more.


Q:   What is the Administration's response to the juvenile crime/gun bill unveiled by
     Republicans last night?


                                                                       Automated Records Management System
                                                                       Hex-Dump Conversion
     how Republicans in the House intend to proceed with juvenile crime and gun legislation.
     After pleading for more time to allow the Judiciary Committee to work its will, they are
     now planning to bring a partisan bill directly to the floor, with little or no opportunity for
     Democrats to debate the issues and offer amendments. Whatever you think about the
     substance of the Senate-passed bill, at least Senators had an open and serious debate on a
     wide range of issues. It doesn't seem like that will be the case in the House.

     But even more disturbing IS the fact that -- instead of taking the opportunity to improve
     upon the Senate-passed bill-- House Republicans have stamped it with the NRA's seal of
     approval. Their bill will not cover many events at which hundreds of guns are sold. It
     will not necessarily cover unlicensed sellers who walk around at gun shows with "for
     sale" signs on their backs. It will weaken Brady background checks at gun shows. And
     it will make it more difficult for law enforcement to trace many of the guns that are sold
     at gun shows and later used in crimes. We oppose this "Lautenberg Lite" version of the
     bill, and will work to amend the bill when it reaches the House floor.
