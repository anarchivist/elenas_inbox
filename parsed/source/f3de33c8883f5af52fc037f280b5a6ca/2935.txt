TEXT:
I had a good conversation with Ron about WTW.  He says he's fine with this
program as long as we're in the WH, but Shaw may send (but not publicize)
a letter to Alexis and/or me making clear that the intent here is to
promote work, not CETA, and that we're not trying to snooker them into a
program that pays people $8 an hour to rake leaves. Since that probably
is the intent of most of our allies, a quiet colloquy to that effect isn't
the end of the world.
