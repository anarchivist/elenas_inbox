TEXT:
OMB has scheduled their review of the civil rights crosscut with Frank
Raines for 10 am Wednesday room 248.

They've also invited PIR. OMB thinks PIR will ask for more resources for
Title VI enforcement and police brutality.

They just gave me their new review of the civil rights budget which I'll
bring by.
