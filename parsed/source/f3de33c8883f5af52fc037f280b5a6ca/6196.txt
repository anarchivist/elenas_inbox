TEXT:
Two items:

1.      I heard from a Senate staffer who attended a briefing Jack Lew
did on the budget tOday that Jack described our proposed tobacco budget as
a "floor."  I have been saying it is neither a floor or ceiling. it is the
amount experts tell us is necessary to reach the youth targets.

2.      At a meeting yesterday you said our budget contains the same
$26B over 5 years for states that was in the 6/20 deal ($4 - $4.5 - $4.5 -
$6.5 - $6.5).  Presenting this fact will provide groups a number to
subtract from the "other uses" and highlight that there may not be the $$
they hoped for for tobacco control or growers.  On the other hand
providing the number may be reassuring to the states.  Your call.   I
wanted to make sure you focused on it.
