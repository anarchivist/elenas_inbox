TEXT:
Elena asked about the Dingell food safety bill and why he was offering a
separate bill instead of the Administration bill, sponsored by Eschoo.
One of the main reasons Dingell offered the bill was to provide a method
for paying for the President's food safety initiative. Dingell has
proposed authorizing FDA to collect a user fee on imported food which
would raise approximately $50 million. (Of the Administration's $96
million food safety initiative for USDA and FDA, we received only $16.8
million in the House full committee and only $2.6 million in the Senate
full committee.  FDA received $7 million in the House and nothing in the
Senate. )

USTR is very adamant that because the user fees were only against imports
and not domestic foods, they would violate the GATT. Therefore, OMB is
not sending comments on the bill because of the trade problem.  In the
event that we actually do comment on the bill, OMB will circulate the
comments.

Here are some of the main provisions of the bill:

1.      Import Inspection User Fees. The Dingell bill authorizes FDA to
collect a user fee of $20 per line item of imported food.

2.      Country of Origin Labeling. The Dingell bill mandates
country-of-origin labeling of imported food subject to FDA regulation at
the point such food is offered for retail sale.

3.      Refusal of imports. One of the main differences between the Dingell
bill and the Administration bill is that the Dingell bill mandates the
refusal of imports if a country does not allow FDA inspections. Our bill
ensures that FDA halts imports of fruits, vegetables, and other food
products from any foreign country with food safety systems that do not
provide the same level .of protection required for U. S. products. Our bill
only permits FDA to consider the refusal of inspections as one factor in
deciding whether to halt imports.
