TOBACCO FARMERS LEGISLATION INCLUDED IN MCCAIN BILL

Senators Ford, Frist, and Hollings, the three members ofthe Senate Commerce Committee from
tobacco-growing states, joined together to include a broad-based fanner package in the McCain
comprehensive tobacco legislation. The package includes a buy-out for quota holders at $8 per
pound as well as maintaining a government production-control program for those who continue
to grow tobacco. It also provides assistance to tobacco-producing communities. This package
would cost $2.1 billion per year for the first ten years and $500 million for years 11-25 for a total
of $28.5 billion. This package incorporates some changes in the flue-cured program, as
advocated by Senator Robb, such as transferring quotas from inactive quota holders to actual
producers. The Domestic Policy Council, along with representatives of USDA, have met with
farmers' groups from Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia,. Tennessee, Georgia,
and Florida. For the most part, tobacco fanners are very pleased with the proposal included in
the McCain legislation. Senator Lugar had proposed a buy-out program for $8 per pound which
would discontinue any kind of tobacco-support program, leaving the crop in a free market. By
and large, farmers have opposed Senator Lugar's proposal. Today Secretary Glickman is
holding a town hall meeting with tobacco farmers in Lexington, Kentucky. Governor Patton,
along with Lt. Governor Henry, Congressman Baesler, and DPC staff are also in attendance.

Note: Ifwe hold this item for a few hours, Tom can call in with a reaction from the town
hall meeting.
