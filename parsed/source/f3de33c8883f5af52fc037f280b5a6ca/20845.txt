         AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT ANNIVERSARY EVENT


                     DATE:           July 29, 1998
                     LOCATION: Roosevelt Room
                     TIME:           1:15-1 :30 pm
                     FROM:           Minyon Moore, Bruce Reed, and Gene Sperling


I.    PURPOSE

      To sign an Executive Memorandum directing federal agencies to increase public outreach
                           and education about important requirements within the Americans
                           with Disabilities Act and the Medicaid buy-in option within the
                           Balanced Budget Act of 1997 _ This event is also an opportunity to
                           commemorate the 8th anniversary of the historic Americans with
                           Disabilities Act, which was signed into law on July 26, 1990, and
                           to further your commitment to the Task Force on Employment of
                           Adults with Disabilities that you created this spring.

II.   BACKGROUND

      While the Americans with Disabilities Act makes it possible for millions of Americans to
      participate more fully in society and to do their part to create a stronger and better nation,
      the unemployment rate among the 30 million working-age adults with disabilities
      continues to be significantly higher than that of the general population. That is why on
      March 13, 1998, you signed an executive order establishing the Task Force on
      Employment of People with Disabilities. With Secretary Herman serving as Chair and
      Tony Coelho serving as Vice-Chair, the Task Force is charged with recommending
      policies to help increase the employment rate of adults with disabilities. Next
      November, the Task Force will issue its first formal report. However, it has already
      identified actions that you will take by issuing an Executive Memorandum at this event to
      immediately begin to reduce barriers to work.

      You will sign an Executive Memorandum directing relevant agencies to take
      appropriate actions to expand public education and outreach about regulations
      within the ADA and the Medicaid buy-in option within the Balanced Budget Act of
      1997. Specifically, you will:
                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion


       ·      Direct the Attorney General, the Chair of the Equal Employment Opportunity
              Commission, and the Administrator of the Small Business Administration to
              expand public education about the requirements of the Americans with
              Disabilities Act of 1990 to employers, employees, and others whose rights may be
              affected. In particular, you are asking them to focus their attention to reaching
              small businesses and under-served populations.

       ·      Direct the Secretary Shalala to inform Governors, State Legislators, State
              Medicaid Directors, consumer organizations, and others about the new Medicaid
              buy-in option enacted as part of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. This new
              option provides Medicaid coverage for individuals with disabilities who, because
              of their earnings, would not qualify for Medicaid under current law.

       You will also be announcing your strong commitment to working with Senator Kennedy
       and Senator Jeffords to pass affordable feasible legislation that helps people with
       disabilities maintain their health care coverage and return to work. First, this
       legislation would extend Medicare for people with disabilities who return to work,
       eliminating a current law provision which often leads people with disabilities to
       have to choose between work and health insurance. Last year's Balanced Budget
       Act included a provision to allow people with disabilities below 250 percent of
       poverty to buy into the Medicaid program. This legislation eliminates the 250
       percent income threshold and gives states resources and bonuses for taking up the
       Me~icaid return to work option.
