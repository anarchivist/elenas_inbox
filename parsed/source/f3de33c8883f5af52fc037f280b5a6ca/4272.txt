Subject:         Senate Block Grant Amendment Passed

The Senate narrowly passed (51-49) Senator Gorton's block grant amendment,
after a "hold-harmless" provision was added for States.  Education is
doing a quick analysis to figure out exactly which programs are affected
-- we know that several of the big ones were exempt. Apparently Lott
decided to make this a Leadership issue. We'll know more shortly. This
is like 1995 revisited.
