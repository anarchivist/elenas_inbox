     Subject: Challenge to Clinton's Executive Order

     From Family Research Council's CultureFacts Newsletter, July 1, 1998:

     A Challenge to Clinton

     House Republicans will challenge President Clinton's executive
     order adding sexual orientation to existing affirmative action
     mandates in the federal civil service (see CF Vol. 1, No 18,
     June 3, 1998). When the House returns after the July recess,
     Rep. Joel Hefley (R-CO) will sponsor a floor amendment to the
     Treasury Postal Appropriations bill to prohibit federal funds
     from being used to enforce it. Along with GOP Reps. Tom Delay
      (TX) , Robert Aderholt (AL) and John Hostettler (IN), Hefley
     circulated a "Dear Colleague" letter calling for support for
     the amendment.     Shortly afterward, GOP Reps. Chris Shays
     (CT) , Connie Morella (MD) , Nancy Johnson (CT), and openly
     homosexual Rep. Jim Kolbe (AZ) responded with a "Dear
     Colleague" letter opposing the amendment.
