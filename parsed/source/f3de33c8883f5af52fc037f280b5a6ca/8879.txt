Why don't you circulate this to make sure you hit everyone needed. Note,
I added the words in the civilian workforce to the last paragraph to make
sure it isn't overbroad.

                    POSSIBLE STATEMENT REGARDING HEFLEY AMENDMENT
                           IN THE EVENT OF AN ADVERSE RESULT

         Today, the Republican House of Representatives voted to overturn Executive Order 13087. The
Order provides a uniform policy for the Federal Government to prohibit discrimination based on sexual
orientation in the federal civilian workforce.

        I am deeply disappointed that the House of Representatives has taken action that legitimizes
government sponsored discrimination against its own citizens based on their sexual orientation. The
American people believe in fairness, not discrimination, and I am confident they will reject this unseemly
and unjust action by the House.

         It has always been the practice of this Administration to prohibit employment discrimination based
on sexual orientation in the federal civilian workforce. Most federal agencies and department have taken
actions to memorialize that policy. The Executive Order does no more than make that policy uniform
across the federal government. It does not authorize affirmative action, or preferences, or special rights
for anyone.

         The Executive Order reflects this Administration's firm commitment that the federal government
make employment related decisions in the civilian workforce based on individual ability and not on sexual
orientation. I assure each and every American that the Republicans in Congress cannot and will not
force this Administration to discriminate.

       Today, the House of Representatives defeated a Republican attempt to overturn Executive Order
13087. The Order provides a uniform policy for the Federal Government to prohibit discrimination based
on sexual orientation in the federal civilian workforce.

         I am gratified by the House vote. The American people believe in fairness, not discrimination,
and they reject efforts like this one that would have legitimized government sponsored discrimination
against its own citizens based on their sexual orientation .
