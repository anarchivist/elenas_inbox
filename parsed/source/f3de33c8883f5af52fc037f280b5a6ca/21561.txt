TEXT:
Attached is a draft veto message for this bill, which may be received at
the White House -- and vetoed -- as soon as today. The principal basis
for the veto is the bill's "Mexico City" abortion provision.  The draft
veto message is based on input from State and NSC.
Because of the possibility of Presidential action on this bill as soon as
today, please give me any comments on the draft veto message by 6:00
today. Thank you.

        I am returning without my approval H.R. 1757, the "Foreign Affairs Reform and

Restructuring Act of 1998". I take this action for several reasons, most importantly, because this

legislation includes unacceptable restrictions on international family planning programs.

        Current law, with which Administration policy is fully consistent, already prohibits the

use of Federal funds to pay for abortion abroad and for lobbying on abortion issues. This bill

would go beyond those limits. One provision would deny U.S. government funding for family

planning programs carried out by foreign nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) that use their

own funds to perform abortions even though the overall result of these NGO family planning

programs is to reduce the incidence of abortion. Although the bill allows the President to waive

this restriction, use of the waiver would also cripple many programs by limiting annual spending

for international family planning to $356 million, $44 million below the amount available for

Fiscal Year 1998.

        A second provision would attempt to restrict the free speech of foreign NGOs by

prohibiting funding for those that use their own funds to engage in any activity intended to alter

the laws of a foreign country either to promote or to deter abortion. The bill would even ban

drafting and distributing material or public statements on abortion. No waiver is provided for

this restriction.

        These restrictions and the funding limit would severely jeopardize the ability of the

United States to meet the growing demand for family planning and other critical health services

in developing countries. By denying funding to organizations that offer a wide range of safe and

effective family planning services, the bill would increase unwanted pregnancies and lead to


                                                             Automated Records Management System

       I am also deeply concerned that this legislation ties unacceptable restrictions on

international family planning to payment oflegitimate U.S. arrears to the United Nations and

other international organizations. There are strongly held beliefs on both ides of the debate over

international population policy, and issues associated with this debate should be decided on their

own merit.

       Congressional insistence on this linkage, and thus its failure to pay U.S. arrears,

undermines U.S. leadership and ability to achieve far reaching reforms at the United Nations.

       The package authorizing arrears payments linked to UN reforms was the result of good

faith negotiations between the Administration and Congress more than a year and a half ago.

Unfortunately, due to the passage of time, some of these conditions are now outdated and are no

longer achievable. While many of the UN reform benchmarks in the package remain acceptable,

significant revisions are required, and we look forward to working with Congress next year to

win the payment of our arrears and an achievable package of UN reforms.

       H.R. 1757 also contains a number of provisions that raise serious constitutional concerns.

These proyisions include section 1809 that instructs U.S. representatives to the International

Atomic Energy Agency as to positions that they must take on programs and projects in Cuba,

section 1228 requiring denial of visas to certain classes of Haitians, and a part of section 1812

regarding U.S. policy on Jerusalem.

       While the legislation contains important and carefully negotiated authority to reorganize

the foreign affairs agencies and other basic authorities for the State Department, these important

provisions have been included in the Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY 1999,

       For these reasons, I am compelled to return H.R. 1757 without my approval.
