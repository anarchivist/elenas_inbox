    Subject:         Tuttle condolence letter

    Here is a draft of a condolence letter from the President to Bill Tuttle's
    widow.   Will the letter be released tOo the press?

    I have background material on Tuttle which I can fax to you if you give me
    your fax number.   You may also want to note that Bill and Gloria Tuttle
    and Joe Garagiola met with the President at the White House on March 20,
    1996. The background materials say that the President, at an East Room
    ceremony, commended the Tuttles and the NSTEP team for their efforts to
    send a positive message to America's youth -- through baseball -- about
    the dangers of smokeless tobacco.
