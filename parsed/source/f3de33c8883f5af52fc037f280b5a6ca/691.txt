        Subject:         NGA Talkers on Benefits to Immigrants


        We have developed some talking points comparing the NGA proposal relating
        to benefits to immigrants with the AdministrationD,s proposal.   The NGA
        has made significant proposals in this area, though different from our
        proposal in a number of ways.  The talking points below could be
        incorporated into other talking points being developed for anyone meeting
        with NGA or working on their proposal.

        Talkers:


        NGA DRAFT PROPOSAL ON BENEFITS TO LEGAL IMMIGRANTS

        The NGA and the President share a common concern regarding the impact the
        welfare billD,s benefit ban will have on low income legal immigrants,
        especially the disabled and refugees. The main difference between the
        proposals is that the President targets cash and medical assistance to
        current and future disabled legal immigrants while the NGA would provide
        cash, some medical and food assistance only to legal immigrants currently
        in the country.  In addition, although they approach the problem
        differently, both proposals address the special needs of refugees.

        By banning legal immigrants from participating in the SSI, Medicaid, Food
        Stamps and other major assistance programs, the welfare bill inherently
        shifts the cost of supporting disadvantaged legal immigrants to the
        States. The NGA and the PresidentD,s proposals each would address this
        concern, albeit in different ways.   Preliminary estimates indicates that
        the proposals have a similar budgetary impact and would provide a
        significant restoration of benefits.

        The NGA would continue to provide SSI and Food Stamps to all elderly and
        disabled immigrants currently in the country.  However, no assistance
        would be available for future low income immigrants who suffer a
        disability or develop an unexpected illness.  The PresidentD,s proposal
        provides'greater long term support for disabled immigrants, including
        children, and ensures their access to health care. The proposal would


continue SSI and Medicaid eligibility for disabled immigrants, including
the disabled elderly, for all current and future immigrants.

Governors should be urged to voice their concerns with the Congress about
the impact of the benefit ban on legal immigrants and refugees in the
States.  Some on the Hill are considering a block grant to provide
assistance to those States with large immigrant populations losing
benefits under the welfare law. While we are pleased that the Congress is
starting to consider fixes in this area, States and immigrants would be
better served by a reinstatement of federal cash, food and medical
assistance than they would by a small capped block grant.
