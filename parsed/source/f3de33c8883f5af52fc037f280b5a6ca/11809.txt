TEXT:
OPL has tentatively scheduled hate crimes as an event on Friday, April 2
or the radio address for Saturday the 3rd. The idea was to get religious
leaders' support over the Easter weekend.  We would prefer, however, to
have it as a radio address because other than supporting the legislation,
we probably won't have much to announce in terms of policy. We're trying
to work with Justice to come up with something.
