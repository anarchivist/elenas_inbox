TEXT:
I don't feel strongly on OMB; you and I had earlier talked about bringing
them in at a later point because they are likely to be skeptical.  But I
generally think theY're so useful and tend to add to the conversation.   So
I guess let's invite them. But is the them just Mac Reed, or also someone
from the program world? (Apfel is the most obvious candidate, though from
the SSA perspective he may not like this.)

                    P6/(b)(6)                 I my instinct is to invite
omb, but if you think i'm wrong, let me know how come.
