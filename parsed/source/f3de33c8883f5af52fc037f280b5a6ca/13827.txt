TEXT:
As follow up to this afternoons meeting, I have a few comments.
please let me know what you think.
1. Given where we are right now in terms of our ability to
answer questions that we can be sure we will be asked, I agree
with Ray that we are not ready to make an announcement tomorrow.
2.   I know we have consulted with some enviros and Congressional
staff. Jen 0 is doing consultations with labor. Are there other
key stakeholders we need to approach?
3. Questions that come to mind and that were raised at today's
meetings seem to range from:
--What approximate percentages of trees will be impacted, in what
regions?
--How will this affect our stated timber goal and how do we
explain that?
 (And how best to talk about both of the above.)
--Will this aggravate fires?
--What are we doing to counter/innoculate communities against
fires?
--Where will we get hit on this and by whom?
--When we characterize this as a step in the right direction, do
we have a sense of what steps might follow?
--Do we need to outline a specific response to questions on the
Kennedy and Furse Amendments and why we did or did not move on
them?

These are just a few. It seems that it would be useful to put
together some q and a's for people so that we are all clear on


  what we are saying.
  I don't think working through these should slow us down -- but we
  should just make sure we're ready to go on this.  Is next week
  okay in terms of other things going on?
