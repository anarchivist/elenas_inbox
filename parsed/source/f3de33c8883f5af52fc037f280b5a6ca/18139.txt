TEXT:
EK:

Below please find the few sentences you requested on Treasury/ATF's
expansion of the Youth Crime Gun Interdiction Initiative (YCGII) in the
budget.  The initiative received no special funding in FY 97.  It received
a $1 million line-item in FY 98 and should also receive $10 million from
the Treasury Secretary's Forfeiture Fund.  However, the current funding
has generally not provided for ATF to hire/dedicate additional agents to
the project or to increase investigations on gun traffickers (funding to
date has generally provided training to state and locals, computer
equipment/software and contract personal to do tracing).

The current OMB recommendation for FY 99 proposes $28 million for the
YCGII -- $12 million that is already built into the base and an additional
$16 million that they are supporting from the Presidential Priority
Reserve (PPR). These funds will be used, in part, for new agents.
Treasury is appealing for an additional $4 million in personal from the
PPR.

Youth Crime Gun Interdiction Initiative -- The proposed FY 99 budget
includes $28 million to expand the President's Youth Crime Gun
Interdiction Initiative (YCGII).  This includes $16 million in new funds
to hire 162 ATF agents to crackdown on illegal gun traffickers in the 27
youth crime gun cities, and $12 million to continue the Administration's
comprehensive gun tracing in these cities. ATF's crime gun tracing has
been a key component of Boston's successful youth violence strategy.

NB:  If Treasury wins its appeal for an additional $4 million, which I
believe DPC and Rahm should support, we could add 27 agents (mostly for
training), 33 inspectors to visit firearms dealers, and 50 clerical and
support staff to the above total.
