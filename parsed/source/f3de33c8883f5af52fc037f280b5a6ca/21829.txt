TEXT:
1. Airplane safety, 12/19. Three options emerged: 1. NPR is pushing hard
for a "holistic" aviation safety plan they are putting together.  I said
we shouldn't count on another plan for a deliverable. They haven't gotten
it to us, but we should get a draft this p.m. -- if this is only a radio
it may be ok;   2. Black box. Currently, airlines give black box data to
the FAA after an accident. FAA could do a voluntary or mandatory
requirement to airlines to turn in black box data whether or not there has
been an accident.   3. Other. We are pushing FAA to come up with
something else.

2.   Child Safety Seats 12/10.  We've been briefed by the highway folks,
it looks ok, they are a little worried about getting OMB approval but it
should be doable.

3.   Food Safety. Our budget got screwed, USDA is upset that they have
user fees (and threaten to nix the initiative if their baseline isn't
funded), FDA got no money for its initiative. Otherwise, it'd be a good
event.

4. Homeless vets.     I assume this is off now that disabled housing has
been done.
