 TEXT:
 Attached are the talking points from last year, in response to the same
 proposal from last year.  Below are talking points I just did independent
 of that.

 Jake Siewert already had one conversation with USA Today, before we got
 the details.


 Chairman ArcherD,s proposal does not go nearly far enough to meet the $112
 billion in school construction and modernization needs nationwide.  His
 proposal would only benefit those school districts already able to pass
 school construction bonds and to delay construction, in order to invest
 the bond funds and a higher interest rate.  While we are pleased that
 Chairman Archer recongizes that the federal government has an important
 responsibility to assist communities around the country modernize their
 schools, this proposal doesnD,t go nearly far enough.==================== ATTACHMENT

           ARBITRAGE DOES NOTHING FOR SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION

Background: House Republicans have proposed extending the period that local
governments could retain arbitrage profits on tax-exempt school construction bonds from 2
to 4 years. Some school associations (e.g. school administrators) are supporting the
proposal as a step in the right direction. It is good that RepUblicans are starting to see the
importance of the Federal government helping to address record school enrollment and
critical backlogs of renovation needs. However:

·      The arbitrage proposal promises nothing for school construction, and may even
       delay construction. While it allows local governments to keep more profits from
       investing their bond proceeds, that simply means that the money is not being used
       on much-needed construction and renovation projects.

·      The extra profits would not need to be used for school construction.

·      Schools that need the most help may get nothing at all. Only schools that have
       bond fund sitting in investments would benefit.

·      Urban schools agree: Arbitrage is not enough. The Nation's largest school districts
       found that "these limited arbitrage benefits do not compare favorably" to the
       Administration's school modernization proposal. (Council of Great City Schools,
       September 22,1998).
