TEXT:
FYI, DOL seems to be getting off to an ambitious start on this disability
employment task force.  One thing they are concerned about is that OMB
should be involved constructively as they go along, rather than coming in
at the 11th hour to veto things.  So I sent this to Barbara Chow to push
it along, and Seth will try, but it may be that I'll need your help later
at higher levels.  I'll let you know.

Subject:         Seth Harris is calling you ...

because he wants to talk about how OMB will be involved in the disability
task force over the coming months.  Under the EO, the task force has to
issue a report by November.  His strategy for this first report is to look
for "low-hanging fruit" -- ideas that are the easiest to accomplish.   He
wants to make sure that you guys are involved enough up front that Herman
and Tony Coelho don't go too far down one road only to learn that you have
an insurmountable problem. This seems reasonable to me, though I'm not
sure what the process is for accomplishing it.  It's also hard since. the
issues cut across OMB's areas -- many are yours, but a lot are health care
or others too.

By the way, DOL is planning the first task for6e meeting next week, and
they seem to have assembled a lot of major Cabinet and sub-Cabinet types
for it (Herman, Shalala, Apfel, Min). This one will be open to the
public. They'll have panels on health care, education and training, and
discrimination. There's a planning meeting for it tomorrow that I'll
attend; I've told Larry Matlack what I know about it.  I've also advised
Seth not to over-promise before that audience, and he says he won't.
