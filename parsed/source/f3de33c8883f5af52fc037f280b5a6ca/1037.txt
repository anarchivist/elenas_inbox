       Quality Commission. The nominations for the Quality Commission are in the final clearance
       process. We have been pushing for a release date of March 4th. The Presidential Personnel
       Office and the Council's office are trying to be responsive, but believe it is highly unlikely
       an adequate vetting of these names will be completed by then. They believe the earliest,
       most realistic timeframe for clearance and announcement is the week of March 10th.
       This announcement could be combined with the release of a HHS reg, now under review by
       OMB, that would provide for expedited appeals for situations in which a plan proposes to deny
       care that a Medicare patient believes is urgently needed; (a similar protection is already provided
       for emergency care situations.) This new reg would represent the highest level of protection for
       patients in either private or public managed care plans.


       Home Care Quality Regulation. After review of the final reg that was approved, DPC and
       HHS concluded it was not substantive enough to merit a Presidential event. As a result, it will
       be released next week during HCFA Administrator Bruce Vladeck's testimony. We have asked
       HHS, however, to review more substantive legislative/regulatory approaches that we could
       possibly announce in the future. This would include a provision, which was not included in the
       initial HHS reg, that would require criminal background checks for home health providers
       partcipating in Medicare.


       Medicare Fraud and Abuse. We are working with HHS to finalize a new package of fraud and
       abuse initiatives to be available for public unveiling by as early as the week of March 10th.
       Since Florida is the fraud and abuse "capitol" of the nation, we believe the President's visit there
       that week would provide an excellent opportunity to announce the new package. It would be
       strongly endorsed and validated by Governor Chiles. (His office has been extremely aggressive
       in this area and has been extremely successful in achieving significant savings for the State's
       Medicaid program.

       does not believe it is humanly possible, however, 'to assume they will be ready for an
       announcement for the week of March 3rd. Working with White House Personnel, i
