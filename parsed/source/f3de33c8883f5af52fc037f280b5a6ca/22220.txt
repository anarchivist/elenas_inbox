TEXT:
Eli's excited about the event and is coming up with CEO ideas.

He stressed that companies now know hiring from the welfare rolls is good
for business -- that's why the Partnership's membership has doubled in the
last 8 months to 10,000.  It's critical that these companies have service
providers -- whether they're nonprofits like Goodwill, for-profits, or
local governments -- that can help them find and support these new workers
so they succeed on the job. The $1 billion in new welfare to Work money
will help do that.

We're picturing the ideal event would include a CEO from a company that
joined the partnership in the last year, perhaps accompanied by a half
dozen or so of his employees hired from the welfare rolls (this would also
enable us to have a father or two in the group) .

1) The CEO speaks, says why hiring from the welfare rolls has helped his
business and why we must invest more but the payoff in job retention makes
it worth it

2) One of his employees introduces the President

3) The President speaks

If we need someone from the WH to open, maybe it could be Bruce?

Since we have three Cabinet Secretaries involved in the announcements
(Shalala -- new caseload numbers; Herman -- new Welfare to Work funds;
Slater -- new welfare to work transportation funds) I think it's critical
that none of them speak, least we end up with a whole parade.   Thus on
stage we have the Cabinet Secretaries and the group of welfare success
stories?

If we can get more CEOs in town, we'd put them on stage, and maybe have
them do a roundtable with the beat reporters?

We're searching for local off-site locations, but suspect that we'd be


more likely to be able to import a good example (CEO and workers)    than
find the ideal spot nearby.

Subject:         Welfare to Work Event -- 1/25

I wanted to give you all some information I'm picking up about the
upcoming Welfare to Work event on January 25.

We will not be able to hold the event in the House itself due to an event
in the evening that will take all day to set up. We should think about
either an off-site venue that would work, or if we want to do the event in
450.
I understand that in the message meeting this morning they discussed
making this a "big deal" event, and would like to heavily involve Eli and
possibly some CEOs.

Let me know if there is more information I can try to get for you, or if
you have any questions.

Thanks!
