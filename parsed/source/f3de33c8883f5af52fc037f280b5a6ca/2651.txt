TEXT:
I have done my best on this event tomorrow morning, but I remain a bit
nervous about it.

The NPR folks kept telling me agencies, state groups, Eli, civic groups,
etc., and everyone is on board on the event, but then these same groups
would tell me they are confused, don't understand their role.  I have
touched base with everyone, so I think it's about as good as it can be.

Also, NPR was slow to accept my and HHS's comments on the speech itself,
but I think that is resolved.   (They didn't initially want to mention
accomplishments like eitc, minimum wage, and instead kept talking about
how wages were too low.)
