Right to Die                        Vacco v. Quill

       I am very pleased with today's Supreme Court decision against physician-assisted suicide.
 The decision is a victory for all Americans--it prevents us from going down a very dangerous
and troubling path in this difficult and often agonizing issue.

        With today's decision, the Court voices its concern that there is a significant distinction
between assisting in death and allowing death to occur. Not only is this an important legal
distinction, it is also a distinction of deep moral and ethical implications.

         I have a great deal of sympathy and a profound respect for those who suffer from
incurable illnesses, and for their families. I have had a number of family members die from
painful and protracted illnesses. Even so, I have always expressed my strong opposition to
physician-assisted suicide. I believe that it is wrong, and have always believed it to be wrong.
It is not right to force patients who might already have impaired judgment into a position where
they might have to make serious and irreversible judgments about their own health care needs.

        Today's decision indicates that the dangers and consequences of allowing
physician-assisted suicide far outweigh the good that it might do in some cases. The issue is
unavoidably heartrending, and we must never ignore the agony of terminally ill patients, but the
Supreme Court made the right decision today. The risks and consequences of physician-assisted
suicide are simply too great.

Vacco v. Quill


       I am deeply disappointed with today's Supreme Court decision in favor of
physician-assisted suicide. The decision is a defeat for all Americans--it allows America to go
down a very dangerous and troubling path in this difficult and often agonizing issue.

        There is a critical distinction, one of deep legal, moral, and ethical implications, between
assisting in death and allowing death to occur. Unfortunately, the Court failed to view this
distinction as a deciding factor.

        I have a great deal of sympathy and a profound respect for those who suffer from
incurable illnesses, and for their families. I have had a number of family members die from
painful and protracted illnesses. Even so, I have always expressed my strong opposition to
physician-assisted suicide. I believe that.it is wrong, and have always believed it to be wrong.
With today's decision, patients who might already have impaired judgment might be placed in a
position where they have to make serious and irreversible judgments about their own health care
needs.

       The dangers and consequences of allowing physician-assisted suicide far outweigh the
good that it might do in some cases. The issue is unavoidably heartrending, and we must never
ignore the agony of terminally ill patients, but the Supreme Court made the wrong decision
today. The risks and consequences of physician-assisted suicide are simply too great.
