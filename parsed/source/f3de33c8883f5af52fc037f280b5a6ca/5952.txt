TEXT:
I don't think we should release a figure on this yet.   Bruce told me on
Friday that Zones would be announced in SOTU (though it wasn't mentioned
in the draft he shared this morning).  If for some reason we don't include
it in SOTU, I know there is interest in the VP's office in having him do
some kind of urban ed event shortly after SOTU.  If the Zones have been
announced by then, he package all of the other initiatives that have a
particular urban impact (e.g., increase$ for Title 1, the mentoring
initiative, school construction, class size, etc.) to show the
Administration's total effort to help kids in urban schools.   If the Zones
haven't been formally announced by then, we might want the VP to do that
as well, and let him release the numbers.
