Subject;         Higher ed reauthorization and our service summit proposal

There is a sticky issue on implementing one of our service summit
proposals.  This is the proposal that interest should not accumulate on
any student loans when students take time off to serve. Our plan has
always been to include this in our higher ed reauthorization bill, which
is being readied for transmittal to the Hill in the next few weeks.

The issue is that the Department's draft would not permit this subsidy if
the service is with an organization engaged in religious activities, with
certain exceptions.  Education is taking the position that doing otherwise
raises constitutional questions.  This means that a group like the Rev.
Tony Campolo's would not qualify. As you recall, Campolo's program was
the inspiration for this idea, and the President talked about Campolo when
he announced this (see below) .

Elena, do you want to review the language to make sure they aren't going
overboard? They are reexamining it after I pointed out a few areas where
it seems excessively strict.  For example, it would rule out teaching
English in a program that offered any religious instruction, even if the
student was not doing religious instruction. However, I should note that
Campolo's people do proselytization for part of their day, so theY're not
right on the edge of this line.

When we resolve this, we can tell him in the weekly report.       Let me know
 '.'


if you want this in the weekly while we're figuring it out.

[FYI, here's what the President said at the summit. Actually, he deviated
from the prepared text
in a way that made it sound like this new proposal applied ONLY to
religious service.]

"For here in Philadelphia, a minister who is a friend of mine, Reverend
Tony Campolo, is helping to organize
a movement among churches to get churches to sponsor 10,000 full-time
youth volunteers to take a year off
from college, or defer a year from college, under the sponsorship of their
churches. The churches will do
what we do in AmeriCorps, helping to provide for the living expenses of
the young people. But I think we
ought to say to them, at the very least, it shouldn't cost you any money
to serve. And so if you've got a
college loan, and you take a year off to serve under the sponsorship of a
religious organization, I am going
to propose legislation to say, 'During that year, no interest should
accrue on that college loan.'  It should
not cost you any money to serve your country."
