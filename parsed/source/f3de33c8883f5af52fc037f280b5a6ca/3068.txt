TEXT:
We've modified Koop/Kessler answer to drop "it would be premature to
commit to any particular timetable" since we say just above that our
review will take 4 weeks.   Shouldn't be an issue anyway, given we expect
to take a month ourselves.   Laura, can you make sure Elena sees that
change before it goes down?   Thanks.  ==================== ATTACHMENT    1 ==========

                                      June 20, 1997

Q.   Did the Administration help close the deal?

A.   No. My staff monitored the talks closely so that we would be in a position to evaluate and
     respond to any possible settlement.

Q.   But didn't Bruce Lindsey close this deal yesterday by suggesting a compromise on
     punitive damages?

A.   No. We have consistently told all the parties that they would have to close any agreement on
     their own. They were able to do so without any help from the Administration.

Q.   The final deal limits punitive damages -- a key concession to the tobacco industry.
     Won't you oppose that given your previous opposition to caps on punitive awards?

A.   The limitation on punitive damages for past misconduct is not a deal-breaker for us. We
     understand that the attorneys general extracted substantial concessions from the tobacco
     companies for this limitation, and we will evaluate whether the agreement as a whole
     advances the public health.

Q.   How will you proceed?

A.   I have asked my Domestic Policy Advisor, along with the Secretary of Health and Human
     Services, to undertake Ii thorough public health review of this agreement. They will consult
     with all interested agencies, members of Congress, and the public health community.

Q.   How long will the review take?

A.   The review will take as long as necessary to conduct a careful analysis, but we will seek to
     work promptly and expeditiously. We estimate the review will take about four weeks.

Q.   Dr. Kessler and Dr. Koop have asked in a letter to you that you give them 30 days to
     complete their own review before signing off on anything. Are you going to wait?

A.   I intend to very closely consider the views of the public health community prior to rendering
     any judgment on the settlement, and my staff was in contact with members of the community
     during the whole course of the discussions. I am not going to judge a deal before I know the
     views of the public health community, including Dr. Koop and Dr. Kessler.

Q.   Are you taking a political risk in considering approval of this settlement?

A.   We may be, but we are determined to protect the public health and children's health -- and we
     will do whatever is necessary to advance those interests. If an agreement with tobacco
     companies will protect the public health, then we'll support that agreement, even if some
     people criticize us for doing so.

Q.   What will you look at in evaluating this agreement?
                                                                    Automated Records Management System
                                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion
A.   We will evaluate whether this agreement protects the public health -- and particularly the
     health of our children. We will pay special attention to the piece in the agreement dealing
     with FDA jurisdiction. The actions the FDA has taken under this Administration forced the
     industry to the bargaining table, and we will insist that the FDA has all the necessary authority
     to regulate nicotine and tobacco products. We also will carefully review the financial terms
     of the settlement and the use of the money for children's health purposes.
