TEXT:
This is the draft agenda for the meeting of the food safety council on
12/16. The main issue will be the budget discussion, hence the meeting is
planned to be closed.  We have held a relatively small MOU that FSIS and
FDA can agree to which we can tell interested press later was one of the
tangible work-products of the meeting. The MOU allows better sharing of
inspection personnel between the two agencies -- but we need much more.
Bruce, has been given 5 minutes to talk, I thought you might want to aff
irm the importance of the council, use the MOU as an example of the
direction you hope we move in,  and talk about how the different agencies
share common goals. Do you want to speak? I~ve previously sent you the
draft documents under discussion "but will send again if you wish.
