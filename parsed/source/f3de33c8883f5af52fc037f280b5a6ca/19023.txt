                                 Proposed School Safety Event
                                       March 19, 1998


Overview o(Event: The event will be an opportunity for the President to announce two studies
on violence and crime in schools, and two actions the Administration is taking to help parents
and communities create safer schools. The studies -- which will be timed for release shortly
before the event -- will provide national estimates on the incidence of violence in schools as well
as trends in school violence as reported by students. To help respond to the school crime
problem, the President will release a preview for a new annual report the Education and Justice
Departments are currently preparing to help parents and schools assess and address their school
safety and violence issues, and $12 million in new COPS funding to reduce violence in schools.

I.     Announcements.

       A.      School violence and discipline study. Earlier that morning, the National Center
               on Education Statistics will release a national survey on violence and discipline
               problems in schools for the 1996-97 school year. Key findings include:
               1)     57% of public schools experienced at least one crime incident that was
                      reported to law enforcement;
               2)     There were an estimated 190,000 physical attacks or fights without a
                      weapon; 11,000 physical attacks or fights in which a weapon was used;
                      and 7,000 robberies; and 4,000 rapes or other forms of sexual battery;
               3)     43% of schools reported no incidents of crime; 37% reported 1 to 5
                      crimes; and 20% reported 6 crimes or more.

       B.      School Crime Victimization Survey. This report was sponsored jointly by the
               Bureau of Justice Statistics and the National Center for Education Statistics for
               1989 and 1995. The survey will include data from about 10,000 youth, ages 12-19
               on weapons possession, disciplinary actions and student victimizations. The
               report will show that while the crime rate in schools has essentially stayed flat, the
               nature of crime has changed and gangs have more than doubled.

       C.      Joint Report to President by Secretary Riley and Attorney General Reno. In
               response to President Clinton's 12-6-97 radio address on school violence, the
               Secretary and Attorney General will present to him the framework of a new
               annual report on school violence indicators currently being developed for release
               by the coming school year. The full report will include a statistical analysis of
               school crime (e.g., drugs, weapons and alcohol possession, gangs, and student and
               teacher safety); model safe and drug-free schools; strategies to create safe schools
               and an overview of state and local school crime data.

       D.      COPS funding for school violence.. The President will announce the
               availability of new Justice Department funding to combat school violence. On
               the date of the event, the COPS Office make applications available for $12

                     million in FY 98 grant funds to help improve school safety and reduce crime on or
                     near elementary and secondary school grounds. The funding is the result of
                     Senator Robb's efforts.
