                                   World AIDS Day 1998

Q:   How many orphans are there now?

A:   Globally, USAID estimates that there are approximately 20 million AIDS orphans now.
     That number will grow to about 25 million by the year 2000 and 41 million by 2010.

     In the United States, we have about 70,000 to 80,000 children that have been orphaned by
     AIDS so far. That may grow to as many as 125,000 by the year 2000.

Q:   Some community groups have critized the Administration's progress on
     international AIDS efforts. How do you respond?

A:   The Administration has been at the forefront of the international response to this
     epidemic. In fact, the United States has led the international response to this global
     pandemic. Since 1986, the U.S. Government, through USAID, has expended nearly $1
     billion dollars for the prevention and mitigation ofthis epidemic in the developing world.
      USAID's HIVI AIDS budget of $125 million for this year exceeds all other bilateral
     donors. We also provide 25 percent of annual budget of United Nations Joint Program
     on HIV/AIDS, UNAIDS.

Q:   What about the "report card" issued by AIDS Action Council that gives the U. S.
     Government an "F" on its international AIDS response?

A:   Our understanding is that the criticism was not ofthis Administration in particular, but
     reflects their concern that not enough is being done. The executive director of AIDS
     Action issued a statement today that said, in part, "With today's initiative, the President
     adds leadership on the global pandemic to the leadership he has demonstrated on AIDS
     research and care issues. We hope that today's action will encourage all Americans
     concerned about AIDS to do more in fighting the epidemic worldwide."

     There is certainly more that needs to be done, and part of why we are here today focusing
     on this issue is to broaden awareness of the depth of the problem and gather support for
     increasing the response from government; private organizations, and citizens.

Q:   This problem of AIDS orphans is not new. What has the US government been
     doing before this to address the problem?

A:   The U.S. government, primarily through USAID, has been working on the problem of
     children orphaned by AIDS since 1989. It's Children and Orphans Fund, which USAID
     administers, has been supporting programs in some of the hardest hit nations (Uganda,
     Malawi, and Zambia). The new resources announced today will help us build on those
     efforts and expand into other countries that are struggling with this issue.

          Q:    What will US AID do with this funding?

          A:   USAID's primary response will be to help support indigenous community-based groups
               that are struggling to meet the needs of both AIDS orphans and the families or foster
               families that take them in. USAID, in conjunction with the Nlli and the CDC, is also
               working to support research that will help reduce the spread of the epidemic so that there
               will be fewer children orphaned by AIDS. These will include new behavioural
               approaches, prevention technologies like topical microbicides, and treatments that reduce
               mother-to-child transmission. The needs of the impacted communities are widely varied,
               so the response will depend largely on local needs.

          Q:   Are you going to be using this funding to build more orphanages?

          A:   We believe the best response is community-based, helping families and other loved ones
               to care for the needs of these children. The numbers that we're talking about--40 million
               orphans by 2010--are so large that orphanages are simply not going to be adequate.
               Also, because of economic pressures in many of the countries struggling with this issue,
               some families might feel compelled to send their children to an orphanage rather than
               trying to care for them. Our best response is to support the community response.

          Q:    What's the progress on the President's AIDS vaccine initiative?

          A:     Last year, the President issued a challenge to make the development of an AIDS vaccine a
                 national and international priority. Since that time, there has been a lot of coordination
                 work with other developed nations on vaccine research efforts. The Nlli has started
                 construction on a new vaccine research facility on its campus that will be home to much
                 of our intramural research. As w:as announced today, the Nlli is also significantly
               . increasing its financial investment in vaccine research.

               There has been progress, but the work will undoubtedly be slow and painstaking.
