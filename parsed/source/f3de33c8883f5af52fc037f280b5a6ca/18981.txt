Q:    WHAT IS YOUR RESPONSE TO THE FACT THAT THE COMMISSION
      EXPLICITL Y REJECTED THE PRESIDENT'S PROPOSAL TO ENACT
      LEGISLATION TO ENSURE THE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS ADVOCATED
      BY THE COMMISSION?

A:    The Commission did not reject the President's proposal. Any suggestion to the contrary
      is simply wrong. The Commission chose not to advocate for any specific enforcement
      mechanism to ensure that all Americans benefitted from the Commission's
      recommendations. However, because they did say that these rights should be made real
      for all Americans, the President's call for legislation represents the only viable approach
      to ensure this outcome.

Q:    CLEARLY YOU WOULD SAY THAT THE COMMISSION DID NOT AND
      COULD NOT REACH FULL CONSENSUS ON WHETHER FEDERAL LAW
      WOULD BE REQUIRED FOR THE PATIENTS' BILL OF RIGHTS?

A:    If the Congress had to get absolute consensus on every issue then they would have never
      been able to enact the Medicare program or the Social Security program. If you polled
      this Commission, I think that at least three-fourths would say that the patients' bill of
      rights does, in fact, require legislation. However, this Commission was set up to have to
      establish universal consensus.

Q:    WHAT IS YOUR RESPONSE TO CRITICISMS THAT THE PRESIDENT'S
      QUALITY COMMISSION IS DIVIDED OVER WHETHER THE PATIENTS'
      BILL OF RIGHTS SHOULD LEGISLATED?

A:     When the President endorsed the patients' bill of rights recommended by his Quality
       Commission, he explicitly stated that many of these rights would require Federal
       legislation. The President is encouraged by the fact the some businesses have agreed to
     . voluntarily implement these patient protections. And this week, the President released a
       report that says that many states have taken action in this area. However, this patchwork
       of protections is not enough to ensure that all Americans get the patients' rights they need
       and deserve.

      State laws do not even have jurisdiction over more than 100 million Americans. For
      example, they do not cover tens of millions of Americans in self-insured plans covered
      under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). And we cannot expect all
      businesses to implement these rights. The only way to ensure that all health plans
      serving all Americans provide the protections envisioned by the Quality
      Commission is to pass and enact bipartisan Federal legislation. We intend to do
      just that.
     PROVIDE REMEDIES TO PEOPLE WHO ARE INJURED BY THE HEALTH
     CARE SYSTEM. IS THE ADMINISTRATION DISAPPOINTED?

A:   No one ever expected this broad-based Commission to reach consensus on this
     controversial issue. The Commission did provide an extremely useful contribution in
     highlighting the widespread disparities in remedies across private and public health plans.
      It also provided a series of thought-provoking questions that would need to be addressed
     in any serious consideration of this issue. We believe that this work product furthers the
     debate. We welcome it and greatly appreciate the Commission's work on this issue.


Q:   WHAT IS THE PRESIDENT'S POSITION ON THE BEST ENFORCEMENT
     MECHANISM FOR THESE RIGHTS?

A:   The President has consistently said these patients' rights should be real for all Americans.
      There is bipartisan legislation on Capitol Hill that includes an enforcement mechanism
     of utilizing legal remedies through state courts. That is one viable option. There may
     be others, and we will continue to review options in this regard. However, we have
     always said that we need Federal legislation that ensure that these rights are real for all
     Americans.
