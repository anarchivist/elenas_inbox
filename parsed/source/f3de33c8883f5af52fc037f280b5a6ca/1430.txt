MEMORANDUM

Your staff requested some feedback regarding proposals submitted by representatives from
American Indian tribes. I was asked to provide comment and recommendations on two specific
issues: a possible Executive Order on Government-to-Government relations with tribes and a
POTUS meeting with tribal leaders.
                                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion
PROPOSAL #1
Proposed Executive Order on Governrnent-to-Government relations with American Indian tribes

BACKGROUND
President Clinton signed a Presidential Memorandum on Government-to-Governrnent relations
with tribes on April 29, 1994. This historic Memorandum acknowledged the special
relationship the United States has with American Indian tribes, and directed the heads of
Executive Departments and Agencies to consult with Federally-recognized Tribal nations on a
Government-to-Government basis in formulating policies and programs affecting tribes. In
addition, President Clinton has issued two Executive Orders relating to tribes: one on Native
American sacred sites and a second on tribal colleges.

ISSUE
In a letter to the President, two tribes requested the issuance of an Executive Order on Indian
sovereignty and the Government-to-Government relationship. While this is a similar subject
matter to the 1994 Memorandum, in the tribes' view, an Executive Order is a more powerful
means of Presidential communication to the Executive Branch.

DISCUSSION
The Presidential Memorandum on Governrnent-to-Government relations was a major
accomplishment for this Administration in promoting greater tribal sovereignty. While the two
Executive Orders are important to the Native American community, expanding
Government-to-Governrnent relations is generally viewed with greater significance to more
tribes.

Federal agencies are varied in their compliance with the Memorandum. The Interior Department
and the EPA were particularly responsive in developing and carrying out policies pursuant to the
Memorandum. Other agencies have been much slower to develop and implement policies on
this front. Tribes would like to see the Federal government more responsive to the
Memorandum which is why they are interested in an Executive Order on the same issue.

It is debatable whether the situation warrants an Executive Order. While it is fair to expect and
ask for greater responsiveness from certain agencies, issuing an Executive Order similar to the
Presidential Memorandum at this point in time may suggest a failure of the Federal government
to act on the President's initial request. This would be inaccurate and could undermine
successes achieved by this Administration on Government-to-Governrnent relations.

RECOMMENDATION
Agencies would probably benefit from some prodding on their compliance with the initial
Memorandum. An Executive Order should be considered as a possible response. However, an
alternate response could be some other form of WH contact with the agencies. This would not
necessarily need to come from the President.

For example, a memorandum issued by the WH Chief of Staff or other appropriate WH official
to Federal agencies could ask for the status of their policies pursuant to the 1994 Presidential
                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion

Memorandum. This may generate some action from otherwise unresponsive agencies. After a
reasonable amount of time has elapsed for agencies to respond, an assessment could be made on
where agencies stand and what steps-- if any-- are necessary to further promote
Government-to-Government relations and tribal sovereignty (e.g., Executive Order or other
Executive action).
                                                                       Hex-Dump Conversion


PROPOSAL #2
Meeting with tribal leaders

ISSUE
The leaders of approximately 25 tribes have requested meetings with the President. The last
major official meeting with tribal leaders was in April 1994.

BACKGROUND
In April 1994, the President met with over 300 tribal leaders in a large ceremonial event on the
WH lawn. The Cabinet was present at the meeting, and the event lasted several hours. During
the meeting, the President released his Memorandum on Government-to-Government relations
and a Memorandum on the use of eagle feathers for religious purposes.

DISCUSSION
Many American Indian tribes believe that it is time for another meeting with the President.
However, only a relative small number of tribal leaders have officially requested such a meeting.
 If a meeting is scheduled, it would be wise to accommodate a larger number of tribes since the
last official meeting occurred nearly 3 years ago.

A larger WH meeting would require significant planning and sufficient lead time. However,
even with a larger meeting, any tribe that was in attendance at the April 1994 meeting that is not
invited to the next meeting could be offended.

Instead of a meeting at the White House, another option could be for the President to speak at a
large inter-tribal conference, such as the National Conference of American Indians (NCAI),
which meets a few times a year. Secretary Babbitt speaks at one NCAI conference annually, and
the Vice President spoke to NCAI in November 1995. One scheduled NCAI conference to
consider is scheduled for November 1997 in Santa Fe.

While many tribes attend the NCAI conferences, the Navajo Nation usually does not attend. It
would be a major oversight to hold an inclusive tribal meeting without the large Navajo Nation.

It should be further noted that any major meeting with tribes will place the President at risk of
being criticized for not being more responsive to Native American issues at both the Department
of Interior or Bureau of Indian Affairs levels. This stands in contrast to the optimism held by
tribes at the 1994 WH event.

RECOMMENDATION
A meeting including a large number of tribes should be organized for the President's second
Administration. It would not only be an important gesture of goodwill to tribes, but would allow
the President to have more direct contact with a constituency that does not ordinarily receive
high level attention.

If a large WH event/meeting is agreed upon, at least 3 months would probably be needed to
sufficiently plan. A speaking role at an NCAI conference would be easier to coordinate, but as
                                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion


noted above, the Navajo Nation would not be in attendance, unless they made a special provision
to attend. Either event should take into account the timing of significant Administration
decisions impacting tribes which are forthcoming (e.g, Indian gaming, BIAiinterior budget
negotiation decisions).
