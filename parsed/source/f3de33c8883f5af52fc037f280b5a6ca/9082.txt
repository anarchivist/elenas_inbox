TEXT:
I've talked to Sean who said they need the final order and directive by
2pm in order to send it around the West wing in the afternoon and get it
to the Vineyard by early evening. The agencies are getting back to OMB by
11am and I hope to get it to you around that time before we send it to
Sean. Thanks
