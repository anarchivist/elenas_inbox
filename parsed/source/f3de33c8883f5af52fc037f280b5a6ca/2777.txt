TEXT:
Shaw argues that SSI has become a retirement program for foreigners.
Therefore, another advantage of the "disabled after entry" policy is that
it is not nice to people who immigrated knowing that they would likely
become a public charge -- i.e.,the old, and those who arrived disabled.
It is nice to people who came expecting to work and contribute.  So it
reinforces points we want to make on immigration policy.

This advantage is in addition to other arguments -- our policy is more
generous than Shaw's in the long run; and it's fairer to sponsors, since
they couldn't have anticipated disabled after entry. Not sure if argument
works that non-disabled aged don't need it as much as disabled, since it's
hard to expect old people to work -- though we can safely say "most
vulnerable", I think.
