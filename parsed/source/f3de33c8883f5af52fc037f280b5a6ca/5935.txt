TEXT:
Barbara Chow says that with some effort, she has gotten Frank to be
willing to include in the budget language a statement limitied to
expressing concern about the problem and pledging that we will send
legislation to the Hill this year.  "The problem" will be defined more
broadly that we suggested (we wanted it to be only our concerns about loss
of federal funds due to separate state programs, they want to also have a
statement of concern about the overall financing of the child support
system. )

I think this could be promising, but the devil is in the details.  I'll
keep pushing for actual language and will let you know as soon as I get
it.
