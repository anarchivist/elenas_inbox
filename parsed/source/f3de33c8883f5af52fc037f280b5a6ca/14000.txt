     TEXT:
     Despite earlier forecasts, the interagency salvage program review
     team will not be ready to brief us at Tuesday's meeting. We will
     commence at 2 pm as usual, but if anyone from your agency was
     planning on attending because of that part of the agenda, they
     should hold off until next week.
     please come prepared to discuss issues, including outstanding
     sales, related to the termination of §2001(k) on September 30th.
     Thank you.
