TEXT:
I am sending you a copy of the brief in opposition to certiorari in
Grijalva, filed a coupleof days ago .. As expected, the advocates argue
 (pp. 13-21) that the role of HMOs in Medicare is very different from that
of the insurance companies in worker's comp and that Sullivan doesn't
change anything. The cases they cite are Medicaid cases rather than
Medicare cases, raising the possibility that the SG's reply, if he and HHS
want to, can try to separate Medicare from Medicaid on state action.
Harriet Rabb says they have a nbew theory on this, which she will discuss
with me.
