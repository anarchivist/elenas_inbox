MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:                  BRUCE REED
                          TOM FREEDMAN

SUBJECT:               Civil Rights Enforcement Initiative

         We have developed a civil rights enforcement initiative that places a new emphasis on
prevention and non-litigation remedies for discrimination while also strengthening civil rights
agencies' ability to enforce traditional federal anti-discrimination policy. The plan promotes
prevention by providing increased resources for compliance reviews and technical assistance, and
offers an alternative to expensive litigation by funding a dramatic expansion of alternate dispute
resolution (ADR) mechanisms. The plan also sets specific performance goals for the EEOC to
speed its processing of complaints and reduce its backlog, and provides for greater coordination
of strategy across federal civil rights agencies and offices. The package of improvements totals
approximately $107 million, including a 16.5% increase above the enacted FY 1998 budget for
EEOC and a roughly 50% increase for the relevant HUD office.

I.     Strategies that Promote Prevention and Avoid Litigation

       A.    Resolving Problems Without Lengthy Court Fights

        The plan calls for the dramatic expansion of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR)
across all relevant agencies. The largest initial investment is a $40 million expansion over three
years of the EEOC's mediation program. The EEOC currently has only a very limited mediation
program. The increased funding will allow upwards of 70% of all complainants to choose
mediation, rather than the lengthy process of investigation and litigation. (The remainder will
not have this option, either because their cases are seen as the most serious enforcement priorities
or because their cases are wholly devoid of merit.) We expect about half of all complainants to
choose the mediation option. In addition to the EEOC program, pilot mediation programs will
be introduced at HHS and Labor.

       B. Spotlighting the Problem and Encouraging Compliance

       The initiative includes a fund to improve the surveillance, technical outreach, and
compliance efforts by civil rights offices. The focus on compliance is reflected in increased
support for DOL's Office of Federal Contract Compliance program, which ensures that
businesses under contract to the federal government implement E.O. 11246 and comply with
                                                                         Hex-Dump Conversion ·

anti-discrimination law. This $23 million refonn will allow the office to increase ten-fold the
number of compliance reviews it conducts through the introduction of a tiered review system.
In addition, the initiative provides $10 million to HUD to conduct a program using paired
testers, which is designed to raise awareness of the extent of housing discrimination
through the public release of audit results as well as subsequent focused enforcement
action. This initiative will also enable the EEOC to improve compliance through videos for
employers and a public service campaign.

II.    Making Enforcement Work

       A.   Resources to Eliminate Backlogs

        One of the most common criticisms offederal civil rights enforcement relates to the
length of time the EEOC takes to hear and decide cases. This plan uses improvements in
technology, mediation, and the addition of over 100 investigators to lower the average time spent
resolving private-sector complaints to under 6 months (from the current 9.4 months) and
reducing the inventory from 64,000 cases to 28,000 by the year 2000. The plan also includes
two new initiatives at HHS to reduce backlogs by expanding the use of case management
techniques and giving state and local civil rights agencies an additional role in enforcement.

       B.    Coordinating and Streamlining Federal Policies

         Federal civil rights offices only rarely consult or coordinate with each other. This
initiative will institute a standing inter-agency working group to address issues of common
interest, including development of strategy, implementation of perfonnance outcome measures,
and sharing of training initiatives and data collection.
         We also recommend that you begin the process of implementing EEOC's proposal to
strengthen its authority to eradicate discrimination from federal agencies, provided White House
and Department of Justice attorneys approve the measures. Currently, parties who complain of
discriminatory treatment by an agency can request a hearing from an Administrative Judge who
is an impartial EEOC employee. Agencies, however, can then issue a final agency decision
(FAD) rejecting the AJ's decision altogether. Statistics show that agencies modify decisions
adverse to them nearly two-thirds of the time, while modifying decisions favorable to them only
about I % of the time. The EEOC proposal would eliminate the FAD process where there has
been an AJ hearing, and pennit both the complaining party and agencies to appeal the AJ's
decision to the EEOC.

       C.    Modernizing Civil Rights Enforcement

        Many civil rights agencies have not received sufficient increases in resources to make use
of technology and improve their efficiency. For instance, unlike most of the federal government,
EEOC offices lack the ability to communicate with each other using e-mail. The plan includes a
$15 million technology initiative for EEOC, HHS, Labor, and Education to provide for
communication via electronic mail; eliminate redundant data entry procedures; pennit the sharing
of infonnation and enhanced research capabilities for investigators and attorneys; allow for the
                                                            Hex-DiJmp Conversion ·

filing of fonns and complaints over the Internet; and provide for the sharing of civil rights data
bases.

III.   Status of Proposals

       DPC developed this plan after consultation with representatives ofleading civil rights
organizations, heads of federal civil rights offices, and other White House offices. OMB has
recommended a package of$57 million for this initiative, which will fund some ofthe measures
described here. OMB is currently reviewing other agency proposals, including the $40 million
expansion of ADR at EEOC and the $23 million proposal by DOL-OFCCP to expand its
compliance program.
