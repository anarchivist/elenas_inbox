TEXT:
The panel to hear our appeal of the NFVC v. Glickman decision
(areas vs. sales - geographic scope) has been announced, and
fortunately, it's not the same panel that so curtly denied our
motion to stay Hogan's decision on areas vs. scope.
It is composed of 1) Levy, who will preside - he's from Eugene and
characterized as conservative. thoughtful, fair - believes courts
should stay out of managing natural resources and thus Al will
portray Hogan's decision as taking managing out of hands of
managers; 2) Noonan - cranky but bright; Hawkins - Clinton
appointees, former U.S. attorney in Arizona.
Al Ferlo and Michelle Gilbert will be leaving Sunday evening for
the Monday afternoon argument (although according to yesterday's
Post story, the federal courts will have run out of $ and be
closed if there isn't a deal or Commerce/Justice $ isn't signed by
Jan. 7th.)

Elena, I faxed you the changes to our timber language suggested by
USDA OGC.  You may now more than I at this point, but TJ was
trying to get a meeting with Gorton asap, this afternoon or
tommorrow.
