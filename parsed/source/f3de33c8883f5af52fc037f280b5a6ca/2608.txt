TEXT:
Bruce is against a public event, leans to doing nothing, but is OK with a
signing statement that follows the SAP.  I'm in about the same place.  I
think the issue is whether a Presidential signing statement would be more
or less likely than our SAP to layout the differences clearly. Don't
forget, this looks like a pretty sympathetic bill.   ellen
