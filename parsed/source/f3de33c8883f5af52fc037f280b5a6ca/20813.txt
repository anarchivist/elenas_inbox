                                   TOP TIER TALKING POINTS

The Republican Leadership Bill (the Gingrich Bill) That Passed the House Yesterday Is More
Like A Bill of Goods Than A Jlatients' Bill of Rights. The House Republican bill falls far short
of giving Americans the patient protections they need and deserve. It leaves out millions of
Americans; it leaves out critical patient protections; and it adds in "poison pill" provisions which
undermine the possibility of passing a strong bipartisan patients' bill of rights this year.

·      The Gingrich bill does not apply to the individual insurance market and therefore
       excludes millions of Americans.

·      It does not include many essential patient protections. It:

               Does not assure patients direct access to the cancer and heart specialists they need.

               Does not ensure that care will not abruptly change if a patient's provider is unexpectedly
               dropped or an employer changes health plans.

               Does not contain sufficient provisions that prevent patients from being put at risk
               through unknown destructive financial incentives to limit patient care.

               Does not have a sufficient enforcement mechanism, as it gives little recourse to patients
               who are injured or who die because of a health plan's actions.

·       Finally, this legislation is includes "poison pill" provisions, such as medical malpractice
        caps, that even the American Medical Association believes are intended to undermine this
        legislation.
The Gingrich Bill is Designed to Give Political Cover Rather Than Give Patients the Cover They
Need. Representative John Linder, Chainnan of the House Republican Campaign Committee, said
this week that Republicans members will be sufficiently protected if they just take a vote on the
patients' bill of rights. We believe that Republicans should not just take votes for political cover, but
rather we should pass a strong bipartisan patients' bill of rights that gives patients the cover and
protections they need.

We are extremely disappointed that the House Republicans tried to jam through legislation to address·
political pressures, rather than running a fair, open process designed to develop a strong bipartisan
patients' bill of rights. Their language was drafted behind closed doors; they never held hearings on
this bill; and they never had a mark-up. They simply held an up-or-down vote without an open debate.
 If the House Republicans wanted to develop a strong patients' bill of rights rather than a political bill
of goods, they would have held fair process that was designed to develop bipartisan consensus on this
important issue.

We Hope the Senate Will Have a Full and Fair Debate To Develop A Strong Bipartisan Patients'
Bill of Rights. The President has called on the Senate to move quickly to have a fair and open
debate. We are confident that a fair process, that allows for amendments, will produce a strong,
enforceable, and bipartisan patients' bill of rights.
                                                                . .. \1a~.Oump Conversion
                                               Q&As

Q:   Yesterday the Gingrich bill passed the House. Do you view this as a setback for the
     AdQIinistration?

A:   No we view it as a setback for the American public. We are not only disappointed with what is
     in the Gingrich bill, but we are dismayed by how it was developed. The Republicans developed
     this bill behind closed doors, with no committee mark-up, no open debates, and no
     amendments. The Republican vote was clearly designed to give them political cover, not to
     give Americans the patient protections they need.

     The Gingrich bill leaves out critical patient protections. It does not assure direct access to
     specialists, so patients can see the cancer doctors or heart specialists they need; it does not
     prevent patients from being put at risk through unknown destructive financial incentives to limit
     patient care; and it adds "poison pill" provisions, such as malpractice caps, that are designed to
     undermine this legislation.

     However, we are pleased that the bipartisan Dingell-Ganske substitute legislation received such
     a strong vote (212-217, including 10 Republican supporters). This legislation covers all
     health plans, contains strong enforceable patient protections, and has no "poison pill"
     provisions that have nothing to do with these patient protections. We believe that if there
     had been a fair and open process to consider this legislation, it would have even received even
     more support.

Q:   Isn't the only real difference between the Democratic proposal and the Republican bill
     that passed the House yesterday that the Democrats assure the right to sue an HMO?
     Why are you making that issue the line in the sand?

A:   That is not true. While many in the media have given the impression that this is the only
     difference in these bills, that is simply not the case. Unlike the bipartisan Ganske-Dingell
     bill, or any bill the President could support, the Gingrich bill: leaves out millions of
     Americans; leaves out critical patient protections; and adds in "poison pill" provisions
     which undermine the possibility of passing a strong bipartisan patients' bill of rights this
     year.

            It does not apply to the individual insurance market and therefore excludes
            millions of Americans.

            It does not include many important patient protections such as ensuring direct
            access to cancer doctors or heart specialists that they need, or ensuring that care will
            not abruptly change if a patient's provider is unexpectedly dropped or an employer
            changes health plans. This legislation does not contain sufficient provisions that
            prevent patients from being put at risk through unknown destructive financial incentives
            to limit patient care.
                                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion

             The enforcement mechanism in this legislation is also insufficient as it gives little recourse to
             patients who are injured or who die because of a health pian's actions. The President
             has always said that to make these rights real you need a real remedy.

             This legislation is undermined by "poison pill" provisions, such as medical
             malpractice caps, that even the American Medical Association does not support on
             this bill, because it has nothing to do with patients' rights.

Q:   But aren't you insisting that this legislation give patients the right to sue their HMOs?

A:   The Administration has consistently stated that a right without a remedy is not a right at all.
     The state court approach in the bipartisan Dingell-Ganske legislation is certainly one approach
     that the President could accept, but we continue to be open to other meaningful approaches that
     ensure recourse for patients who have been maimed or who have died as a result of health plan
     actions.

     As was reported recently, judges across the country believe that their hands are tied by the
     current law. They have explicitly stated that Congress sho).lld remove the statutory barriers of
     ERISA that prevent consumers from seeking a meaningful remedy when they are injured
     because of their health plans' actions.        .

Q:   Mr. Norwood said on the floor yesterday that the Administration never pushed the right to sue early
     on in this process, despite his urging. Isn't it true that now you are pushing enforcement so that
     you can ensure that the patients' bill of rights becomes a campaign issue rather than the law of the
     land?

A:   No. As we have indicated from the beginning, we want to make sure that patients who have
     been maimed or who have died because of their health plan's actions have some type of
     recourse. This has been outlined in the Administration's testimony by the Department of Labor
     from the beginning of this debate.

Q:   Isn't this going to lead to a proliferation of lawsuits? Is that really what we need in this
     country -- more lawsuits?

A:   We believe that having a strong internal and independent external appeals process in place will
     address almost all patients' grievances and that very few cases will ever make it into the courts.
      That is why all of the independent analyses of the Dingell-Ganske enforcement approach,
     including the one done by the Congressional Budget Office, have scored it as costing between a
     dime and a dollar per month.

     There is no question that this is small price for such an important protection. Under current
     law, let's say that a patient is denied a critical mammography test recommended by her doctors
     and she is later diagnosed with stage two breast cancer. Even if it is determined that the HMO
     was clearly at fault, the patient can only be compensated for the cost ofthe test -- not for any
     subsequent treatment she will need and not for pain and suffering. We believe that patients
                                                                        .    Hex-Dump Conversion

     who are maimed or die because of action of their health plans ought to have some type of real
     compensation.

Q:   The House Republicans say that their legislation does cover everyone covered in the
     Dingell-Ganske bill. Why are you saying that this is not true?

A:   The way the legislation is drafted, it does not amend the law for the individual insurance
     market. As such, these protections, however limited, do not cover approximately ten million
     Americans. However, if the Republicans are saying it was their intention to cover all health
     plans, we certainly welcome that development. I would only say that the fact that this
     legislation was drafted behind closed doors, was not subjected to any amendments, and was
     rushed out for a vote, may help explain why a drafting error could occur. Having said this, we
     all know that the Republican Senate plan does not cover over 100 million Americans. Finally,
     the Gingrich bill, as I have mentioned, has serious shortcomings and a number of poison pills
     that make it unacceptable to the President.

Q:   Are you seriously saying that if the Congress passes a patients' bill of rights that is clearly
     an improvement from current law, that the President would veto it. Isn't that putting
     partisanship ahead of progress?

A:   The President is not going to sign legislation that is an empty promise. We do not want a bill
     that is full of provisions designed to please special interests and ignores the needs of the
     American public.

Q:   We have not heard the President himself say the word veto when referring to the House
     Republican bill. Is it possible that he is keeping the door open for signing this legislation
     should it make it through the Congress?

A:   Of course not. If the bill that was passed on Friday was presented to the Congress, the
     President would veto it.

Q:   What is the Administration's position on the Chafee/Graham patients' bill of rights that
     is likely to be introduced in the Senate next week?

A:   We welcome any bipartisan efforts to introduce a strong, enforceable patients' bill of rights.
     We have not seen the details of this legislation, however, and so it would be premature to
     comment on it.

Q:   We have heard that the Chafee-Graham legislation has a Federal court remedies
     approach that provides for economic damages and does not have any caps. Would that
     meet the Administration's criteria for enforcement?

A:   It certainly sounds like an improvement over the Republican Leadership bills' enforcement
     mechanisms, but without knowing the details it would be ill-advised to comment on it.
                                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion

Q:   Opponents are labeling the patients' bill of rights as another Kennedy plan for a
     government takeover of the health care system. Isn't this part of the overall White
     House strategy to do what you could not do in 1994: takeover the health care system?

A:   Of course not. The patients' bill of rights is a narrowly drafted piece oflegislation designed to
     provide basic protections for Americans who already have private health insurance.
     Supporters of the status quo frequently use reckless and inaccurate rhetoric to scare the public
     and the Congress. It will not work this time because the American people are scared that of a
     system where accountant -- not doctors -- are making medical decisions and where the bottom
     line is not a patient's health but profit margins.
