                            LOCATION: Cabinet Room
                            TIME:     1:30 p.m. - 2:30 p.m.

L      PURPOSE

        You will hold the first fuU Cabinet meeting of your second term to receive responses
to your March 8, 1997 directive asking aU federal agencies to develop plans to hire welfare
recipients. AU of the Cabinet agencies as weU as over 100 non-Cabinet agencies and
departments have submitted hiring plans through the Office of the Vice President. To
date, the Cabinet agencies estimate they can directly hire into the Federal government
8,000 welfare recipients during the first two years of this program. And some agencies have
already committed to hiring at least 2,000 more over the next two years bringing the initial
total to 10,000. Further, most agencies will encourage their grantees and contractors to
hire welfare recipients. You will introduce two Social Security Administration workers
who are former welfare recipients and congratulate them on their success. Information on
these women is provided below.

       During your remarks at the top of the meeting, you will also release new data
showing that welfare caseloads have declined nationally by 2,755,000, or 20 percent, during
your first term. You will announce plans to meet in May with a large group of corporate
CEOs to discuss their specific commitments to make the welfare reform effort a success.

II.    BACKGROUND

       Following is information on the former welfare recipients you reference in your
remarks:
Rebecca Rae Wilson of Clinton, Iowa. Rebecca is a single mother of two, who was on
welfare while attending Clinton Community CoUege. Last year, she got a part-time job as
a clerk with her local Social Security office, which enabled her to leave welfare while she
fmished school. With her supervisor's encouragement, she's now on her way to a business
degree -- she just got a raise and a promotion two days ago - and she's been offered a
permanent job with the Social Security Administration after she graduates.
                                   Hex-Dump Conversion


Tonya JoAnn Graham of Plainview, Texas. Tonya had a child at age 16, and went on
welfare while attending college part-time. She found out about a job at the Social Security
Administration in 1989 through a college professor, dropped off welfare the month she was
hired, fmished her degree and is now working full-time as a Social Security claims
representative.
