TEXT:
OLC is still looking at the issue of the extent to which a guardian or
proxy might be permitted to be involved in establishing the oath
requirement for the incapacitated individual. This might be to provide
some evidence of earlier intent to naturalize or the.extent to which the
guardian can essentially take the oath on behalf of the individual. Also,
the guidance might be updated on how individuals might be accomodated as
more experience is obtained in the field.
