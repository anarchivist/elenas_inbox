TEXT:
Last month, the Education Department announced that for the first time in
nearly 30 years of testing, average reading scores had improved in each of
three grades tested -- 4th, 8th, and 12th grades. Vice President Gore and
Secretary Riley participated in an event that day to comment on the scores
--both of them appropriately characterizing the scores as modest
improvements and a significant reversal of previous downward trends.
