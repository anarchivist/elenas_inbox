FROM:      OMB LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS

DATE:      MAY 5, 1998

SUBJECT:           LEGISLATIVE REPORT


Today, the Senate took a significant step toward completion of the IRS
Reform legislation by agreeing by unanimous consent to restrict amendments
to the IRS Reform Legislation to relevant amendments -- with the exception
of amendments to be offered Wednesday morning by Senator Roth, and by Sen.
Kerrey, to pay for the out year costs of the legislation.  (D&RelevanceD8
is a somewhat broader standard than germaneness but nevertheless places s
ignificant limits on what amendments may be offered to this tax bill.)

The Roth D&payforD8 amendment consists of an expansion of D&Roth
IRAs.D8   Converting D&conventional IRAsD8 to D&Roth lRAsD8 requires
depositors to pay tax on the money in their accounts;  the expanded
availability of Roth IRAs would therefore be estimated to bring in
additional revenues.

ISTEA: Tentative conference meeting at 4pm on Wednesday.
