        Here is the information we've gathered to date.   I've included data tables
        so it's 4 pages.   Elena, Bob Schoeni at CEA has all the backup data and
        is happy to answer questions next week in my absence.   He is also: doing
        some additional runs of characteristics associated with long-term welfare
        receipt from 96 and 97 CPS data, working on backing out child-only cases,
        and calculating welfare dependency by race as a way to control for
        population changes (i.e. what % of total white, black and hispanic
        population were on welfare in 94 vs 97) .==================== ATTACHMENT    1 ========

                                WELFARE CASE LOAD ANALYSIS

There are a number of factors that appear to contribute to the different rates at which the
caseloads are declining for different racial and ethnic groups. The primary factors are listed
below, along with currently available data. Staff are continuing to do additional analysis to
determine the magnitude of these factors.

The racial/ethnic composition of welfare caseloads has been changing gradually over the
last 25 years: whites rose from 38 percent in 1973 to a peak of 42 percent in 1983 and have
dropped steadily to 35 percent in 1997. The proportion of blacks has generally declined, from 46
percent in 1973 to 37 percent in 1997. The most significant trend is the increase in the Hispanic
portion of the caseload, from 13 percent in 1973 to 23 percent in 1997. However, this is not too
surprising given the rapid increase in the Hispanic population overall.


                            TOTAL         WHITE              BLACK         HISPANIC        OTHER

The question is how welfare reform may be affecting these historic trends. National data on the
racial/ethnic characteristics of welfare recipients are only available through June 1997, so it is
hard to gauge the impact of the past year when welfare reform efforts accelerated so rapidly.
States provided more recent data to the Times (generally through June 1998), but HHS has
concerns that some of these data may have problems, particularly NY and CA. They are
working with states to verify the data.

It is also worth noting that the caseload data only tells who is currently on the rolls; it does not
tell the rate at which different groups are entering and exiting. Analysis of entries and exits will
be conducted in the near future.

The number of white, black and Hispanic families receiving welfare have all dropped since
1994 (when caseloads peaked nationally, but the rate of decline has been greater for whites
than blacks, with an even slower decline for Hispanics.

               94                               % Change
Whites 1.9M             1.4 M           -26%
Blacks         l.8M             1.5M            -18%
Hispanics      l.OM               .9M                  -9%
                                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion
The changes are more dramatic than the actual mix of who is left on the caseloads, at least
on a national basis.


Whites 37%             35%
Blacks          36%           37%
Hispanics       20%           23%

There is some encouraging evidence from Census data that the employment rates of former
welfare recipients are increasing even faste.r for minorities than for whites, although the
actual rates and the disparity between groups remains disturbing. Between 1996 and 1997, the
percentage of all prior year welfare recipients who were employed in the next year increased by
28%. The increase was highest for blacks (33%), followed by Hispanics (22%) and whites
(21%).

Minorities on welfare disproportionately share characteristics that may make it harder to
Icave the rolls. These factors include: lower education levels, lower marriage rates, larger
families, isolation from areas with jobs, and employment and housing discrimination. March 95
Current Population Survey Data shows the following characteristics for public assistance
recipients in 1994:

Historical data confirms that minorities are more likely to remain on the welfare rolls
longer. At the same time, the proportion oflong-tenn recipients on the roils is increasing
slightly. This would partially explain why the current rate of caseload decline is slower for
minorities and why they are making up an increasing share of the welfare caseload.

The trends in marriage rates and births to unmarried women could contribute to an
increasing proportion of minority families going on welfare. While the proportion of
never-married single mothers is increasing for the entire population, the rate of is largest for
Hispanic women (based on CPS data).

In addition, the rate of births to unmarried teenagers remains much higher for blacks and
Hispanics than for whites. And, while the rate is decreasing significantly for blacks and slightly
for whites, it continues to increase for Hispanics. For example, between 1991 and 1996, the rate
of births to unmarried teenagers decreased 18% for blacks and 4% for whites, but increased 3%
for Hispanics.

Minorities are a disproportionately represented in child-only cases. To the extent that child
only cases are decreasing more slowly than cases headed by adults, this would appcar to
contribute to the increasing proportion of minorities on the caseload.

HHS is working on additional analysis of child only cases, by state and by reason, to determine
whether the magnitude of this factor on the changing racial composition of the caseloads
nationally and in specific states.
