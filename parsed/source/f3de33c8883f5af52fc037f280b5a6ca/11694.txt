TEXT:
HHS just sent over a draft press release on the Council's assessment of
the NAS report. Unfortunately, it contains the same objectionable·
language concerning "more bureaucratic layers." I will pass on to Jim
O'Hara our concerns.  I thought this might be important as you try to
resolve this issue with the Secretary. Cliff
