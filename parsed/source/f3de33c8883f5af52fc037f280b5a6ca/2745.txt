TEXT:
Here is a shot at striking the right balance on FLSA language for the
letter to the Hill.  Please give both me and Cynthia any comments.


The Administration strongly opposes the House Ways and Means Subcommittee
proposal on the minimum wage and welfare work requirements.  First, this
proposal is beyond the scope of the budget agreement. This proposal was
not included in the budget agreement between the White House and Congress
and should therefore not be included in the reconciliation bill.

Second, the Ways and Means Subcommittee proposal would undermine the
fundamental goals of welfare reform.  The Administration believes strongly
that everyone who can work, must work -- and that those who work must be
paid the minimum wage, whether they are coming off of welfare or not.   The
House Ways and Means Subcommittee proposal does not meet this test.   The
Administration stands ready to work with Congress and states to discuss
alternative proposals that do not undermine the minimum wage or weaken the
law's work requirements.
