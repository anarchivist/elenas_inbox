TEXT:
Elena -- I got a message on my voice mail today from Debbie Funk at Army
Times requesting a copy of the letter dated September 22 from Judith
Miller 'at the Pentagon regarding Defense's request for money from the
tobacco settlement. What, if anything, do you want me to do in response
to her message?    Thanks, Mary
