                      New Requirements on Immigrant Sponsors
                              Questions and Answers
                                 October 20, 1997


Q.     What is action is INS taking today that will effect individuals that sponsor legal
       immigrants into this country?

A.       Today, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) released guidelines that will, for
the first time, require sponsors of certain immigrants to meet minimum income requirements and
be financially responsible for the immigrants they bring to live in the United States. The new
requirements were mandated under the 1996 Immigration Law and will take effect on December
19,1997:

       The new requirements will mean that agencies that provide means-tested public benefits
to immigrants may enforce the legally binding affidavit of support against their sponsors. It
should be noted that most immigrants who are sponsored under the new affidavits are barred
under the immigration and welfare laws from federal means-tested public benefits for 5 years.

        In addition, the new affidavit requires the immigrant's sponsor to show an income of at
least 125% of the federal poverty level. Sponsors must show proof of current employment and
copies of their last 3 federal income tax returns.

Q.     Why did the INS derme "public means-tested benefits" for the affidavit so
       narrowly-- thereby limiting the number of welfare programs a sponsor will have to
       reimburse the government for?

A.       Federal agencies have been charged with defining this term and many others in a manner
that is consistent with the welfare law. They have determined that Federal means-tested public
benefits include Food Stamps, Medicaid, SSI, and Temporary Assistance to Needy Families.
State means-tested benefits are any public benefit for which no federal funds are provided that
a state has determined are means-tested public benefits. We are encouraging Federal and
state agencies to publicly announce which of their programs are means-tested public benefits.


Q.     Doesn't the new affidavit of support undermine the Nation's commitment to
       reuniting families? Is it a backdoor attempt to cut family reunification?

A.      We believe that they new legally enforceable affidavit of support is consistent with our
tradition of family reunification. It is our position that family members should be held
responsible for providing basic support for the family they bring into this country as immigrants--
and to be held liable if the immigrants they support use means-tested benefits. The new affidavit
provides sponsors with reasonable opportunity to qualify as sponsors, or find another person to
become a joint sponsor. We expect the new income requirement for sponsors to make it more
difficult for some families to reunite, and we raised concerns to this effect when the provision
                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion

was being considered in the immigration legislation last year.

Q.     How many immigrants will be affected by the new affidavit of support?

A.      INS estimates that approximately 565,000 family immigrants will submit affidavits of
support. INS does not have an estimate on the number of employment-based immigrants that
will be affected, but it is expected to be small.
