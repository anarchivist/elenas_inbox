          The ongoing debate over H.R. 1833, legislation to ban a
  certain abortion procedure commonly referred to as partial birth
  abortion, involves an issue as difficult -- indeed, painful -- as
  any confronting our citizens and public officials.   If the goal
  of those engaged in the debate is to solve a truly human problem
  rather than create a political issue, all participants in the
  discussion need to listen to and understand what the others are
  saying. unfortunately, President Clinton's clear, principled
  position on this legislation has been seriously misrepresented
, and misunderstood.
          President Clinton long has opposed late
 o
 -term abortions,
 except where necessary to protect the life or health of the
 mother.   As Governor of Arkansas, he signed into law a bill that
 barred third trimester abortions, with an appropriate exception
 for life or health.  He would sign a bill to do the same thing at
 the federal level if it were presented to him.
         The particular procedure at issue in H.R. 1833 posed a most
 difficult and disturbing issue for the President, which he
 studied and prayed about for many months.  The President
 ultimately came to believe that this rarely used procedure is
 justifiable as a last resort when doctors judge it necessary to
 save a woman's life or avert serious consequences to her health.
         Last month, the President was joined at the White House by
 five women who desperately wanted to have their babies and were
 devastated to learn that their babies had fatal conditions and
 would not live. These women wanted anything other than an
  "




      abortion, but were advised by their doctors that this procedure
      was their best chance to avert the risk of death or grave harm
      which, in some cases, would have included an inability to bear
      children.   For them, this was not about choice -- not about
      choosing against having a child.    Their babies were certain to
      perish before, during, or shortly after birth. The only question
      was how much grave damage they were going to suffer.
              The President vetoed HR 1833 because it did not provide an
      exception for the small number of compelling cases where the
      procedure is necessary to preserve life or protect against
      serious harm to health. The President has said repeatedly that
      he would sign legislation banning this procedure if Congress
      would add a limited exemption covering such cases.
              The President does not contend that the procedure is always
      used in circumstances that meet his standard     namely, that the
      procedure must be necessary to prevent death or serious adverse

      health consequences. The procedure sometimes may be used in
      other situations. But the President does not support such uses,
      does not defend them, and would sign appropriate legislation
      banning them.
      o
              Many who support this bill believe that any health exception
      is untenable because it could be stretched to cover everything.
      The President does not share this view.  It is not impossible -
      it is not beyond the ingenuity of Congress working with this
      administration - to draft a bill making absolutely clear that the
      procedure may be used only where a woman risks death or serious
      damage to her health, and in no other cases.

              President Clinton has implored Congress for months to send
      him a bill that contains such a carefully limited exception for
      serious harm to health.  In the interests of all who face this
      tragic situation, the President's offer to Congress remains on
      the table: Work with him to produce a bill that provides this
      limited exception, and he will sign it the moment it reaches his
      desk.
