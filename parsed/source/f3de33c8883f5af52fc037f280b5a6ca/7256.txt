Administration Announced New Rules To Improve Safety of Juice. On Sunday, we leaked
the announcement of two proposed regulations by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to
improve the safety of fruit and vegetable juices. The first regulation would require that all fruit
and vegetable juice processors implement a Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point
(HACCP) system which will ensure that processors take extra steps to reduce the numbers of
microorganisms that may be in their products. Retailers of packaged juice, as well as processors
who sell less than 40,000 gallons of fresh juice per year, would be exempt from this requirement.
 The second proposed rule would require any packaged untreated juice to be labeled with a
warning statement advising consumers ofthe potential risks of juice that has not been processed
to eliminate dangerous bacteria. This requirement will apply to retail and other processors who
package untreated juice for consumption off-site --such as grocery stores that squeeze and bottle
juice for home use. But retail sellers of juice for consumption on-site --such as restaurants and
children's lemonade stands --will be exempt from this labeling requirement. Although 98
percent of juice sold in the United States is pasteurized, the FDA estimates that there are up to
48,000 juice-related illnesses per year. In 1996, one sixteen-month-old girl died, and at least 66
others were sickened in the western United States and Canada from drinking untreated Odwalla
brand apple juice. The Administration received three days of positive press on this
announcement, including coverage on ABC News, CNN, every major newspaper, and a lead
story on CBS News on Tuesday.
