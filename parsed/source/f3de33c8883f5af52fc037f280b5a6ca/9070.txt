TEXT:
The Hill was briefed on the NAS study yesterday.   This is what they say is
in the report:
1.    Food safety should be based on science
2.    The statutes governing food safety need to be modified (although
there was no specific recommendation for how this should be done)
3.     There needs to be some central framework for dealing with food
safety -- this can be done in one of the following three ways:
         a.    a food safety czar
         b.    designate one of the agencies as the lead agency
         c.     create a new food safety agency
