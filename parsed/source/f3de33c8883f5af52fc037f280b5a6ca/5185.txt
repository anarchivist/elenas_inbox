                                  Talking Points

The letter is a written commitment by the President that:

1. Tobacco needs an independent source of funding and farmers are
entitled to a a dedicated source of revenue that will ensure the economic
stability in their communities, compensation for negative effects from the
settlement,. protecting the viability of their investments, and costs
associated with the tobacco program.

2. Commitment to the quota sy~tem. Tobacco farmers need a stable price
and that Congress is the appropriate place to have price set ..

3.   Tobacco farmers deserve a share of the world market share of the
American tobacco farmers and will work with Congress to guarantee a share.

4. Immunity for farmers to share in with tobacco manufacturers from
legislation.

5. Work with members to reform "Duty Drawback" so the system does not
provide an economic incentive to purchase foreign tobacco.
