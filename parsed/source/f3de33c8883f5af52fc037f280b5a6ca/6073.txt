TEXT:
I received Conrad's Public Health and Other Programs funding title from
HHS.  Conrad's staff has asked us to keep a very close hold on it.    It is
Title VI of the Conrad bill. The title spells out how funds from a
section 101(d) (2) (C) will be allocated and spent, but the draft provides
no clue on how much money will be in 101(d) (2) (C)   I will distribute it,
but in the meantime here is a summary:

The title proposes to divide the $$ into 12 buckets controlled by the
Secretary (I assume HHS) :

  1.    30% for smoking cessation to individuals and private,
non-profit entities;
  2.    25% for counter advertising;
  3.    15% to NIH for tobacco related biomedical research including
addiction research;
  4.    10% for "anti-tobacco" research, including prevention,
cessation, and social determents of smoking;
  5.       5% to states for school-based tobacco education programs;
  6.       5% to states for alcohol and illicit drug education for <18;
  7.       3% for assistance and compensation for those suffering from
tobacco-related illness;
  8.       2.5% to expand ASSIST and IMPACT;
  9.       1.76% for international tobacco control to WHO and foreign
countries;
10.        1% for college tobacco education programs targeting 18-24;
11.        1% for event sponsorship; and
12.        0.083% for the American Center on Global Health and Tobacco
(a new private, not-for-profit corporation) and
                          associated trust fund.
