  Subject: Q&A on NAFTA & UR Impact on Imported Food -Forwarded

  The attached paper is interesting in underscoring two points: The
  increase in u.S. food imports is not
  related to recent trade agreements (UR or Nafta) but is driven by consumer
  demand; and while that
  growth has been substantial since 1993 (53%) this is a systems and
  resources issue as to
  inspections (exactly how the Administration is handling it), not a trade
  issue.

  Is Sec. Glickman responding to the Gerth article? If so information in
  the attached should be included
  in the response letter.  I'll be on the Hill for the next couple of hours,
  please reach Chris in my office if
  you need immediate information.  Please advise.  jz

                           Trade Liberalization and U_S. Imports of
                                 Fresh Fruits and Vegetables

Question: What impact have the NAFTA and Uruguay Round had on U.S. imports of fresh fruits
and vegetables?

Answer: The NAFTA and Uruguay Round have had a negligible impact on U.S. imports of fresh
fruits and vegetables. Prior to these agreements, U.S. import tariffs on fresh fruits and
vegetables were relatively low. The United States market was open to imports, and the tariff
reductions called for in NAFTA and the Uruguay Round were very small. Other factors such as
currency fluctuations, weather conditions, and consumer demand in the United States account for
nearly all of the rise in fresh fruit and vegetable imports.

For those few commodities where U.S. protection was high--imports of cantaloupe from Mexico
were 25% prior to the NAFTA for exarnple--Iong phase in periods for tariff reductions and the
fact that we are just four years into N AFTA have meant that today's import protection remains
relatively high.

In Secretary Glickman's report to the Congress on the Effects o/the NAFTA on Agriculture and
the Rural Economy, USDA concluded that:

·      Although U.S. agricultural imports from the NAFTA partners grew from $7.3 billion in
       1993 to $10.5 billion in 1996, U.S. agricultural imports from Mexico and Canada were
       only about 3 to 5 percent higher, respectively, in 1996 than they would have been without
       the agreement.

·      For U.S. imports of winter vegetables, only a small increase in imports can be attributed
       directly to the NAFTA tariff changes. NAFTA tariff reductions on U.S. imports of
       winter tomatoes from Mexico have been very small, less than 1.5 percent on an ad
       valorem basis. The peso crisis in Mexico, technological shifts in tomato production, and
       unusual weather in Florida were far more important that the NAFTA tariff reductions.

·      Because Mexico's tariffs on agricultural imports from the United States were much
       higher than U.S. tariffs on agricultural imports from Mexico, Mexican tariffs have been
       reduced substantially more than U.S. tariffs.

Background

U.S. total imports of fresh fruits and vegetables (excluding bananas) were $2.95 billion in 1996,
up 53 percent from the $1.93 billion imported in 1993 (the year before NAFTA began).

U.S. imports of fresh fruits and vegetables (excluding bananas from Mexico were $1.61 billion in
1996, up 52 percent from the $1.06 billion imported in 1993.
