TEXT:
I have copies of the Bond bill available in Room 436.    It is unclear in
intent but appears to prohibit a much broader range of activities than our
June draft.   It has internal inconsistencies that would appear to make it
difficult to determine if any research involving the use of human cells in
somatic cell nuclear transfer might be carried out.   The bulk of the
language is devoted to establishing a Commission to promote a national
dialogue on bioethics.

I hope to get a draft letter on Kennedy-Feinstein around shortly.     That
bill will dropped "shortly" but probably not today.
