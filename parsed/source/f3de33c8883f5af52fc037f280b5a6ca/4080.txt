This is the preliminary paragraph to replace the last sentence of the
paragraph on the black caucus.  I will probably edit it as I get return
phone calls from some members. Thanks Andy

The issue of testing is a divisive issue among Caucus members and can be
expected to split the Caucus. While Representative Major Owens (NY)
opposes the national tests, other members of the Caucus on the Education &
the Workforce Committee, including Representatives Harold Ford (TN) and
Bobby Scott (VA) "have indicated support for the development of the
tests.
