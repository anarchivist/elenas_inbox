                       PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
               RADIO ADDRESS ON MEDICARE CANCER SCREENING
                              December 27,1997

        Good morning. The holidays are a time when families come together to celebrate
 the season with love. And they remind us of our bonds of duty to care for one another.
 Today, I would like to talk to you about how we are enlarging the blanket of Medicare
 protection to honor our parents and grandparents in important new ways in the new year.

        Looking back over 1997, it's clear that we achieved major reforms of the Medicare
 system that will hCIp Americans live healthier, happier, and longer lives. This year's
 bipartisan balilDced budget agreement reafnrmed our commitment to preserving and
 strengthening Medicare. We extended the life of the Medicare Trust Fund until at least
 2010. We made Medicare protection more affordable for low-income Americans. We
 modernized the Medicare system by expanding choice, injecting competition, and
 controlling costs. And we created a blue-ribbon commission that will examine ways in
 which we can ensure that Medicare will serve baby boomers and our children as well as it
 has our parents.

       , Now, we will begin the New Year by implementing expanded Medicare benefits so
 that they provide greater protection to Americans in our fight against cancer. That's why,
 on New Year's Day, we will introduce a series of changes in Medicare that will make
 screening, prevention, and detection of cancer more affordable and frequent. We are
 ringing in the New Year resolved to take new steps in our battle against cancer - one of
 mankind's oldest foes.

        First, for the first time, we will guarantee the option of annual mammograms for
 every woman over 40. And, by waiving the deductible, we will make annual breast cancer
 screenings more affordable. By making mammograms more accessible and detecting
 cancer earlier, we can significantly increase the likelihood of successful treatment for this
 disease. And I would like to thank Hillary for her long-standing campaign to encourage
 older women to get regular mammograms -- and to make sure that no woman is denied this
 crucial test because they can't afford it.

         Second, we are expanding coverage for the early detection of cervical cancer. We
  have sophisticated tests to pick up early signs of cervical cancer and, from now on,
. Medicare will pay for regular access to this life-saving technology.

        And third, for the first time, we will now cover regular examinations for colorectal
 cancer. When we catch this cancer early, we can beat it more than 90% of the time.

        Nearly every family has been touched by the hand of cancer. My own mother
 passed away because of breast cancer and I miss her dearly - especially at this time of the

     year. And that's why these actions are so important. By detecting cancer early on, we
     offer our loved ones the greatest gifts of aU - the gifts of life, of health, and of many
     holidays to come.

             Thank's for listening. Happy Holidays and have a happy - and healthy - New
     Year.
