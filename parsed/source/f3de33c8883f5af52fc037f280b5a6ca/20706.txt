TEXT:
As you know, Podesta pushed to have a Thursday presidential event on rural
issues. NEC clearly wants to take the lead on the event, but does not
have a clear picture of what to announce.

The most likely scenario is we end up pushing for the rural agenda items
that are currently pending in Congress.  These could include:    funding
the Fund for Rural America; the Disaster Assistance plan done last week;
rural school construction and food safety.   In addition, we can talk about
telemedicine, long distance learning, the transportation bill and push for
free trade (maybe saying something on sanctions). This is what I talked
about with Greg Frazier, Glickman's COS.   Sperling may have a different
picture, if so, Sally and Jon Kaplan haven't said.
If this sounds ok, I'll push it at the 1 pm meeting. I mentioned to Paul
we will would need the telemedicine and school construction pieces put
together by Chris and Mike. There was a rumor Sperling was coming to the
meeting (they scheduled it so he could attend) .
