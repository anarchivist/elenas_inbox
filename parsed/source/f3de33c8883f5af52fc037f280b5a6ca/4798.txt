TEXT:
Here are my suggestions for a starting point on the meeting.

I.    Update

               Any strategy update/description of the residence meeting
                    Congress out of session, R.  appeal of linking the issue
to drugs,
                    danger of legal fees

                Events

                    Second hand smoke settlement
                    Pentagon letter story
                    Medicaid letter
                    Pentagon
                    Gingrich response

               Reports from agencies
                    Int'l-- Turollo is meeting with Shalala next week
                   USDA-- Rawls is in Chile
                   HHS


II.    Next Steps

           {Thoughts on timetable for how this might move
           Conversations with Hilley/Bowles
           Visits to members}
           VPOTUS report
           POTUS event ideas (something to announce to keep pressure on?)



I think we should sit down in a small group and talk some planning
issues: a POTUS event, some visits to members by you, the feasibility of
going ahead with a budget style strategy.
