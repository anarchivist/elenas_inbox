TEXT:
OMB, with our support, recommended changes to strengthen the termination
language for bilingual grants to ensure that the Secretary denies 4th year
(continuation) grants in circumstances where he does not approve the
grantee's improvement plan or determines that the grantee is not making
continuous and sufficient progress (see below).

ED staff initially agreed to the changes, but Mike Smith did not approve
the change.   Barbara Chow is planning to discuss this with Mike -- as she
supports her staff's position.   I am forwarding to you in case you want
to weigh in on this issue.

OMB Proposed Change
Comprehensive school Grants and Systemwide Improvement Grants.    The
proposed language actually weakens the current law with regard to
terminations. We suggest paragraph (iii) read as follows.

 "(iii)  If the Secretary does not approve a recipient's program
 improvement plan under clause (i), or if the Secretary determines that the
 recipient is not making sufficient progress in implementing such plan
 continuous and substantial progress in assisting children and youth with
 limited English proficiency to learn English and achieve to challenging
 State content and performance standards, the Secretary shall take such
 other action as he or she determines to be appropriate, such as the denial
-of deny a continuation award.";
