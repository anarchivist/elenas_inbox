TEXT:
           I have gotten the earliest time possible -- the HHS meeting with
           John Monohan will be from 12:30 am to 2:00 pm on Friday, November
           15 in OEOB 211 (yes, HHS just called and asked for 1 1/2 hours).
           Please let me know if you have a conflict.  I'll be confirming
           soon with HHS.  Thanks for your help.
