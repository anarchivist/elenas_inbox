        SAFETY LEGISLATION AND REPORT TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF
            IMPORTED AND DOMESTIC FRUITS AND VEGETABLES
                             March 4,1998

Today President Clinton will announce the introduction of legislation by Senators Milkulski and
Kennedy to ensure the safety of all imported foods, including fruits and vegetables. This
legislation will enhance the Food and Drug Administration's authority to prevent the import of
fruits, vegetables, and other food products that do not meet u.S. food safety requirements. The
President also will announce the release of a report that provides a blueprint on how the
Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Department of Agriculture (USDA)
will work cooperatively with the agricultural community to develop guidance on good
agricultural and manufacturing practices for fruits and vegetables.

Enhanced FDA Oversight for Imported Foods. The food safety legislation to be introduced
today in the Senate will provide greater assurance that imported foods meet U.S. food safety
requirements or achieve the same level of protection required for comparable domestic products.
The President will call on Congress to promptly enact this crucial next step in improving the
safety of all the food that reaches Americans' tables. The legislation also will permit the FDA to
halt imports from countries or facilities that do not allow FDA inspections to occur. This
legislation gives FDA authority that is comparable to USDA's existing authority to prevent the
importation of unsafe meat and poultry. The President already has committed to providing
approximately $25 million in his Fiscal Year 1999 budget to enable the FDA to dramatically
expand its international food inspection force. Reps. Eshoo and Pallone previously have
introduced this legislation in the House of Representatives.

Development of Guidance on Good Agricultural and Manufacturing Practices. The
President will announce the release of a report that provides a roadmap for the Secretary of
Health and Human Services, in partnership with the Secretary of Agriculture and in cooperation
with the agricultural community, to develop guidance on good agricultural and manufacturing
practices. This report outlines the progress already made -- and the measures still to be taken --
to develop guidance for the growing, processing, shipping, and marketing offniits and vegetables
by October 1998. The guidance -- the first-ever specific safety standards for fruits and
vegetables -- will address potential food safety problems throughout the production and
distribution system and help ensure the sanitation and safety practices of all those seeking to sell
produce in the U.S. market. The report also provides both short- and long-term plans for
technical assistance, education, and outreach activities to support the appropriate application of
the guidance.

            Clinton Administration Accomplishments In Improving Food Safety

The President's announcement builds on a strong record of food safety initiatives, ensuring that
Americans eat the safest possible food. The Administration has put into place improved safety
standards for meat, poultry, and seafood products, and has begun the process of developing
enhanced standards for fruit and vegetable juices. The Administration also has expanded
research, education, and surveillance activities throughout the food safety system.

approximate $101 million increase for food safety initiatives.

*May, 1997. Administration announces comprehensive new initiative to improve the safety of

program, including measures to improve surveillance, outbreak response, education, and

data to help stop foodborne disease outbreaks quickly and to improve prevention systems further.

regulation of pesticides by FDA and EPA and puts important new public-health protections in
place, especially for children.

poultry inspection system for the first time in 90 years. New standards help prevent E.coli
bacteria contamination in meat.

regulatory programs to require food industries to design and implement preventive measures and
increase the industries' responsibility for and control of their safety assurance actions.

* 1994. CDC embarks on strategic program to detect, prevent, and control emerging infectious
disease threats, some of which are food borne, making significant progress toward this goal in
each successive year.
