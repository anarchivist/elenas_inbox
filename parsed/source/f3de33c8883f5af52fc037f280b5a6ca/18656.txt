Attached is an early draft of Ann's version of the 1998 Democratic Agenda
paper for Thursday's event based primarily on two documents from the House
and Senate. It is being looked at by House and Senate people.   [The only
comment so far is that the Senate wants to add a line on science and
technology]. Please get any comments on it back to me or to Ann as soon
as possible. Thanks.

                          THE   1998 DEMOCRATIC AGENDA


Democrats want to address real problems affecting Americans by saving social security for
all, reducing class size for our children by hiring 100,000 new teachers and making sure
that doctors and patients together, not insurance companies, make health care decisions.

These are the issues that define us as Democrats and most clearly outline our goals for
strengthening American families. Together with the agenda we are presenting today, these
issues serve as our legislative roadmap to maintaining the strong economy we currently
enjoy and addressing the concerns families wrestle with everyday; preparing for
retirement, educating children and raising them in safe neighborhoods, and having access
to quality, affordable health care.

To further these goals we are committed to a 1998 Democratic legislative agenda that
includes:

·      Cutting The Deficit And Saving Social Security First. By passing a balanced budget
       three years ahead of schedule, we will be able to cut the deficit to zero and pay for
       every proposal in the agenda without touching Social Security.

·      Reducing Average Class Size And Modernizing Schools. We will reduce average
       class size to 18 students per classroom for the first through third grades by helping
       local communities hire 100,00 new teachers with certified skills to teach basic
       reading and math and provide tax credits to local communities to build and
       renovate over 5,000 schools.

·      Establishing A Patients Bill Of Rights. Insurance reform will guarantee patient
       access to specialists, coverage for emergency services, disclosure of information,
       independent appeals for denied benefits, confidentiality, and patient participation in
       medical decisions.
·      Raising the Minimum Wage. Giving approximately 12 million working Americans a
       pay raise by increasing the minimum wage 50 cents over the next 2 years.


A full list of the 1998 Democratic agenda is attached.
