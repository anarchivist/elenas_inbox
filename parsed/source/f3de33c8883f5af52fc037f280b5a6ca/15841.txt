           TEXT:
           Here's Mark Mazur's response to my question of whether we are now
           supporting a refundable child care tax credit.  He says the internal tax
           group is willing to propose a refundable $500 child tax credit -- which
           would not be earmarked specifically toward child care -- as a way of
           increasing the tax breaks to the $85 billion level.   This Administration
           proposal has not been shared -- at least not to his knowledge, he said --
           because the decision was made to comment on Archer first.

           Cynthia,
           The NEC has led a small group of Administration folks in looking at the
           President's tax package and trying to design something that would fit
           within
           the parameters of the balanced budget tax ~ut (as you know, the balanced
           budget
           agreement has a net tax cut of $85 billion over 5 years, while the
           President's
           budget has a net tax cut of about $25 billion over 5 years).  In trying to
           figure out how to "spend" the extra $60 billion in tax cuts, the group
           decided
           that it would make sense to have the $500 per child tax credit to be
           refundable. This decision has not been publicized, since it didn't seem
           helpful to have the Administration craft its own larger tax cut package so


soon
after the budget release.  It was thought to be a better strategy to see
what
the Republicans put together and then attack it, if warranted.

Please call if you have any questions.
    Mark
