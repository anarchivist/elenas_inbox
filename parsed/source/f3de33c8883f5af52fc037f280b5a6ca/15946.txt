Q:    Recently columnist William Raspberry, long a public schools loyalist, has said the time
      has come to try out vouchers where the public schools are failing. Earlier this year, one of
      your former advisors, Bill Galston, called for a national experiment on the effectiveness
      of private school vouchers. Given the numerous horror stories of how public schools are
      failing students in our cities today, do you remain opposed to private school vouchers?

A:    We can and should work to provide our students with the safe and disciplined
      public schools and the world class education they deserve. I was so proud last week
      when we released the results of the international math and science tests for the 4th
      grade. Our students tied for the 2nd in the world in science, and scored above the
      international average in math. If we keep working at it, we can create a generation
      of students who are among the best educated in the world.

      Many of our urban public schools are doing a fine job, and they deserve our support.
      However, where schools are failing, we need to take tough action and fix them, by getting
      rid of watered-down curriculum and retraining the teaching staff. If the school still
      doesn't respond, then it should be closed down and reopened with a new staff that will
      get the job done.

      Moreover, every family should have the right to choose which public school their child
      will attend. I have challenged every state to pass a charter school law that allows parents
      and teachers to start new public charter schools that stay open only as long they do a good
      job. In fact, I have proposed nearly doubling the charter school start-up program (to
      $100 million next year) to help start 3,000 charter schools over the next several years.

      While I support public school choice, I continue to oppose federally funded tuition
      vouchers for private elementary and secondary schools. I also oppose state funded and
      locally funded vouchers. Vouchers take money away from public schools, and
      controversy over vouchers distracts communities from the hard work of improving our
      schools.
