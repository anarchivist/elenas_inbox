Faith Community Challenge

DPC is working with Flo McAfee and Linda Lader to organize this effort.
Flo McAfee has started approaching different sects of the faith community
to invite her involvement in the welfare to work effort. None has put
forward a formal proposal but many are considering various ideas.

As you know, the First Lady will likely be speaking Wednesday night, and
possibly Thursday, after you speak, to those involved in the Congressional
Prayer breakfast (a group of moderate to conservative members of the
religious community).  The First Lady will invite this group to become
involved in the welfare to work effort and will talk about an adopt a
family program. Congressmen Hall and Wolf are organizing this effort.

Over the next few weeks we will talk with other representatives of various
religious communities and begin to organize a wider effort.  Our time line
is about a month.
