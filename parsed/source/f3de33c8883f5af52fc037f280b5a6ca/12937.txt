                                Combating Racial Profiling
                                       June 9,1999

Today at a Justice Department conference, President Clinton will chair a roundtable discussion
with leaders from civil rights and law enforcement organizations on ways to build trust between
police and the communities they serve. To address the issue of racial profiling, the President
will direct federal law enforcement agencies to begin collecting and reporting data on the race,
ethnicity, and gender of the individuals they stop and search. The President also will call on
Congress to pass legislation to promote data collection and reporting by state and local law
enforcement agencies.

Getting the Facts on Racial Profilillg

       Leading by example. No person should be targeted by law enforcement because of the
       color of his or her skin. Stopping or searching individuals on the basis of race is not
       consistent with our commitment to equal justice under law and is not effective law
       enforcement policy. Racial profiling is simply wrong. As a necessary step to combat
       this problem, we need to learn the hard facts about when and where it occurs. That is
       why the President will direct the Departments of Justice, Treasury and Interior to:

              (1) begin collecting data on the race, ethnicity, and gender of individuals subject
              to traffic and pedestrian stops, inspections at entries into the U.S., and certain
              other searches by federal law enforcement agencies including the Immigration and
              Naturalization Service, Drug Enforcement Agency, Customs Service, and
              National Park Service; and

              (2) after one year, report on the findings of the new data collection system and
              make additional recommendations based on those findings on how to ensure
              greater fairness in federal law enforcement's procedures.

       Helping states and localities. The President also will support legislation introduced by
       Representative John Conyers (D-MI) to establish a new federal grant program to assist
       state and local law enforcement agencies to implement similar data collection systems.
       This legislation also will authorize the Attorney General to develop a nationwide sample
       and issue a report on the number and nature of traffic stops conducted by state and local
       enforcement throughout the country.

       Surveying the American public. As recently announced by the Attorney General, this
       year the Justice Department will amend its National Crime Victimization Survey
       and begin asking Americans about their experiences with traffic stops, police use of
       force, and police misconduct. This new information will help measure our success
       in building trust and improving relations between law enforcement and the
       community.

    More Progressive Policing for the 21st Century

           Continuing the community policing revolution. To make our communities safer and
           stronger, we must enhance our commitment to community policing. The 21 st Century
           Policing Initiative contained in the President's crime bill extends his successful
           community policing initiative and contains several measures to help strengthen the
           integrity and ethics of police forces across the country. Specifically, his crime bill
           includes: (1) $20 million to expand police integrity and ethics training; (2) $20 million for
           police scholarships to promote the best educated police force possible; (3) $2 million for
           improved minority recruitment to help make sure police departments reflect the diversity
           of the communities they represent; (4) $10 million to help police departments purchase
           more video cameras to protect both the safety of officers and the rights of the individuals
           they stop; and (5) $5 million to establish citizen police academies to engage community
           residents in the fight against crime.
