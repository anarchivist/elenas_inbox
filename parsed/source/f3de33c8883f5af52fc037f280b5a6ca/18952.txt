TEXT:
Elena,
I have spoken with Ceci Rouse at NEC re: next steps on the H1B issue. We
are going to pull together a meeting for tomorrow morning at lOam with WH
folks and the agency reps (INS, Labor, Commerce, State, Education) to
discuss the Kennedy and Abraham bills. Ceci is going to ask the Labor
Dept. to analyze and compare the two approaches for us (particularly the
different approaches to long-term solutions included in the bills).   I
left Peter a message, asking that he attend to give us the leg.
perspective (i.e., how quickly do we have to move, etc.).
NEC would like to get back with the industry folks early next week.

Julie
