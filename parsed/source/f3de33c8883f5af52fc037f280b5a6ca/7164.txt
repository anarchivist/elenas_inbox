TEXT:
        I talked with Norm Ornstein and several others involved with the
Gore Commission on Public Interest Broadcasting.  Here is the current
status:

        ornstein believes he can get a free television compromise among
the commission members which would provide 5 minutes of free air time from
each broadcaster over each night the last month of a national campaign.
This is approximately 1 hour and 30 minutes per broadcaster.  It is not
clear what the format would be (debate, interview, or statement from a
candidate). This is basically the same idea Paul Taylor has put forth to
all the major networks for the upcoming election cycle.

        In addition, Ornstein wants the Gore Commission to recommend to
Congress that it repeal the "lowest unit rate" and put in its place a new
law which would provide any candidate who buys 2 minutes of air time with
an additional minute of air time.

        Finally, there is a proposal to create an additional digit~l,
PBS-like channel which would provide air time for public interest
broadcasting including candidate info shows, etc.

         There are three problems with this proposal.   First, the 5 minutes
 per night of air time will not have any significant impact on reducing the
 cost of campaign advertising. A candidate will be lucky to get one or two
'minutes in the final month of free air time. Second, removing the lowest
 unit rate requirement requires congressional approval.   Finally" it is
 unlikely a large majority of Americans would watch campaign commercials on
 a PBS-like station.

        We are working with Congressional and public interest groups to
place pressure on the Gore Commission and to try to change the focus of
the debate to one which talks about how television can help reduce the
high cost of campaigning.  I will keep you posted.
