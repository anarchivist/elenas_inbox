TEXT:
Tomorrow morning, the Ways and Means Committee is scheduled to mark-up its
home health proposal. HCFA will be in attendance to represent the
Administration.
If all goes according to rumor, Congressman Thomas will pay for his $1.4
billion proposal from the surplus. Although we will say nice things about
the policy, we will oppose the financing source. Moreover, we will not
commit to any specific Medicare savings offset to pay for this, or any
other, home health care proposal.
