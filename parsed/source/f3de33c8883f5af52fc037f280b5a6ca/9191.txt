TEXT:
I've included a summary of the Food Stamp fraud announcements for the
weekly as Paul suggested (see below).  I do have two somewhat unresolved
issues I was going to raise at our team leaders meeting. They may not
merit a change to the weekly, but let me raise them now:

Both issues relate to the directive regarding using SSA's death data.

(1) We have a choice about to what extent we mandate use of SSA's death
data.   By requiring SSA to make this death data available to states (by
adding it to the existing system states must use to verify social
Security numbers) we will essentially require states to check against the
death data when a family applies for assistance. We mayor may not be
making the check mandatory when a family's benefits are redetermined
(about once a year) -- USDA is checking. To require states to check their
entire caseload periodically, we may need to direct USDA to issue a new r
egulation requiring that.  States would I'm sure prefer the option to
check the databases periodically without the mandate.  At the same time,
Senator Lugar has a bill that would make a statutory change (not really
necessary if we do a reg) requiring states to do periodic matches.   I will
have more definitive information by Tuesday, so we can decide then.

 (2) We could make a TANF and Medicaid announcement out of this as well.
By requiring SSA to make this death data available to states (by adding
it to the existing system states must use to verify Social Security
numbers) it will also be used by state workers determining eligibility for
TANF and Medicaid.  The same mandatory/optional issues described above
would apply -- in order to make it mandatory for states to periodically
check their Medicaid databases against the SSA death database, we would
have to amend a Medicaid or TANF regulation.  Thus we could hold these for
a future announcement.  What do you think?

FYI: the Social Security death master files contains records on 60,000
people. They get reports from funeral homes, relatives, Treasury Dept,


the Post Office, and state   records.  They do not verify the data except
when they get a match with   their social security files.  Thus, the Food
Stamp/TANF/Medicaid agency   that got a match would need to verify the
information before cutting   off benefits.

Weekly

        Welfare Reform -- Food Stamp Fraud: We are preparing three anti-Food
Stamp fraud announcements for you to make as part of a radio address on
the 12th or the 19th. We have prepared directives that will: 1) Ensure
that Food Stamp receipients who die are immediately removed from the
rolls, by requiring the Social Security Administration to share its death
records with Food Stamp program;   2) Require USDA to develop a plan to
create an interstate matching system to ensure Food Stamp recipients are
not receiving benefits in mUltiple states; and 3) Require Treasury to
collect (through offset of federal payments and other means) unpaid fines
owed by retailers that have violated Food Stamp rules, such as exchanging
Food Stamps for cash. The Food Stamp program provides nutritional
assistance to 19 « million Americans. Three-fifths of households contain
children, and one third have elderly or disabled members.
