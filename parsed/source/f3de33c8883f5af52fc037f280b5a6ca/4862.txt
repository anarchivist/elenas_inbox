TEXT:
If we are going to do the sexual orientation non-discrimination executive
order before the President's speech at the Human Rights Campaign dinner on
Saturday, November 8th -- and I think we should -- I think we should do it
next Friday, October 24th. The only other possibilities are Friday,
October 31st (Halloween) or Friday, November 7th (the day before the
dinner). As I have discussed with Bruce, as the order would only re-state
existing federal policy by bringing together the existing patchwork of Depa
rtmental regulations, I think we can do this with very little, if any,
fanfare.
Mary tells me that OMB has had the order out for comment and as I
understand it, the informal deadline for such has passed. Also, rumors
have begun to leak out from the agencies that this is in the works, so at
this point we should probably do it sooner rather than later.
Does this sound right to you all? What needs to be done to work within
this timeline?
