TEXT:
I met recently with Sarah Brown of the National Campaign to Prevent Teen
Pregnancy to find out more about their upcoming plans, some of which I
think we may want to become involved in (I've drafted a separate events
memo I'll send you shortly).

Besides possible events, she asked for the President's help in two areas:

        1) Could he help them engage Whoopi Goldberg, who is a member of
their board, but is not very active. They would like to do forums of
teens around the country with her as moderator.

        2) Would he make some phone calls, as he apparently did last time,
if needed to help them get new board members.
