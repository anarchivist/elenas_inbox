TEXT:
I think it would be extremely helpful to have a meeting on the DC charter
school issue sometime before too late tomorrow afternoon.   Elena, if you
agree, could Laura set the mtg up?
I have heard no word yet from OMB whether Jack Lew has reached Alice
Rivlin, and I am not completely certain how much urgency he or OMB may
feel about making this call. Meanwhile,
the Senate bill could still come up later this week, and the House full
committee will mark up the appropriations bill on Thursday. We probably
will need to agree on SAP language on these tomorrow afternoon, and agree
on a strategy for dealing with the Senate.      -- Jon
