 MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

 FROM:         Bruce Reed
               Elena Kagan

RE:            DPC Weekly Report



         Tobacco --Update: On Thursday, Senator Daschle f"Iled a cloture petition in order
  to bring debate to a close. The cloture vote will take place on Tuesday. The Senate will
. also vote on Tuesday on a Coverdell amendment which allocates over $3 billion a year on
  anti-drug efforts, significantly reducing funding available for public health and research.
  We. are working to draft a scaled down version ofthe Coverdell amendment, in order to
  attract the votes of those members who might otherwise support Coverdell but also wish to
  provide significant funding for public health and rese~rch.

         Senator Gramm continues to modify his pending marriage penalty amendment.
 The latest version would cost $13 billion over the first four years, or 28.4 percent of the
 $45.7 billion in spending under the McCain bill. If funding for states and farmers is held
 constant, funding for public health and research would be reduced by _ percent. Over
 the next five years, the Gramm amendment would spend an additional $30 billion on tax
 cuts, or 42 percent of the $71.1 billion in the McCain bill, completely eliminating funding
 for public health and research, and reducing funding for farmers by _ percent. Between
 2008 and 2022, the Gramm amendment would absorb $225 billion, or 78 percent, of the
 $289.5 billion in the McCain bill, leaving no funding available for public health, research
 or farmers, and reducing state funding by _ percent.

        In order to attract votes away from the Gramm amendment while preserving
 funding for public health and research, Senator Daschle plans to offer an alternative tax
 cut which would provide married couples with a 20 percent deduction against the
 lower-earning spouse's income, phased out between $50,000 and $60,000 of income. The
 amendment would also provide full-deductibility of health insurance costs for the
 self-employed. The Daschle amendment would cost significantly less than the Grariun
 amendment, and targets tax relief at those couples who are actually penalized by the tax
 code.

        On Thursday, the Senate failed to table, by a vote of 29-66, Senator Durbin's second
 degree amendment to strengthen the company-specific look back penalties. Earlier in the
                                                                Hex·Dump Conversion

week, the Senate adopted a McCain amendment by voice vote which restored $3 billion in
funding to the VA for smoking-related illnesses.

        The House has still not taken up tobacco legislation. On Wednesday, Larry,
Erskine and I met with Representative Waxman to seek his advice on how to jump-start
the process in the House. Waxman believes that the Hansen-Meehan bill is a viable
vehicle in the House, given that it has 90 cosponsors (including 11 Republicans). He urged
us to issue a stronger endorsement of the Hansen-Meehan bill that clearly states that you
would sign the bill provided it includes adequate assistance to farmers and farming
communities. We [are preparing such a statement] [issued such a statement on Friday
when you were in Boston].

       Equal Pay -- Equal Pay Act 35th Anniversary: You, along with the Vice President
and the First Lady, are scheduled to participate in an event on Wednesday to commemorate the
35th anniversary of President Kennedy's signing of the Equal Pay Act in 1963. Dr. Dorothy
Height, who attended the signing in 1963, is also expected to participate. You will (1) announce
a Council of Economic Advisors report on the wage gap and (2) urge Congress to pass Senator
Daschle's and Congresswoman DeLauro's equal pay bills, which the Vice President supported at
an event on April 2.

        Drugs -- Drug Courts: On Thursday, the National Center on Addiction and Substance
Abuse (CASA) released the first major review of the effectiveness of drug courts. The CASA
study was commissioned by the National Association of Drug Court Professionals (NADCP), a
bipartisan group of judges, prosecutors, treatment providers and others, working to implement
effective drug courts across the country. The study found that drug courts provide more
comprehensive supervision, monitoring, testing, and treatment than other forms of community
supervision of drug offenders. Specifically, the report cites that 55% of drug courts require at
least two drug tests per week; 35% require weekly tests; and 10% require tests every other week.
In comparison, under probation supervision, 52% of jurisdictions reported monthly drug testing;
8% tested weekly; and 33% tested on a less frequent, or random basis. In addition, CASA found
that drug use and criminal behavior were substantially reduced while offenders were under drug
court supervision, as well as after leaving the program. Drug courts have flourished in the past
few years, due largely to the 1994 Crime Act which authorized the first-ever federal funding for
drug courts. Between 1995 and 1997, the Justice Department provided $56 million to drug
courts, and as of last month, there were drug courts in 275 jurisdictions.

       Welfare Reform --Urban Challenges: You recently asked about areas where there may
be insufficient jobs for those leaving the welfare rolls. While there are areas--both urban
and rural--where unemployment remains high and job opportunities lag behind, there is
still little solid or widespread evidence that people are being pushed off the rolls without
jobs. (The New York study that received a lot of attention was preliminary and had
serious flaws.) Only a small number of welfare recipients in a handful of states have hit
time limits yet. State studies find 50-65 percent of those leaving the rolls are working. Early


                                               2
                                                       Hex-Dump Conversion
evidence suggests that about half those who leave due to sanctions are working; others rely
on family, or other public and private social services. It is difficult to determine how many
more people would now be leaving the rolls if there were more jobs available in their area.

        Caseload declines are not entirely related to employment opportunities; the extent to
which people leave the rolls is also a function of different state policies. States such as IL
and MN have generous 'make work pay' incentives which allow people to combine welfare
with work for a longer period of time. Other states have immediate work requirements,
shorter time limits, or stricter sanctions that accelerate movement off the rolls (MA, WI).
Other states have just been slower to implement welfare reform so it is too early to see the
impact ofthese changes (CA, W A). In addition, some individuals cannot take advantage
of existing job opportunities due to child care, transportation, or skills mismatch issues.

       Nevertheless, a recent Brookings study of welfare caseload trends in 23 major cities
and urban counties reveals some interesting trends. Between 1996 and 1997, caseloads
declined in all of the areas studied, ranging from a 4 percent drop in Bridgeport to a 29
percent drop in Milwaukee. Caseloads dropped less dramatically (5-10 percent decline) in
Los Angeles, St. Louis, Seattle, and Cleveland. San Francisco, New York, Boston, Wayne
Co, Pittsburgh, Indianapolis, Chicago and Denver all experienced 10-15 percent declines,
and caseloads in Miami dropped 17 percent. 1998 welfare caseload data is not yet
available at the sub-state level.
       The relationship between caseload declines and economic factors is not clear-cut in
these cities. For example, Chicago has the largest caseload decline among big cities even
though its drop in unemployment and growth in employment are slower than Los Angeles,
where caseloads have declined more slowly. Based on economic and employment factors,
caseload size, and other issues, Los Angeles, Philadelphia and New York are among the
places that face some special challenges and that we need to pay close attention to over the
next year.

        The Welfare-to-Work Competitive grants you announced on May 27th are targeted
at the hardest-to-place welfare recipients in high poverty/high welfare areas, with about 70
percent of the funds going to urban areas. DOL approved 4 grants totaling $16 million in
Los Angeles; 2 grants totaling $10 million in NYC; 3 grants totaling $11 million in Chicago;
and 2 grants totaling $6.3 million in Philadelphia. The Welfare to Work Partnership's
eight-city campaign with the Enterprise Foundation will also help connect welfare
recipients with private employers in areas with high concentrations of poverty and welfare
dependency (Atlanta, Baltimore, Dallas, Denver, New York, San Antonio, St. Louis and
Washington, D.C.).

[NOTE to CRIPW/EK--we did a weekly on the NY study 4116 and on what we know about
people leaving the rolls 1116)

       Welfare Reform ··HHS Study on Individiuals Leaving Welfare RoDs: HHS just announced
it will be making funds available to 8-10 states to track and monitor the status of people
leaving the welfare rolls. The studies will also track families who are not coming onto the
rolls either because of diversion programs, new eligibility rules, or other factors. HUD,
USDA, and DOL are participating in the research effort by contributing funds to study
impacts on families in public or assisted housing and rural areas, and to do in-depth
interviews about employment status. Results will probably not be available for several
years.

       Welfare Reform --PBS Special "Ending Welfare As We Know It": On June 5th,
PBS airs a 90-minute documentary billed as "an eye-opening look at how American
families are coping in the new era of welfare reform". The documentary was developed
by Roger Weisberg, producer of the 1994 documentary "Making Welfare Work", and
hosted by Meredith Vieira, co-host of ABC Daytime's The View. The documentary asks
broad questions about how welfare reform is working, but focuses on the experience of six
'hard-to-serve' families who are struggling with the transition in Wisconsin, Florida, and
New Jersey. Apparently the decision to focus on the tough cases was deliberate;
unfortunately, it ignores successes such as Rhonda Costa.

        Health Care -- Medicaid Coverage of Viagra: As early as next week, HHS is
expected to announce that the Medicaid statute does not allow for the exclusion of Viagra
as a covered drug. As long as it is proven to be prescribed for a medically necessary
reason, the Department's Office of General Counsel has determined that it must be
covered. States will, however, be able to limit the number of pills dispensed and will also
make coverage subject to a prior authorization requirement (which requires physicians to
provide an explicit medical rationale for the dispensing of this medication). Although
Medicaid covers very few men (about 90 percent of the covered population are women and
children), this issue concerns the state because they believe it could signal the beginning of
an influx of required coverage for "designer drugs." When the Department releases this
decision, it will stress that the Secretary does have the authority to exclude this drug if state
experiences clearly illustrate that it is being inappropriately prescribed and excessively
utilized. We will work closely with the NGA, the Governors, and Medicaid directors to
collect data to see if such a determination can be made.

        Health Care -- Coverage of Viagra Compared to Birth Control: Although most
private sector plans already have decided to cover Viagra (although with varying degrees
of limitations), many still do not cover birth control pills. This has led many women's
advocacy organizations to suggest that private sector coverage rules represent a double
standard. The widespread media coverage and controversies surrounding Viagra have
served to intensify pressure from these groups to support mandating the coverage of birth
control pills. There is a policy justification for the differences in coverage policies: Viagra
and other covered drugs treat a medical condition, while birth control pills are, in most
cases, intended to prevent a "medical condition." Since the debate around Health Security


                                               4
                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion

Act, we have generally hesitated to endorse explicit benefit mandates in private insurance.
Because the Medicaid statute does require the coverage of birth control pills, our position
with the women's groups is strengthened since the Federal government is not taking
perceptively conflicting positions on these drugs. However, we wanted to advise you that
this issue could arise in the upcoming Congress, as Senator Snowe (R-ME) has introduced
legislation to mandate that all health plans cover birth control pills.

       Health Care --Patients' Bill of Rights Update: On Thursday, Congressman
Norwood called Chris Jennings to advise you that he is interested in developing a strategy
to obtain sufficient support for a discharge petition. Such a petition would bypass the
Committee process and send patients' bill of rights legislation to the House floor for a vote.
 Mr. Norwood is becoming increasingly frustrated with the Republican Leadership's delay
in developing a Republican alternative to the Dingell/Ganske patients' rights legislation.
As you know, Congressman Norwood has his own bill with over 200 co-sponsors. He has
also indicated a desire to determine if it is possible to agree on one bill with Congressman
Dingell to increase the likelihood of succeeding with this discharge petition approach and
passing a bill through the House. Although he has not completely given up on the House
Republican Task Force, he is highly skeptical that they will come up with something that
he can support. He is placing a self-imposed late June deadline for the Republican
Leadership to act on this issue. However, even if the Republicans propose a bill, he will
oppose it if it is weighted down with poison pill provisions designed to ensure that nothing
passes this year. We are following up Congressman Norwood's call by meeting with
Congressman Dingell. Subsequently, we will have a joint meeting with Representatives
Ganske, Dingell, Norwood to develop a legislative strategy. Finally, to maintain the public
focus on this issue, we are contemplating recommending a public event with you, Senator
Kennedy, other Members of Congress, and Helen Hunt (if available) on June 15.

        Health Care -- Minnesota AARP Event with the Vice President: On Wednesday,
the Vice President addressed the biannual, national AARP conference in Minneapolis,
Minnesota. He focused his remarks primarily on the Administration's Medicare record
and was extremely well received. The issue, however, that got the most attention in
Minneapolis was his reiteration of your call on Congress to pass a patients' bill of rights
and his highlighting of the experience of native resident Ricka Powers with her HMO's
handling of her breast cancer case. The health plan that Ms. Powers charged with
mishandling her case (Health Partners) has vehemently denied her accusations. The only
reason why Health Partners' denials are worth noting is because they are one of the more
well respected HMO plans in the country and have some credibility with outside validators.
 It is important to note that neither you nor anyone within the Administration singled out
this company in the event or subsequent to it. We were advised about her experience by
the National Breast Cancer Coalition and a medical clinic in Minnesota that we felt to be
quite credible. However, because Minnesota state law confidentiality requirements
prohibit the plan from releasing any specific information about her case without her
explicit permission, it is impossible for us to confirm the degree to which either side's


                                              5
                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion
charges are accurate. But like most disputes, it appears that the truth may lie somewhere
in between these opposing viewpoints. Although we are quite confident Ms. Powers' case
has a substantial degree of merit, we believe it may be wise to advise avoiding referencing
this case in the future.

        Health Care -- Prostate Cancer Update: We have been extremely successful in
highlightiug the new Medicare preventive benefits and research breakthroughs for breast
cancer. However, we have yetto have the same level of success highlightiug our significant
record on prostate and colorectal cancer. For this reason, we are contemplating Father's
day as a time frame for focusing attention on these two issues. Admiuistration initiatives
we believe we could highlight include: the new Medicare colorectal and prostate screening
preventive benefits, your support for Medicare coverage of cancer clinical trials, historical
increases in the NCI budget, genetic discrimination legislation, and the patients' bill of
rights. Until recently, prostate cancer research and breakthroughs have not received the
attention or funding that other politically salient diseases have, such as breast cancer and
AIDS. The NCI, however, now believes that there is new potential in this area, and is
therefore increasing funding to begin new clinical trials and other research in this area,
efforts which will be enhanced if Congress passes your proposed 67 percent increase in
cancer research. In addition, one of the greatest barriers to progress in this prostate
cancer research is the lack of success in enrolling men in clinical trials. Your proposal to
cover cancer clinical trials, which is currently being carried in the McCain version of the
tobacco legislation could make a significant difference in attracting men into these studies.
It is important to note that the Medicare prostate preventive benefit does not go into effect
until the year 2000. The reason for the delay of implementation has much less to do with
cost than it does with the lack of evidence that screening makes a difference in morbidity.
Experts believe that this test has many false positives and even when it finds cancer, the
jury is still out as to whether or not we catch it soon enough to make a difference given the
treatment outcomes. It is our hope and expectation, however, that in prostate screening
and research should lead to lower mortality rates in the future.

        Health Care --Genetic Discrimination Update: Labor and Human Resources
Committee Chairman Jeffords has asked us to participate in a work group to mark up a
bill to prohibit genetic discrimiuation by health insurance plans. This legislation responds
to your call to build on the anti-genetic discrimination provisions in the
Kennedy-Kassebaum law and includes new anti-discrimination provisions, such as
ensuring genetic information is not used to prohibit access to the individual market or to
raise group premium rates in the individual or group market. The legislation also prevents
insurance companies from disclosing genetic information to other insurers, plan sponsors,
and other regulated entities. The Labor Committee is pushing this as a freestanding bill
because they believe that few other initiatives have a chance of passing out of committee
and the Senate as a whole. We are providing technical assistance and developing outside
organizational support to ensure that a strong bill has the potential to pass the Congress



                                              6
                                                          Hex-Dump Conversion

this year. We are concerned, however, that Senator Jeffords is seeking a lowest common
denominator approach to the extent that it is virtually meaningless.

        Health Care -- Assisted Suicide Rollout: On Friday, the Justice Department
released its interpretation that the Controlled Substance Act "oes not give the Drug
Enforcement Agency the authority to penalize physicians who are prescribing medication
to assist patients who commit suicide. As you will recall, Senator Hatch and Congressman
Hyde requested this opinion in hopes of using this authority to preempt the Oregon assisted
suicide law. As you directed, we clearly enunciated your strong opposition to '
assisted-suicide as well as your openness to contemplating legislative options in this area.

         Health Care -- Medicare Coverage of Abortion and the Hyde Amendment: It is a
little known fact that Medicare covers approximately 500 abortions a year for women who
receive the benefit through their eligibility to Social Security Disability Insurance. In
recent weeks, the Catholic Health Association has indicated its concern that it may have to
provide abortion services if some of their institutions decide to avail themselves of the new
Balanced Budget Amendment provisions that allow them to become a provider sponsored
organization (PSO). In addition, Senator Nickles has requested that the Department
advise him about the applicability of the Hyde amendment to Medicare. We are working
with HHS, OMB, Justice Department, and the Counsel's office to determine current
Medicare coverage practices as well as to develop options to how we could respond to these
inquiries. We are extremely concerned that Senator Nickles is soon going to highlight this
issue as yet another abortion wedge issue. You will be receiving an options memo on this
controversial issue shortly.
