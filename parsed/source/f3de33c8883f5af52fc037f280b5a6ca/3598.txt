Are these caps on compensatory damages? In which case the issue probably
has something to do with arcane statutes like the Death on the High Seas
Act, or are they on punitives? either way, I think we need to understand
better what's happening.   From the perspective of what we've been talking
about on products and tobacco, we seem more concerned about a punitives
cap, but there's something really weird about a compensatories cap,
particularly since, as I understand it, we're proposing to eliminate such
a cap for commercial airlines (DOT letter that passed by my desk
yesterday.)  If the caps only relate to employees, that's probably a very
different matter. ellen
