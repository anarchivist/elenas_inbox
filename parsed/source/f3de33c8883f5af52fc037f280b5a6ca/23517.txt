    TEXT:
    The roundtable went very well, and the women's groups with whom I spoke
,   seemed very happy.   In fact, a few said it was the best roundtable they
    had seen. The nurse stayed completely on message and emphasized that she
    wanted nurses to be paid more because her daughter is going into nursing.
    There was no mention of comparable worth at all.   The President seemed to
    particularly like the older woman and how it tied into saving Social
    Security.   Another potential disaster averted . .
