Cessation New Initiatives

       · New Department of Defense anti-tobacco plan. This comprehensive anti-tobacco
       plan to increase military readiness will likely include covering over-the-counter nicotine
       replacement therapies under military health care coverage as part of a comprehensive
       military-wide anti-tobacco plan. (Cost: $300 million over 5 years)

       · Veterans. We should re-propose the plan from the President's 1999 budget which
       created a new discretionary program open to all veterans who began using tobacco
       products while in the service, regardless of their eligibility for other VA health care
       services (currently less than 15 percent of veterans receive their health care through the
       V A system because of statutory limits --veterans must be low income or have a
       service-related injury.) Thirty-six percent of the 25 million veterans in this country
       smoke. (Cost: $435 million over 5 years).

There are two ways to increase substance abuse treatment:

1) Substance Abuse Block Grant
These funds are allocated to states on a formula basis with states deciding how to target the funds.
SAMHSA requested an increase of $270 million for FY 2000. OMB passback holds them to FY 99 level
of $1.585 billion (plus an additional $100 million in advance funding).

2)Targeted Capacity Expansion Grants
These funds are designed to address treatment needs for emerging substance abuse problems specific to a
city, county, state or region, with a particular focus on meeting local needs since the block grant goes to
states. For FY 1988, SAMHSA identified several target groups including: substance abusing women
and their children, clients participating in welfare reform programs, juvenile and adult criminal
justice-referred offenders, dually diagnose youth offenders, substance abusing physically and cognitively
challenged individuals, and hard-to-reach IV drug users. FY 98 funds supported 41 grants totaling $24
million to a combination of state, local, and tribal agencies and community-based organizations. This
funding will serve an additional _ people on an annual basis. Grants are available for three years, with
first year funding generally between $500,000 and $700,000. Approximately one-third of the FY 1998
grants are targeted to TANF or substance abusing women with children. For example, Women in Need in
Brooklyn received $250,000 to expand capacity to serve an additional 85 homeless women and women
with children receiving TANF. The Wisconsin Department of Health and Family services received
$750,000 to provide intensive family treatment to 121 women with children and TANF recipients.

US Conference of Mayors has indicated strong support for these grants -- in fact, they would like to see an
increase of around $250 million. Based on conversations with ONDPC staff, they generally support
SAMHSA's request both for the block grant and targeted capacity grants, but they particularly like the
targeted capacity grants since we have more ability to target and track how these get spent.
