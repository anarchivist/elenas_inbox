                     ST ATEMENT BY VICE PRESIDENT AL GORE
                   ANNOUNCEMENT OF "THE HEAL THY KIDS ACT"
                          WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 11, 1998

      I want to thank Senator Daschle for his outstanding leadership of the Senate Democratic
Caucus -- and for helping to make this issue such a priority for our party;

       And I want to offer a special word of praise and gratitude to Senator Conrad, whose
dedicated and extremely hard-working task force has brought us here today. Senator -- ajob
well-done.

       [other acknowledgments to be provided by advance]

        Today, we take a crucial step forward in the fight against teen smoking -- and the next big
step toward writing tough anti-tobacco measures into law.

        For years, America's parents and families have been outmatched --by multi-million
dollar ad campaigns targeted at our children. By secret strategies to hide the deadly effects of
smoking. By nicotine addiction that captures 3,000 of our children every day -- and costs 1,000
of them their lives.

        Over the past five years, President Clinton and I have been determined to change all that
-- to protect our children from the number-one preventable cause of death in this country. We
enacted the toughest-ever measures to cut-off children's access to tobacco, and the tobacco
companies came to the bargaining table -- because they knew we meant business.

        Now we have an opportunity to build on the landmark tobacco settlement that was
reached last June. We have a chance to pass bipartisan, comprehensive legislation that
dramatically reduces teen smoking -- and changes the way tobacco companies do business
forever.

         The President has made clear that there are five core principles that must be met for any
bill to receive his signature: One, it must raise the price of cigarettes by up to $1.50 a pack over
the next 10 years, including penalties on the tobacco industry if it keeps marketing to children.
Two, it must give the FDA full authority to regulate nicotine as a drug. Three, it must require
tobacco companies to disclose information on the dangers of their products. Four, it must
advance other crucial health goals, like reducing second-hand smoke. And five, it must protect
the economic welfare of tobacco farmers and their communities.

        The President asked me to take the lead in rallying Congressional and public support
behind these principles, and in the past five months, I have held bipartisan tobacco forums all
across this country. This much is certain: support for tough anti-tobacco measures crosses all
lines of party and politics. There is no such thing as Democratic or Republican nicotine
addiction.
                                                          Hex-Dump Conversion

        Today, just two weeks after Congress has come back to work, Senator Conrad and his
colleagues have come forward with legislation that meets all five of the President's principles --
and therefore meets America's challenge of reducing teen smoking. I can say that the President
would be proud to sign this bill, as he would be proud to sign any bill that does as much to meet
his goals and principles.

         And while I stand here today with dedicated Democrats who are fighting to reduce teen
smoking, I know there is strong commitment to this issue on both sides of the aisle. In the
coming days and weeks, I hope and expect that many Republicans will join us -- on this or other
bills that meet our core principles. Ultimately, any successful bill must have broad, bipartisan
support. The President and I are committed to working with members of both parties to shape
the best ideas and proposals into a truly bipartisan bill.

        And like Senator Conrad's bill, any successful bill must meet all five of the President's
principles. Teen smoking is a comprehensive problem, and it demands a comprehensive
solution. The President and I cannot get behind a watered-down, piecemeal bill -- one that
ducks the problem of teen smoking, instead of dealing with it. That is why we are insisting that
Congress meet all five principles -- including a substantial price increase on a pack of cigarettes,
and other measures to cut teen smoking in half.

        Our call for a price increase is not about money; it's about our children's health.
Without a substantial increase in the price of a pack of cigarettes, we simply will not achieve our
goal of dramatically reducing teen smoking. And that has always been our sole and central goal.

      I ask every member of Congress, of both parties: follow the example of these Senators.
Support this legislation, or come forward with your own bill that meets our five principles.
We've got to seize this historic opportunity, and build on this growing coalition. This can be the
Congress that finally protects our children from nicotine addiction and disease -- and gives
America the healthy kids and families we deserve.
