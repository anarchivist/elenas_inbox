                        President Clinton: Deterring and Reducing Gun Crime
                                           March 20, 1999

    In weekly radio address, President Clinton will direct the Secretary of the Treasury and Attorney
    General to develop a national strategy to increase gun prosecutions and further reduce gun
    violence. Among other things, the strategy will specifically call for: the intensive investigation
    and prosecution of gun criminals; expanded efforts to identify illegal gun markets and gun "hot
    spots"; and improved coordination with state and local law enforcement and other
    community-based efforts. The President will also release a new Justice Department report
    highlighting 60 promising strategies that have helped reduce gun violence throughout the
    country.

    Stepping Up the Fight Against Gun Violence

    Gun crimes down, but still too high. Since 1993, the nation's crime rate has dropped by more
    than 20 percent, and to its lowest level in a generation. During this period gun-related crime has
    dropped even more: gun murders are down by 33 percent, and crimes committed with firearms
    are down by 27 percent. But gun-related crime and violence remain serious problems. In 1996,
    more than 34,000 people died from gunfire -- about 14,000 of which were homicides. And the
    youth gun murder rate remains especially high -- nearly twice what it was just 15 years ago.

    Taking the fight against gun violence nationwide. To continue to reduce gun crime and
    violence, President Clinton will direct the Secretary of the Treasury and Attorney General--
    working with U.S. Attorneys, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF), and all of
    state and local law enforcement -- to develop a comprehensive national strategy to prosecute
    more gun criminals and further reduce gun violence by building on the successful efforts already
    in place throughout the country.

    Prosecuting more gun criminals. The President will ask that U.S. Attorneys and ATF to
    work with state and local law enforcement to investigate and prosecute more gun criminals
    by expanding efforts such as Project Exile in Richmond, VA. As part of Project Exile, the
    Richmond U.S. Attorney -- working closely with other state, local and federal law
    enforcement authorities -- targeted gun-carrying felons and other armed criminals for
    immediate federal prosecution and stiff mandatory sentences in federal prison. Law
    enforcement authorities also reached out to the business community and launched an extensive
    media campaign to educate Richmond's residents about the lengthy, mandatory prison sentences
    associated with gun crimes. Gun-related homicides in Richmond fell by 41 percent after Project
    Exile was implemented.

    Targeting illegal gun markets. The President will also ask law enforcement authorities to
    target illegal gun markets and gun "hot spots," as is done in Boston. Through the Boston Gun
    Project, every gun recovered by Boston police at a crime scene is traced through ATF's National
    Tracing Center to its source. The Boston Police Department and ATF then work together to
    disrupt illegal gun markets by investigating illegal gun trafficking and referring cases for swift
    prosecution by both federal and state prosecutors. As a result of these and other youth violence
                        Hex-Dump Conversion

prevention efforts, youth homicides in Boston have dropped 75 percent since 1995.
Coordinating our strategy with state and local efforts. Today's directive also calls for the
Treasury and Justice Departments to develop a strategy that builds on the many successful
strategies already in place around the country. To help communities learn more about such
programs, the President will release a new Justice Department report -- Promising Strategies to
Reduce Gun Violence. Designed as a "toolbox" for communities, the report details 60
successful strategies to reduce gun violence that were reviewed and recommended by more than
40 national experts, including: coordinated enforcement of all local, state, and federal gun laws
and regulations; closer, tougher supervision of gun criminals on parole or probation; and
increased efforts to keep guns out of the hands of juveniles. The report will be distributed to
communities throughout the country next week.

New Resources for Firearms Enforcement

The President's FY 2000 budget includes new resources to help implement the national strategy
called for today. In particular, his budget includes:

       $5 million for more than 40 additional federal prosecutors to conduct intensive firearms
       prosecution projects targeting violent felons who possess guns, armed drug traffickers,
       and illegal gun markets;

       $23.8 million for more than 120 new ATF agents to support firearms investigations,
       arrest violent criminals and gun traffickers, and crack down on illegal gun sales; and

       $1.3 billion for a 21st Century Policing Initiative to help communities hire more police
       and prosecutors, and to allow them to target gun crime and other public safety priorities.
