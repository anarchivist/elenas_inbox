TEXT:
The next meeting of the VP's Welfare Reform Coalition to Sustain Success
will be either May 11 or 12 in Washington.  It will focus on connecting
the non-profits/community organizations in the Coalition with businesses,
especially small businesses. Both SBA and the Partnership will be
involved. There will be downlinks to 10 regional sites, hopefully managed
by SBA, where businesses and local chapters of the coalition members will
be invited to participate.   This will feed well into the Partnership's
cities effort since many of the cities are the same. Lee Anne is also
planning a working meeting for April 9th, before the 2 p.m. federal hiring
event, with key Coalition members to announce and plan for the May
meeting, give them a survey to report their accomplishments, and review
the proposed web site (VP may drop by).  They will then be invited to
attend the 2 p.m. event.   With the Coalition meeting happening so close
to the W2W Partnership event around May 20th, we'll need to coordinate
closely.  Lee Anne also made it clear the the VP would like to be involved
in any announcement of the WtW competitive grants.
