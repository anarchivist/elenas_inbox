TEXT:
Tell the President two things:  On Wednesday Oct 1, he will host a mtg on
tobacco with the bipartisan congressional leadership. We'll challenge
them to work together to draft elements of bipartisan legislation by the
end of the year, and to make tobacco the first issue they'll take up in
1998. We believe the prospects are good for a bipartisan bill to emerge
in the Senate. On Friday Oct 3, the VP is holding a tobacco event in
Tampa to highlight Florida's success in taking on the tobacco industry and
build public support for tobacco legislation. We are working with the
VP's office to plan other regional town halls on tobacco in the months to
come.
