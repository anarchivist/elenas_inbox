                       Talking Points on Tobacco Settlement Talks


o    The Administration is closely monitoring the settlement talks among the tobacco
     industry, state attorneys general, public health groups, and private lawyers. Any
     agreement would have to be passed by the Congress and signed by the President. We
     will carefully review any settlement that emerges from the discussions, and we will seek
     the advice of the public health community. As the President has said, in reviewing any
     settlement proposal, our focus will stay squarely on protecting kids and the public health.

Q:   Would you support a settlement that caps punitive damages? That seems to be the
     key stumbling block.

A:   I'm not going to speculate on any particular aspects of a potential settlement. The
     Administration proposed the toughest measures ever to protect children from tobacco,
     and we are fighting in the courts to see that those restrictions take effect. Our focus in
     reviewing any settlement will stay on protecting kids and the public health. The President
     has made it clear he is not going to agree to anything with respect to tobacco that
     jeopardizes the public health.

Q:   Senator Lott and others are urging quick closure to the talks. They say that the
     window of opportunity is closing. Is the Administration trying to help close the
     deal?

A:   Any settlement would likely have a profound and lasting impact on the public health.
     We are not going to take a position on a proposal until the Administration and the public
     health community have fully reviewed it.
