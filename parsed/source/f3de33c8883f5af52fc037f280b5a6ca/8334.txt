Subject:         Education

As you know, the Vice President.will be speaking (actually in a town hall
meeting format) to approximately 12,000 delegates to the NEA convention
the first week of July.  The President will be speaking to about 5,000
delegates to the AFT convention. Given that we believe we will have an
education fight with the Congress in late summer/early fall, I thought it
would be useful to have a process to think through how we could best use
these two venues for our education message.

I thought a NEC/DPC discussion that would include the VP's office as well
as communications for both WH and VP's office would be a good starting
point. Since there will already be alot of press around these 2
conventions because of 'their merger and the vote, I am concerned that we
all know what we are doing. will NEC/DPC convene a meeting? Please let
me know.  Thanks
