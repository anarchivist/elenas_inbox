TEXT:
Elena--
I got a call from David Ogden this morning. He wants to set up a
high-level meeting with you, Deich, Kevin DiGregory, Lynn Cutler, Ann
Shields (Interior) etc. for early next week to work out the directive
options. While I agree that this needs to happen, I think we should meet
first internally to decide where we want this to end up.

Please let me know how you want to proceed.   Thanks.
