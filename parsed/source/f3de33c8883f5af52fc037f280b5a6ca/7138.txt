TEXT:
Nancy Zirkin called late on Friday and wanted us to know that Kay Bailey
Hutchinson is planning to introduce a bill supporting single sex
classrooms and schools. The bill includes language that allows local
education agencies to utilize public monies to set these up if they are
"comparable" to other public schools, but Nancy says comparable has not
yet been defined!.

AAUW will fight aganist this.  They are trying to get Carol M. Braun to be
the point aganist , but due to the school construction bill, she has not
said yes yet.

Nancy is faxing information to me on    Monday.   Tania will get a copy to
each of you.

Since I will be gone Mon., Tues and Wed., I wanted to pass this on.     THANKS
