TEXT:
We are advised that Summers' testimony has already been sent to the Hill.
We would nevertheless appreciate hearing from you ASAP if you see any
major inconsistencies between the testimony and the President's Budget.
We will bring any major inconsistencies to the Director's attention as
soon as possible.
