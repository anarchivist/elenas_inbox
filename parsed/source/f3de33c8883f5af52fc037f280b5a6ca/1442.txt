FROM:          Elena Kagan         .
               Deputy Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy

SUBJECT:       Interagency Working Group on Early Childhood Development and the White
               House Conference on Early Childhood Development and Learning: What New
               Research on the Brain Tells Us About Our Youngest Children


As you know, final agency responses to the President's February 24, 1997 memorandum to
department heads requesting comprehensive lists of existing and planned agency activities
supporting are youngest children are due Monday, March 24, 1997. Please be sure to include
in your submission when each new action could be announced. We plan to make
announcements before, during, and after the April 17th White House Conference on Early
Childhood Development and Learning: What New Research on the Brain Tells Us About Our
Youngest Children, and will be developing an annoucement schedule based on these
submissions.

The next meeting of the Interagency Working Group on Early Childhood Development will be
Tuesday, March 25 at _ in room _ . The meeting will cover the agency responses to the
President's February 24th memo, the White House Conference, agency involvement in regional
satellite conferences, and written materials that could be released in conjunction with the
Conference.

We plan to issue invitations to attend the April 17 White House Conference on Early Childhood
Development and Learning this weekend. The consolidated agency lists of suggested invitees
were extremely help-ful and we tried to accommodate the top priorities of the agencies that made
these submissions. Space in the East Room is extremely limited and we could not invite
everyone we would have liked. Please feel free to refer Congressional inquiries about the
Conference to the White House Office of Legislative Affairs. Others should be asked to send
their inquiries about the Conference in writing to the White House Office of Public Liaison.

To make arrangements for delivery of your agency response to the President's memorandum no
later than close of business on Monday, please call Laura Emmett/Carrie Filak (?) at 456-_ _ .
