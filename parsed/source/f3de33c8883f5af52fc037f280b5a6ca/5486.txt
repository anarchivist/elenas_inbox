TEXT:
You left me a note the other day about a memo from Hilley to POTUS,
regarding the prospect that the ED dep't is holding back parts of the
higher ed reauthorization proposal for SOTU.  Here is the scoop:

1. They aren't holding back anything; the process has been
extraordinarily slow overall, betweeh ED and OMB

2. The only part of HEA that could conceivably be held back is the
School/College mentoring proposal. Of course, it would be more accurate
to say that its still being decided, rather than being held back.

3. Kennedy met with Riley and Smith last week, and indicated his concern
that it was taking the Administration so long to get HEA up to the hill.
Mike apparantly mumbled something about holding back for SOTU as the best
excuse he could come up with. I suspect that must have gotten back to
Hilley somehow.

You also asked me to talk with Rob Weiner about the single sex school in
NY. I did.  He has been talking to the OCR folks in ED, asking for the
Riley talking points. He's gotten nowhere so far.   Surprise. I suggested
he try Leslie Thornton instead, and offered to call her myself if that
would help. He wanted one more shot on his own, and promised to get back
to me.  I haven't followed up with him since, but will now.

I '.m sure there are about 3 or 4 other things you've asked me about.   I'll
get back to you as soon as I can remember what they are.
