TEXT:
thanks.

here's a formulation the POTUS just used in his speech before the school
boardsassociation.  it's quite good. worth using it here?

       We also, again, will try to pass the provision of the budget that
would
use tax breaks to enable us to build or modernize 5,000 schools, and that
is
very important, indeed.   (Applause.)  Again, I heard the argument last
year,
well, this is really not something that the federal government ought to be
doing. Well, the federal government puts a lot of money into state
highways,
and this is our road to the future.   (Applause.)
