Bruce/Elena:
As you know, June 14th is the one year anniversary of the Race
Initiative.  In anticipation of the likely press calls that the WH and PIR
press offices will be receiving in the coming weeks, the PIR is trying to
pull together an up-to-date accomplishments document.  Judy and the PIR
press staff are coordinating with Beverly Barnes, Minyon, Ann Lewis and
others on this.

To that end, I am starting to pull together a draft policy accomplishments
document for your review.  I hope to get it to you both by the end of next
week. Thanks.

Julie
