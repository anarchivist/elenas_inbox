PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
RADIO ACTUALITY ON ED-FLEX AMENDMENT
February 25, 1999

        This year we have an opportunity to work together, across party
lines, to bring true progress to AmericaD,s public schools.   I welcome the
idea of greater flexibility for states and school districts; and I hope
the Senate will pass the Ed-Flex legislation it is now considering. But
we must do more to give our children a world-class education.   Flexibility
is not enough in the many communities where classrooms are overcrowded.
That is why I strongly support the amendment proposed by Senator[s]
[Kennedy and Murray]. We must make a national commitment to hiring more
teachers and reducing the size of classrooms across America.   Studies
confirm what every parent already knows: smaller classes make a big
difference, from improved test scores to improved discipline. The Senate
should pass the [Kennedy-Murray] Amendment, and give our nationD,s
children the individual attention they deserve in the classroom, and the
better future that only a good education can bring.
