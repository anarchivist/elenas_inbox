TEXT:
I'm happy to say it's been resolved.  He was worried that OMB wasn't going
to clear a HCFA document, but OMB just cleared it.

We might be able to use this document at the signing of the disability EO
(assuming we get a signing event). The BBA included a Medicaid buy-in
state option for people with disabilities who return to work.  It was our
idea, as part of the 98 budget.  States that participate can let people
buy Medicaid on a sliding scale, and not lose Medicaid as their income
rises (up to 250% of poverty). The document OMB just cleared is HHS's
letter to states on how to implement this.  I have asked them to hold it
for a few weeks.  It might be a nice announcement for him to make at the
signing, since it's an action step,and the rest of the EO is just studying
the problem.
