A couple of points. In my view the letter fails to identify the positives
of biomedical research in this area (see the Jones memo to the President) .
Second, the letter fails to note or comment on the Kennedy Feinstein bill
expressly, nor does it comment on the negatives associated with the other
efforts and why they would be problematice. Finally, the letter is
eliptical on the question of interfering with human embryo research. I
know that there is a ban on the use of federal funds, but what is our view
about the House effort to ban that conduct in the private sector.
