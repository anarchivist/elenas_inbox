TEXT:
Basically, they dinged our sentence on weakening work.  Plus, apparently
Hilley has already signed off on the latest version -- see Kountoupes'
strong advisory below that any changes must be worked out between Elena
and Hilley.

I assume we want to fight for our sentence on work, but we have to figure
out how to get Hilley's signoff. Advice?   (The sentence is "In addition,
the Administration is seriously concerned that the House bill weakens the
welfare law's strict emphasis on work by permitting some states to count
additional time spent in activities such as job search toward the work
requirements.")

good.  just to underscore, it is really important that Elena and Hilley
get together on the FLSA issue. we will not be able to make any changes
that are not worked out between the two of them.  thanks
