TEXT:
Elena--

I'm speaking out of school, to use an inappropriate expression, but I feel
the need to share some thoughts about guns and you're the person with whom
I'm most comfortable.

It's the end of the second term.  It's the worst school-violence episode
in history. There's a war and a need to refocus on domestic policy.   If
ever there was a time to go for broke on guns, isn't this it?

You know much more about the policy options than I do, but as a regulatory
lawyer, I would think that there would be a statute upon which Education
or Treasury could base a notice of proposed rulemaking of broad scope.
Let the NRA make the beyond-statutory-authority argument and let them sue
under the APA after a final rule. As long as we could hold off a stay of
the rules, it's a win.  Legislatively, with the appropriations cycle still
in the early stages, why not have Rep. Maloney sponsor a rider
conditioning funds on school security measures?   (unfunded mandate
problem?)

Anyway, forgive me for treading on your turf. As a former Rangel and Kohl
staffer, I've fought my share of gun battles and it's hard to get out of
one's system. As the President says after a radio address, thanks for
listening.

--Dave
