TEXT:
Just a heads up ... I ran into Nicholas, public policy editor for the
Financial Times of London, at 'the NGA policy forum last week.   He
mentioned that he was working through Dan Balz of the Washington Post to
try to get an interview on welfare reform, and said Balz had contacted
Bruce. Apparently Timmins had arranged an interview for Balz with Tony
Blair or some high level British official and now Balz is trying to
reciprocate. Timmins is spending several months studying and writing
about welfare reform in the U.S. Without revealing anything about the
upcoming Blair visit, I took the opportunity to ask Nicholas about what's
going on with welfare reform in the U.K.

Key points:
Rhetoric from U.S. continues to play big in U.K., though in practice their
strategies have a different focus.
 Major focus right now is primarily on unemployed males. Many of the men
are structurally employed, i.e. laid off steel workers whose skills have
become 'redundant'.
 Lone (single) parents are a secondary focus. Currently they are able to
collect benefits until their youngest child is 16. They are now being
invited in on a voluntary basis to participate in employment and training
assistance.  It remains to be seen whether this will occur on a large
scale--funding is not adequate to make it mandatory.
