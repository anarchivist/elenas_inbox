TEXT:
Need your advice on a small item -- the Save America's Treasures
preservation program in Interior's budget.  I have meetings out of town on
Monday and Tuesday -- Had planned to give Jack Lew talking pts - and you
too if you need them -- and have the National Park Service prepared to
answer questions.  Do I need to do anything more, or be here in person?
Thanks for your guidance.
