FROM: OMB LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS

DATE: MAY 20, 1997

SUBJECT:   LEGISLATIVE REPORT


Conferees for the Disaster/Bosnia Supplemental met today, but did not complete
action on the bill.  They are scheduled to reconvene tomorrow at 1:00 pm.


Major open issues include the automatic CR, RS2477 (wilderness rights-of-way),
and restrictions on census sampling. The conferees reached a tentative
agreement to eliminate objectionable Senate language concerning getting out of
Bosnia by June 30, 1998. The conferees did approve $1.9 billion for Bosnia,
which is $.2 billion below the PresidentD,s Budget.   Agriculture conferees
approved a $76 million supplemental for WIC.   The tentative agreement also
includes $500 million for the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG), split
equally with $250 million in FY97 and $250 million in FY98.

The Senate Governmental Affairs Committee postponed todayD,s mark-up of S. 261,
Senator DomeniciD,s Biennial budget bill, and S. 207, a bill to establish a
Corporate Subsidy Reform Commission.

CONGRESS TODAY (5/20):

SENATE
Passed (64-36) H.R. 1122, the Partial Birth Abortion Ban
  [SAP sent, 5/14: President will veto]

Began consideration of S.Con.Res. 27 - The Concurrent Budget Resolution for
FY98.

While under consideration, the Senate took the following action:
o Tabled (61-39) Dodd Amendment, to increase the discretionary spending caps by
$15.752 billion in outlays over five years to improve funding of critical
programs to assist infants, toddlers, and young children, and offset this
effort by closing corporate tax loopholes.

o Tabled (70-29) Allard/lnhofe Amendment, to require that any shortfall in
revenues projected by the resolution be offset by reductions in discretionary
spending.

o Tabled (8-91) Hollings Amendment, to eliminate the PresidentD,s initiatives
for increased spending and the tax cuts.

o Adopted (DC) an Allard Amendment to express the sense of the Senate about the
Federal debt, and that the President should submit a budget proposal with a
plan for repayment of the Federal debt.
