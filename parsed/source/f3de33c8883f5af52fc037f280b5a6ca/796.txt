TEXT:
It just occurred to me, at 6:30pm, that I had left a message for Carol
Williams not long after we spoke today -- a detailed message on her
voicemail -- for her to call me, that you and Olivia had spoken and agreed
that a conference call would be useful to the White House to answer
questions not addressed at our last meeting.  She never called me back.
And, needless to say, no one is there now.

What I'll do this weekend, absent a call from her, is to do a memo that
outlines what I believe will be the major policy questions we will have to
address if and when we receive the report from HHS.  I'll leave it on your
chair over the weekend.
