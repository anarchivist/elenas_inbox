Subject:         update on school safety

Currently we only have one Member confirmed and that is Chuck Robb.
Therefore we are taking out the riser and putting Robb in the front row.
He should obviously be acknowledged. Also there will be 4 students from
T.C. Williams High School coming with Herb Berg. They will also be in the
front row.

We currently have 42 confirmed guests plus 10 staff people from Education
and Justice so our room will be full.  Thanks
