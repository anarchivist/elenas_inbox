TEXT:
Sally Katzen held a meeting today with USDA and other agencies on the farm
safety net and helping out farmers in the Northern Plains. (Tom phoned in
for the meeting).   USDA is going to prepare a paper with several proposals
by July 2, and Sally hopes to have a deputy or principals meeting after
the Fourth of July.    This paper will also discuss the political aspects
of these proposals vis-a-vis the 1996 Freedom to Farm bill and how these
issues are shaping up along party lines on the Hill.

These issues do relate to the rural agenda that Tom and I worked on, but
seem to be moving at an accelerated pace as Glickman briefed Gene about
them this week.  We'll keep you updated.  Thanks, Mary
