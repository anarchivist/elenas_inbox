 TEXT:
 TOBACCO EVENT
,The press office recommended giving the report to one of the morning shows
 so that Satcher could be on a show Monday morning.  It would help w/
 making the nightly news and it won't hurt print stories for Tuesday. What
 do you think?
 (Also, we will have POTUS walk out w/ Satcher and kids to ensure a good
 photo of POTUS and kids at this event).

NYC EVENT UPDATE
Gene thinks the SSC numbers coming out on Tuesday will make news, but he
still wants to do High Hopes as our message event in NY.   So, the
"decision" out of an Ann Lewis' meeting seems to be to brief education
reporters on Monday for Tuesday's pape'rs about the High Hopes news and
have POTUS talk about both high hopes and SSC at a college in NYC on
Tuesday.

The High Hopes news is announcing a $50 million commitment by the Ford
Foundation to High Hopes type programs throughout the country. The Ford
Foundation will be funding partnerships between middle schools and
colleges to mentor kids towards college. They have already given $15
million to projects in the Newark/NYC area and the President will visit
one of these model ,programs in Queens or Newark.

I'm not sure of the specifics of the SSC news, but b/c it is independently
released Tuesday afternoon, it makes sense for POTUS to talk about it
during his speech b/c it will get covered for Wednesday's papers,

So, Bruce, do you want to participate in a briefing of education reporters
about High Hopes on Monday? They talked about having Ford Executives come
to the White House and do a Roosevelt Room briefing? What do you think?
