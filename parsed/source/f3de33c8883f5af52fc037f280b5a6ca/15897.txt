TEXT:
here's what craig is talking about: he believes that all the democratic
govs, with the exception of chiles, are ready to back off on flsa. they
all say they are just carrying water for chiles and will be happy if he is
happy.  craig claims, from talking to the DGA, that chiles is willing to
"compromise" on flsa by counting more stuff a::; work. this is no
surprise--and where we always thought the govs would end up.    craig's
concern is that if we pick a fight on minimum wage, we want chiles with
us--we all agree on that.

craig says he's bringing this up at weds pm meeting. so you may want to
start to prepare options.

i will talk to the chiles and dean folks today. let me know if this is a
compromise you can live with (i assume its not)
