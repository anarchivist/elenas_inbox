                                21st Century Policing Initiative Event
                                          January 14, 1999
                                       Questions and Answers


       Q:   Can you explain how the President's 21st Century Policing Initiative is different
            from the current COPS Program?

       A:   The Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) program created in the 1994 Crime
            Act authorized $8.8 billion over six years to help communities hire and redeploy 100,000
            officers to our nation's streets and to promote community policing in other ways. To
            date, COPS haw awarded over $5.3 billion in grants to more than 11,300 state and local
            law enforcement agencies -- helping to fund more than 92,000 officers on the beat and
            train more than 21,000 officers and community residents. Under COPS, the number of
            police departments engaged in community policing has grown exponentially -- from
            several hundred to many thousands.

            For the most part, however, the current COPS program has focused on hiring new officers
            and redeploying veteran officers to the streets. For instance, the COPS Universal Hiring
            Program provides three-year grants to help hire new officers, and the COPS MORE
            program provides grants for agencies to pay for technology, equipment, and civilian
            personnel that will free officers from their desks and redeploy them to the community and
            on the beat.

            The initiative launched today builds on the success of the original COPS program, but it
            also takes a giant step forward by giving law enforcement the tools and partners it needs
            to keep crime coming down well into the 21 st Century. First, the 21 st Century Policing
            Initiative continues the Administration's commitment to keep the number of officers on
            the beat at an all-time high, by helping communities to hire, redeploy, and retain police
            officers. Second, the initiative provides significant new funds to give law enforcement
            access to the latest crime-fighting and crime-solving technologies -- improved police
            communications, crime mapping, laptop computers, crime lab improvements, and more.
            And third, the initiative makes an unprecedented commitment to engage the entire
            community in the hard work of preventing and fighting crime -- by funding new
            community-based prosecutors, and partnerships with probation and parole officers, school
            officials, and faith-based organizations.


       Q:   How many officers have been funded by the COPS Program and when do you think
            you will reach your 100,000 goal?

       A:   Through the COPS Program, more than 92,000 additional community policing officers
            have been funded to date. We expect the program to meet the its goal of helping
            communities fund 100,000 more police officers by this summer -- under budget and
            ahead of schedule.
                                                                                        Hex-Dump ConvGrsion


Q:   How many officers are actually on the street?

A:   According to the COPS Office most recent survey this summer, nearly 50,000 officers
     were already on the streets, and about another 25,000 were in the process of being
     recruited, screened, tested and trained. The COPS Office is in the process of completing
     another survey that should be ready in the upcoming weeks.


Q:   How do you explain the discrepancy between the 92,000 officers number you use
     and the much smaller number on the street?

A:   The remaining police officers are in the process of being recruited, screened,tested or
     trained -- a process that, on average, takes about .18 months. The funds to pay these
     officers are available to local police departments just as soon as they are ready to hire
     their new recruits.

     The COPS office expects -- in fact, it demands -- that local law enforcement agencies
     stick to their nonnal rigorous recruiting and hiring procedures in filling all COPS-funded
     positions. Nothing could be more important than hiring qualified and fully screened
     police to entrust with the public's safety.


Q:   There have been news reports that audits of COPS grants by the Office of Inspector
     General. The reports suggest that there is substantial misspending by police
     departments of COPS grants. How widespread is this and what are you doing
     about it?

A:   The COPS Office and the Inspector General work together to monitor COPS grants to
     ensures that funds are being spent properly. Many of the audits reported in the news
     have already been certified as closed by the Inspector General. In every other case, the
     COPS. Office is working with the local agency to resolve any outstanding issues and bring
     grantees into compliance. It is important to note, however, that the audit reports reported
     in the news represent less than one percent of all COPS grants.


Q:   What happens when the three-year federal grant runs out? Are police departments
     allowed to layoff officers hired with these funds?

A:   Every agency knows from the outset that it is expected to pick-up the long-tenn costs of a
      COPS officer when the federal grant expires. This is part of the commitment law
     enforcement agencies make in order to receive the federal COPS grant. More
     importantly, Justice Department monitoring and media stories confinn that the majority
     of grantees are fulfilling their responsibilities under COPS grants.
                                                                                 Automr,lcrl ;;ecordc Managem:mt System
                                                                                          Hex-Dump ConvGision

              Nonetheless, we understand that there may be some unforeseen circumstances, fiscal
              emergencies, or natural disasters that may prevent a police department from retaining its
              COPS-funded officers. In these case, the Attorney General has the authority to extend
              funding in special circumstances and for certain small communities (populations below
              50,000). In addition, the President's new 21st Century Policing Initiative will provide
              even further relieve for economically distressed communities that are having difficulties
              with the long term costs of retaining their officers.


        Justice Department Crime Statistics

        Q:    What do the statistics released today show?

        A:    For the first part of 1998, crime continued to decline significantly. Notably, we expect
              serious violent crimes to fall below 3 million for the first time since the National Crime
              Victimization Survey began in 1973. By the end of 1998, both the overall violent and
              property crime rates will have fallen by well over 20 percent since 1993.


        Q:    How is the data you are releasing today different than the crime statistics that were
              recently released by the FBI?

        A:    Today's statistics are part of the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS)
              administered by the Justice Department's Bureau of Justice Statistics. The NCVS is a
              household survey that interviews about 80,000 persons age 12 and older in 43,000
              households across the country twice a year. The survey measures the number and types
              of crimes as reported by the victims themselves, and therefore covers crimes that go
              unreported to the police. In contrast, the FBI's Uniform Crime Report (UCR) provides
              crime data on specified offenses as reported by the nation's state and local law
              enforcement agencies. Interestingly, while the UCR and the NCVS use different
              method's of data collection, the findings are the same: that serious violent crime is
              declining for the 7th year in a row.
