Q:   How do you respond to the GAO and CBO's contention that the President's
          Medicare proposal does not represent real reform?

A:   The President believes that preparing the Medicare program for the next century will
     require both additional revenue and reforms to make the program more competitive. In
     his State of the Union, he set out a plan to provide the necessary new funds and proposed
     working on a bipartisan basis to develop appropriate reforms. The President believed
     that it was appropriate to await the recommendations of the Commission before
     proposing specific reforms. When the Commission makes its recommendations, the
     President will evaluate them and take the steps most likely to bring about agreement both
     on reforming the program and on giving it new revenues.

Q:   How do you respond to Senator Breaux's contention that the White House should
     send a signal to its members to support the Commission's recommendation?

A:   The President has confidence in his appointees and he believes they should excersize
     independent judgement in responding to the various proposals the commission is
     considering and he will not ask his Commissioners to vote for something they do not
     believe will strengthen the Medicare program; conversely, he will not ask them to vote
     against something they believe will help the program.

Q:   What is the President's response to the Patients' Bill of Rights legislation that will
     be marked up by the Senate Labor Committee this Wednesday?

A:   We have not seen the details of the legislation Senator Jeffords intends to mark up this
     Wednesday, but all indications are that it will fall far short of what is necessary to meet
     the needs of patients in a rapidly changing health care system. We understand that it will
     not cover tens of millions of Americans; that it will not have a standard to prevent HMOs
     from making arbitrary coverage decisions; and that it will have a wholly inadequate
     mechanism to enforce patients'. It is our hope that Senator Jeffords and the Committee
     work toward passing a strong, comprehensive, and bipartisan Patients Bill of Rights that
     the President can sign.                                                 .

Q.   Some have criticized the President for being "irresponsible" in proposing funding
     for Medicare without any real structural reforms. Isn't this true?

A.   Absolutely not. Unlike Republicans, he is acknowledging what every Medicare expert
     knows: you cannot significantly extend the life of the Medicare Trust Fund without
     additional financing. To get to 2020 by restructuring alone, a real cut in the program's
     spending would be required, resulting in a growth rate that is 60 percent below private
     spending growth per person. Reducing benefits is not a solution either: today, the value
     of Medicare's benefits is about 80 percent below that offered to the typical employee.
     Thus, some source of new financing is necessary to ensure that Medicare will be
     financially secure when the baby boom generation begins to retire.

              The President has also made it clear that he would prefer to use the surplus for
              Medicare in the context of broader reforms that include adding a long-overdue
              prescription drug benefit. To that end, he outlined principles for improving and
              strengthening Medicare, and hopes that the Commission's recommendations reflect
              those principles. However, he believes that it would pre-empt and undermine the
              work of the Medicare Commission for the Administration to weigh in on any specific
              policy prior to the Commission's report.

         Q    Will the President propose his own plan?

         A,   The President always has that option. He would make that decision based on
              whether it would enhance or detract from gaining a bipartisan consensus on reforms
              that would strengthen and improve the program. He has made no decision on this
              matter at this point.
