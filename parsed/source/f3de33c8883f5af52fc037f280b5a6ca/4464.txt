TEXT:
1. Staffing the Houston Community College event:   I assume we will need a
policy person for this event; Bill Kincaid and Bob Shireman have been
working as a team on the report and other aspects of the event. Should
one of them go--and if so, is it important to you that DPC rather than NEC
provide the policy staff. Do you th1nk I need to go instead of either of
them?

2. Oct. 8 New Jersey Education event:   I agree with you Bruce that we
shouldn't make this into a standards/testing event so as not to ruin our
chances of getting New Jersey if Whitman is reelected. My understanding
is that this was to be a gubernatorial campaign event, though it appears
from the latest e-mail traffic on this that it is more Congressionally
driven? Do you know anything about this? If it is a campaign event of
any kind--do you know if there are limits on my potential involvement?

3. Greaty City Schools -- POTUS was invited to address the October
meeting of the Great City schools in mid October (while he will be in
South America). There are at least four more cities that want to sign up
for the test (San Francisco, Louisville, New Orleans and Milwaukee) and
perhaps a few more to come. What would you think about the VP doing
this? If we don't get tripped up over the language issue, this could be a
good time to get more cities, demonstrating support and continued momentum
during a Congressional battle or, better yet, right after we win.
