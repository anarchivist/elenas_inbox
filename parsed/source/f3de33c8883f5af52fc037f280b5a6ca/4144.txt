TEXT:
A heads-up--

I just heard from Sandra Cook in legislation at ED. She said that the
Department was very concerned about being able to get the NAGBE
legislation cleared to transmit in a timely fashion.  Currently they
anticipate that it won't make it over to OMB until tomorrow morning.
After that, she said folks in the counsel's office at ED think there is a
decent chance that the language may need to be cleared by DOJ (not
generally a speedy process) because of potential constitutional issues
regarding the assignment of certain duties to a board like NAGBE --
evidently similar issues came up when NAGBE was first established.   We
should figure out when we think the legislation HAS to be ready to go up,
and then figure out who needs to be consulted to make sure this can all
happen in a timely way.

I explained to her that I will be out of the office beginning at 3:30
today and that whe will have to work with others here to get this done.

-- Bill
