TEXT:
We've talked to OMB and believe this language essentially puts into law
the compromise we put forth in our memo.

Keith says that Martha Foley will probably argue that we shouldn't offend
Stenholm by criticizing his privatization language in our SAP. So she is
key IF we decide we want this in.

FYI on other, unrelated language in the Stenholm draft:   It would cap
state food stamp administrative costs at 102\ of current levels plus
inflation and caseload.  This is to address the fact that states now have
an incentive to shift welfare admin costs to food stamps and Medicaid,
because TANF caps admin costs at 15% of the total.    CBO has scored this
at some huge amount.  Keith says he doubts OMB would support this, even
though it has a certain budget policy logic to it.   The big problem is
that the states will hate it. Also, he says that the plan is for the
money saved to go to other non-welfare things in the ag bill -- cotton,
etc.
