TEXT:
I just talked to Marvin Krislov to get a preview of where DOL is prior to
this noon meeting. He said:

he can't speak for AFL.  They were "ballistic" after
Arnold&Porter/Treasury meeting Monday because Treasury represented this to
them as a done deal, and also suggested more than they should have that
the new draft was OK with DOL.
Notice still presents some risk; he's not sure how much this adds to the
current risk, although he termed it "not overwhelming"
he said that Treasury has made efforts to reduce the risk.
he thinks it would be very helpful if the AFL could see the latest draft,
to mend fences, see if they are comfortable or have suggestions. He said
he spoke to Elena about this and she "seemed open" to the idea.

Showing it to the AFL could get us into another round of back and forth,
obviously, so that's a risk we should consider.

Laura: please hand this to Elena.
