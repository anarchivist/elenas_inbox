     The President's Budget Cuts Taxes for Middle Class Families
       . Republican Charges that the President's Plan Raises Taxes are Plain Wrong



President's Tax Cuts are Permanent. The President's budget cuts taxes by $98 billion over
five years. Those tax cuts include help for middle-class families who are raising children,
saving to pay for college or to buy a new home. Under our budget, those tax cuts are permanent.

Republican Charge Rests on Three Misleading Assumptions. Some Republicans have
claimed that the President's plan amounts to a $23 billion net tax increase over five years. That
charge rests on three misleading assumptions.

       (1)     It assumes that our tax cuts are temporary -- which would only be true if our
               conservative economic assumptions prove inaccurate. Andfor four years in a
               row, the deficit has been lower and growth has been higher than we have
               predicted.

       (2)     It also counts as a tax increase $34 billion in savings from reducing unwarranted
               corporate subsidies and closing business tax loopholes. That is clearly not a tax
               increase on families.

       (3)     Finally, the Republicans also count $42 billion from the extension of expiring tax
               provisions like the airline ticket tax that even Majority Leader Armey has argued
               should not be viewed as a tax increase.

       Background

       The President's Tax Cuts Don't Sunset as Long as Our Economic Forecast is
       Accurate. Some Republicans assume that we sunset our tax cuts in 2001 in order to
       secure a balanced budget by 2002. But we would only do that if our economic
       assumptions prove to be too optimistic. The fact of the matter is that our
       assumptions have proven to be conservative over the past four years: every year, the
       deficit has been lower and growth has been higher than we had predicted. Since we
       took office, the actual deficit has on average been about $50 billion lower than we
       had projected the year before. CBO has been less accurate: they have
       overestimated the deficit by $59 billion on average. Furthermore, our current
       assumptions are equally prudent and conservative. Our estimates of GDP growth
       and inflation over the next 5 years are precisely the same as the Blue Chip private-sector
       consensus.
                                                                             Automated Records Management System
                                                                             Hex.Dump Conversion



        In addition to not counting some of our tax cuts, the calculation is also misleading
        because it assumes that the budget's $34 billion in savings from reducing unwarranted
        corporate subsidies should be counted as a tax increase on middle-class families -- but
        clearly they are not.

        As for the $42 billion in revenue from extending expiring tax provisions, House
        Majority Leader Richard Armey stated that the extension of the airline ticket tax is not a
        tax increase at all. The National Journal, in its commentary on reinstating the airline
        ticket tax, noted that "House Majority Leader Armey today said he does not consider
        the bill a tax increase because it reinstates a long-standing airline ticket tax that expired
        at the end of 1996. '/ consider [a vote for the tax] a maintenance of effort, ' Armey
        said. " [National Journal, February 25, 1997, page 3.] Over the next 5 years, the extension of the
        airline ticket tax produces $32 billion -- more than enough to ensure that the President's
        budget includes a net tax cut, even in the unlikely event that our conservative economic
        forecasts prove to be wrong.
