TEXT:
The child care advocates (principally CDF and the National Women's Law
Center) have caucused as they promised on the question of whether child
care .should be on the menu of state spending of federal tobacco settlement
dollars.   Their answer is now YES, on the basis that it does not foreclose
any appropriations options for child care. They plan to push this
position with Kennedy, Kerry, etc., knowing that many congressional staff
are grappling with the same question.
