Immigration Issues -- as of January 27, 1999

1.    Public Charge

      Status: Need to finalize guidance, including the interim final rule on deportation.

      Contacts:       Cynthia Rice (DPC)
                      Dan Marcus (WU Counsel)
                      James Castello (DOJ) -- 514-3392
                      Bob Bach (INS) -- 514-3242 or 616-7767
                      Barbara Strack (INS) -- 514-3242 or 514-8860

2.    NACARA regulations

      Status: Comment period on the rule ends January 26, 1999. OLC has been asked to
                  look at whether we could presume hardship for Salvadorans and
                   Guatemalans covered by the legislation.

      Contacts:       Scott Busby (NSC)
                      James Castello (DOJ) -- 514-3392
                      John Morton (DOJ) -- 514-9343

3.    Parity for Salvadorans and Guatemalans

      Status: We are exploring legislation that would provide parity for Salvadorans and
                     Guatemalans (equal to what the Nicaraguans got in NACARA). Leg.
                    Affairs in consulting with the Hill re: what this bill would look like.
                     There appears to be bi-partisan interest in some kind of legislative
                    package, though many members are pushing for us to do the presumptio
                    of extreme hardship first.    .

4.

     Status: The Department of Labor has been approached by Senator Coverdell to begin
                   again a bi-partisan process on H2A reform. We have been approached
                   by grower lobbyists re: heading a process to do the same (though not
                   necessarily a bi-partisan process). We have not yet decided whether we
                   want to go down that road.

                   Barbara Strack (INS) -- 514-3242 or 514-8860

5.   Section 377

     Status: OLC is looking at the question of whether the group that is considered
                    "front-desked" can be expanded beyond the current group defined by
                   the DOJ. We are also pursuing whether we could do a legislative fIX to
                   the registry date (to, perhaps, January 1984) that would relieve all bona
                   fide members of the late amnesty class (all of whom had to be in the U.S.
                   prior to January 1,1982).

6.   HIV+ Refugees

     Status: We need to determine where the INS is in developing their comprehensive
                   regulation. Scott is leading an inter-agency group on this.

          7.    Visas for exploited workers/victims oftraffiking

                Status: DOJ is working on draft legislation that would create a separate temporary visa
                               category for aliens who cooperate in law enforcement actions and are
                               victims of exploitation (including traffiking and smuggling).

          8.    ESLICivics

                Status: Our $70 million initiative is in the FY 2000 budget. This is part of NEC's
                              Adult Literacy initiative.

                              productivity goals (set last A ugust). INS is preparing a briefing for

          10.   INS Reform

                Status: We introduced reform legislation during the last session of Congress.   This is
