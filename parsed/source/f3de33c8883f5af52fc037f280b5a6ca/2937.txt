TEXT:
Emily Bromberg tells me sh spoke to Larry Haas, who says the VP is very
eager to do an immigrants event. They've set aside some time for
Thursday.  He wants it to be an event with members of Congress, advocates,
and real people -- not including mayors.  Emily agrees, because she says
they'll just complain that we haven't gotten enough and would probably
support Shaw's grandfathering provision over the budget agreement.

Bruce -- Emily wants to know if you disagree, and think mayors SHOULD be
there.
