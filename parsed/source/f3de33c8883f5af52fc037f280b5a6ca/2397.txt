TEXT:
Regarding the VP's paper briefing for his meeting w/ Senators Kennedy and

Conrad, I was wondering if anyone had any thoughts on what information to

include in the briefing.    I have a two-pager that Kennedy sent to the VP

on his concerns w/ the McCain bill.    I can include that and any

information you have on Conrad's conerns.       I'm happy to call over to

Conrad's office, but I don't want to interfere w/ your communications with

the Hill.



!   assume much of the information will be told to the VP in    pers~m   in the

briefing prior to the meeting tomorrow.     Let me know.   Thanks~
