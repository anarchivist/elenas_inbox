TEXT:
Maria spoke to Feinstein and she is willing to not submit the legislation
- however Feinstein expects that the rule will be completed by May 24 and
she wants a briefing for her Legislative Director Mark Kadish and her
Judiciary staff person L. Strickland.

Maria wants us to procede with setting up the briefing as soon as
possible, she also wants to be kept in the loop.   Please let me know who
will arrange the briefing and when it will happen.

Thanks.
