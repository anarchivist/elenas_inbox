                                                      1/14/98

I.         LEGISLATION

*       Status: DPC, WH Counsel, OPL, DOJ, EEOC, SBA, Labor, Commerce
have met many times. DOJ/EEOC has produced draft legislation.

*      Draft bill does not currently satisfy constituency group.
(Marshall memo on outstanding issues.)


II.        STATUS: EXTERNAL VETTING

*       Have met with religious groups led by Folton.  If we can work out
issues with them, should vet with other non-coalition member groups.
Including:

*          Labor (some vetting required-- premium pay issue remains) .

*       Business (Chamber Commerce etc. have been alerted but complete
vetting needed) .

*       Legislative (Leg. Affairs has waited to contact Coates/Kerry--
thinks they will be     very interested if groups sign on.)

III.       OPTIONS

*          Get everyone to agree to Administration bill.    (Best choice)

*       Get close enough to endorse common principles with Senators and
constituency groups.

IV.        NEXT STEPS AND TIMING
