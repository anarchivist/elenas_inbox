                            Question and Answer on Fathers Count Act Hex-Dump Conversion
                                          June 12, 1998

      Question:   Does the Administration support HR 3314, the Fathers Count Act of 1998?

      Answer:     We certainly support the general goal of encouraging states and communities to
                  help fathers become more involved in their children's lives ami share the 60n6erns
                  aeo\it "'lorking families, both mothers ana fathers. The Administration has
                  always placed a high priority on supporting strong and healthy working wo parent
                  families and on strengthening the role offathers. This track record includes:
                  family friendly policies such as the Family and Medical Leave Act, expansion of
                  the Earned Income Tax Credit and the new Child Tax Credit; initiatives to
                  promote father involvement in child health immunization and early education;
                  demonstration projects to promote responsible fatherhood; and employment
                  programs for non-custodial parents of children on welfare so they can help support
                  their children. We remain ready to work with Congress on initiatives that will
                  help hard pressed families meet their needs, including child care.

                  We would be glad to work with Congress on the specific provisions of the Fathers
                  Count Act at an appropriate time. Funding for the initiative would need to be
                  considered within the context of other priorities and within the context of the
                  balanced budget.

                  Background
                  The bill was introduced by Clay Shaw on March 3 and now has 7 Republican
                  co-sponsors. It would authorize $2 billion over five years for block grants to states
                  for projects to encourage fathers to become better parents. Funding levels grow
                  from $200 M in 2000 to $500 M in 2004. The funds would be distributed by HHS
                  to states based on their share of total population, and would be targeted to private
                  organizations (75 percent) and to fathers below the state or local average income
                  of male earners (80 percent). The bill specifically declares religious
                  organizations eligible to receive funds under the act.

                  Funds could be used to: I) encourage unmarried or prospective fathers to get
                  married, and encourage better parenting both by fathers who are living with their
                  children and those who are not and 2) help fathers obtain gainful employment or
                  increase their skills in order to qualitY for higher paying jobs. The bill also
                  specifies that a state who receives a Fathers grant may use Welfare-to-Work and
                  Title XX (Social Services Block Grant) funds for the same purpose. Up to $10
                  million annually is earmarked for research and evaluation, with another $10
                  million annually earmarked for technical assistance.

                  While the bill has not moved to date, it is possible that the National Fatherhood
                  summit on June 15th may generate new momentum.
