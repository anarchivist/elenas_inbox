TEXT:
We are going to have a meeting with DOJ and INS on Thursday, January 8 to
discuss possible legislative language so that battered immigrant women can
remain here while their visa applications are pending. We set up this
meeting in response to concerns by the Audrey Haynes and the Violence
Against Women Office.  Thanks, Mary
