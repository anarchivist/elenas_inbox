RE:           DPC Weekly Report


        Education -- Senate Democrats Education Agenda: DPC staff met with staff from
Sens. Daschle, Kennedy and Dodd's offices to discuss a Democratic leadership package for
the next Congress. The issues they identified as highest priority and most likely to unite
the caucus include our Class Size Reduction and School Modernization initiatives, as well
as possible initiatives on technology teacher training and safe schools. However, they
thought it would be more difficult to unite the caucus behind new proposals addressing
either teacher quality or public school choice. We will continue to work closely with Sen.
Daschle's office as these discussions proceed.

        Education -- National Board for Professional Teaching Standards: The National
Board announced on Thursday that 924 teachers from 37 states earned National Board
certification during 1997-1998. This brings the total number of board-certified teachers to
1,836 in 45 states and D.C. Most of these teachers are concentrated in North Carolina
(536) Ohio (337) and California (129), though the newly certified teachers also include the
first from Arkansas -- Susan Lockhart, from Rena Elementary School in Van Buren. Mike
Cohen will be meeting with NBPTS President Jim Kelly next week to map out plans for
putting the board on stronger, bipartisan political footing in the next Congress.

        Welfare Reform -- Vice Presidential Welfare-to-Work Event: On Friday, November
20th the Vice President will announce the second round of Welfare-to-Work competitive grants
at a town hall meeting with civic and faith-based organizations, employers, and individuals wh9
have moved from welfare to work. You announced the first round of competitive grants at a
Welfare to Work event in late May. While the Department of Labor is still finalizing the grant
awards, we expect to award approximately 75 new grants totaling over $250 million. The Vice
President will be joined by Secretary Herman and we expect several other Cabinet Secretaries to
amplify this message at similar events around the country.

        Welfare Reform -- Caseload Dynamics: A new study presented at the Southern
Economic Association meeting last week sheds some important new light on the employment
rates of families leaving the welfare rolls. The report tracked welfare recipients in Atlanta,
Baltimore, Houston, and Kansas City by matching welfare case data with emploYment data
submitted by employers through the Unemployment Insurance reporting system. All four cities
have experienced substantial caseload declines over the last few years, as well as substantial
    increases in the rates of long-term recipients leaving the welfare rolls (although because short
    term recipients are leaving the rolls at even greater rates, the proportion of the caseload that is
    long-term recipients is still growing). Most significantly, the study found that the proportion of
    those leaving welfare and going to work has increased in all four cities. Specifically, between
    early 1993 and late 1997, the proportion of people who were working in the quarter after they left
    the rolls increased from 55% to 67% in Kansas City, 47% to 57% in Atlanta, 45% to 56% in
    Baltimore, and 43% to 47% in Houston.

             Health -- Labor Department Amicus Brief to Supreme Court Regarding Health
    Insurance Remedies: Within the next two weeks, the Department of Labor will be filing an
    amicus brief to the Supreme Court that argues that the Employee Retirement Income
    Security Act (ERISA) does not preempt State insurance laws providing remedies to
    consumers who wish to sue insurers who have taken actions that have caused them harm.
    This brief would effectively overturn a previous Reagan Administration Labor Department
    provision that argued that ERISA did preempt State insurance law in this area. We believe
    the filing of this brief is advisable and appropriate for two reasons. First, we believe it is
    consistent with the underlying statute, which has a "savings clause" that explicitly states
    that State insurance law is not preempted. Second, we believe it will strengthen our hand
    on the Hill in the debate surrounding enforcement provisions of the Patients Bill of Rights.
    If the Supreme Court upholds our position, it will still validate the need for Federal
    legislation for self insured plans not regulated by the State. If the Supreme Court rejects
    our argument, it will highlight the fact that no American has any remedy to resort to when
    insurance practice has harmed an enrollee. Although under normal circumstances, the
    business community would strongly oppose this position, it is unclear what public position
    they would take in response to this filing. They may conclude that it only highlights the fact
    that individuals have no real remedies under current law and opt to lay low. In between
    now and the date of the filing, we will need to determine whether it is advisable to
    significantly publicize this amicus brief or not.

            Health -- Racial Disparities in Heart Disease: This week, the Morbidity and Mortality
    Weekly Report at the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) included new information on racial
    disparities in heart disease. The report finds that from 1981 to 1995, death rates for heart
    disease fell for women and men of all age groups. However, the ratio of blacks to whites who
    died from heart disease increased by nearly 20 percent during this time frame and is higher than
    2.5 times for certain age groups. The racial disparity increased across all age groups,
    particularly for men and women between the ages of 45 to 54. Moreover, the disparity increased
    during each of the three five year time periods examined. This study underscores the need for
    your racial health disparities initiative, which seeks to eliminate disparities in six critical health
    areas, including heart disease, by the year 2010.
