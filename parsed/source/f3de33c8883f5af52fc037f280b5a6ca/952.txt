TEXT:
As you know,   on March 3 POTUS and FLOTUS will be announcing a PSA
developed by   the AdCouncil and the Benton Foundation to encourage
volunteerism   overall, but primarily with the Coalition for America's
Children 350   organization network.  There are two issues here:

1) the connection with the Summit.  I have talked with Diana and we are
brainstorming some possibilities. At a minimum to have perhaps those
companies that have made commitments (Newsweek) highlighted in POTUS'
speech and be guests as well.
 - Interetsed in your thoughts and just wanted you to be aware.

2) there are number of potential attendees that were forwarded to the
Communications office for vetting.   I have been talking with Laura
Schwartz about the event so she forwarded them to me.
In any case I would like your guidance on how to proceed.   I'll attach the
list of folks - mostly business (donors) that I was a little concerned
about.  There are also some of the Coalition's representatives coming, but
I don't think there will be a problem there - Public Liaison is looking at
them.  She will need some feedback COB.
