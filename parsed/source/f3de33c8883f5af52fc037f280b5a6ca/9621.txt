That there is no policy in this speech, unless you know something I don't
know. waldman and Elena just talked, and tell me that he's just there to
say a few nice things about the cops and then talk about the approps
process.

So, I don't know what, if anything, you can give me, except your thoughts
on the best way to talk about the crime record in way that segues well
with the approps stuff ... and your forgiveness.

Yours in struggle.
