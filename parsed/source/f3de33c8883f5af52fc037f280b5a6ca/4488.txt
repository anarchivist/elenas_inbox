TEXT:
Just talked to Riley. He will call Graham and Wellstone first thing in the
morning on the Bingaman letter.

He told me he talked to POTUS about the Black and Hispanic Caucuses -- and
told him that "we need to do something on school construction to split off
the Black Caucus, and something on the tests to split off or neutralize
the Hispanic caucus." He said POTUS agreed.

Fort~nately,   they did not have a chance to discuss details.
