PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
STATEMENT ON EDUCATION STANDARDS
THE WHITE HOUSE
January 8, 1998

        Good morning. This week, an independent report showed that more
than half the students in our nationD,s city schools are failing to master
the basics in reading, math, and science -- the building blocks of all the
skills our children need to succeed in the 21st Century. And while some
city schools systems are making progress, all too many are clearly failing
our children.

        As a nation, we have a responsibility to all our children-- and
especially those in our most vulnerable communities. That is why I have
fought for excellence, competition, and accountability in our nationD,s
public schools, with more parental involvement, greater choice, better
teaching, and an end to social promotion.

        Above all, that is why I have fought for high national standards
and national tests to help our children reach their highest potential.
Since I called for national standards, I am proud to say that 15 major
city school systems have stepped forward to accept that challenge.  But we
must not rest until every school system in the nation commits to adopting
high standards -- and helping their students to meet them.

        If we are going to prepare our nation for the 21st Century, we
must continue to expand opportunity for all of our people -- and when it
comes to our childrenD,s education, that means continuting to expect and
demand the very best from our school, our teachers, and above all, from
our students.  We cannot afford to let them down when they need us the
most.

           Thank you.
