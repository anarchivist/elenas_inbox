FYI -- Did you folks know Ray Fisher is slated to be nominated to the 9th
Circuit? If they actually approve him, we'll need a new Associate
sympathetic to and interested in COPS II.    Personally, I'm for bringing
back Andy Fois ... he's a known quantity on the Hill; pro-COPS; knows the
insider politics at DOJ; and could be a huge help in working on Crime Bill
II .
