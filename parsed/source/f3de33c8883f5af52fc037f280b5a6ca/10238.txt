MEMORANDUM TO ASSISTANTS TO THE PRESIDENT

 FROM:           JOHN PODESTA AND MARIA ECHAVESTE

 SUBJECT:                  MISSION STATEMENTS


Earlier this month, we asked members of the Cabinet to prepare summaries
of what they would like to accomplish in their agencies dur.ing the next
two years. At the beginning of the President's second term, we asked you
to prepare similar mission statements outlining the goals and objectives
for your departments.

While we do. not want to reinvent the wheel, we would like you to review
your offices' previous work and prepare a short summary of what you would
like to accomplish in your departments -- what your revised goals and
obj ecti ves are -.- over the next two years. We know you have been working
hard and have accomplished a great deal for this President.    We would like
this exercise to build upon that work and' challenge you to stretch your
vision, again. This information will be very helpful to us and we would Ii
ke to share your thoughts with the President.    Please provide your
submissions to us by the close of business on Wednesday, December 2.
