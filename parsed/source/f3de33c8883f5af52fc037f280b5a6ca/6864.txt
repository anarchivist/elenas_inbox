TEXT:
I know you two are swamped with tobacco so I've been trying to. avoid
bothering you, but I have two questions:

1. Elena, do those scheduling requests look okay?   I'm trying to get them
in before April and May are filled.

2.  Paul mentioned that Rahm is interested in doing a "tax" radio address
on April 11, focusing primarily on child care tax credits.  That seems
fine to me.  Paul said that Rahm did not envision doing anything new in
the radio address. The only issue is whether we push to do anything on
stay at home at that time or not.  Let me know what you think.

Also, FYI, a few highlights . . . Today the Women's Caucus is doing a
bipartisan press conference on child care, Chafee has scheduled a hearing
for April 22, and Andie King has created a Democratic task force on child
care.
