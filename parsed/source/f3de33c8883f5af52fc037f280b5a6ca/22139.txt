TEXT:
One of our many friends out in the real world sent along this quote from
Robert Kennedy in April 1968 as an idea for POTUS talking about ending the
politics of destruction in SOU. It also fits well with a 'One America'
theme.

"When you teach a man to hate and fear his brother, when you teach that he
is a lesser man because of his color or his beliefs or the policies he
pursues, when you teach that those who differ from you threaten your
freedom
or your job or your family, then you also learn to confront others not as
fellow citizens but as enemies, to be met not with cooperation but with
conquest; to be subjugated and mastered .... We learn, at the last, to look
to
our brothers as aliens ... We learn to share only a common fear, only a
common
desire to retreat from each other, only a common impulse to meet
disagreement with force ... We must admit in ourselves that our children's
future cannot be built on the misfortunes of others ... But we can perhaps
remember, if only for a time, that those who live with us are our brothers,
that they share with us the same short moment of life; that they seek, as
do
we, nothing but the chance to live their lives in purpose and in happiness,
winning what satisfaction they can .... Surely we can learn, at the least, to
look at those around us as fellow men, surely we can begin to work a little
harder to bind up the wounds among us and to become in our hearts brothers
and countrymen once again."
