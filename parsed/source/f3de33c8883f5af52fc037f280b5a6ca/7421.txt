TEXT:
Bruce/Elena:
At yesterday's subcommittee mark-up, Smith's bill was voted out with no
amendments (on a voice vote). Afterwards, both the Intel lobbyist and
someone from Senator Abraham's staff approached Peter saying that it
appeared as if they had to deal with us. A very good sign.   The Intel
lobbyist was the most stridently opposed to our reform ideas when we met
with high-tech lobbyists when this whole thing first started (a couple of
months ago).

The full committee mark-up is scheduled for next Wed. or Thursday. Also,
the Intel execs are in town next Wednesday and their lobbyist has asked
for a meeting.  Peter is going to try to set something up (to include
Sally and Elena). Peter may want to cast this as "informational" rather
than a place to deal, pricipally b/c he thinks that we may be able to get
all that we want out of the full committee mark-up.  Also, Peter is
setting up a Democratic staff briefing for Monday (also to include Sally
and Elena) .

Finally, Abraham's bill is likely to go to the floor the week of May 11th
(high-tech week in the Senate). We are going to begin working on a SAP.

Julie
