          Please see below (highlighted in blue) a corrected description of the
          bill. Also - H.R. 1852 was pulled from the agenda for tomorrow - but will
          probably come up after the Memorial Day break. So the fire drill is off
          for today. will keep you posted.

          Subject:         HR 1852 - Multi-jurisdiction Cases

          Heads Up -
          The House JUdiciary Committee is scheduled to markup HR 1852 tomorrow.
          This bill expands Federal court jurisdiction. in a very narrowly defined
          category of cases - mass tort litigation arising from a "single event or
          occurence."

          Last Congress, HR 1252 - The Judicial Reform Act - included an identical
          prov~s~on.  The 3/10/98 Justice letter on H.R. 1252 stated that "we would
          consider supporting such a provision separate from this legislation."

          Justice expects to submit a short letter to OMB for clearance supporting
4     ...

    HR 1852 for quick clearance (in time for transmittal before tomorrow's
    lOam markup) .
