TEXT:
Later today Waxman will announce he's going to release RJR documents
showing presentations to the board by its marketing department on the need
to reach young smokers (14-24 years old), that "the future is young
smokers" and the need to advertise in places like Sports Illustrated, and
that the companies were doing quarterly surveys of teens.
