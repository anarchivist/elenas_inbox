The gist of the earlier versions of the amendment we saw was that it would let
States access the contingency fund in FY97, and with some conditions, basically
meant that only New MExico and maybe one other small state (Utah, Nevada or
something like that) could get in.  I'm hesitating because I know there were
some modifications to the amendment in the last round, but I don't know what
they are yet.  I offered a redrafted paragraph for the memo to Diana -- I'll
send you a copy and that should explain it.
