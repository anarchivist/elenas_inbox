TEXT:
As you will see from the document that (with some technological
luck) I have attached below, Jeff Connaughton has been erroneously
tasked with providing Q & A's for the President on Ruby Ridge and
Waco.  It seems to me that Elena should take responsibility for
the former and Cheryl for the latter. Note the Monday deadline.
I have a copy of the the sample format, which Odetta will send
over to you.  Thanks.

TEXT:
The President is participating in a NATIONAL radio town hall meeting on
Thursday, September 21, 1995. The show is being done live from Los Angeles with
over 200 radio stations from around the country participating. Larry King will
host and the President will take questions for an hour.
We are starting to pull the briefing materials together. The President has a
large block of briefing time on Wednesday for this event. We will most likely
need to send the briefing out on Monday.
Listed below are the subject areas we will need Q & A from and who I assume the
contacts are.  please let me know if the contact is someone else. As you
compile your Q & A, please keep in mind that this is a briefing for questions
from a wide range of talk radio listeners all across America. The questions ARE
NOT from journalists, so Q & A should be written in jargon-free language.
Please call me (6-5690) if you need any additional information or guidance.
Please have your Q & A in disc and hard copy form to me by 11:00 am on Monday.
This should give us enough time to make additions or revisions if necessary.
Some updates may be necessary since the town hall is not until Thursday. Julie
Mason is sending you a copy of the preferable format under separate cover.
Thank you for your help!
