Subject:         Surgeon General's Report

Eriksen said that they do have a Surgeon General's report coming out in
the near future on tobacco. It is called "Reducing Tobacco Use", which
discusses what works in terms of treatment, education, economics,
regulatory action, etc. It has been in the works for 4 years, and is
slated to be released in November. If we make it a priority, they can
probably have it out in late September / early October.   I asked if it
addressed teens, and he said it does in terms of education, media, price
and access.

If we do push them to release it sooner rather than later, it could get
some decent play right before the election.

While this is not necessarily top secret, they are trying to keep it
quiet. FYI.
