TEXT:
Dave Beyer of the Vice President's office asked me if he could get a copy
of the DPC weekly report to the President.  I told him it was our policy
not to distribute the DPC weekly to the President, because it is in theory
confidential.  I also advised him that we left the decision of
distribution of the weekly to the discretion of the Office of the Staff
Secretary.

Beyer does get our weekly from Klain, but not until two weeks later.   He
argues it helps them keep organized and informed, especially when they
only have four policy staffers.  I told him I would ask you if we could
give him a copy but that he should also ask Staff Secretary to go on the
distribution list.

Please Advise.
