MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM BRUCE REED
         CHUCK RUFF

RE:            Attached ONDCP Memorandum on the Southwest Border Region

      Attached is a memorandum that General McCaffrey sent to you outlining
recommendations on how to improve the Administration's drug interdiction efforts along the
Southwest border. Although we share the General's concerns, we do not support his
recommendations at this time and do not believe this issue should be tasked to the Drug Policy
Council for resolution.

       First, the Treasury and Justice Departments have strong reservations about ONDCP's
recommendations. In fact, less than a month ago, we met with Secretary Rubin, Attorney
General Reno, and General McCaffrey to discuss coordination of border-related issues. At that
time, General McCaffrey was preparing to send a report to Congress on the Southwest border
that made the same recommendations as the attached mernorandum. Secretary Rubin and the
Attorney General expressed their opposition to sending this report to Congress, and General
McCaffrey agreed to hold it. Rubin and Reno -- who oversee the enforcement agencies that
carry out the drug, crime, trade and immigration laws along the border -- have concerns that
assigning a single, federal official at each point of entry to coordinate drug interdiction will
negatively affect or conflict with our immigration and trade policies.

        Second, several other border-related issues are currently being discussed in the White
House and among the agencies, and will need to be resolved over the next few months. Most
notably, the Commission on Immigration Reform recently released its final report recommending
that the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) be disbanded and its responsibilities --
including border enforcement -- parceled out to various agencies. In the wake of this report;
Members of Congress have introduced INS reform plans and included appropriations language
requiring the Administration to submit similar plans by e,arly next year.

        Because of all the above, we proposed at our recent meeting with Secretary Rubin, the
Attorney General, and General McCaffrey that a White House-led working group consider all
border-related proposals and the issues of drug and crime enforcement, immigration, and trade
that they raise. We have met internally and concluded that the White House group will be led by
DPC; include Counsel's Office, OMB, NSC and NPR; and will closely coordinate with all the
affected agencies to ensure that their issues are fully considered. Although we recognize
ONDCP's specific mandate to oversee the High-Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas and coordinate
certain counterdrug technologies and intelligence -- and support these issues being discussed by
the Drug Policy Council -- border issues that go beyond the reach of drug policy would be more
                                                                    Automated Records Management System
                                                                    I lex-Dump Conversion

    appropriately handled by the process we have outlined. At OMB's request, we expect to have
    some initial recommendations before the budget process is concluded. We recommend that you
    support this process for coordinating border-related issues.               .
