TEXT:
I am very sorry I missed the meeting this afternoon but I spoke with Allen
Erenbaum of INS and I believe I am up to speed on the roll-out plan but
let me know if you have anything to add.

My understanding is that by this Friday, 5/14, INS will send me the
following documents:
        1. Roll-out Plan to the Hill and groups -including who will do
the briefing, who will be briefed, where and when
        2. Talking points
        3.  Fact sheet/background
        4.  Qs and As

The plan is for a low-key roll-out next week- probably 5/18 or 5/19.

Thanks.
