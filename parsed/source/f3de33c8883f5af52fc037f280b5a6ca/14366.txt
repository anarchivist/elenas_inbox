Subject: RE: Proposition 211-NEW DRAFT

           I think the draft is fine but it doesn't address the concern in
           the letters which is that we would do something to preempt 211,
or
           presumably any future proposition like it.   We didn't do so.    So
I
           think we should point that out.

    Thank you very much for writing to me about Proposition 211, the California ballot initiative
    regarding securities lawsuits.

    I opposed this Proposition because I felt it would undermine the balance between the federal and
    state governments with respect to the regulation of widely trade securities. As my veto of last
    year's Securities Reform Act attests, I believe strongly in the need to protect the rights of
    defrauded investors. But after careful consideration, I determined that Proposition 211 's creation
    of a novel cause of action, broader than any now recognized, would have gone too far in the other
    direction, deterring companies from providing useful information and thereby harming American
    investors.

    Thank you again for giving me your views.
