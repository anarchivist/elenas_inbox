TEXT:
You may already know this, but the Kasich budget plan would do some other
rotten things in welfare (in addition to cutting all the welfare-to-work
money in 1999, as Andrea noted·earlier):

eliminate the money we got added in the BBA for work slots to soften the
food stamp cuts for 18-50 childless adults;
freeze the shelter deduction;
takes a mysteriously large amount out·of food stamp admin costs ($4
billion) ;
big EITC cut.

In the service world, it would also eliminate funding for AmeriCorps (so
much for Harris's efforts to reach out to this guy).
