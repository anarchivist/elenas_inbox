TEXT:
Bruce, just following up on your message from last night ... Apparently OMB
staff are still thinking about this issue internally -- I've heard nothing
more today.   On TANF rule, HHS has promised to send us a summary of key
issues and changes from NPRM on Monday.  This will be a big help in
attacking the 1,078 pgs. We'll be able to give you a general sense of hot
issues before your meeting with Shalala, and those things she's likely to
highlight, but I doubt you'll need (or want) to react to specifics at t
his session.
