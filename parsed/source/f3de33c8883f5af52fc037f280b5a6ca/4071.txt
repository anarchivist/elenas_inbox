CRIME

Sex Offenders -- Yesterday, a divided federal appeals court upheld the
constitutionality of New Jersey's "Megan's Law." The court held that it
is not unconstitutional for authorities to notify residents of convicted
sex offenders living in the community.   The Third Circuit Court was the
highest court to rule on the constitutionality of community
notification.   All 50 states have laws requiring sex offenders to
register with law enforcement upon release from prison and 46 states have
enacted laws on community notification of released sex offenders. The
federal Megan's Law you signed last year requires states to impose
community notification systems by November or risk losing federal funds.


COPS Program -- On Friday, the COPS Office will announce $73 million in
grants to police departments to fund 1,000 additional officers and
deputies. The grants will go to 48 states and two U.S. territories,
bringing the total to more than 64,000 community officers funded under the
Clinton COPS Program.
