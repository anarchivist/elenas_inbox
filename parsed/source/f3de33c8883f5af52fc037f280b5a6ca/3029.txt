Public Health Provisions

       FDA Authority. This is a critical issue still under discussion. While preserving FDA
       regulation of tobacco as a "drug-delivery device" under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act,
       the negotiators have considered placing some limits on FDA's ability to regulate nicotine and
       other cigarette ingredients in the next 12 years, and modifYing the regulatory criteria and
       process somewhat.

       Youth Access Restrictions. Codifies FDA rule. In addition, among other things: bans all
       vending machines, requires tobacco products to be behind the counter; and establishes a
       nationwide licensing system for tobacco retailers with graduated penalties and supervision.
       FDA and state attorneys general would have joint enforcement authority over FDA
       provisions, and industry would fund enforcement effort. May prohibit FDA from modifying
       agreed-to provisions for up to 7 years.

        Marketing and Advertising Codifies FDA rule. In addition, among other things: eliminates
        all billboards and outdoor signs; eliminates all human images and cartoon characters from all
        advertising and from all cigarette packages; places further restrictions on store placement of
        ads; prohibits product placement in movies and on TV. FDA and state attorneys general
        would have joint enforcement authority over these provisions, and industry would fund
      . enforcement effort. May prohibit FDA from modifYing agreed-to provisions for up to 7 years.

                                                                   Automated Records Management System
                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion
       previous campaigns in California and Massachusetts.

       Health Warnings. Revises the warning label system. Requires new black and white
       Canadian-style warnings occupying at least 25 percent of the front of the package. New
       possible warnings include: "WARNING: Cigarettes are Addictive;" and "WARNING:
       Smoking Can Kill you."

       Smoking Cessation. Industry would provide funds to the Federal government to subsidize
       smoking cessation programs for those who want to quit.

       State and Local Tobacco Control. Industry would fund state and local tobacco control
       activity modeled on HHS's ASSIST program. The grant program currently covers a limited
       number of states, and would be expanded to all states.

       Environmental Tobacco Smoke. Embraces Congressman Waxman's proposal to restrict
       tobacco use in public places and most workplaces to locations separately ventilated to the
       outside that non-smokers don't pass through. Exempts bars and certain restaurants.


Industry Accountability and Disclosure

       Youth Smoking Targets. The industry would be subject to penalties if youth tobacco use
       fails to drop by 30 percent in 5 years, 50 percent in 7 years and 60 percent in ten years. The
       penalty is $80 million per percentage point under target.

       Document Disclosure. All documents which would have been revealed through the
       litigation process would be made public and the industry would make public its health-related
       research in the future.

       Monitoring of Corporate Behavior. To ensure industry complies with the law,
       manufacturers would be required to develop detailed compliance plans; corporations would be
       required to set up incentive plans to encourage compliance; and industry would be required to
       use auditors and report on behavior to shareholders.

Liability

       Right to Suet Limitation on Damage Awards. Does not abridge rights of individuals to
       sue, but limits individual damage awards to no more than $1 million in one year. Prohibits
       class action suits. Sets up $4 billion annual fund for liability payments. Prohibits punitive
       damages for past actions. Industry would make one-time $10 billion "punitive" payment to
       the Federal government for past behavior.

       Settles all state Medicaid suits.   Includes states that have not filed suits. Money distributed
       as outlined below.
