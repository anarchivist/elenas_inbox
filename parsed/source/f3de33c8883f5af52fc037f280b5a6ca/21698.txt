TEXT:
At the end of the meeting with Maria, it was decided that at the radio
address (which I suppose has already been taped), Mrs. Gore will recommend
that the AG continue to stay deportation for nationals of all four Central
American countries (El Salvador; Nicaragua; Guatemala; Honduras) through
the holidays.  On Monday, the DOJ will issue a statement effecting such a
continuation, and set a date (likely January 1st or 6th) for when they
will conduct their next review to determine if continued suspension is ne
eded for each country.

During her trip to the region on Monday, HRC will reiterate the
President's and Mrs. Gore's message.

Sometime within the next week or so, we will announce TPS for Honduras and
Nicaragua.  We will also announce our support for legislation that would
give amnesty to the Salvadorans and Guatemalans in the ABC class
(currently eligible for pre-1996 suspension of deportation with the
modified procedure) and the small class of Hondurans who are equivalent;
i.e., those who applied for amnesty prior to December 1992.
