TEXT:
The proposal regarding tobacco farmers sent by Mike Easley to Bruce
Lindsey seemed like a reasonable starting place according to the tobacco
program experts at USDA.  Its central elements-- a commitment by
manufacturers to annually purchase a minimum quantity of tobacco and for
the government to continue the price support program is similar to other
proposals that have been floated.   In addition, its contemplation of a
possible transition and quota compensation program is similar to other
programs-- although USDA thinks it will be somewhat cheaper than the
current Ford proposal for instance.

There seems to be a problem with the numbers, however, in the proposal for
quota program costs. Briefly put, the estimates contemplate an increase in
subsidy of a fixed 873 million pounds of tobacco in the top half of the
chart, and in the second chart estimate that the amount of tobacco in the
program will have declined to 555 million pounds by 2005.  If one assumes
the program will shrink, than the program will be somewhat cheaper than
the projections in the chart.
