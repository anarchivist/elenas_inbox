U.S. Seeks to Spur Use of Aid by Immigrants
              By PATRICK J. MCDONNELL, Times Staff Writer


                              The Clinton administration plans to unveil
long-awaited but
                              controversial rules today that officials say
should help tens of
                         thousands of legal immigrants seek publicly financed
health, nutrition
                         and other aid without fear of deportation or other
consequences.
                              "This new regulation will improve the health of
our families by
                        addressing widespread confusion that prevents legal
immigrants
                         from signing up for health insurance, school lunch,
child care and
                        other essential programs," said Vice President Al
Gore, who is
                         scheduled to announce the guidelines during a stop
in Texas.
                              The changes, effective immediately, are
designed to quell a
                        persistent fear in the immigrant community from
California to Florida
                        to New York that applying for public benefits can
put
                        applicants--even legal immigrants--on the road to


deportation.
                            Stoking the fears are incidents in which
federal and state
                      authorities have cited immigrants' past use of aid
in attempts to
                      deport them or bar them from bringing relatives from
abroad. The
                      new rules would explicitly ban use of such noncash
aid against
                      immigrants.
                          The widespread fear in the immigrant community,
health
                       professionals say, has resulted in broad
underutilization of many
                       initiatives, including Medicaid (Medi-Cal in
California, the
                       federal-state health insurance plan for the poor)
and the Children's
                       Health Insurance Program (Healthy Families in
California, for
                       uninsured youth) .
                             Some people even avoid immunizations and
treatment of
                       communicable diseases, officials say, which
threatens to undermine
                       the nation's public health regimen and spread
contagious illnesses.
                             The changes, to be announced after months of
intense debate
                       within the White House, come after several studies
documented a
                       steep decline in receipt of benefits among
immigrants.
                             A report released in March by the Urban
Institute, a Washington
                       research organization, found that welfare use by
noncitizen
                       households plummeted 35% between 1994 and 1997. That
was
                      more than double the 15% drop among citizens. The
decline was
                       even sharper in Los Angeles County, one of the
nation's principal
                       immigrant magnets.
                             The Urban Institute found the drop was largely
linked to the
                       "chilling effects" of efforts to link benefit
eligibility to immigration
                      status. Community health care workers have seen the
fear
                       first-hand.
                             "Even women with very high-risk pregnancies are
scared to
                      death to ask for aid that they are entitled to,"
said Lynn Kersey of
                      Maternal and Child Health Access, a nonprofit group
in Los
                      Angeles.
                             Officials of California and other states have
pressed the Clinton


                         administration to clarify the matter, as have
activists with Latino
                         groups and other immigrant lobbies.
                              The change--and the fact that the new rules are
being announced
                         by Gore, a presidential aspirant--once again
underscores how the
                         atmosphere in Washington has become considerably more
                         pro-immigrant since 1996, when Congress severely cut
noncitizen
                         access to public benefits as part of its landmark
welfare overhaul.
                              "The administration has learned, and in many
ways politicians in
                         general have learned, that they do well politically
when they do the
                         right things for immigrants," said cecilia Munoz,
vice president for
                         policy for the National Council of La Raza.
                              Although Latino organizations and allied groups
praised the
                         changes, activists seeking reductions of immigration
levels were
                         expected to be harshly critical.
                              "These rules will increase the number of
immigrants on welfare
                         who will be able to bring in more immigrants to go
on welfare and
                         are an insult to all Americans--native born and
immigrant," said U.S.
                         Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Texas), who heads the House
immigration
                         subcommittee.
                              The regulations do not make anyone newly
eligible for benefits.
                              Rather, the move provides specific direction to
federal agencies,
                         including the Immigration and Naturalization Service
and the State
                         Department, that have the responsibility of
determining whether
                         immigrants and potential immigrants are a likely
"public charge," or a
                         drain on public resources. Officials regularly
interview immigrants
                         seeking permanent resident status and citizenship.
                              For more than 100 years, a person's likelihood
to become a
                         public charge has been a ground for inadmissibility
and deportation.
                         But, until now, there has been no precise definition
of the term.
