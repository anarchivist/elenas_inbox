TEXT:
 Ah well more information --it turns out the distribution system I was in
told was in place doesn't really work like that ...

So here's where we are: we will produce talking points ,aiming for twice
a week . And we will get a real distribution system, although that will
take longer.

Suggestions for what is useful in form and content gratefully accepted.
