Consumer Credit and Financial ServicesBill of Rights.  Consumer debt
levels are at record highs. So too are consumer bankruptcies. And as
fees for financial services (including ATMs) mount, consumer anger
grows.   Working with the DPC, we could develop an initiative and
legislative proposal aimed at educating consumers about the use of credit
and bank services, improving the information consumers receive, and
targeting predatory practices.
