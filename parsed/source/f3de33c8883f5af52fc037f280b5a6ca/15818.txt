TEXT:
Phil-- here is the final copy of the directive.  It has been cleared by
DPC, OMB, WH Counsel, Treasury/ATF and main Justice. Justice OLC has a
problem with bullet (3) on page 2 of the directive dealing with warning
that handguns are a leading cause of juvenile violence and fatalities.
Treasury was also concerned but signed off on the language as drafted.

OLC is debating whether they will officially oppose this line; we decided
not to wait any longer to give this to you.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY

SUBJECT:       Enforcing the Youth Handgun Safety Act

A major problem in our nation today is the terrifying ease with which our young people gain
illegal or unintended access to guns. Firearms are now responsible for 12 percent of fatalities
among all American children and teenagers. Criminal use of firearms by young people is a
national tragedy. Between 1984 and 1994, the number of juvenile offenders committing
homicides by firearms nearly quadrupled. Moreover, firearms are the fourth leading cause of
accidental deaths among children ages 5-14 and are now the primary method by which young
people commit suicide. A recent study supported by the Department of Justice found that
slightly more than half of all privately owned firearms were stored unlocked and approximately
one-third of all handguns were stored both loaded and unlocked. We must do all we can to
prevent both illegal and unintended access to guns by juveniles.

To address this issue, my Administration has consistently called for toughening our laws to help
reduce youth gun violence. Specifically, we have fought for and gained passage of: (1) the
Brady Act, to allow local law enforcement to conduct background checks before handguns are
sold; (2) the Assault Weapons Ban, to keep deadly assault weapons off the streets; (3) the
Gun-Free Schools Act, to establish a policy of "zero tolerance" for guns in our schools; and (4)
the Youth Handgun Safety Act, to prohibit, in most circumstances, the transfer to or possession
of a handgun by a juvenile.

More recently, we proposed comprehensive juvenile crime legislation that, among other things,
would continue to crack down on youth gun violence by increasing penalties for transferring a
firearm to juveniles, prohibiting violent juveniles from owning firearms as adults, and requiring
federal firearms licensees (FFLs) to provide a child safety lock with every gun sold. I hope
Congress will enact these important measures as soon as possible.

Until Congress acts, however, there is more we can do to keep guns out of the hands of our
nation's youth. Existing law already bans the transfer of handguns to minors and juvenile
possession of handguns, except in specified circumstances, and grants the Treasury Department
authority to prescribe rules and regulations to implement this provision. I direct you to take the
authorized steps necessary to do everything in your power to enforce the provisions of the Youth
Handgun Safety Act -- and specifically, to promptly publish in the Federal Register proposed
regulations requiring that FFLs post signs on their premises and issue written notification with
each handgun sold to non-licensees warning that:

       (1)     federal law prohibits, except in certain limited circumstances, anyone under the
               age of 18 from knowingly possessing a handgun, or any adult from transferring a
               handgun to such a minor;
·                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion

           (2)     violation of the prohibition of transferring a handgun to a minor is, under certain
                   circumstances, punishable by up to 10 years in prison;

           (3)     handguns are a leading contributor to juvenile violence and fatalities; and

           (4)     safely storing and locking handguns away from children can help ensure
                   compliance with federal law.

    I also direct you to provide me with a written status report within 60 days on how you will carry
    out this directive.

    Your implementation of this directive will help inform gun purchasers about their responsibility
    under federal law to keep handguns from our children. It will also ensure that gun purchasers
    are warned about the frequency with which handguns kill or injure our kids.
