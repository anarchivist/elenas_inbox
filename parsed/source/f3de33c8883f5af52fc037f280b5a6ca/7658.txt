FReport: Drunken driving deaths fall to lowest level in 1997
    WASHINGTON (AP)    Fatalities from drunken driving fell to their
lowest level in over 20 years in 1997, but 42,000 people still died
on America's roads last year.
    In an indication of value of wearing a seatbelt, 63 percent of
those who died in car crashes in 1997 were not belted at the time.
     "The number of traffic fatalities would drop by 35 percent or
more if people followed two simple rules: Wear your seat belt and
don't drink and drive, " said Dr. Ricardo Martinez, administrator
of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
    His agency released the annual report today. It is based on data
from accident reports completed in all 50 states and the District
of Columbia.
    While overall accident deaths were down slightly from 42,065 in
1996 to 42,000 in 1997, six states posted double-digit increases
last year: Montana (up 33 percent), Delaware (29 percent), North
Dakota (24 percent), Virginia (13 percent) and Maine and Utah (12
percent each) .
    Only South Dakota had double-digit decrease, with the number of
accident fatalities falling 14 percent.
    The statistics showed that there were 16,520 alcohol-related
traffic fatalities in 1997, the lowest level since NHTSA's record
keeping began in 1975. In percentage terms, 39.3 percent of the
fatalities were alcohol-related, the first time that figure had
fallen below 40 percent. In 1996, there were 17,126 alcohol-related
fatalities, 40.9 percent of the total deaths.
    The fatalities per 100 million vehicles miles traveled, another
index, remained steady at 1.7. NHTSA officials were delighted the
rate didn't increase, considering the increased amount of driving
that has been spurred by the nation's improved economy and lower
gas prices.
