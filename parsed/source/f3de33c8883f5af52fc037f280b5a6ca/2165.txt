         Subject:         IDEA--big day Wednesday

         fyi-- Diana may have updated you on this, but the product of the
         Lott-sponsored bipartisan negotiating process for the IDEA reauthorization
         will be marked up at the full committee level tomorrow morning in both the
         House and the Senate.   Assuming the mark-ups go smoothly, in the
         afternoon, Secretary Riley will have a press conference (tentatively 3 pm)
         to praise the legislation, with probable attendees including Sens Lott,
         Jeffords, Coats, and Harkin, and Reps Goodling, Riggs, Castle, L, Graham,
         Clay, Martinez, and Miller.   Sen. Kennedy might also participate--see
         below.  Floor action on the bill is expected next week, on Tuesday in the
         House and on Thursday in the Senate.   If all goes without a hitch, we
         could be looking at the potential for a bill signing as early as May 22 or
         23,

         The main question mark for tomorrow is Kennedy; late in the process he
         began pushing to give DOJ authority to investigate IDEA matters without
         having them referred from Education, as a means of toughening
         enforcement,   There has been lots of back and forth between Kennedy and
         Lott's staff; as of late today it wasn't clear whether Kennedy would
         pursue this tomorrow, and if he does (and fails) what it would mean for
         his support for the bill overall, which is getting praise as very balanced
         from both education and disability advocacy groups,   Meanwhile, Kennedy
         has irritated the Republicans, notably Riggs, for raising the DOJ issue so
         late.   Riggs has made noises about pushing harder on an issue of his own
         (having to do with services to students in adult prisons)  that had
         already been raised and addressed in the negotiating process, but ED
         thinks at this point he probably won't.

         On one of the biggest sticking point from the last Congress, cessation of
         services/discipline, my understanding is that the agreement that has been
         worked out would overrule the 4th Circuit decision and explicitly require
         states to provide services to special ed students who had been suspended
         or expelled from school.
