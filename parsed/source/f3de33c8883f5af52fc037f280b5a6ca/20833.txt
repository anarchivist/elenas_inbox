How did you all respond to this? didn't we do something re children--or
was it just the order directing issuance of data re children? do I need
to follow up here?

Subject:         proposed EO

There are requests for an EO on children--Indian children, Asian children,
other minority children.   Some of us have been talking and while we agree
that an initiative on children's health, education and other aspects of
their lives is timely, we would like to do just one document.   I would
assume that you agree with this.   My proposal is that we meet internally,
come to a decision, and then work with the outside groups to ensure that
the major needs are covered.   Do you want to convene such a meeting--we c
ould tell you who would need to be at the table from our side of the
perspective.  Let me know.
