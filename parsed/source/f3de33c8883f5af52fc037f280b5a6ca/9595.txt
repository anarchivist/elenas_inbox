Bruce/EK:

Per your request, here is some more info on the CJS approps:

Local Law Enforcement Block Grant -- I think the LLEBG is on OMB's list
because we're generally opposed to it, period, and the draft conference
report includes a permanent authorization.  I don't think this is worth
fighting; we've had to eat it every year anyway.  Moreover, the mayors and
chiefs support the LLEBG, and it actually includes some earmarks that we
like (i.e., $40 million for Boys and Girls clubs -- double last year's
funding) .

Brady -- This is a big problem.  First, the draft language prohibits the
FBI from charging a user fee for NICS and instead allocates $42 million
for its operation -- $20 million from DOJ's working capital fund, which
should be fine; and $22 million from general appropriations, which may be
fine but is costing somebody in the CJS bill.  Second, the draft language
requires the FBI to immediately destroy records of persons that have been
cleared through NICS -- and gives persons aggrieved under this provision
the right to sue. This will result in a delay of at least 6 months while
the FBI reprograms the NICS -- and should be unacceptable to us.

OMB is proposing a compromise that drops the prohibition on charging a
fee, deletes the $42 million appropriation and allows the FBI to keep
records for 6 months (actually, through 6/99).  I agree with them that we
should fight hard on this issue, and that this is a good counter offer.
Ultimately, depending on our leverage, we may need to give even more.   If
so, here are my ideas on a bottom line:

1. On the Fee ... Accept the $42 million appropriations, but allow OMB to
try and negotiate from where the $22 million in general appropriations
comes. Alternatively, we could agree to the $20 million earmark in the
working capital fund, but charge a reduced fee to make up for the rest.

    2. On Records ... Allow the FBI to initially keep records for up to 6
    months so that NICS can be operational and on-line December 1st of this
    year. After this period, the FBI would be required to destroy records
    Wlcnln 24 hours, as currently proposed by the CJS draft. NB: While the
    FBI believes complying with this will not be a problem, the sooner we
    destroy records ... the less ability we have to check for straw purchasers
    through NICS.  Thus, the longer we are able to keep records -- even days,
    weeks    the more useful NICS will be as an overall law enforcement tool.
    This, of course, is exactly what the gunners don't want.

    Some other quick observations from what I've seen ...

    Controlled Substances Act, State Ethics for u.S. Attorneys -- Both of
    these issues carried over into the proposed CJS draft and remain serious
    problems. DOJ has drafted language for OMB to try and water down them
    down.

    COPS -- Fully funded, of course, and with $180 million in earmarks --
    including $5 million for community prosecutors and $17.5 million for
    COPS/Schools partnerships.

    Indian Country Crime -- Funded at $189 million -- including $34 million
    for COPS, $5 million for courts, $10 million for at-risk youth, and some
    money for prisons.  Pretty good, I think.

    Drug Testing Initiative -- Although Drug Courts were fully funded ($40
    million), our $85 million drug testing initiative did not make it.  Since
    it was not included in either the House or Senate bill, I guess it is safe
    to assume it's dead.

    Prevention -- The $95 million at-risk youth initiative that is near and
    dear to the AG was included in the CJS draft bill, with $10 million
    earmarked for a Safe Schools Initiative.

    Juvenile Accountability Block Grant -- Same as   last year. Allows 40% of
    the $250 million to be used on prosecutors and   specialized courts. One
    change: up to $20 million of these funds could   be used by states for drug
    testing initiatives and/or defraying the costs   of processing appeals by
    inmates on death row.

    Hope this helps ... j c3
