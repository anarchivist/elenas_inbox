       Attached is the tobacco section in the budget.  Linda Ricci asked me to
       let you know that it is largely unchanged (if there are any changes) from
       the last version.

       Thanks,
       Dawn

       Stopping Youth Smoking:      The 1998 State Attorneys General Tobacco


    Settlement was a step in the right   direction, as the tobacco industry
    affirmed its responsibility to pay   for health care costs caused by
    tobacco.  But more must be done to   protect our children and preserve
    public health. The Administration    is pursuing a two-pronged approach:

            Raise the price of cigarettes, so fewer young people start to smoke.
    Public health experts agree that the single most effective way to cut
    youth smoking is to raise the price of cigarettes:  For every 10 cents
    additional per pack, estimates show that 270,000 fewer teenagers will
    begin smoking over the next five years --and more than 90,000 premature
    deaths will be avoided as a result.  Last year, the President called for
    an increase of $1.10 per pack (in constant dollars) to help cut youth
    smoking in half within five years.  This year, we can build on the
    increases already agreed to between the tobacco companies and the states
    and those already legislated by the Congress. As a result, we can work
    with the Congress and, with a single increase of only half this amount,
    reach the target this year.

    The funds that result from this policy will cover tobacco-related health
    care costs. Each year, the Federal government spends billions of dollars
    treating tobacco-related diseases --in our a.rmed forces, our veterans, and
    others.  It is fitting that the tobacco industry reimburse US taxpayers
    for these costs, just as it has already agreed to do for the states.

            Give the Food and Drug Administration full authority to keep cigarettes
    out of the hands of children. The Administration will again propose
    legislation that confirms the FDAO,s authority to regulate tobacco
    products:  to halt advertising targeted at children, and to make sure that
    cigarettes are not sold to them.

            Since US taxpayers paid a substantial portion of the Medicaid
    costs that were the basis for much of the state settlement with the
    tobacco companies, Federal law requires that the Federal government recoup
    its share. However, the Administration will again support legislation to
    waive direct Federal recoupment, if states agree to use a portion of funds
    from the settlement for programs currently financed by Federal taxpayers.

            Tobacco is linked to over 400,000 deaths a year from cancer,
    respiratory illness, heart disease, and other health problems. Each year,
    a million young people become regular smokers, 300,000 of whom will die
    earlier as a result.  The budget includes $61 million of additional funds
    for tobacco-related activities in the CDC and the FDA--$27 million of
    which will pay for expanding CDC's existing State-based tobacco prevention
    activities, and $34 million of which will support FDA's outreach and
    enforcement activities.
