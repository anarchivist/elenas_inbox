 TEXT:
 Kennedy just called for the federal government helping to hire half the
 techers that will need to be hired in the next decade--100,000 teachers
 per year, by providing loan forgiveness for those who agree to teach for 5
 years. I didn't hear him mention the cost, but he said it should be paid
 for with "the same tax changes the R's propose to use for vouchers".

 He also called for a new G.I. Bill of "rights that would guarantee every
 academically qualified student with $3,000 per year--balanced between Pell
 grants and HOPE tax credits--for 4 years.
 He estimated the cost at $10 Billion per year, and proposed to pay for it
 with 1/3 of the $30 billion in wasteful corporate tax breaks identified by
 the Progressive Policy Institute and DLC.

 He also just called for an after school program for every community in
 America, based on a program in Boston.

   Subject: Kennedy speech Thursday

       FYI, I just spoke with Danica who called to let me know that Kennedy
       is doing a speech at the press club tomorrow on a wide range of
       topics, but there will two education platforms in it:

       (1) On higher education, he is going to advocate adding to what we
      have done on Pell, HOPE and Lifelong Learning to, in effect, insure
      that all students (presumably up to an income limit, but Danica did
      not know what it would be) should receive government support
 totalling
      $3,000 to pursue their postsecondary educations.

       (2) On teachers, he is going to advocate using loan forgiveness to
 add
       100,000 teachers around the nation -- this is designed to mirror what
       happened with cops on the street. They do NOT see this as an
       alternative to our Title V in any way.


       Of course, Danica's request is that we be as positive as we can be in
       responding to any press calls we receive.
