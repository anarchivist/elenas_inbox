Yesterday we circulated for your review and comment a draft SAP on the

House

child custody/abortion bill.     The House Rules Committee will meet at 2

p.m.

today on HR 3682 and full House action is scheduled for tomorrow.     Please

let

me know by 2 p.m. today whether you will have any comments on the proposed

SAP.       Our plan is to have the SAP ready tonight for final White House

sign-off.     Thanks.
