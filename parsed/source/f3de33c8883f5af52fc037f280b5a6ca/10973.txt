        PRESIDENT CLINTON'S PLAN FOR TURNING AROUND LOW PERFORMING
                                  SCHOOLS

     In his State of the Union Address, President Clinton called on all states and school districts to
     identify and tum around their worst-perfonning schools -- or shut them down. In a visit to the
     JacksonIMann Elementary School in Boston, President Clinton announced a $200 million
     initiative in his FY 2000 budget that will require states and school districts to take corrective
     actions to improve low perfonning schools, and give them the resources to get the job done.

     $200 Million to Turn Around Low Performing Schools. The President's FY2000 budget
     includes a $200 million in new funds for the Title 1 program, to be set aside for intervening in
     low perfonning schools. The President's proposal will require states and school districts to
     identify the schools with the lowest achievement levels and the least improvement, and take
     corrective action to tum them around. These corrective actions, based on a careful assessment
     of each school's needs, would include steps such as intensive teacher training, support to
     improve school discipline, and the implementation of proven approaches to school refonn. If
     these actions do not result in improved student achievement within two years, the President's
     proposal would require states and school districts to take additional corrective actions, such as
     pennitting students to attend other public schools; reconstituting the school, by fairly evaluating
     the staff and making staff changes as appropriate; or closing the school and reopening it as a
     charter school or with an entirely new staff. The funds provided in the President's budget will
     be used to support these interventions.

     An approach that works. Experience demonstrates that when these interventions are
     carefully implemented, are accompanied by the resources to support change, and are part of a
     broader state and district strategy to raise academic standards, upgrade curriculum, strengthen
     teaching, keep school safe and disciplined and implement proven practices, schools improve.
     and student achievement increases. For example, in the Fall of 1995 Florida identified 45
     critically low perfonning schools in Dade County. The Miami-Dade School District responded
     with Operation Safety Net which requires schools to implement a school wide reading program,
     and provides them staff assistance, improved technology and other resources. These schools are
     given 3 years in which to make adequate progress or be subject to further action. After 3 years,
     Dade County removed each ofthe 45 schools from the state's list oflow-perfonning schools.
     New York City has created the Chancellor's district, to provide low-perfonning schools with
     special intervention to redesign the school, set instructional priorities, identify staff training
     needs and take other steps improve student perfonnance. In 1966, the Chancellor's District
     identified and took over 10 of the city's lowest perfonning schools, and by 1998 half had made
     enough improvement to be removed from the Chancellor's direct control. In one successful
     school, P.S.154 in Harlem, staff redesigned the school, chose a concentrated reading program,
     organized an education plan around it, and trained all teachers to implement the plan. In the first
     year, the number of third-grader students meeting state standards increased 20 percent, and
     student reading scores on a statewide assessment have improved significantly. In 1992,
     Houston identified 68 low perfonning schools, and as a result of the school district's intervention
     all of those schools have increased achievement and are no longer considered low perfonning.

Making Common Sense Common Practice -- Now. Holding every school accountable for
results, providing extra help to schools that need it, and closing down those that don't improve, is
a common sense approach to strengthening public education. President Clinton's proposal will
dramatically speed up the pace at which states and school districts begin to tum around low
performing schools. In March 1996, President Clinton challenged every state and school district
to take responsibility for intervening in low performing schools. According to a recent
Education Week study, nineteen states currently have policies and strategies in place to help
improve low-performing schools. More than half of these schools are in urban areas, and a
growing number ofurbart school systems, including New York City, San Francisco, Dade
County, Philadelphia and Chicago are taking similar steps, including the implementation of
comprehensive school improvement plans, after-school academic help to students, and intensive
teacher training. The Boston Public Schools have begun to implement an accountability plan
that requires every school to implement a school improvement plan, and that targets help and
intervention to the lowest performing schools. Under current Title 1 requirements, states and
school districts participating in Title.1 must begin to take corrective actions for low performing
schools by school year 2003-2004. The President's proposal will accelerate these efforts, and
will ensuring that every state and every school district with the lowest performing schools will
start immediately to tum those schools around.
