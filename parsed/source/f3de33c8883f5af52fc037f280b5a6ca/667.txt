I received the final estimate from GSA yesterday combining option A & B.
The cost for HVAC has gone down considerably making the total estimated
cost @ $12,000.  Just wanted to let you know in case this additional
information aids your decision making.  Please let me know as soon as
possible if we are moving forward with both offices so I can inform GSA.
They have begun to gather the materials and are waiting for the final word
on working this weekend.  If they build the walls on Saturday, they would
like to start moving the furniture and other equiment as soon as possible
on Friday afternoon which means I also need to inform the telephone and
computer people.  Thanks.
