TEXT:
The Mayor of Springfield has requested the President go to Springfield
this weekend after he delivers the Portland Sate Commencement Speech, and
the scheduling office is looking for our recommendation. The President
was concerned about this b/c he has not visited any other site of a school
shooting. However, the AG went to Jonesboro on his behalf and he did a
video b/c he was in Africa. On the other hand, we went to Kentucky
without mentioning or visiting the Paduka victims.

Do you prefer anyone of these options:
1. POTUS goes to school shooting.  If so, what is the format -- does he
meet privately w/ victims families, does he give speech to student body
and parents?
2. POTUS makes mention in his Portland State remarks -- he could call for
a moment of silence, or make harder hitting statement.
3., POTUS invites victims families to attend Portland State speech and has
private meeting with them. And he mentions it in his speech.

[I think option 2 is safest and it is fine if that is all he does.
Perhaps that way he can call for a moment of silence on behalf of the
victims of all scho01 shootings.]

The Attorney General went to Jonesboro on behalf of the President b/c he
was in Africa at the time of "the shooting. At that event they aired a
video from both the President and the First Lady. In terms of parady, it
seems like it would be appropriate for the President to visit the
Springfield school when he's in Oregon this weekend. Also, fyi, the Mayor


of Springfield requested a meeting wi the Attorney General the following
week which can help if we don't go.  I'll check wi Bruce and Jose for
their views on him going to Springfield.
