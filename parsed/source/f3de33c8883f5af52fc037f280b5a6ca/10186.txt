TEXT:
The NEC is planning on having a Principals' Meeting next Thursday or
Friday on possible farm safety net proposals such as increasing crop
insurance subsidies, covering more non-insured crops, risk management
accounts, land retirement, revenue insurance, and increasing educational
programs on commodity options. They will have some paper in the middle of
next week.
