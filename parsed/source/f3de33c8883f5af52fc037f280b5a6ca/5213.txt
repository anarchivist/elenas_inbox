 TEXT:
 Yesterday, I met with Lin Liu and several of her policy staff members.
 At that meeting, we briefly discussed the November 19th Board meeting. As
 of last night, the only change to the agenda was that the order of topics
 has been switched -- start with the "value of diversity" discussions
 (including a discussion of programs that are promoting diversity) and
 follow (in the afternoon) with statistics on continuing discrimination and
 civil rights enforcement.

 They are still finalizing their list of presenters, but are starting to
 contact some of them. Also, they are still altering how subjects will be
 presented (titles for panels, etc.). Scott Palmer (a policy staffer)    is
 e-mailing to Bill and me (with a cc: to you) the most recent draft
 agenda. According to Bill, there are some changes that the Education
 people want to suggest.  I am going to get with him this morning to
 determine exactly what their concerns are, etc. I will let you know.

 On a more general note, I have some more basic questions about the
 function of the Board and our relationship with them and the PIR. Now
 that I am getting more information from the PIR side, it would be great if
 we could sit down in the next couple of days to discuss what that
 relationship is (or should be) from our perspective. Thanks.

 Julie
