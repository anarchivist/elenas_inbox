 Subject: International Tobacco -- Draft Legislation

 I have received from the "bipartisan international tobacco issues working
 group" on the Hill copies of discussion drafts for several pieces of
 possible legislation:

 Prohibitions on official USG promotion of exports of "tobacco and tobacco
 products" (Doggett & Durbin) -- an "expanded" version of the Doggett
 Amendment to the FY98 State/Commerce/Justice Appropriations bill: normal
 business facilitation would be allowed (it is anticipated that the
 legislative history would incorporate State/Commerce Department Guidelines
 to Embassies), but any exceptions on the trade front (e.g., to cease
 discriminatory practices or remove barriers) would require certifications
 to Congress that there are no negative public health ramifications.

 Smuggling (Lautenburg & waxman) -- would generally treat tobacco like
 distilled spirits to ensure the integrity of the custody chain, control of
 sales, etc.; the prospective changes in the way that tobacco would have to
 be sold at the retail level are huge.

 Creation of an American Center for Global Health and Tobacco (Lugar &
 Harkin) -- an NGO to fund ($150 million per annum) major public
 information campaigns; does not provide monies for bilateral and
 multilateral science-based public health activities to control tobacco.

 I hope to receive additional drafts this week, including legislation
 relating to an international code of conduct (Doggett & Waxman) that, like
 the framework convention, would seek to promote cigarette labelling and
 advertising requirements at least as rigorous as those in· effect in the
 U.S.


 The report from the National Cancer Policy Board does indeed have .quite a
 substantial section on international issues.

I hope to collar an intern to put together a quick summary of these
various materials.
