regarding responses to the PRC decision.
DOJ will send an options paper out to the agencies prior to the
meeting.  The·objective at Friday's meeting will be to reach a
consensus on whether all reasonable options have been identified
in the paper, ellliminate any options that are considered
infeasible, and prioritize future discussions. Agency personnel
with particular expertise in the ESA consultation process should
try to attend.
