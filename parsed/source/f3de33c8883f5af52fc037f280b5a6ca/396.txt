TEXT:
FYI:   I got a voice mail from Elaine Ryan saying the following:
She hears that HHS is going to file a brief with the Supreme Court
against some state's position (not sure which state) on an issue
relating to a private right of action in a child support case.
 (And the brief will make some reference to the importance of
private right of action in welfare reform??)
She asked if this is true and if we can talk about it at
tomorrow's 1pm meeting with them.
I left her voice mail asking her to tell me the name of the case
and the state.
