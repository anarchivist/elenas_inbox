Commission Won't Seek Toxic Toy Ban

                            WASHINGTON (AP) -- Government safety regulators
are
                            asking toymakers to quit using a suspected
carcinogen as a
                             plastic-softening compound in baby rattlers and
teething toys,
                            but have decided against trying to ban all toys
made with the
                             substance.

                            The Washington Post quoted Consumer Product
Safety
                             Commission officials in today's editions as
saying studies show
                             that the amount of the chemical -- diisononyl
phthalate --
                             ingested by small children "does not even come
close to a
                            harmful level."

                            The agency was scheduled to announce its actions
today, along
                            with advice to parents to discard soft vinyl
toys that their
                             children chew or hold in their mouths for long
periods of times.

                             "Few children, if any, are at risk,"      Ronald
Medford, the
                            commission's assistant executive director for
hazard identification
                            and reduction,    told the Post.   "But given the
number of
                            uncertainties, we are       as a precaution --
asking the toy industry
                             to take certain steps to reformulate their
products intended to go
                             into children's mouths."

                            The newspaper said phthalates have been linked
in laboratory
                            studies to cancer in mice and rats. They also
are a suspected


                        source of liver and kidney damage in laboratory
animals.

                        The commission identified only one line of
pacifiers and nipples
                        -- Clear and Soft made by Gerber Products Co.
that parents
                        should immediately discard,    the Post said.

                        Some major retailers, including Kmart and Toys R
Us, have
                        already begun pulling plastic teething toys made
with pthalate
                        from their shelves.

                        "We've just been looking at the research and
reading up on it, ' ,
                        Kmart spokeswoman Michele Jasukaitis said in an
interview
                        with The Associated Press.    "We are going
forward in the
                        interest of our customer safety.' ,

                        Jasukaitis said Kmart would continue to monitor
other products
                        containing pthalate, including those that might
not be explicitly for
                        teething but could end up in the mouths of young
children
                        anyway.

                        Toys R Us, the world's largest retailer of
children's products,
                        promised last month to have the teething toys
off its shelf by
                        Nov.IS.

                        The commission said Sears, Roebuck and Co.,
Wal-Mart
                        Stores and Target Stores also have announced
plans to remove
                        phthalate teethers and rattlers from their
shelves.

                        Several toy manufacturers,    including MatteI
Inc., Walt Disney
                        Co. and Little Tikes Co., have said they plan to
phase out use of
                        the additive.

                        Environmental groups had asked the commission to
ban the
                        chemical ingredient and issue an advisory to
parents on its
                        dangers.

                        At least seven European governments have banned
the use of
                        phthalates in certain toys that commonly are put
in children's


                      mouths.
