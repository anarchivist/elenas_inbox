      Subject: CRA MEMORANDUM

      You need to be aware that Maria Echaveste and Chuck Ruff have established
      a task.force on civil rights issues (Civil Rights Coordinating Council).
      It is their attempt to exert a greater influence on what they view as race
      issues.  They included CRA and access to capital and credit on that list.
      I advised them of the following:

      1.  The DPC and NEC will continue, as they have for the last six years, to
      coordinate CRA and access to credit and capital policy in the
      Administration (along with Treasury), and that while their interest was
      welcome, we would not be setting up a separate and new process.  They
      concurred, but want to be apprised of what is going on and want regular
      reports. That of course is completely understandable.

      2.  I also told them, that it was uneccessary, and in fact not helpful, to
      discuss with Justice and HUD enforcement issues without taking into
      account its impact on Financial Modernization.  They understand and all
      this will be handled through the current process on financial
      modernization.

      3.  I advised them that we are doing a memorandum for POTUS and VPOTUS on
      the CRA issue and that we were targeting the end of next week.  I advised
      them that Treasury would do the first draft.

      4.   They also raised several issues regarding the Fed and Reg B. I told
      thcm Treasury was the appropriate and ONLY entity discussing any issues
      Ullder Fed jurisdiction.

      AIl this however, underscores the need to have a thoughtful and direct


    options memo to POTUS on CRA so that we can nip in the bud any other
    desires to tie the race and civil rights agenda to CRA and financial
    mo"ernization. As you know, any connection would be devastating to both.

    So no reason to panic.   Call me if you want to discuss further.
