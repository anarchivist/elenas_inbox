TEXT:
House Floor action is expected tomorrow morning around lOam (Thurs. 9/17)
on the Foreign Operations Appropriations bill. We still need to come to
closure on the veto language at the beginning of the SAP (3 options
numbered).  The rest of the letter is identical to the conferees letter
that was released last week except for the International Family Planning
language (Mexico City) and the KEDO language has been made stronger.
Please provide your comments by 9:30am tomorrow (sorry for the short
notice). Thanks.

(House Floor)

H.R. 4569 -- FOREIGN OPERATIONS, EXPORT FINANCING,
         AND RELATED PROGRAMS APPROPRIATIONS BILL, FY 1999
(Sponsor: Callahan (R), Alabama;)


        This Statement of Administration Policy provides the
AdministrationO,s views on H.R. 4569, the Foreign Operations, Export
Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Bill, FY 1999, as reported
by the House Appropriations Committee. Your consideration of the
AdministrationO,s views would be appreciated

1)       [The Administration appreciates efforts by the Committee to accommodate
certain of the PresidentO,s priorities within the 302(b) allocation. The
bill, however, is unacceptable to the Administration for a number of
reasons.    First, the major portion of the request for the International
Monetary Fund is not approved, putting needlessly at risk U.S. and global
prosperity. Second, the allocation is simply insufficient to make
necessary investments in a number of key programs, including a complete
lack of funding for the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization
(KEDO). Third, there are a number of objectionable provisions in the
bill, such as the restrictions on international voluntary family planning
programs (the O&Mexico City08 restrictions) and the limitation on the
PresidentO,s authority to transfer funds for KEDO.    For these reasons,
the President would veto the bill if it were presented to him in its
current form.)

 2}       [The Administration appreciates efforts by the Committee to
.accommodate certain of the PresidentO,s priorities within the 302(b}
 allocation. The bill, however, is unacceptable to the Administration for
 the reasons described in this letter. Therefore, the President would veto
 the bill if it were presented to him in its current form.)

3a}      [The Administration appreciates efforts by the Committee to
accommodate certain of the PresidentO,s priorities within the 302(b}
allocation. The bill, however, is unacceptable to the Administration for
a number of reasons.   First, the major portion of the request for the
International Monetary Fund is not approved, putting needlessly at risk US
and global prosperity.   Second, the allocation is simply insufficient to
make the necessary investments in a number of key programs, including a
complete lack of funding for the Korean Peninsula Energy Development
Organization (KEDO). Third, there are number of objectionable provisions
in the bill, such as the limitation on the PresidentO,s authority to
transfer funds for KEDO.   For these reasons, if the bill were presented to
the President in its current form, the PresidentO,s senior advisors would
recommend that he veto the bill.



3b)     The Administration strongly opposes the inclusion by the
Committee of the D&Mexico CityD8 restrictions on international voluntary
family planning programs in this bill. As stated in past communications
on this issue, should this language be included in the final bill
presented to the President, the President would veto the bill.]

        This legislation is a.critical element of America's national
security budget. At the dawn of a new century, America faces unique
challenges and unprecedented opportunities to strengthen our national
security, enhance our global leadership, extend the reach of our
democratic values, and deepen our own prosperity. The challenges we face
are formidable.  If this bill in its current form were to become law,
however, it would erode our ability to promote effectively critical
American interests at home and abroad.  It would require us to walk away
from problems that can and must be solved. The responsibility for
safeguarding our national security and exercising u.s. leadership must be
foremost when allocating scarce fiscal resources.  We urge the Congress to
provide the leadership needed to keep America safe, strong, and prosperous.

        The only way to achieve the appropriate investment level for the
programs funded through this bill is to offset discretionary spending by
using savings in other areas.  The PresidentD,s FY 1999 Budget proposes
levels of discretionary spending for FY 1999 that conform to the
Bipartisan Budget Agreement by making savings through user fees and
certain mandatory programs to help finance this spending.   In the
Transportation Equity Act, Congress -- on a broad, bipartisan basis
took similar action in approving funding for surface transportation
programs paid for with mandatory offsets.   In addition, this year, as in
the past, such mandatory offsets have been approved by the House and
Senate in other appropriations bills. We want to work with the Congress
on mutually-agreeable mandatory and other offsets that could be used to
increase funding for high-priority discretionary programs, including those
funded by this bill.

International Monetary Fund

        While the Administration welcomes the CommitteeD,s efforts to
provide funding for the International Monetary FundD,s (IMFD,s) New
Arrangements to Borrow (NAB), we are extremely concerned by the
CommitteeD,s failure to include in its bill the requested appropriation
for the $14.5 billion u.S. share of the IMFD,s critically needed quota
increase.  Since February of this year, the President has repeatedly
called on Congress to approve the full amount of his $18 billion budget
request for the IMF.  To reject or delay this funding not only would
undermine AmericaD,s leadership in the world; it also would expose
American workers, savers, farmers, and businesses to unacceptable economic
risks.

        The IMFD,s financial resources are nearing historic lows,
necessitating the recent activation of the IMFD,s emergency credit lines,
the General Arrangements to Borrow (GAB), for the first time in twenty
years. Without the entire $18 billion in new funding, composed of the
quota increase and the u.S. share of the New Arrangements to Borrow (NAB),
the IMP -- and hence the United States and the world -- will remain
vulnerable if new, escalating, or spreading systemic crises occur. To
protect AmericaD,s economic strength, Congress must act now to pass the
full quota.
        The CommitteeD,s bill proposes several conditions on IMF funding
that, while directed at objectives we share, are unworkable in their


current form and, therefore, would have the effect of delaying
indefinitely the availability of these critical resources to the IMF. We
urge the Congress to respond to these concerns as the bill moves through
the process.

International Family Planning

          The Administration strongly opposes the D&Mexico City~8 restrictions
that are included in the Committee bill, which would prohibit foreign
non-governmental organizations from receiving u.s. family planning funds
if the organization uses any of its own funding from non-U.S. Government
sources for abortion-related services or advocacy.  The Committee billD,s
D&Mexico CityD8 language is even more restrictive than the provision
contained in the conference report on the Foreign Affairs Reform and
Restructuring Act. The Administration continues to oppose these
restrictions, which would deny funding to the most experienced and
qualified family planning and maternal-child health care providers.

Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization (KEDO)

        The Administration strongly objects to the Committee action
deleting U.S. funds for KEDO and including language prohibiting the
President from exercising his authority to transfer funds from other
sources for this purpose. The Agreed Framework reached between the United
States and the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea in 1994 remains the
key tool with which we are able to engage with North Korea on a range of
bilateral and multilateral issues, including missile tests.  The
CommitteeD,s actions would allow North Korea to blame the United States
for not fulfilling our commitment to the Agreed Framework and, in essence,
give the North an D&outD8 to begin reprocessing fissile material currently
monitored under international safeguards.  Such an action would seriously
destabilize security on the Korean peninsula, place U.S. troops in greater
danger, and exacerbate the Korean financial crisis.

New Independent States

          As recent events have indicated, the incomplete, peaceful transition of
the New Independent States (NIS) to stable, market democracies is vital to
the U.S. national security. The Congress has shared this view and
provided considerable support for this program in the past. The current
political/economic situation in Russia highlights how great the stakes are
for the united States to continue to help Russia achieve this peaceful
transition. The enormous economic potential of the Caspian Basin
represents great opportunities to advance our mutual goals. Therefore,
the cuts embodied in the Committee's funding level for USAID assistance
programs to the NIS are especially unfortunate. These cuts would make it
extremely difficult to push for market reforms and support democratic
forces across the region.   The Administration welcomes and strongly
supports the CommitteeD;s action to repeal restrictions on U.S.
assistance to Azerbaijan and would strongly oppose any efforts to overturn
the CommitteeD,s action. These restrictions have been a disincentive for
securing peace in the Caucasus and do not serve U.S. national interests.

Middle East Assistance

        The Administration welcomes the efforts of the Committee to work
with us in encouraging changes in traditional levels of assistance to
countries in the Middle East. We believe that Israel's initiative to
reduce Economic Support Fund (ESF) assistance provides an important basis
on which to build future assistance programs that meet our needs in the


Middle East and beyond. However, due to the very constrained funding
levels for international affairs programs, the Administration has proposed
an accelerated approach to the reduction of Israel's ESF. We would
encourage the Committee to give strong consideration to such an approach
as the bill proceeds through the process.

Economic Support Fund

         The Administration is concerned with the overall funding level for
the Economic Support Fund (ESF) account. At the Committee mark, the
account would not nearly have sufficient resources to continue supporting
economic and political stability in Latin America, and in other emerging
democracies in Africa and Asia. We strongly encourage the Committee to
support a higher funding level for the ESF account as the bill moves
forward.   In addition, the restrictions on assistance to Haiti need to be
balanced with a national interest waiver to ensure that the President has
sufficient flexibility to pursue our national interests.

Global Environment Facility

         The Administration is concerned with tne refusal of the Committee
to fund the PresidentO,s request for the Global Environment Facility
(GEF) , which is helping to reduce long-term environmental risks that will
affect all Americans. The $300 million request for GEF (of which $192.5
million is arrears) is needed to assure that the GEF does not run out of
resources in FY 1999. Concerns that funding the GEF would prejudge debate
on the Kyoto Climate Protocol are misplaced:   the new replenishment
agreement is funded at the same level as the prior one, and the GEF will
continue with precisely the same broad work program that it had prior to
Kyoto.   The GEF is among the best vehicles that the United States has to
encourage developing countries to shoulder greater responsibility for
protecting both the local and global environment.   It is manifestly in our
interests to clear our arrears and keep the GEF running, and the
Administration strongly urges the Committee to restore funding for this
critical program.

Nonproliferation, Anti-terrorism, Demining, and Related Programs (NADR)

        The Administration is concerned with the $64 million, or 30 percent, cut
to the $216 million request for NADR. This reduction would undermine the
multi-prong effort that NADR supports to reduce the proliferation threat
to U.S. national and global security. Lack of funding for the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) Preparatory Commission would harm
U.S. national security interests as it would eliminate planned
improvements in our ability to monitor nuclear testing worldwide. The
recent Indian and Pakistani tests are a stark reminder of the importance
of this monitoring. As well, we would be forced to reduce support for NIS
science centers, demining efforts, and other related activities.

Peacekeeping Operations

        The Committee has reduced the $83 million request for Peacekeeping
Operations (PKO) by 25 percent.  PKO provides vital assistance and support
for many important national security and foreign policy activities,
including commitments in Bosnia and Haiti, conflicts in Africa, and
potential trouble spots such as in the Balkans. This reduction would
severely limit the PresidentD,s ability to respond to these and other
evolving events.

Trade and Investment Financing



        The Administration appreciates the Committeeu,s effort to increase
substantially the funding for the Export-Import Bank and to support the
Overseas Private Investment Corporation and the Trade and Development
Agency (TDA).  However, Export-Import Bank funding still falls short of
the level needed to meet the expected demand of U.S. exporters in FY
1999.  Support for TDA, at 17 percent below the PresidentD,s request, is
insufficient to allow the agency to remain engaged around the world,
especially given its growing program in the Caspian region.

U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)

        The Administration is concerned with the $24 million cut in the
request for USAID Operating Expenses. This reduction would not only make
it impossible for USAID to carry out Presidential initiatives in Africa
and Latin America, but also would interfere with the agencyO,s ability to
manage its ongoing programs effectively, including congressional
priorities in areas such as infectious diseases and child survival, as
well as to address management priorities.  In particular, this reduction,
combined with the House action striking the emergency fund in the Treasury
and General Government Appropriation bill, would make it difficult for
USAID to implement fully its Year 2000 conversion.   Even if USAID were to
begin closing missions and eliminating additional positions immediately,
the fixed costs of doing so would prevent AID from achieving the savings
necessary in FY 1999 to respond to this cut.  For these reasons, we urge
the Committee to restore funding for USAID Operating Expenses.

        In light of the continuing needs created by both natural disasters
and ongoing civil conflicts, we urge the Committee to provide a higher
level of funding for international disaster assistance. The Committee
mark would cripple our efforts to respond expeditiously and effectively to
countries in transition from crisis caused by political and ethnic
conflict and could undercut our ability to address man-made and natural
disasters.

         The Administration is concerned that the Committee has not funded
the modest $6 million request for credit subsidy for the Urban Environment
(UE) credit program, or provided transfer authority for USAIDD,s
Development Credit Authority (DCA).   As the Congress and the
Administration agreed in the FY 1998 appropriations legislation, USAID has
taken substantial steps towards developing the capacity to manage both its
existing and future credit portfolios. We urge the Committee to restore
the transfer authority for the DCA and the subsidy request for the UE
program.   Failure to do so would limit the ability of USAID to use credit
to promote development in urban areas and to encourage the development of
needed private sector financial mechanisms.

        The prohibition on the use of funds from the Child Survival and
Disease Programs Fund for non-project assistance, which is specifically
authorized in the Foreign Assistance Act, would weaken USAIDO,s current
leadership position with bilateral and multilateral donors to encourage
and support policy reforms in sub-Saharan African countries.

Exchange Stabilization Fund

        The Committee bill contains a provision that would limit the
PresidentD,s flexibility to utilize the Exchange Stabilization Fund as
necessary to protect AmericaD,s economic and security interests.  For this
reason, and because the Exchange Stabilization Fund is not germane to the
purposes of this appropriations bill, the Administration opposes this


provision.

Treasury International Affairs Technical Assistance Program

        The Administration is disappointed that the Committee has not
funded the $5 million request for this program, which could significantly
enhance the transition to stronger private sector-led growth and more
efficient, transparent, and better supervised financial institutions in
emerging economies, including reforming countries in Africa and financial
crisis countries in Asia . . Given the large potential benefits and modest
cost of this program, which provides technical assistance in tax policy,
development of domestic capital markets, and privatization of state
enterprises, we urge the Committee to fund the request.

International Organizations and Programs (IO&P)

        The Committee bill reduces the request for IO&P by $55 million and,
unfortunately, eliminates funding for the U.N. Population Fund (UNFPA),
which provides support for women in family planning matters in a number of
countries not served by U.S. assistance programs.  UNFPA does not fund
abortions.  The overall reduction in IO&P would limit U.S. ability to
participate and support a number of international organizations.

Peace Corps

        The Administration regrets that the bipartisan Peace Corps
initiative to fund 10,000 volunteers by the year 2000 has not received the
full request of $270 million from the Committee.  However, we are
heartened by report language stating that the Committee is prepared to
approve a further increase should there be a reallocation of funds later
in the appropriations process.

Community Adjustment and Investment Program (CAIP)

        The Administration is concerned with the Committee's failure to
fund the Community Adjustment and Investment Program, a program initially
funded through the North American Development Bank, a multilateral
development bank. The CAIP was established to help communities affected
by adverse trade patterns associated with implementation of the North
American Free Trade Agreement. To date, the program has assisted in more
than 120 loans in 20 states, leveraging private sector financing of over
$70 million. The $37 million requested would significantly bolster the
CAIPD,s ability to continue this work, as well as to support technical
assistance, grants, and micro-lending. The Administration urges the
Committee to restore funding for this innovative program.

Year 2000 Conversion

         In the FY 1999 Budget, the President requested more than $1 billion for
Year 2000 (Y2K) computer conversion, including specific amounts in the
requests for the agencies funded in this bill.  In 'addition, the budget
anticipated that additional requirements would emerge over the course of
the year and included an allowance for emergencies and other unanticipated
needs.  On September 2nd, the President transmitted to the Congress a
request for $3.25 billion in FY 1998 contingent emergency funding for Y2K
computer conversion activities. This supplemental request would create a
funding mechanism that is consistent with both the needs anticipated in
the President's budget and the Senate's action creating a $3.25 billion
contingent emergency reserve to provide the resources and the flexibility
necessary to respond to critical unanticipated Y2K-related requirements.


It is essential that this contingent emergency funding be enacted as
quickly as possible, whether through the Treasury/General Government bill
or another legislative measure moving through the process earlier,
particularly in light of the decision of several Subcommittees, including
the Subcommittee on Foreign Operations, not to fully fund the base
requests of a number of agencies for Y2K conversion. We urge Congress to
leave as much as possible of the reserve unallocated so that funds are
available to address emerging needs.
