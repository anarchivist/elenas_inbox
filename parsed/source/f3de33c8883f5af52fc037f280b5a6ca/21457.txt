TEXT:
For those of you who may   be working on Treasury-Postal and/or omnibus
appropriations, I wanted   to provide the following update about the
"Improving Federal Child   Care Act," in the hopes that, in the last days of
negotiations, we may get   this important bill passed.

The bill, sponsored by Jeffords in the Senate and Morella/Gilman in the
House, improves federally-sponsored child care through a number of
measures, including allowing agencies to provide child care subsidies to
low-income federal workers and giving the General Services Administration
greater oversight of federal child care facilities, specifically directing
GSA to develop health and standards and holding federal facilities
accountable to these standards or to state standards, which ever is more
rigorous.

In the Senate, the full bill was attached by voice vote to
Treasury-Postal.  We understand, however, that in conference this bill may
be stripped of its authorizing amendments, including this piece.  In the
House, the full bill was voted unanimously out of committee and headed for
suspension calandar consideration, but was side-tracked by last minute
objections by Reps. Hoekstra and Thomas, and Ron Haskins of the House Ways
and Means Committee, who argued that the bill would be a slippery slope to
national standards.   Because of these objections, the House on Monday
passed on suspension only the subsidy piece, which is Morella's bill, and
did not consider the quality piece, which was Gilman's bill.  GSA, HHS,
and CDF have been working hard to convince these members of the importance
of improving the quality of federal child care and holding the centers to
some reasonable standards of health and safety.

As final negotiations proceed, there is likely to be a renewed attempt by
Jeffords and others to attach this bill to an omnibus appropriations
package, and, if possible, we should weigh in to support that effort.   We
should, however, support pas age of the entire bill, not just the subsidy
piece.
