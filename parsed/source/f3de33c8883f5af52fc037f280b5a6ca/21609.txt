TEXT:
I thought I'd pull together a Treasury-OMB-HHS group early next week to
flesh out our options, and starting the scoring of different price
increase options, including lookback.   I don't think you need to come to
this meeting, but I'd like to hear your current views before the meeting
and then I'll try back to you more food for thought.
