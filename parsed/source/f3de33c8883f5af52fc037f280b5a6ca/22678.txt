TEXT:
I talked to Melanne and she said she is going to try to talk to the First ~OO' ~J
Lady in the next few hours I               P6/(b)(6)            I and if we    ()4.
do get an answer, it is not~kelY to be before bpm.    However, Melanne d1d
want to convey her own view which is that she supports either option 2 or
3.  If option 2 is not possible or not really workable, then she believes
we should not file.
