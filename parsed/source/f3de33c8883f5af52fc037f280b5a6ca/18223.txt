TEXT:
Nothing has really happened this week while we focused on the
budget--except for our "breakthrough" on the Women's Leadership Academy
earlier today.

I suspect you will want to massage this a good bit; I found it diffucult
to find precisely the right words to explain our strategy.

Single Sex School in New York City: After meeting with DPC and WHC staff,
Secretary Riley has agreed to approach Chancellor Rudy Crew in an effort
to explore ways they might work together to support the continuing
operation of the WomenD,s Leadership Academy in NYC, in the context of
civil rights and Constitutional requirements.   Riley has placed a call to
Crew and expects to speak with him by the beginning of the new year.   Our
strategy is to engage NYC officials at the policy level rather than in an
investigative and .complaint context, to explore the issues around single
sex schools and look for ways in which we can together achieve our mutual
goal of enabling the WomenD,s Leadership Academy to continue to operate.
