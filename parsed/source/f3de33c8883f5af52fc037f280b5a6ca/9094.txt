TEXT:
This is the spoof radio address I mentioned to you on the telephone a
minute ago. We sent it to the road as a joke when the President was in
Chile. You may recall that someone realized rather late in the day that
our Chilean hosts might take umbrage were the President to deliver a radio
address decrying the food safety standards in countries like ... Chile.
So the topic changed at the last minute to natural disasters.  This was my
response, inspired by a Freedman wisecrack.

Just to brighten your day.
