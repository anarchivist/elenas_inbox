TEXT:
Keith Fonteneau and I will revise the Secretary's letter to the Hill so
that it reflects today's our proposal on work, child support, and data.
We will run it by you.

How is this for a sentence on work:

We look forward to discussing with you in the weeks ahead our proposal to
ensure that the welfare lawD,s tough work requirements apply to
participants in both TANF and state maintenance of effort programs.
