TEXT:
I will be at my home in California and, after the long weekend, do plan to
do some work from there since my husband has to be at the office anyway
and I have a lot going on.  Therefore I may join important meetings by
conference call -- even if it's from my backyard! -- and will certainly
respond to phone and email messages.  Your best bet for immediate
assistance will be to call upon Diana, however -- she will be here all
week.  But you can reach me by:

        1) Office voice mail at 456-2846 -- I will retrieve my messages
from afar.
        2) Email -- I will have Erica (our intern) forward my emails to me
in California.   (My email address there is "I         P6/~(6)       I' .
Diana -- I added this address to your personal address book -- just choose
                                                                                         Coo\]
"Rice, Cynthia in California" to send me an email.)
        3) You- ca;:;call me atI  P6/(b)(6) I --
                                               however if I'm on email,
you'll get a busy signal .·

I'll be here all day Friday.   I leave Saturday afternoon. and return -Sunday
evening, June 1st.
