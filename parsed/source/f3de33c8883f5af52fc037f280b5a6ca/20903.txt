TEXT:
OMB proposed to add a description of the amendment (which I think is fine)
and made some edits to our proposals.  I plan to send them these changes
to restore it to the statement we suggested -- unless you tell me
otherwise.


The Senate bill contains a provision amending the Temporary Assistance for
Needy Families program (TANF).  It would expand the type and length of
education programs that can be counted toward a State's "work activity"
participation rate.  The provision would also extend the FY98 and FY99
exclusion of teen parents from the cap on education programs that can be
counted toward a State's "work activity" participation rate to FY2000 and
beyond. The Administration strongly supports the TANF goal of enabling
more welfare recipients to move from welfare to work. We look forward to
working with conferees to ensure that the final legislation recognizes the
role of education in meeting this goal keeps the doors of college open to
all Americans while still maintaining the welfare law's strong work focus
[was "requirements" but I think "focus" is ok).
