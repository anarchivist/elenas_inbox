TEXT:
Mary Bourdette accepted our changes, Elena, so that the key part of the
proposed report language now reads "we strongly urge the Secretary of
Health and Human Services, in exercising her discretion to assess
penalties against States that fail to meet the requirements of PRWORA, to
take into account State efforts to protect and provide services and
otherwise assist victims of domestic violence. We recommend that the
Secretary utilize the regulatory process to advise States of these penalty
considerations. "  ["protect" .added by Ann Rosewater]

Barbara Chow, Jack Lew, and OMB leg affairs all signed off on the idea of
responding to Harkin's request to suggest report language.  Barry White's
folks looked at the actual language.
So, Mary is calling Marsha Simon of Harkin's staff shortly.
