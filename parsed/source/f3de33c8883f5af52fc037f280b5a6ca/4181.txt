TEXT:
to Bruce about COPS Report and radio address currently scheduled to be
taped Friday afternoon. Copy of COPS report is sitting in Laura's box on
her desk.  I've been in touch with the COPS Office and hopefully we'll get
an improved version together by Sunday night.

Thanks.

CRIME

Crime Bill Anniversary -- Next Saturday will mark the third anniversary of
the Crime Act.  In next week's radio address to commemorate the Crime Act,
we plan to release a community po-licing report prepared by the COPS Office
and the last round of COPS universal hiring grants for the fiscal year--
bringing the total number of' community police officers funded through the
COPS program to over 65,000.    The report highlights the achievements of
your signature community policing program as well as making the case that
community policing is making a difference is fighting crime. (NOTE FOR
BRUCE: Rahm is pretty unhappy with the latest draft that we got today.
He's threatened to pull the radio address if it's not improved by Monday.
I'm planning on rewriting parts of it this weekend-- I wasn't sure if you
still wanted to include the bullet in the weekly with this caveat.)
