Karen and Minyon are doing a request.         do others want to sign on or be

Subject:         NEA Reception

The National Education Association's Board of Directors and State
Affiliate Presidents will be meeting in DC April 30 - May 2. They have
written to POTUS requesting a White House Reception for 250 people on
Friday, April 30 or Saturday, May 1.

How do people feel about this request?        Do we want to submit a scheduling
proposal for a POTUS reception?
