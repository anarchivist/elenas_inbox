TEXT:
Esteemed Colleagues:

Attached please find what I take to be the final version of the sex
offender/technology letter to the govs.  I don't think it differs much
from what was sent around last week -- minor justice edits only -- but
some of the circumstances surrounding the letter/directive have changed
significantly.

1. The House Judiciary Committee marked up and passed important
amendments to the Jacob Weterling Act that will help States and the
Administration in implementing the sex offender registry.  These
amendments, which go beyond the scope of our intended directive, are
likely to be tacked on to an appropriations bill, and Justice does not
want to jeopardize their passage by issuing an overlapping/competing
directive now that the legislation has moved forward.

2. The letter to the govs focuses not only on the registry, but on other
important technology pieces. While Rahm was most concerned with the sex
offender language, we've also included other language that's important to
a long-term Brady fix, child care background checks and other information
sharing. As a result of the positive response we've gotten from the AG's
letter to the govs -- and because of the increasing importance of these
other related issues -- Justice wanted to make sure they we're also part
of the letter.

Thus, unless anyone has any concerns, I suggest we work to clear and send
the President's letter this week, and that we hold on the directive until
we see what happens with the Wetterling amendments bill. Ultimately, we
may lose the opportunity to do the directive, but the legislation moving
forward on the Hill will help us even more.

I have made the changes proposed by Justice.  As we discussed the sex
offender directive language was deleted.  Also, the number of states
participating in the sex offender registry is now 11 and the letter now
says the Compact will be transmitted to congress the same day as the
letter is sent.  Forward this draft as appropriate.

DRAFT

Dear Governor - - - - - , -

       The continuing explosion of new technologies gives us a groundbreaking
opportunity to work together to link our federal and state law enforcement efforts
in ways we never thought possible even a few years ago. For example, we are
now able to track the whereabouts of convicted sex offenders to prevent them
from committing new crimes. If we continue to coordinate our efforts, I am
convinced that American public safety will benefit significantly.

        From the historic 1994 Crime Act through the National Crime Prevention
and Privacy Compact that I will soon submit to Congress, my Administration has
strived to pass legislation to harness computers and other technology for the
public good. Many of our states' governors have played crucial roles in fighting
to pass this legislation, and I thank you again for that assistance. Although these
laws are an important foundation for federal and state cooperation, the new
technologies can do only what we commit them to do, and we still need to do
much more -- including exchanging criminal records between states for
employment checks on workers in occupations that deal with children, and using
incident-based crime reports to help police solve specific types of repeated crime,
such as church arson or ~erial murder. Federal and state governments must forge
a close partnership to realize the full potential of these new technologies. I am
prepared to take actions to intensifY our federal efforts in the coming months, but I
will need your help in order to ensure our success in several initiatives.

        In June of 1996, I directed the Attorney General to develop a national
sexual predator and child molester registration system to link the sex offender
registration and notification systems being developed in all 50 states. The
Interim national sex-offender registry became operational earlier this year, and the
Attorney General recently wrote to enlist your assistance. I am encouraged that
eleven states have already loaded their information on sex offenders onto the
system, with many of you pledging to do so within the next few months. I am
grateful for any help you can provide in making this national sex offender
registration system a reality.

        I am today submitting to the Congress the National Crime Prevention and
Privacy Compact to facilitate the exchange of criminal records using an FBI index
of state-maintained criminal information that states can access nationwide. The
Compact would standardize policies for sharing of criminal records for purposes
such as pre-employment background checks for child care workers and school bus
drivers. It would improve access to criminal records and save the states and the
federal government money by avoiding duplication of effort. I hope I can count
on your support ofthe Compact as it moves through your State legislature.
                                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion
         Many Federal laws --including the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention .
Act, the Violence Against Women Act, and the Child Protection Act --contain
provisions to help states automate and improve their criminal records, especially
to block handgun sales to prohibited gun purchasers and allow for easy
identification of criminal offenders subject to "three strikes" laws. The
Department of Justice's Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) stands ready to help
states reach this goal through the National Criminal History Improvement
Program. BJS has already awarded more than $150 million to states, with a total
of $226 million authorized. I urge your State to take full advantage of this
program.

        As you know, the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting Program gives us data
that help us measure our progress in reducing crime. The next generation ofUCR,
the National Incident-Based Reporting System, will usher in a new era of crime
data -- so that we can tell for example, that a crime was a hate crime, an incident
of domestic abuse, or a crime directed at a child. Such information will help law
enforcement agencies identify local and national trends, and lead to quicker arrests
of violent offenders. The Justice Department is working with states, counties,
and cities to expand the NIBRS. I hope that you will lend your support to this
effort.

         With your State's active participation, we can make significant progress in
all of these initiatives .. Your personal involvement is key in making this happen.
I look forward to working with you to achieve our mutual goal -- using new
technologies to make America safer for all our citizens.

Sincerely,

                                      #####
