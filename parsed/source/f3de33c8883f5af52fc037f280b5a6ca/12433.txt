Subject:          Announcement on Kosovar Refugee Processing

State will be announcing today at the noon briefing and with press release
that we will be processing Kosovar refugees in Macedonia, not Fort Dix.
Site is between two Stankovic camps just north of Skopje.  State will also
announce that processing will begin early next week, with the first group
of refugees arriving by the end of the week. Refugees will travel
directly to their ultimate destination.  State (Taft) will do a backrgound
briefing with all the details at 3:30 this p.m.

I will be contacting State and Local officials in NJ this a.m. to let them
know of decision.  NSC/Leg and State/H will be taking care of NJ Congo
delegation.

I will get guidance to Joe as well.

Let me know if you have Qs or if I'm missing something.
