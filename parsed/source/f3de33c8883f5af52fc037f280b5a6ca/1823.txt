Background

      The SEC is releasing to the public on Wednesday a report to the President and Congress
on how last year's securities litigation legislation has played out.

        The report was written at the President's request. He asked for it last year after the
legislation went into effect over his veto. It examines questions like whether the number of
federal court suits has gone down and what effect there has been on state court litigation.

       The report's major conclusions are summarized in the attached two pages from the report.
 (/ would append pages 4 and 5.)

Possible Questions and Answers

Q.     So does this mean that the President was wrong to veto the bill?

A.     No, it doesn't mean that. The President's veto was based on his concerns about whether
       the legislation would unfairly raise the bar for injured plaintiffs to get into court. We want
       to study the report to see what the SEC learned about how the pleading standards in the
       bill are operating in practice. The concern is still there; we want to see how it has played
       out.

Q.     During the campaign, the President told some Silicon Valley CEOs that he thought that
       California's Proposition 211 should be preempted if enacted. Some of the CEOs thought
       that he was gung-ho about this and wanted to do it right away, even if Prop 211 didn't
       pass. Where does he stand now, and what influence will this report have on his
       thinking?

A.     When he was in California, the President was speaking against the backdrop of Prop 211,
       which subsequently was roundly defeated. The SEC tried to answer the question of
       whether the Act had played out in a way that required further legislative action at this
       time. They concluded that this is not the case. If that case is to be made on the basis of
       other data, we certainly would listen, and White House staff, with the help of the agencies
       will do just that. Keep in mind, though, that the evidence would have to be pretty
       convincing to change a sixty-year-old division of responsibility between the states and the
       feds on the basis of one year's experience.

Q.     Who's in charge of this issue in the White House?

A.     Counsel's Office and the National Economic Council are coordinating the process.

Q.     Is the SEC involved?
