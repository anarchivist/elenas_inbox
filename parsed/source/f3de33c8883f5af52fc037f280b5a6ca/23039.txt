MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM Bruce Reed
            Chuck Ruff

RE:            Police Brutality

        We wanted to update you on our discussions regarding Hugh Price's letter to you on the
issue of police brutality. Chuck has personally followed up with Mr. Price, who believes --
along with many of the other civil rights advocates -- that you need to speak to this issue as soon
as possible. Key White House and Justice Department staff share this sense of urgency, and we
also generally agree that it is important for you to focus on the constructive steps the Admini-
stration has and will to take to root out police brutality and strengthen the bond between police
officers and the communities they serve. Accordingly, we recommend the following:

       (1) Use your next radio address to bring together a group of civil rights advocates,
       mayors, police chiefs, and rank-and-file law enforcement organizations;

       (2) Challenge these leaders to work with you to make sure that the criminal justice system
       serves the needs of all Americans, and to make the system both fairer and more effective;

       (3) Discuss new provisions to be included in your 21 st Century Crime Bill that will help
       accomplish this -- such as more and better police training, early warning systems to detect
       problem police, better educated police forces, improved efforts to recruit minorities, and a
       long-term commitment to strengthen community policing efforts across the country; and

       (4) Direct the Attorney General to hold a series of meetings with all of these interested
       groups, and to recommend further action steps that the Administration can take.

Also, attached please find a brief description of some of the initial proposals you may want to
consider supporting in such a radio address. Although these require further development -- and
we have not yet consulted with any of the impacted groups -- we thought you might be interested
in our initial recommendations.

                                 Police Abuse and Misconduct
                                    Policy Announcements


       L    Increase funding for police integrity and ethics training. Currently, the federal
government invests only a limited amount of funds to promote police integrity and to keep
officers from turning to misconduct or abuse. With community policing helping to decentralize
the management of police, this training becomes increasingly important. However, of the
approximately 25 regional training centers funded by the Justice Department's COPS Office,
only 2 specialize in this important area. By increasing the percentage of funds in the COPS
program that can be used for training, we can make police integrity and ethics the priority it
should be in all 25 of the federally-funded regional training centers.

        2. Develop early warning systems to detect abuse and misconduct. Studies show
that many of the police officers who engage in serious misconduct and abuse tend to be the
source of a disproportionate number of complaints. Local police departments can and should do
more to implement early warning systems that allow them to identify and discipline problem
police officers sooner. Funds could be authorized to help police departments put such early
warning systems into place.

        3. Develop a national system to track serious misconduct and abuse. The federal
government could establish a national database that tracks police officers who are found guilty of
serious misconduct or abuse. State, local and federal law enforcement agencies would then be
required to consult this database when screening prospective recruits. Such a database would
help ensure that rogue cops who are disciplined or let go in one jurisdiction are not simply
re-employed by another law enforcement agency.

        4. Enhance police recruitment of minorities. Former New York Police
Commissioner William Bratton has recommended that police department diversify and improve
their workforce by aggressively recruiting and educating minority candidates. He has proposed
offering 12-to-14 year-olds summer jobs and training, establishing public safety high schools,
and continuing to pay for the education of police cadets in the City College system. The Police
Corps and/or COPS program could easily be amended to support such long-term minority
recruitment efforts.

       5. Raise police force education levels. A fundamental reform in policing that is
supported by both police management and labor is an overall increase in the education level of
America's police. Our budget this year already includes $20 million for such scholarships.

        6. Establish citizen police academies. In some cities, police departments offer a
version of their police academy training to citizens and community advocates. The goal of this
training is two-fold: (I) for police department to better understand the concerns of its citizens;
and (2) for citizens to better understand how police make important decisions, such as when and
how to use force, when to stop a motorist, etc. Support for such academies could be specifically
authorized by the COPS program.

       7. Promote tough enforcement of our laws. Tough enforcement of our civil rights
laws must be a central element of any plan against police misconduct and abuse. Our budget
includes an increase of more than $1 million dollars (and 10 new attorneys) just for this purpose.

        8. Complete the transition to community policing. Over the long term, the most
important thing we can do to affirmatively strengthen the bond between police and the people
they serve is to renew the COPS program, which has helped to sow the seeds of change in
thousands oflaw enforcement agencies throughout the country. If COPS is not renewed this
year, or ifit is replaced with a block grant, the federal government will lose the leverage it has
gained over the past 5 years in helping to promote changes in law enforcement at the local level.

                            Police Misconduct and Abuse Q&A
                                      March 2, 1999


Q:   The Diallo case in New York has raised the issue of police abuse and misconduct
     across the country_ Last week, a number of civil rights groups including the Urban
     League held a press conference on the issue_ What do you intend to do about this
     matter?

A:   With respect to the Diallo case in particular, as the Attorney General said last week, the
     Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division, the local U.S. Attorney's Office, and the
     FBI are working with the local prosecutor and local authorities to ensure that every
     possible step is taken in this case.

     As to the larger issue of police brutality, the criminal justice system must be fair and have
     the support of all law-abiding Americans. I've asked the Attorney General to consider
     the thoughtful recommendations submitted by Mr. Price as she continues to work with
     state and local law enforcement agencies on these matters. .

     My Administration is committed to vigorous enforcement of our civil rights laws against
     those police officers who would betray the public's trust through lawlessness or brutality.
      Our record shows that. Since 1993, the Justice Department has criminally prosecuted
     over 300 officers, resulting in more than 200 convictions. And our budget for next year
     includes a 15 percent increase for civil rights enforcement across the board, and an even
     more substantial increase for the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department, which
     has responsibility for much of the work involving police misconduct.

     We must also work proactively to ensure that the criminal justice system serves the public
     safety needs of all Americans. The Justice Department is actively working with law
     enforcement organizations across the country to develop training programs to address
     issues of misconduct and abuse. And our community policing initiative has been
     instrumental in strengthening the bond between community residents and their local
     police, as well as reducing the victimization of minorities. Building this kind of trust is
     essential if we are to move forward to make our criminal justice system more responsive
     and fairer for all of our citizens.
