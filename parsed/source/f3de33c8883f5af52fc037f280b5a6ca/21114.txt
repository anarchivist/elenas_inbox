TEXT:
In advance of Maria's 11:30 meeting on 1-200, I offer one substantive
observation on the level of principle. My sense is that some, probably
most, WH staff believe that the fate of 1-200 is basically a local concern,
and that the Administration's posture should be one of "support", rather
than "responsibility." From that, it follows that you should just monitor,
and be reactive and responsive.

The alternative principle is that if 1-200 passes it will ignite a
firestorm of Prop 209-like activity, and in combination with adverse lower
court rulings, broaden and deepen the risks to affirmative action policies
the President and Vice President strongly support. This is no more a
"local" problem than loose nukes in the Former Soviet Union.

What I hear is that "No-200" is in serious financial trouble, relative to
the need; that the battle is winnable (as Prop 209 probably was); and that


the local folks are pretty good (which was only half true on Prop 209).

So the first question is, What's our principle? If you agree with me,   then
the second question is, What would the Administration have to do to
maximize the chances of defeating 1-200, and how much of that are we
actually willing to undertake, given everything else?

Finally, I'll play the WW parlor game: I'll bet that if the issues and
arguments were put before the president, he would say that he does not want
to preside over the dismantling of affirmative action; that he wants an
aggressive (not reactive) strategy to defend his mend-it-don't-end-it
policy; and that he would make these points with an edge of impatience.
