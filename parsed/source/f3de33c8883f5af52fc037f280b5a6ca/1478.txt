TEXT:
I have a note from Erskine instructing that I follow up with Mr. Dingell
on his request for a process on this issue.

It seems to me that our memo is still the first key event in our internal
process.   (Elena is drafting this; my thought of having Ellen do it didn't
work out because of her schedule.)

Meanwhile, who should make the call to Dingell's staff to make a
preliminary acknowledgement of the conversation between Erskine and Mr.
Dingell? Peter?
