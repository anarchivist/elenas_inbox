TEXT:
The Tanner performance bonus amendment just failed on a nearly party line
vote (Ensign was the only R to vote yes) .

Mary Bourdette called me from the markup to ask if we'd seen the language
ahead of time, that Ray U. really didn't like it.  I said that while we
knew they were planning to offer an amendment, we had not seen it in
advance and did not write it for them.
