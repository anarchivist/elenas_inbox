 For Immediate Release              January 14, 1999


 RELIGIOUS FREEDOM DAY, 1999



 BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

 A PROCLAMATION


  On Religious Freedom Day we commemorate a landmark achievement in the
 history
 of our Nation:  the adoption in 1786 by the Virginia legislature of a
 religious
 freedom statute. This historic legislation, drafted by Thomas Jefferson
 and
 co-sponsored by James Madison, was designed to prevent religious
 discrimination
 and to protect Virginians from pressure to join or support any church.  It
 served as the model for the First Amendment of our Constitution, the
 guarantee
 of freedom of religion that has beckoned so many people fleeing
 persecution to
 seek sanctuary in this land.

  Americans are a deeply religious people, and our right to worship as we
 choose, to follow our own personal beliefs, is the source of much of our
 Nation's strength.  Our churches, synagogues, mosques, temples, and other
 houses of worship are centers of community service and community life.
 They
 preserve and promote the values and religious traditions that have infused
 our
 efforts to build a civil society based on mutual respect, compassion, and
 generosity. They provide our children with the moral compass to make wise
 choices.

  America's reverence for religious freedom and religious tolerance has
 saved us
 from much of the hatred and violence that have plagued so many other
 peoples
 around the world. We have always been vigilant in protecting this
 freedom, but
 our efforts cannot stop at our own shores. We cannot ignore the suffering
 of
 men and women across the globe today who are harassed, imprisoned,
 tortured,
 and executed simply for seeking to live by their own beliefs.  Freedom of
 religion is a fundamental human right that must be upheld by every nation
 and
 guaranteed by every government. The promotion of religious freedom for all
 peoples must continue to serve as a central element of our foreign policy.

  Reflecting our steadfast commitment to this goal, last fall the Congress
 passed, and I was proud to sign into law, the International Religious
 Freedom
 Act of 1998. This legislation enhances our ability to advance freedom of
 religion for men and women of all faiths throughout the world.  It also


         establishes a new position at the Department of State -- the Ambassador at
         Large for International Religious Freedom -- to ensure that religious
         liberty
         concerns receive consistent and appropriate attention at the highest
         policymaking levels.

          On Religious Freedom Day, let us give thanks for this precious right that
         has
         so profoundly shaped and sustained our Nation, and let us strengthen our
         efforts to share its blessings with oppressed peoples everywhere.

          NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of
         America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and
         laws
         of the United States, do hereby

         more

                    (OVER)

         proclaim January 16, 1999, as Religious Freedom Day.  I call upon the
         people of
         the United States to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies,
         activities,
         and programs, and I urge all Americans to reaffirm their devotion to the
         fundamental principles of religious freedom and religious tolerance.


          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto. set my hand this
         fourteenth day of January, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and
         ninety-nine, and of the Independence of the United
