TEXT:.
One addendum: I'm not so sure that EEOC's alternative to expanding the
form-- such as supplementing the regular form by targeting specific
industries that Mary mentioned (EEOC suggested Wall Street) -- will be
much more desirable.  The act of the EEOC picking an industry to target
will still be pretty controversial and that industry will still get wacked
with paper. work. We asked EEOC if they could come up with changes to the
form or the process that that led to a no net burden increase to business
and they said no.

We also need to think about the problem a general directive to start a
"reform the form" process may also lead to -- it will likely raise fears
in the business community that the new form will be an interest group
monster, while the groups interested in changing the form likely would put
pressure on any process to include a lot more data.
