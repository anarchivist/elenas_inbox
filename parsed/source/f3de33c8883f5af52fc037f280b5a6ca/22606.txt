TEXT:
FYI -- OMB has decided to extend the deadline for responding to OFCCP's
request to collect wage data for three months, and, in the meantime, work
with us in exploring options of how wage data could be collected.  I told
OMB that seems fine.   If you have a problem with that, let me know.

In addition, Josh Gotbaum is supposed to sit down with the women's groups
next week and listen to their complaints about the lack of wage data and
listen to what they have to say about OFCCP's pending request.
