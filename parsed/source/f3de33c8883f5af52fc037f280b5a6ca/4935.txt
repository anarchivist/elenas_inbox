 TEXT:
 I just spoke with Scott Fleming at ED; Rep. Roemer's office called and
 said they had heard that the Republicans didn't have the votes to move
 their voucher bill out of committee on Friday, so probably would scrub the
mark-up.    Evidently Roukema, Castle, and Barrett (and possibly one more)
have indicated they won't vote for it. The bad news is that they may try
.to attach this to the Charter Schools bill on the floor.   Scott
 emphasized that none of this is definite yet.
