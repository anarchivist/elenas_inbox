 TEXT:
 Here is the weekly report.  If we don't need to include the list of
 potential states and cities to sign up for the test, I'd prefer not to.
 While they are all promising at this point, except for Kentucky, none has
 actually promised yet, and I'd hate to set up unrealistic expectations.

 Let me know if you need anything else.   Elena, I look forward to our
 traditional Saturday morning chat!==================== ATTACHMENT     1 ==============

 Weekly Report: Education

  1. Release of 4th Grade math and science TIMSS results: On Tuesday June 10 the
  Education Department will release the 4th grade TIMSS results, which are very positive. The
  results will show that, for the first time, U.S. students score above the international average in
  both math and science -- 41 points above the international average science score of 524, and 16
  points above the international average math score of 529. Compared with 25 other participating
  nations, U.S. 4th grade students rank behind only South Korea in science, and behind seven
  countries (Singapore, Korea, Japan, Hong Kong, Netherlands, the Czech Republic, and Austria)
  in math. These findings show significant progress in 4th grade math and science, and that we
  are far closer to the National Goal of 1st in the world in math and science than anyone thought
  possible when the goals were established.. Because previously announced results show U.S.
  students well below the international average in 8th grade math, the results reinforce the value of
  a national focus on 8th grade math, and on the national 8th grade math test as a tool for that
. effort.

2. Launch of Public Service Ad's on Standards by Education Excellence Partnership and
Major League Baseball: The DPC has been working with the Education Excellence Partnership
(the Business Roundtable, the National Alliance of Business, the National Governors'
Association, the American Federation of Teachers, and the U.S. Department of Education) and
Major League Baseball on the release ofa new series ofPSA's featuring baseball players in ads
discussing the importance of raising academic standards. The release of these ads is tentatively
scheduled for July 2 at Camden yards, and will feature representatives of each of the participating
organizations. The ads are likely to be played on the stadium screen during the Oriole's game
and during other games throughout the league that day. The fulfillment materials, aimed at
parents, encourages them to ask if their child will be able to participate in the national tests in
1999.

3. National Test. Secretary Riley will be meeting with Rep. Goodling on Tuesday to attempt
to alleviate Mr. Goodling's concerns about the national test initiative, and to seek his support.
They are also likely to discuss the America Reads proposal.

DPC is also working to sign up additional states, and cities, to participate in the national test.
The states that appear most promising candidates include Kentucky (which is definitely
committed), Missouri, Vermont, Colorado, Nevada, and Utah. Based on preliminary contacts,
the cities that appear most promising include Boston, Broward County FL, Cincinnati, Long
Beach, Los Angeles, New York City, and Philadelphia.

This week DPC will provide you with a more detailed memo describing the status of state and
local sign-ups as well as an update on our overall strategy for moving the testing agenda forward.
