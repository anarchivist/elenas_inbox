TEXT:
The DOJ point person is Bill Kollins, Chief of the Land
Acquisition. Apparently he's developed many similar agreements.
Lois talked to Dave Watts from Interior about this, and my sense
was that she was comfortable with DOJ signing on behalf of the
U.S.
I conveyed your comments to Dave, but told him you wanted to talk
to DOJ before we all sign off. Bill Kollin's number is 305-0316.
Again, thanks for your quick turnaround.
