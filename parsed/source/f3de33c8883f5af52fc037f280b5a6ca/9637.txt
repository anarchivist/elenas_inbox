ANTI-GAY RIGGS AMENDMENT DUMPED FROM VA-HUD CONFERENCE REPORT

HOPWA Funding To Increase by $11 Million According to VA-HUD Conference
Committee Report

WASHINGTON -- The House overwhelmingly passed the VA-HUD Appropriations
Conference Committee report today, by a vote of 409 - 14. The report did
not include the controversial anti-gay Riggs Amendment.   If enacted, the
Riggs Amendment would have prohibited the city of San Francisco from using
any VA-HUD funds to enforce that part of its anti-discrimination ordinance
which requires city contractors to offer domestic partnership benefits to
its unmarried employees. The conference report also dropped the Hilleary
amendment, which sought to freeze spending on the Housing Opportunities for
People With AIDS (HOPWA) program at FY '98 levels. The final VA-HUD bill
increases HOPWA funding by $11 million. The HOPWA program helps people
living with HIV and AIDS find housing.
        "The Riggs Amendment represented an unprecedented federal intrusion
into local affairs.   Today's elimination of the Riggs Amendment was a
responsible action by House and Senate conferees who did not want the
federal government to micro manage local affairs and impose narrow beliefs


in far away cities," said HRC political director Winnie Stachelberg.
         The Committee's $11 million increase of HOPWA brings total funding
for the program to $215 million and will help thousands of people with
HIV/AIDS find adequate housing.
         "This was a major victory that will save lives.   It is nearly
impossible for people living with HIV/AIDS to remain healthy without
adequate housing and today's bill will help a lot of people. We will now
work with Senate leaders to have the Senate vote on this report as soon as
possible," said HRC senior health policy advocate Seth Kilbourn.
         House VA-HUD Subcommittee leader Rep Louis Stokes (D-OH), Rep.
Jerry Lewis (R-CA), and Representative Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) were
instrumental in eliminating both the Riggs Amendment and increasing HOPWA
funding. Minority leader Richard Gephardt (D-MO), Sen. Barbara Boxer
(D-CA), San Francisco mayor Willie Brown, and White House staff were also
key in prevailing on conferees to eliminate these provisions in the bill.
In July, the Hilleary amendment, sponsored by Tennessee Republican Van
Hilleary,   passed the House by a vote of 231-200 and the Riggs amendment,
sponsored by Congressman Frank Riggs (R-CA), passed the House by a vote of
214-212.
         The Human Rights Campaign is the largest national lesbian and gay
political organization, with members throughout the country. It effectively
lobbies Congress, provides campaign support and educates the public to
ensure that lesbian and gay Americans can be open, honest and safe at home,
at work and in the community.
