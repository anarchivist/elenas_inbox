                                      PRESIDENT CLINTON:
                              STRENGTHENING EQUAL PAY FOR WOMEN

                                                        June 10, 1998

"Equal pay is not d political issue. It is not even a gender issue. It is, at heart, a national issue, a family issue, and a
matter ofprinciple -- a question of what kind of country we want America to be today and in the 21st Century. "

                                                                                   President Bill Clinton
                                                                                   June 10, 1998

Today, President Clinton, First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, Vice President Al Gore, and Tipper Gore come
together to commemorate the 35th Anniversary of President Kennedy's;signing of the Equal Pay Act, and to urge
passage of legislation to strengthen the laws that prohibit wage discrimination against women. In addition, the
President will also announce the release of two reports providing current and historical data on the wage gap
between men and women.

A CONTINUING NEED To ADDRESS THE WAGE GAP. The President will release the results of a Council of
Economic Advisers (CEA) report showing that the gender gap in wage earnings has closed 29 percent since
1963, and that the gender gap has narrowed among younger women and married women with children; however,
the wage gap persists, women earn only 75 cents for every dollareamed by men. The President will also release
the results of a Department of Labor report that provides a perspective of the thirty-five years since the Equal Pay
Act was enacted. This report shows that:

·        Participation in the labor force by women has increased from roughly 38 percent in 1960 to almost 60
         percent in 1997.
·        Between 1995 and 1996, the number of families with two working parents increased by nearly half a
         million, making equal pay even more of a family issue. The report shows that in two-parent families
         with children under 18, nearly 64 percent of those families have a two income household.

A CALL FOR IMPROVED ENFORCEMENT OF WAGE DISCRIMINATION LAWS. The President calls on
Congress to pass legislation introduced by Senator Tom Daschle (D-SD) and Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro
(D-CT) which strengthens current laws. The legislation includes the following provisions:

·        Increased Penalties For Violations Of The Equal Pay Act. The legislation would put gender-based
         discrimination on equal footing with wage discrimination based on race or ethnicity, allowing for full
         compensatory and punitive damages against a defendant company;
·        Banning Retaliation Against Employees Who Share Salary Information. The legislation would
         allow employees to share salary information, helping women better evaluate whether they are suffering
         wage discrimination;
·        Training, Research, and Pay Equity Award Provisions. The legislation provides for increased
         training of Equal Employment Opportunity Commission workers involved in matters of wage
         discrimination; research on discrimination in the payment of wages; and the establishment of the
         "National Award for Pay Equity in the Workplace", which will recognize and promote the achievements
         of employers that have made strides to eliminate wage disparities.

PRESIDENTIAL LEADERSHIP TO ENSURE EQUAL PAY. The President firmly supports the Daschle-DeLauro
measure. It is tough, fair, and equitable and goes a long way toward ensuring that as our nation moves forward
into the 21 st Century, equal pay will be a reality for all women who enter the workforce.
