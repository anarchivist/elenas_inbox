TEXT:
martha and barbara were trying to get us in to see gorton to
continue to move this -- but at the member level. that did not
pan out before the holiday. we also discussed making sure that
the subject at least gets raised in the budget talks to put a
marker down.  i don't know for sure, but i doubt that happened.
so, back to martha and barbara i think to see what the next step
is.
