Subject:         Race initiative

Bibb and I are planning on hosting a conference call for the agency point
of contacts on the Race initiative on Thursday at 11:00 am. Please join us
by dialing 757-2104 code:4590. This call will be fairly informal. We just
hope to take this opportunity to give direction as to what we are looking
for from the agencies in regards to their memos on "Best practices," as
pertains to this initiative. We will be asking that these memos be turned
into us a week from Friday , July 18th.

Please let us know if you will be joining us.
