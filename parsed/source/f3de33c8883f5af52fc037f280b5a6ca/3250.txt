TEXT:
If we are planning, as I believe we are, to ask for a significant increase
in the ADAP program for '98, we should consider whether this would be a
good announcement for POTUS or VPOTUS and moniter the timing of any
announcement closely w/ HHS.   It would be a shame if we missed this
opportunity· to feature good news in our war on AIDS.
