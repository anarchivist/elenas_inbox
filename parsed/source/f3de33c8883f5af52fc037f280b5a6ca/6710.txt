                                        March 17, 1998


DRAFT MEMORANDUM FOR THE DPC/ NEC

FROM:                 DPCINEC STAFF

SUBJECT:              Equal Pay Initiative

        This memorandum outlines some options for a possible announcement on equal pay on
April 3rd. Many organizations around the country hold events on April 3rd, which is "Equal
Pay Day," the day designated as the date on which women's earnings, added to their previous
year's earnings, are said to equal what men earn in one calendar year.

        There are numerous studies attempting to determine the degree of wage differences
between men and women. A recent brief review of existing studies in the area by the Council of
Economic Advisors concludes that while wage differentials have narrowed steadily since the late
1970s, there is still a significant wage differential, even after controlling for education,
experience, and occupation. The raw differential in terms of female and male wage ratios is
72.4. Taking into account education and experience, the differential becomes 80.5. The wage
differential further narrows to 88.2, controlling for occupation, industry, and union status. A
more popular figure, cited for instance by the Department of Labor, states women earn on
average only 75 cents for each dollar a man earns.                                           .

        The following summarizes existing legislation on equal pay, and describes policy options
in four areas (1) data collection; (2) enforcement; (3) technical assistance; and (4) executive
actions. The memorandum then describes four options for endorsing or modifying existing bills
or endorsing legislative principles.

I.      Existing Legislation

       There are two main bills regarding fair pay that have been introduced, one by Senator
Daschle (D-SD) and one by Senator Harkin (D-IA).

        A.    Paycheck Fairness Act - Daschle S.71

       Enhanced Enforcement. Daschle's bill would amend the Equal Pay Act (EPA) to allow
for compensatory and punitive damages. Currently, the EPA only allows for liquidated damages
and back pay awards. Liquidated damages typically are awarded in an amount equal to back


                                               1
                                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion

pay. Typical recoveries are double back-pay awards.

        An individual can file suit for wage discrimination under either Title VII or the
Equal Pay Act (EPA). Title VII allows for compensatory and punitive damages, in
addition to back pay, as a result of the Civil Rights Act of 1991. These damages are,
however, capped. Compensatory and punitive damages under Title VII for wage
discrimination are limited to no more than between $50,000 and $300,000, depending on
the size of the employer -- not the severity of the offense (e.g., for firms with between 15 and
100 employees, combined damages are capped at $50,000). Victims of racial or ethnic
discrimination in employment can seek unlimited damages under a separate statute,
leaving victims of discrimination based on sex, religion or disability limited in the relief
they can receive.

      The Daschle bill adds unlimited compensatory and punitive damages to the Equal
Pay Act. A number of advocates believe that increasing the damages available under the
EPA would encourage the private bar to bring more suits under the statute, encourage
employers to devote more attention to their pay practices, and encourage victims to come
forward.

       Adding unrestricted damages to equal pay cases would not necessarily lead to a
huge proliferation of frivolous actions or excessive awards. An examination of Title VII's
section 1981, the statute that allows for unlimited damages in cases of racial or ethnic
discrimination, found that between 1980 and 1990 plaintiffs won 121 cases -- eleven per
year. There were no compensatory and punitive damages in 52 of the cases; in 42,
damages were less than $50,000. Total damages exceeded $200,000 in only two cases
during the eleven-year period. This study was limited to reported decisions, and did not
include cases settled before trial.

        Nonretaliation Provision. The bill includes a nometaliation provision that amends the
EPA to prohibit employers from penalizing employees for sharing information about their
salaries with coworkers.

       Data Collection. Daschle's bill also provides for the collection of pay information by the
EEOC. Daschle's bill is somewhat vague on exactly how the wage data would be collected. It
does not specify that the data needs to be collected on the EEO~ 1 form, which is the form used by
the EEOC to collect employment data.

       Daschle's bill did not perform a cost analysis for the collection of this data, but merely
requests that the EEOC appropriations be brought up to the level requested by the President in
FY 1997 by adding $36 million to the budget. (The President's FY 1999 budget requests $279
million for the EEOC -- $37 million or 15 percent more than the enacted 1998 budget.
More than one-third of the proposed increase, $13 million, goes to expansion of the
agency's ADR program.)


                                                2
                                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion



       In addition, the Daschle bill provides for training, research, education, and
outreach. Finally, the bill establishes "The National Award for Pay Equity in the
Workplace," to be administered by the Women's Bureau of the Department of Labor, to
recognize and promote the achievements of employers that have made strides to eliminate
pay disparities.


        B.      Fair Pay Act - Harkin S.232

        Comparable Worth. The principal provision in Harkin's bill is for equal pay for
equivalent jobs. The Fair Pay Act outlaws discrimination in wages paid to employees within a
workplace in equivalent jobs solely on the basis of sex, race, or national origin. However, wage
differences on the basis of seniority, a merit system, or an quality/quantity system would not be
affected.

         Harkin's bill also contains a non-retaliation provision, a provision to permit the awarding
 of expert fees, and a section that provides for the collection of wage information by the EEOC .
·The bill also provides for research, education, and technical assistance.


II.     Relevant Policy Issues

       The following describes policy options in four areas: data collection; enforcement;
technical assistance, and actions regarding the federal workforce.

        A.      Data

        Data collection could improve pay equity in two ways. The first is by providing more
information to enhance enforcement of anti-discrimination laws; the second is by increasing
public awareness of pay inequities. Development of better data to improve enforcement could
be accomplished with a directive to the agencies to determine how best to update the EEO-l
form in order to better serve the EEOC; public awareness of pay inequities could be made with
an annual report on the pay gap by sex produced by the DOL using the (existing) Current
Population Survey.

        1.      Directive to the Agencies

                       The EEOC currently collects annual data regarding the demographic
                breakdown ofthe workforces of private employers with 100 or more employees
                and offederal contractors with 50 or more employees on the EEO-l form. The
                EEOC does not currently collect salary data. The EEO-l form, however, has
                remained virtually unchanged for the past 30 years. During that time, the


                                                  3
                                                                       Hex·Dump Conversion

       occupation and racial categories have become outdated; they have not kept pace
       with the new information economy.

               At the same time, the EEOC believes that collecting wage data on the
       EEO-l form would greatly improve their ability to target and prioritize
       discrimination cases. It also would assist the Department of Labor in targeting its
       enforcement efforts and monitoring affirmative action programs. However,
       collecting wage data through the EEO·l form will be very controversial .- any
       attempts to add wage data to the form will draw significant fire from the
       Republicans and the business community.

               In order to give complete consideration to competing arguments regarding
       changing the EEO·l form or creating a supplement to the form, the best method
       would be to issue a directive to the EEOC, the Department of Labor, and the
       Department of Justice (in consultation with the Department of Commerce,
       Treasury, and OMB) to report back in 6 months on ways to improve the form to
       increase enforcement of our anti-discrimination laws. The agencies should be
       directed to streamline the data collection process and to pay particular attention to
       minimizing burdens on business.

Pros: The EEOC, the Dept. of Labor (OFCCP), and organized labor believe that wage
      data is critical to improving the enforcement ability of the EEOC and OFCCP.
      And, they are extremely eager for the administration to collect this data.
      Unfortunately, if the EEO·l form were amended in its current form to include
      wage data, it would increase compliance costs by several hundred· fold. Other
      options, such as creating a supplement to the form, may mitigate some of these
      costs. At the same time, the form is quite out-of·date which further hinders
      enforcement.

       Thus, we need a thorough and creative study (and policy process) in order to
       consider seriously changing the form, and to weigh the costs and benefits of
       revising the occupational and racial categories and collecting wage data. Issuing
       the directive will give us time to study the issue thoroughly while re-assuring
       interested parties that we understand their concerns.

Cons: Issuing a directive may be seen by organized labor and other groups as "weak"
      relative to stating that the administration will update the form and/or will collect
      wage data. Further, at the end of the 180-day period, we may be faced with a
      recommendation to change the form or collect wage data that comes at an
      unacceptably large public compliance burden. In other words, since the groups
      will expect us to include the wage data on the form (since we are announcing that
      we want to update the form on Equal Pay Day), we may be putting ourselves in a
      box that we will not be able to escape from.


                                         4
                                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion

              Also, the business community -- concerned that we may make the fonn more
              difficult to comply with -- may object to us even considering changing the EEO-l
              fonn (much less considering collecting the wage data).

       2.     Annual Report Based on Bureau of Labor Statistics Data

                       The President could also improve data collection by requiring DOL to
              issue an annual report based on (existing) wage data by the Bureau of Labor
              Statistics. This option would be less politically charged because it would not
              impose additional burdens on business. In addition, because attitudes and
              awareness are keys to reducing wage disparities, highlighting the issue every
              year would likely have a powerful effect on public consciousness and be an
              effective way to achieve increased gender pay equity. However, this option
              would not enhance enforcement efforts. This option would not involve
              significant costs.


       B. Enforcement

       Enforcement of anti-discrimination laws by the EEOC and OFCCP have traditionally
played an important role in easing discrimination in our labor market. Therefore, a key
component to our equal pay initiative is to improve enforcement by both agencies. In particular,
we propose:

       1.     Increase Funding for Enforcement

              a.      Increase OFCCP Funding by $5 million
                      DOL estimates that it would require approximately $5 million to support
                      additional training, travel, and staff to increase corporate management
                      reviews. These corporate management reviews, also known as "glass
                      ceiling" reviews, are different from other compliance reviews conducted
                      by OFCCP in that they begin with an interview with the chief executive
                      officer. These reviews also include a perusal of promotional and
                      compensation policies related to mid- and upper-level management
                      positions, efforts to recruit diverse pools of applicants for senior level
                      positions, and the developmental opportunities that exist for individuals to
                      become senior executives. Since 1994, OFCCP has conducted
                      approximately 100 Corporate Management Reviews of Fortune 1000
                      companies. With an additional $5 million, OFCCP could increase its
                      FTEs by 80, and conduct approximately 190 corporate reviews per year.

              b.      Increase EEOC funding by $500,000


                                                5
                                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion

                     EEOC estimates that it would cost $500,000 to increase training for its
                     staff for enforcement of wage discrimination under both Title VII and the
                     Equal Pay Act.

      2.     A Memorandum Of Understanding (MOU) between EEOC and DOL to
             Cross Train

                     The EEOC and the Department of Labor could enter into an agreement to
             train each other's staff to be sensitive to potential violations of the statutes they
             enforce, including the Equal Pay Act. The agencies would refer information
             concerning potential violations of the agency's statutes to the applicable EEOC or
             Labor Department office for appropriate action.

      3.     A MOU Between EEOC and DOL to Collect Damages

              OFCCP would be designated to serve as the EEOC's agent for purposes of
      collecting damages that are not otherwise collectible under OFCCP's authority under its
      executive order. OFCCP then could obtain full relief for intentional discrimination.
      This change would not require any legislative action. There are no costs anticipated for
      this option.

      4.     A Presidential Directive to Emphasize Existing Obligations for Federal
             Contractors

               The President could issue a directive ordering all of the contracting agencies to
       abide by already existing Equal Employment Opportunity clauses which are contained in
       most goyemrnent contracts. OFCCP enforces the anti-discrimination provisions in
       employment laws that pertain to federal contractors, which constitute 22 percent of the
       civilian workforce. As the result of the EEO clause in their contracts, federal contractors
       and subcontractors are required to refrain from discriminating and to take pro-active steps
       to ensure an equal opportunity workplace. This government contract obligation includes
       a self-audit component that often recognizes and corrects patterns of discrimination and
     . eliminates unnecessary barriers to employment. The EEO clause is a powerful lever that,
       if taken more seriously by the contracting officers, would help prevent discrimination.



C. Technical Assistance

      1.     Federal Contractor Best Practices

             Currently, federal contractors must conduct self-audits as part of their


                                               6
                                                                              Hex·Dump Conversion

       federal contract obligations. OFCCP has begun to publicize successful programs
       through its best practices honor roll. The agency plans to place these Best Practices
       suggestions on its web site.

       2.     SWAT Team at DOL to provide technical assistance

               DOL proposes $2 million for a specialized technical assistance team to reach out
       to approximately 1000 companies. DOL's technical assistance would include analysis of
       hiring, promotion, compensation, and evaluation data to ensure fairness and consistency
       for women at all levels within the company. Recommendations for correcting problem
       areas could then be proposed.

       3.     lO-Step Voluntary Self-Audit for Businesses and Employees

              The Department of Labor would develop and make available a 10-step package
       that would give companies guidelines to determine whether they offer equal pay, hiring,
       and promotional opportunities. The Department would also develop a similar checklist
       for employees. DOL would put these self-audits on the Internet. This would require no
       additional funding.

       4.     Awards

              The Department of Labor has an Exemplary Voluntary Efforts (EVE) and
       Secretary's Opportunity 2000 Awards program that recognizes best corporate practices.
       This year's event will be held on September 17. This existing vehicle could be used to
       highlight the best practices in furthering pay equity. There is also an award proposed in
       the Daschle bill.


D.     Federal Government

       Another way in which the Federal government can provide for the recognition and
promotion of fair pay practices by employers is to become a role mode) for other employers.
The following four initiatives are designed to address discrimination within the Federal
government:

       1.     Guide to Recruitment and Retention of Women

              The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is producing a new Guide on
       Recruitment and Retention of Women in the federal government that would contain
       information to make agency managers aware of career opportunities for women and to
       provide guidance on recruitment and career development for women. This could be
       prepared by April 3rd.


                                               7
                                                                           Hex.Dump Conversion


      2.       Outreach

              OPM, in conjunction with other agencies, could expand outreach efforts,
      including working with professional groups, participating in women's conferences, and
      visiting college campuses so that talented women may be recruited for jobs in the Federal
      government.
      3.      Best Practices

              OPM could work with the other Federal departments and agencies to develop best
      practices, from both the public and private sectors, for recruiting and retaining women.

      4.       Career Development Programs

             OPM could explore extension of career development programs and activities,
      such as the Women's Executive Leadership Program and Federally Employed Women
      workshops, to increase employment of women in the federal workforce and to identify
      new initiatives that support the enhancement of career skills for women at allleve1s.


III. Options

Option 1:      Endorse Daschle

      Pros: The bill addresses the legislative principles described in Option 4, below.

      Cons: The bill may go further than we are willing to with regard to punitive and
            compensatory damages and with regard to adding wage data to the EEO-l
            form (see the data discussion, abov~).

Option 2:      Work with Daschle's Staff to Modify his Bill
               Amend the provision to provide for the addition of capped compensatory and
               punitive damages, which would put the Equal Pay Act on par with the
               damages currently available for wage discrimination under Title VII, and
               issue a directive to consider changing the EEO-l form (rather than
               determining that before a proper process has occurred). Announce an annual
               report on wage differentials.

      Pros: Again, the bill addresses many of the proposed legislative principles.
            However, the President does not want to encourage unnecessary litigation
            and unlimited punitive damages that result in large legal settlements.
            Capping damages would both limit potential settlements and would make the
            Equal Pay Act consistent with Title VII. The annual report would be a

              valuable informational guide to wage differentials. The advantages of
              issuing a directive to study the EEO-l form are discussed in the Data section,
              above.

       Cons: The Administration would be endorsing an enforcement provision stronger
             than what some businesses would likely prefer, and weaker than the bill
             originally sponsored by Senator Daschle.


Option 3.     Support or Endorse Harkin

       Pros: Economists agree that most of the (remaining) pay disparity between men
and
             women results because traditionally female jobs pay less than traditionally
male
              jobs. Therefore, that it will be difficult to achieve true pay equity without
              overhauling prevailing pay practices, such as through comparable worth.

       Cons: While a policy akin to comparable worth may be required to achieve true
             pay equity, it has several drawbacks, including: a) interfering with the labor
             market's ability to set wages and strong opposition from business, b)
             possibility of causing women to lose jobs (since imposed pay equity would
             most likely be achieved by increasing female salaries rather than lowering
             male salaries), and c) no one really knows how wages are determined so it is
             difficult to implement.

Option 4:     Endorse Legislative Principles

       The President could simply endorse legislative themes for pay equity that should be
       in legislation, such as:

      1.      Providing for the recognition and promotion of fair pay practices by
employers;
       2.     Providing for research, education and outreach to encourage fair pay
              practices and to eliminate pay disparities in the workplace;
       3.     Providing enhanced enforcement to deter violations of the Equal Pay Act and
              other laws;
       4.     Prohibiting retaliation against employees who disclose, discuss, or inquire
              about their wages or the wages of their co-workers.

       Pros: We avoid committing to a particular policy before we have completed a
             thorough policy process while still emphasizing the administration's policy
             principles.

     Cons: It does not respond specifically with solutions and would be criticized as
           ineffective and rhetorical.


Recommendation:

     We recommend Option 2 as a specific action to reduce unequal pay with common sense
     legislation that improves enforcement, data collection, and technical assistance. In
     addition, we recommend the agencies sign the MOU's and develop guidelines for federal
     employers to improve federal coordination and practices.
