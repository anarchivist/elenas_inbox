TEXT:
Phil said it went to the President and he signed off "in principle." Phil
said he would need to run it by OMB himself (which shouldn't be a problem)
and that it could get signed as early as late Tuesday, but more likely
sometime on Wednesday.

I will call the VP's office tomorrow about this.   Thanks!
