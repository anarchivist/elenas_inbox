TEXT:
DOL is getting close to releasing California's Welfare to Work formula
grant. Given the size ($190 M) and importance of the state, DOL wanted to
see if there was any White House interest in being involved in the
announcement. On the other 17 states approved so far, DOL has issued a
press release and made calls to key congressional members and state/local
electeds. The release on TN included a quote from the VP.     POTUS will be
in CA next Friday for Oceans event.  Lee Anne, is VP interested? If
anyone thinks we should do something, we need to let Lynn Jennings at DOL
know soon (219-82~1),
