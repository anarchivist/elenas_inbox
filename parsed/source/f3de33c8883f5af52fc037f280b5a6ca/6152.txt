TEXT:
Shaw is holding his child support computer systems subcommittee hearing on
Thursday.
If there's a quorum, they may mark up the Shaw-Levin bill.

Shaw and Levin have made every effort to be cooperative, and have
incorporated every change we've asked for -- except one. The bill imposes
the new penalties starting in June 1, 1998 -- that is, any state which
completes its system between October and June will not be penalized.
Haskins says he needs that to get the support of states that are almost
certified and that imposing new penalties retroactively is legally
problematic. We told him that we've taken the strong position that we
will not extend the deadline beyond October 1st.

The current plan is for HHS' testimony to be silent on this issue but
Monahan, if asked, will say we oppose changing the date.   Is this an
acceptable solution to you?
