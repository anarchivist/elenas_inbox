TEXT:
I'm still concerned about the implications of the Ed Dept. study on a
decision to call for HS service requirements.  It will be released
eventually.  It shows that by far the most common school policy is to
arrange community service without requiring it, and that policy is
virtually as successful as arranging it and requiring it.  So, as we
discussed, it seems to provide a pretty strong argument that requiring
service is not that productive.

The survey asks 25,000 students if:

Their    school   arranges community service:                      68%
Their    school   arranges & requires service:                     16%
Their    school   does neither                                     14%
Their    school   requires service without arranging it:                 2%

Percent of students who do perform service, by type of school:

School   requires and arranges service:              56%
School   arranges service                      52%
School   does nothing                                30%
School   requires service only                       19%

Also, Gomperts thinks that this will become the story if we add it in
because the press is fascinated by it, and will draw attention away from
AmeriCorps.
