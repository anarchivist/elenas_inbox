Subj ect:         Mayor Giul,iani Meetings in New York on Immigration

I just wanted to be surethat you were all aware of the meeting that Mayor
Giuliani is hosting in New York on Monday and Tuesday of next week.  He
has a fairly large group of Democrat and Republican city and county
officials coming to throw the spotlight on Immigration issues. He has
been very outspoken on the need to fix the immigration problems present in
the welfare reform legislation, and is vsing this meeting to make a strong
bipartisan statement. His Tuesday event will be held at Ellis Island.

I have the agenda and attendance list for those who might want it--we were
not invited, but have been advised by our friends.  Since we seem to agree
with the Mayor on these issues, this is really an FYI in case there are
press inquiries.
