TEXT:
I just heard from Chris Greggiore (and also from Tom Miller).  The
drafting team worked all night to put on paper agreements reached so far,
and proposals for remaining issues. The money is largely settled, but
public health issues remain, and she specifically pointed out her concern
with the behavior of the non-participating manufacturers. The "recess" is
to allow the cigarette negotiators a chance to brief their CEOs and get
some further guidance. They have every expectation of resuming talks Wed
or Thursday.
