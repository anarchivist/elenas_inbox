TEXT:
Per a call from DOL -- this morning the Republican leadership decided that
all the administrative questions on Welfare-to-Work go HHS's way -- i.e.,
HHS is the Federal Administering agency, and the local system is run
through the TANF agency. DOL believes other W-to-W issues were discussed,
but what they were and the outcome (if any) is unknown at the moment.
