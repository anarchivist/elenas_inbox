 BR/EK:

 Per your request, here's a quick and dirty on the Rs' drug bills that were
 included in the final omnibus approps bill:

 1. ONDCP Reauthorization.   Reauthorizes ONDCP for 5 years and generally
 mirrors Administration's proposal.  Some differences: includes non-binding
 targets to reduce overall drug use, availability, purity and crime by
 between 50 and 80%; establishes President's Drug Policy Council (DPC not
 specifically included, but can be added by President); and creates a
 Parents Advisory Council on Drug Abuse that reports to ONDCP.

 2. Drug Demand Reduction Act. Authorizes Drug-Free Media Campaign at
 current funding levels ($195 million) through 2002, and establishes
 2-year, $50 million program for prison and jail-based drug treatment.  On
 a lesser note; provides for state education officers to establish a standa
 rd of quality for drug and other prevention programs; seeks to promote the
 development and approval of anti-addiction medications; establishes
 commission to improve the efforts of health professionals in reducing
 substance abuse; and calls for a report on how to streamline federal drug
 treatment and prevention programs.

 3. Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act. Authorizes about $2.5
 billion in funds for a multitude of interdiction and international
 counterdrug programs, including -- increased radar coverage, Coast Guard
 equipment and resources, crop eradication programs, and alternative crop
 development support and research.

  4. Miscellaneous Bills.     Three small bills were also attached, including:
   (1) a Sense of the Congress resolution condemning the legalization of
  marijuana for medicinal purposes; (2) increased penalties for
  methamphetamine trafficking (equalizes w/current crack penalties by dropp
  ing triggers for 5 and lo-year mandatory minimums from 10 and 100
. grams ... to 5 and 50 grams); and (3) authorizes 2-year, $20 million
  demonstration program for SBA to help small business adopt drug-free
  workplace policies.

5. Drug Supplemental Appropriations. Finally, the omnibus includes $650
million in emergency drug appropriations -- most of which funds components
of the Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act (Coast Guard, DEA
intelligence, international programs, crop support research). Some
exceptions include our requests for X-ray machines for Customs, improved
-
border barriers, a "point of entry" integrity initiative,   $1.2 million for
ONDCP staff and $2 million for a Drug Court Institute.

Hope this helps,
Jose'
