READ: UNKNOWN

TEXT:
Lyn says you are looking for groups to involve in the rollout of the sotu
in some way or another.

I don't know the content of the speech enough to know whether or not
welfare or disability groups would be happy with it, but here are some
names.  (I.would also note that public liaison usually has reams of lists
like this.)

She and I agreed on the obvious welfare candidates:  Children's Defense
Fund, Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Also, groups like United
Way, Jewish Federation (not sure of exact name), Catholic Charities

Intergovernmental groups:
NGA
APWA
NCSL
National Association of Counties
US Conference of Mayors
National League of Cities

Disability:
Consortium of Citizens with Disabilities
United Cerebral Palsy
Easter Seals
The Arc
National Mental Health Association
many more if you want them

(By the way, if we are looking for visits/trips for the President to
highlight his policies and build public support for them, he could visit
legal immigrants facing SSI cutoffs. Just a thought ... might not work.)
