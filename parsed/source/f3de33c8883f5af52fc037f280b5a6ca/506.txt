TEXT:
We need to make sure we are comfortable with SSA's plan to give
information on naturalization to legal aliens at risk of losing
SSI.
SSA needs our comments on their approach TODAY in order to meet a
printing deadline so that they can meet the law's deadline for
getting notices to beneficiaries.
I sent you all copies. Warnath signed off.
I think they have a good approach.  SSA proposes to include with
the notice itself a one-page fact sheet from the INS on "How to
Become a U.S. Citizen".  It is strictly a fact-oriented piece.
The draft SSA notice itself says, "If you want to know more about
becoming a US citizen, see the information on the enclosed INS
fact sheet .... "
What other WH offices, if any, do you think we need to alert to
this?
Please let me know today if you have comments on this.  Otherwise,
I will tell SSA we have no comments at the end of the day.
