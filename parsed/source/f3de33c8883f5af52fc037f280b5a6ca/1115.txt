TEXT:
Nancy-Ann is trying to set up a meeting with Dr. Varmus, Dr Paul, Kevin
Thurm, and you to discuss the status of the AIDS vaccine and possible next
steps. Right now Dr. Varmus is holding at 4pm Friday, but his office says
they need to know asap because they are squeezing this in with cloning
testimony etc. Does this time work for you?
