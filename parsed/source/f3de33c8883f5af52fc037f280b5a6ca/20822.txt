TEXT:
We haven't gotten the new draft yet because the IRS is not happy with the
new language that Treasury has put forth that DOL loves (saying that
Treasury assumes there IS an employment relationship.  (Tax policy has
been simultaneously talking to the IRS and us.)  Treasury will try hard to
convince them, but this could be rotten if we can't even offer what we've
already put on the table. And unfortunately Lubick mentioned this
wonderful new language at the Arnold&Porter meeting today, so the unions
know about it.
