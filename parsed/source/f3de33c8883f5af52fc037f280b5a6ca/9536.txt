HIGHLIGHTS

   1.We have cut RJR estimates to $2.20 in 1998 (from $2.40; we had
previously quantified exposure of
     $(.15)/share in Russia), and to $2.40 in 1999 (from $2.50). Our going
forward assumption is that Russia will
     generate zero profits in 1998, and $10-$15 million in 1999. With no
profits in low-tax Russia, management
     has increased its estimated 1998E tax rate to 45.5%, from 43.0%.

   2.The estimate cut, which was largely expected, was offset by news that
3Q domestic tobacco profits will be
     up about +10% (+4-5% previously expected) on an approximate (7%)
volume decline (industry -6%;
     reflects trade deloading following Spring price increases). This
suggests that RJR, following B&W's lead,
     is finally cutting back on promotional spending behind Doral.

   3.We do not expect RJR to cut its dividend (1998 dividend $2.05, vs.
$3.75 cash earnings, 55% payout; MO
     52% payout; UST 65% payout) until Nabisco is spun off (early-1999).
Our standalone RJR Worldwide
     Tobacco 1998E estimates are now $1.45 reported EPS ($1.55 in 1999),
$2.55 cash EPS ($2.70 in 1999), and a
     1998E fixed charge coverage of 3.1x (3.3x in 1999).

   4.The estimate cut does not change prospects for a spinoff of Nabisco.
In fact, the continued terrible
     operating results at both RJR International and Nabisco, combined
with our view that raider Carl Icahn
      (13-14MM shares) will announce another proxy fight to unseat
~      ,-

    management (filing deadline Nov. 26),
         increases the pressure on RJR to spin out Nabisco once there is a new
    AG deal.

       5.We believe the market has overreacted to what is old news, especially
    when one considers that RJR likely
         has no choice but to find an international partner to beef up
    distribution and management. With a 35% cut
         in RJR estimates since beginning of the year, shareholders have lost
    faith in management's ability to fix
         RJR's problems, and should increasingly attach a change in control
    premium to RJR's shares. If Icahn
         attracts as a partner a strong consumer products veteran, he could ge
    t 60%+ of the proxy vote.

       6.While Philip Morris does not appear to be having anywhere near the
    same problems that RJR is having in
         Russia -- much better management team and local distribution -- we
    have said that we would cut $.05/share
         out of our Philip Morris 1998 numbers (to $3.10) if PM told us that
    its Russian profits were zero ($150
         million current estimate -- about 3% of PM International)

       7.Settlement update: We believe the key obstacle holding up the deal is
    the parties' intent to make sure that
         "substantially all" of the AGs opt-in to the deal once it is
    announced (Friday or next Monday is our best
         bet). We have heard that the opt-in period for the AGs will be
    relatively short -- likely 7-10 days from day
         of announcement. We have also heard that there will some monetary
    incentive that RJR and B&W (portion
         of upfront payments borne by MO) forfeit if they fail to sign up
    during the opt-in period.

    INVESTMENT CONCLUSIONS

          We reiterate our outperform rating. Assuming there is a new AG
    agreement, we see little downside for RJR,
          even with continuing problems in Russia. Either one of two outcomes
    seems likely: One, RJR will enter into
          the AG settlement, spin off Nabisco, and shareholders will be
    rewarded with a sum-of-the-parts valuation
           (estimate $40 -- RJR's stake in Nabisco is now worth $23.75 per
    share. Even with the estimate cut, RJR's
          worldwide tobacco business ($1.45 in reported EPS and $2.55 in cash
    EPS) , is worth potentially $15 - $18
          per share, at 10 - 12x reported earnings, or 6-8x cash earnings). If
    RJR elects not to join the settlement,
          which would suggest no spinoff, we have no doubt there would be a
    change in control at RJR next year as
          shareholders elect to unseat the current Board and management. In the
    latter situation, we would expect
          the new Board to adopt the settlement put in place by Philip Morris
    and Loews, install a new management
          team that can fix RJR International, and move to unlock value via
    spinoffs, asset sales, etc. That said, we
          still prefer Philip Morris and UST over RJR, which is likely worth
    more dead than alive. Our price target
          remains $40.
