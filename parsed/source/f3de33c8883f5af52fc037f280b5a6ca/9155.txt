TEXT:
Hi.   I just spoke to Sally and informed her that she would be chairing the
H-2A meeting on Monday.   I will give her the DOL memo outlining the "idea
inventory," however she would also like to know, in advance, your
assessment of the different ideas.   She would a l so like to know what you
would like to come out of this meeting.   Sally will be in tomorrow morning
but will leave mid-afternoon.

Thanks.
