TEXT:
Elena,

At the meeting today, not all issues were resolved, but some amount of
consensus was reached.  It is Sally's inclination to keep trying to reach
consensus, rather than ask OLC to resolve the legal question. An informal
opinion will likely not get us very far (in terms of resolution) and a
formal opinion will take a long time and is uncontrollable. This does
not, of course, prevent one of the agencies from going to OLC if they are
unhappy with the resolution.

This is where we are now:

(1) the AJs decision will be   final.  However, the standard of review of
the AJ's decision by the OFO   (EEOC appellate) will be less deferential
that the "clearly erroneous"   standard now advocated by the EEOC.   How this
standard will be articulated   has yet to be determined;

(2) a standard for reconsideration by the Commission will be developed
(under the current system, there is a right to de novo reconsideration;
the proposed reg allows the Commission to reconsider if they believe there
has been a miscarriage of justice). One idea was to allow
reconsideration, upon motion, only if the Commission concludes that the
decision below was clearly erroneous or if the case is one that has a
sytemic effect throughout the agency (broader implications);

(3) the question of attorneys' fees is still u~settled.   The EEOC had
proposed the availability pre-complaint attorneys' fees, with guidance to
the AJs about how to calculate it.   The agencies still seem opposed to
this.  They are also resistant to the proposed change to eliminate the
"offer of full relief" and create an "offer of resolution." The
significant difference between the two appears to be when the offer can be
made by the agency (an offer of resolution can only be made after the
complaint has been filed).   In either case, if the complainant turns down
the offer, but doesn't, in the end, recover more than the offer, they are
barred from recovering post-offer attorneys' fees.   The EEOC has agreed to
consider the question of allowing pre-complaint offers of resolution.

Sally is hoping that all of this can be resolved without another meeting.
We'll keep you posted.

Julie
