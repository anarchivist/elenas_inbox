MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:          Bruce Reed
               Elena Kagan

RE:            DPC Weekly Report


        ImmigrationiWelfare -- Public Charge: Last week, we anticipated that by
November lst we would have the guidance completed that instructs INS inspectors and
State Department consular officers to disregard prior or current receipt of Medicaid,
CHIP, and/or Food Stamps when determining whether an immigrant is likely to become a
public charge (unless an alien has received institutionalized care funded by Medicaid).
However, the Justice Department has identified a legal question regarding the intersection
of the new binding affidavit of support and rules for deportation as a public charge that
should be resolved before issuing comprehensive guidance. We considered issuing a general
policy statement in advance of the guidance announcing our decision with regard to
Medicaid/CHIP and Food Stamps, but immigration advocates urged us not to make any
statements until we are prepared to respond to detailed questions on all of the partiCUlars ofthe
guidance (to minimize confusion in the immigrant communities). We expect to have all of the
issues resolved shortly.

         Health Care -- Patients' Bill of Rights Event at AFSCME: On Monday, you are
scheduled to participate in a roundtable discussion with health care workers and patients
on the patients' bill of rights at the Association of Federal, State, County, and Municipal
Employees. We are also working with a number of candidates around the country, who
have indicated interest in downlinking this event to patients' rights rallies in their districts.
 At this event, you will receive a status report from the Vice President outlining how the
five Federal agencies with primary jurisdiction over health care have responded to your
executive order directing them to ensure that their health plans come into compliance with
the patients' bill of rights. This report will underscore that while the Republican
Leadership has allowed Congress to adjourn without passing a strong enforceable patients'
bill of rights, you are taking every possible action to implement these protections for the 85
million Americans in Federal health plans. You can also reiterate your strong
commitment that passing a patients' bill of rights that applies these protections to all health
plans is a top priority for you in the next Congress.

        Health Care -- Meeting With The Disability Community: This week, Justin Dart and
other leaders in the disability community met with us to outline their policy priorities as we begin
                                                                    Hex-Dump Conversicn

our preparations for the FY 2000 budget. At this meeting, they expressed their extreme
appreciation for your support of the Jeffords-Kennedy work incentive proposal and indicated
their commitment to working with the Administration on this and other issues of interest to the
disability community. They were also pleased to have their opinions solicited so early in the
budget process. DPC and NEC are in the process of exploring other work incentive and long
term care initiatives that would provide the disabled with the health care services critical to
achieving independence. We will be outlining these options to you in the upcoming weeks.

        Health Care -- Pediatric Labeling Initiative: Last year at an event with the First Lady,
you announced our intention to release an FDA regulation that would require manufacturers to
conduct the necessary studies to provide pediatric labeling information for physicians treating
children. This announcement was widely praised by pediatricians and the advocacy community,
especially those for children with AIDS. Subsequently, FDA reform legislation was passed with
the intention of complimenting this regulation by awarding short term patent extensions to offset
the costs incurred by companies undertaking these State studies. Since the enactment of the
legislation, the industry has taken the inaccurate and untenable position that the legislation
assumes voluntary and not mandatory compliance with these regulations. However, because of
the industry's sensitivity about the regulation and their influence over the confirmation of Jane
Henney as FDA Commissioner, the final regulation was not published. Now that Dr. Henney
has been confirmed, the First Lady's office believes (and we agree) that we should expedite the
release of the regulation. Although Dr. Henney strongly supports this regulation, we may want
to release it prior to her swearing-in to assure that her first regulatory initiative is not excessively
controversial.

        Crime -- Brady/National Instant Criminal Background Check System: This week,
the Justice Department will publish the final regulation implementing the Brady National Instant
Criminal Background Check System (NICS). Under the NICS, which will go into effect on
November 30th, the FBI and/or state points of contact will conduct computerized background
checks of all prospective guns purchasers (not just handguns). hnplementation of the NICS is a
significant accomplishment for you and this Administration -- starting with the fight to enact the
Brady Bill's passage in 1993, to securing funds to improve state criminal history records, and
more recently, thwarting Congressional efforts to undermine Brady's final implementation.

    Drugs -- Medical Marijuana: On Wednesday, a letter was released to the press signed by
former Presidents Carter, Ford and Bush, stating their opposition to pending state medical
marijuana ballot initiatives. Current polls indicate that medical marijuana initiatives will pass in
Alaska, Oregon, Washington and the District of Columbia. It is unclear whether the initiative
will pass in Nevada. Arizona -- which passed a broad medical marijuana initiative two years
ago -- has another ballot initiative which would essentially moot the earlier vote; however, it
appears likely that this second measure will fail.

        Welfare Reform -- New Jersey Family Cap Study: On Monday, New Jersey will
release its latest evaluation of the state's family cap policy. We understand that the major


                                                   2

    findings in the report, prepared by Rutgers University researchers, are a decrease in births to
    families on welfare and a small early increase in abortions. Secretary Shalala sent you a memo
    about the draft Rutgers study in June, pointing out that both New Jersey and HHS had serious
    methodological concerns with the study. The Department is reviewing the latest study in more
    detail, but remains concerned with the methodology (in particular, the study may not have
    controlled sufficiently for other factors that may had an impact on abortions). A total of23
    states have chosen to adopt a family cap policy since the passage of the welfare refonn law (up
    from 15 states that had waivers to implement this policy).
