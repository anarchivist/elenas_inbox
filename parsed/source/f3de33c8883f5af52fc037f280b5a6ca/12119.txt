                           HATE CRIMES ANNOUNCEMENT

                             DATE:           April 6, 1999
                             LOCATION: Roosevelt Room
                             BRIEFING TIME: lO:OOAM· 10:30AM
                             EVENT TIME:     10:30AM - 11 :OOAM
                             FROM:           Bruce Reed, Mary Beth Cahill


I.    PURPOSE

      To urge Congress to pass quickly pending federal hate crimes legislation, and to
      demonstrate the broad base support for this legislation. Also, to announce other hate
      crimes initiatives targetted toward children, such as a pUblic-private program that will
      develop a program for middle school children.

II.   BACKGROUND

      Today you will applaud public and private efforts to teach children about tolerance and
      urge Congress to quickly pass the pending federal hate crimes legislation. This
      legislation strengthens the existing federal hate crimes law by (1) extending the situations
      where prosecutions can be brought for violent crimes motivated by bias based on race,
      color, religion, or national origin; and (2) expanding the federal hate crimes statute to
      protect against hate crimes based on sexual orientation, gender, or disability. You will
      also announce a new pUblic-private partnership which will focus attention on issues of
      hate, tolerance, and diversity in middle-grade schools. Finally, you will call on the
      Departments of Justice and Education to include hate crimes in its annual report card on
      school safety and to report on hate crimes and bias on college campuses.

      Urging Passage of Expanded Federal Hate Crimes Law. You will urge Congress to
      pass the Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 1999, which expands a principal federal hate
      crimes statute. The current statute prohibits acts of violence that are based on a person's
      race, color, religion, or national origin and that are intended to interfere with certain
      specified federally protected activities. The proposed legislation would make illegal acts
      of violence, even if they did not interfere with federally protected activities. Further, the
      legislation would authorize the Department of Justice to prosecute individuals who
      commit violent crimes against others because of the victim's sexual orientation, gender,
      or disability. Current federal law does not cover these cases at all.
                                                                          Automated Records Management System
                                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion

            Announcing Public-Private Partnership to Create a Middle-School Program about
            Tolerance. You will announce a public-private partnership that will develop a program
            for middle-school students to teach tolerance in the classroom and in their daily lives.
            The members ofthe partnership are the Departments ofJustice and Education and AT&T,
            Court TV, the National Middle School Association, the Anti-Defamation League, and
            Cable in the Classroom. This effort is supported by the NAACP, the Leadership
            Conference for Civil Rights, the National Council of La Raza, the National Asian Pacific
            American Legal Consortium, the National Association of Protection and Advocacy
            Systems, the National Education Association, and the National School Boards
            Association, and the Partnership welcomes support from other organizations that deal
            with these issues. Recognizing that tolerance cannot be taught in a single day and that
            raising awareness of diversity should be integrated into students' daily lives, this
            public-private partnership entitled "Dealing with Our Differences," will provide an
            opportunity for an ongoing dialogue for middle-school students to learn about the harmful
            impact of intolerance and to highlight positive ways that young adolescents are dealing
            with diversity issues. The Partnership will develop in-school lessons and activities
            supported with cable TV programming; videos and websites; a nationally-televised forum
            on diversity and tolerance at the end of October; and post-show lessons and activities.

            Creating New Studies About Hate Crimes in Schools and Colleges.              In order to
            better understand the problem of hate crimes and intolerance among young people, you
            will call on the Departments of Justice and Education to include in their annual report
            card on school safety a section on hate crimes among young people, both at and away
            from school. In addition, you will direct the Department of Education, with appropriate
            assistance from the Department of Justice, to collect data on hate crimes and bias on
            college campuses for periodic publication.
