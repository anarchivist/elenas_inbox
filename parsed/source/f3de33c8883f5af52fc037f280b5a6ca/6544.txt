TEXT:
The call to Kathy Kiely of the New York daily News can be made tomorrow.
Chuck Brain relates the following: the House legislative situation is
similar to what it was in the senate.  the committee bill contains
incentives rather than a penalty.  Lowey and allies will seek to turn it
into penalties, just as Lautenberg did in the Senate.  We think our
legislative prospects are good (Chuck thinks it's slightly better than
50-50.)  Kathy's number is 467-6670.
