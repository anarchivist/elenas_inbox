TEXT:
In planning the Editors time at the White House on Wed., March 18th, I
wanted to revisit the Tobacco Issue with you ...... since any articles they
would write as a result will not be published until July or August due to
their publication cycles, do you all believe it is still worth including
Tobacco as an Issue for them? I'm not clear as to the time line you all
are on with Tobacco .... thanks
