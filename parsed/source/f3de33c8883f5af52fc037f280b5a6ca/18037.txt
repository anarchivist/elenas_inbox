FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

        HRC CALLS ON SHALALA TO STAND BY COMMITMENTS TO MAKE
    LIFE-SAVING THERAPIES AVAILABLE TO LOW-INCOME PEOPLE WITH HIV

    Dubs Continued Exclusion of People With HIV a -Moral Outrage'

WASHINGTON - - Responding to rOeports that the Clinton administration has
abandoned attempts to expand Medicaid coverage to low-income people who
are HIV-infected, the Human Rights Campaign labeled the move a "moral
outrage," and called upon Health and Human Services Secretary Donna
Shalala to stand by the commitments of President Clinton and Vice
President Gore to make new life- saving drugs available to people who
cannot afford them.

        An AIDS-specific expansion of the Medicaid program would allow
states to enroll people who are HIV positive, who would otherwise be
excluded from the program until they developed full-blown AIDS. Such an
expansion will save resources because the high costs of hospitalization
and treating opportunistic infections will be curtailed. Vice President
Gore announced his support for such a Medicaid expansion in April and
called on the Health Care Financing Administration to issue a report
within 30 days on such an initiative.

        According to The Washington Post and the Associated Press, the
Health Care Financing Administration, which oversees Medicaid, has
determined that expanding Medicaid to cover low-income people who are
HIV-infected but who are not yet diagnosed with AIDS is too expensive.

        "[S)everal proposals were tested and all were too expensive,
Victor Zonana, a spokesman for the Department of Health and Human


Services, said Thursday," according to the Associated Press.

        "For administration officials to acknowledge that new treatments
administered early in the course of HIV disease save lives, and then fail
to develop programs to make those treatments available is a moral
outrage," said Winnie Stachelberg, political director of the Human Rights
Campaign.

         The administration's own guidelines for the treatment of   HIV
disease, released in June, clearly indicate that early treatment    is
essential. For the administration not to develop a comprehensive    plan to
ensure that these treatments are available to all those who need    them is a
life-threatening contradiction.

        Stachelberg pledged that the Human Rights Campaign, working with
its coalition partners, will continue to press the Clinton administration
to rapidly develop a solution to this problem. "People's lives are at
stake," Stachelberg said. "'Too expensive' is an unacceptable excuse for
not making these treatments available to people who cannot otherwise
afford them."

        The Human Rights Campaign is the largest national lesbian and gay
political organization,. with members throughout the country. It
effectively lobbies Congress, provides campaign support and educates the
public to ensure that lesbian and gay Americans can be open, honest and
safe at home, at work and in the community.
