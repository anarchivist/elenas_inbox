TEXT:
Elena,

I am faxing you the briefing paper prepared by DOJ on whether the INS
should process the Salvadorans, Guatamalans and Eastern Europeans covered
by the recent law under the ususal procedure (immigration court) or under
a more expedited administrative adjudication. As we discussed," the groups
are pushing for a regulation (with presumptions), but we all (DOJ, NSC and
us) favor an administrative adjudication scheme (though, INS more favors
no change to the current process). Maria seems to agree that an admini
strative procedure would be a fair result, but has not yet concluded that
it is the best solution (wants to further consider a regulation) .

I thought you might want to look over an outline of the administratie
scheme before our meeting this afternoon with the advocates (2pm in room
476) . (OPL, NSC, DOJ, INS, us).  Thanks.

julie
