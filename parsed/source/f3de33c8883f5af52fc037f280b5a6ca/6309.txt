 TEXT:
 You should have received (or will shortly) a copy of the Justice testimony
 for the Tuesday (2/10) S. Judiciary hearing on tabacco liability and
 advertising (First Amendment) issues.

 The discussion of the liability issue is similar to the testimony which
 was cleared last week on this issue (all the new sections have been
 marked). The discussion of the advertising issue (pp.1-13) is all new.

 Comments are due to LRD by 4:30pm Today, Monday, February 9th.    If you
 have not received the testimony please call me at ext. 53883.
