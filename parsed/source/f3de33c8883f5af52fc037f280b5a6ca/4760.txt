     Planning Guidance
     We reviewed the revised planning guidance on Friday; it will go out on
     Tuesday. Since DOL made all our changes and since we agreed to allow up to
     one-half of the match be in-kind, the mayors should be quite happy.   (We
     also clarified that private sector match is treated like government
     provided match -- i.e., no limits on cash, in-kind capped at half the
     match. )

     The guidance clarifies the role of the PICs through statements such as the
     following:

     "PICs shall determine on which individuals and activities listed in the
     statutue to expend the WtW funds they receive."

     "Consistent with statutory provisions, the State may not restrict PICs
     from exercising their authority to expend funds on the statutorily
     eligible populations.  PICs, therefore, have authority to determine the
     individuals to be served in the service delivery areas."

     "Consistent with statutory provisions, the State may not restrict PICs
     from exercising their authority to expend funds on the statutorily
     prescribed activities. PICs, therefore, have authority to determine the
     services to be provided in the service delivery area."

     "The PIC for an SDA [service delivery area] has sole authority, in
     coordination with the CEO of the area [the chief elected official, i.e.,
     the mayor], to expend the 85 percent formula funds passed through to the
     local level, in accordance with the requirements of the statute."

     Next Steps

     On Wednesday, DOL will send us their proposed regs.  By statute, we must
     publish them by Nov. 4th.  We are shooting for Oct. 31st.

     Although we won the battle reo the guidance, the regulations will be the
     true war. DOL plans to spell out in the draft regulation something
     glossed over in the guidance: what it means for the statute to say the
     governors shall assure that these funds are coordinated with TANF and what
     sort of fiduciary oversight states have. As you can tell from the quotes
     above, the guidance laid out two things the governors cannot do (tell the
     PIes which individuals to serve and which activities to provide) but it
     did not define what they can do.

     I will examine the draft regs when they arrive.  If we have something to
     fight about, I will talk to Elena about what counter-arguments we can make
     and we will probably need to bring the Dept. of Labor lawyers over here to
     discuss.  I'll keep you posted.
