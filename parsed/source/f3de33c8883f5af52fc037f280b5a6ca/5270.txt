                     INS Restructuring Proposals: Mtg. wi DOJ and INS
                                          Questions:

 Fundamental Mission

 Q.    Why keep enforcement and services together?

 Q.    What doesn't work in the Commission's report?

 Q.    Does the INS proposed refonn cost any money?

 Q.    How does INS presently coordinate with the DOS, DOL (and others)?

 Q.    INS background paper states that they have hired  two   outside management consulting
       finns to assist in developing and validating its reform proposals. Where are they in that
       process? How does that impact what we are doing with the review?

 Enforcement

 Q.    What of the CIR proposal to merge all of INS's law enforcement agents into one unifonn
       service?

 Q.    How is the Reyes bill different from the Commission report with respect to enforcement?
       What is the downside to, as is suggested in the Reyes proposal, keeping services at INS
       while moving enforcement to Main Justice?


 ServiceslNaturalization

. Q.   What is wrong (or wouldn't work) with the DOS handling naturalization (immigration,
       refugee and citizenship)?

       a.      Does this "send a message" that legal immigration and naturalization are not
               principally law enforcement problems?

       b.      What additional infrastructure would be needed for State to handle these
               additional responsibilities?

       c.      Since most services are fee-based, would there be any increased costs associated
               with shifting this function to State?

       d.      Would this conflict with the State Department's fundamental mission in any way?


 Workplace
                                                                    I lex-Dump Conversion

Q.    What is wrong (or wouldn't work) with the DOL handling work-place enforcement?

Q.    Isn't there overlap with the current system?

Q.    Would INS's reform proposal make changes in this area?


Immigration Hearings/Review

Q.    What is the JusticelINS position on making Executive Office of Immigration Review
      (EOIR) an independent agency that would handle all appeals from administrative
      determinations?

Q.    What are the benefits of allowing the Attorney General to have review of certain
      immigration decisions?
                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion

                          INS Restructuring Proposals: Mtg. wI DOJ and INS
                                General Overview of Proposed Refonns

     Commission on Immigration Reform recommends:
     1.   Bureau for Immigration Enforcement at DOJ -- Border and interior enforcement.

     2.     DOL -- Enforcement of immigration-related employment standards (expand its
            enforcement role by verifying employer compliance with laws requiring employers to hire
            only legal aliens).

     3.     DOS -- Adjudication of immigration (visa and benefit functions) and naturalization
            applications.

     4.     Agency for Immigration Review -- Consolidation of immigration appeals.

     CIR Commissioner Warren Leiden recommends:
     Two main functions of INS -- enforcement (border and labor) and adjudication (of immigration
     and naturalization applications)-- should be separated into two different agencies w/in the DOJ,
     with separate leadership.

     Each agency with separate mission, career paths, training, and management, while still
     benefitting from policy and strategic coordination at senior department level.

     Reyes Bill:
     Pulling enforcement out of INS and into Main DOJ. Bolsters visibility of Border Patrol.
     Maintains services within current INS structure.
