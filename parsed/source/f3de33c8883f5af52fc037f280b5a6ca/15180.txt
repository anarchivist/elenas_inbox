                                   President Clinton Acts to
                               Expand Family and Medical Leave
                                    for Federal Employees
                                        April 12, 1997


·   Today, President Clinton asked Federal agencies to expand Family and Medical Leave Act
    benefits for Federal Employees. In September, 1996 President Clinton proposed legislation to
    expand the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) to allow workers to take unpaid hours off --
    up to 24 hours a year -- for child education, older relatives' health needs, and routine family
    medical purposes. Today President Clinton asked Federal agencies to implement this expanded
    leave policy immediately for Federal workers.

·   Federal workers could schedule up to 24 hours to help care for their children and parents.
     The President asked agencies to ensure employees can schedule and be granted up to 24 hours
    of paid or unpaid leave for the following activities:

     ·       School and early childhood education activities -- to allow employees to participate
             in school activities directly related to the educational advancement of a child,
             including educational activities related to child care, Head Start programs, elementary
             school and secondary school. For example, parents could use leave to attend
             parent-teacher conferences or meetings with child care providers, or to interview for a
             new school or child care facility.

     ·       Routine family medical purposes -- to allow parents to accompany children to
             routine medical or dental appointments, such as annual checkups or vaccinations.

     ·       Elderly relatives' health needs -- to allow employees to accompany an elderly
             relative to routine medical appointments or other professional services related to the
             care of the elderly relative, such as making arrangements for housing, meals, phones,
             banking services, and other similar activities.

·    The President called on Congress to pass his legislation expanding the Family and
     Medical Leave Act for all workers. The FMLA currently allows workers to care for a
     newborn or adopted child, to attend to their own serious health needs, or to care for a
     seriously ill parent, child, or spouse. The President urged Congress to pass his legislation·
     expanding the FMLA to cover school and early childhood education activities, routine family
     medical care, and additional activities related to caring for an elderly relative.

·    Expanding the Family and Medical Leave Act will help Children ages zero to three..·
