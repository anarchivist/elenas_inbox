TEXT:
Elena,
I just spoke with Peter reo Hill developments and INS reform.   He thinks
that we need to develop an executive summary that describes the
Administration's proposal. This document would also include a summary of
how our proposal will address Congress's concerns -- essentially, how our
proposal will do everything better (services and enforcement) and how the
CIR proposal won't.  Peter would want to use this document to shop our
proposal around the Hill.  He is anxious to get it early next week, to
give him enough lead time prior to Doris's testimony on the 31st. We
could create this by building off of the POTUS memo and the Booz Allen
final report (which we were supposed to have had by Tuesday -- I put in a
call to INS).  Should Leanne and I take a stab?

Also, Peter spoke with Abraham's staff. They are not on a super-fast track
with their legislation -- they indicated that they wanted to speak with
Kennedy's people before moving forward.  They described their bill as a
"discussion piece" to get movement on the issue. They did, however, ask
Peter what our rxn would be to a bill that raised the cap, but did nothing
else.  Peter told them that we would object.

Julie
