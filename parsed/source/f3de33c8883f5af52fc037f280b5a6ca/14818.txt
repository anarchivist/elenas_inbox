TEXT:
Here is what I have found out about the Defense schools in relation to
North Carolina:

1. In general, the overseas and stateside schools are good, and they are
doing things world-wide (though not necessarily in NC, that could be
pointed to as models. Chief among these are: (1) technology--getting all
schools wired by 1998; (2) translating national math standards into
classroom curriculum; (3) school report cards and accountability.   They
are also beginning to talk about providing incentives for teachers to
undergo National Board for Professional Teaching Standards certification,
though this effort will look weak in comparison to Gov. Hunt's proposal in
NC.

2. The Defense schools, especially stateside, are basically invisible
according to the Defense people.  They operate below the radar screen,
have tremendous difficult getting any attention, and feel that most of
America, including almost all of the education community, doesn't even
know they exist.

3. There are several potential downsides to a defense schools announcement
from their point of view:

The school at camp Legune (sp???) is in a terrible state of disrepair,
especially with leaking roofs. There is a plan to fix it, but, in the
meantime, their comment was "I wouldn't want the President to visit while
it was raining without an umbrella."   Not exactly a strong endorsement
for the notion that these are model schools.
The Defense Department is working on a congressionally mandated study of
the desirability of turning stateside defense schools over to local school
systems, and getting Defense out of that business.  The report is at least
6 months late, and will not be competed until June at the earliest. The
head of the defense schools did not know the original impetus for this
study, and no one from the hill has been bugging them for the report.   The
Department apparantly has not yet taken a position on this, though mil
itary families and leadership believe that the defense schools are
generally superior to neighboring schools and will want to keep the
current situation. So will neighboring local school boards, who will not
want to get more students and no additional tax base.
April is the "Month of the Military Child" and would provide an additional


opportunity for this message if we did not make an announcement in North
Carolina.
Marsha Hale was to call Hunt's staff; as of late afternoon she had not
done so, and I do not yet know if Hunt is on board with our testing
proposal, or what he might think of this announcement overall. As we have
discussed, it would be awkward to announce Defense participation if we
don't get North Carolina's.

Finally, I've attached a couple of pages of suggestions from ED about how
we might approach the teaching portion of this speech, since Hunt's main
education proposals before the legislature center on improving teaching.
The centerpiece of Hunt's plan is a call for a 13% salary increase for
master teachers -- teachers who receive National Board for Professional
Teaching Standards certification -- as a concrete way to reward excellent
teachers. The President could challenge every state to take similar steps.

                                    High Standards for Teachers

The President's speech to the North Carolina legislature provides an ideal opportunity to outline his
vision and plan for rewarding good teachers, getting incompetent or burnt-out teachers out of the
classroom, and for getting talented and dedicated teachers into every classroom in America. The
major announcement would be calling on state legislatures around the country to enact major pay
incentives for master teachers who become certified by the National Board (such as the 12% bonus
Governor Hunt has proposed to the North Carolina legislature), and explaining how the President's
budget will help set this new national standard of excellence in teaching -- a standard which has
already gained wide, bipartisan acceptance.

But the President can also use this announcement to stipulate that our students will not reach national
standards without outstanding teachers, and to layout -- in greater depth than he has so far -- his
vision for raising teacher quality. The President can issue an appeal to honor and reward good
teachers while refusing to tolerate failing teachers, challenge talented young people and other
mid-career professionals to enter into teaching and give them the highest-quality preparation, and
speak directly to parents and grandparents, asking them not to discourage their young family members
from going into what will be the noblest and most important career of the information age. With 2
million teachers to be hired in the next ten years, the President can challenge the nation to
immediately establish policies and an ethic for the teaching profession that will affect the quality of
our children's education for decades.

For three reasons, the address to the North Carolina legislature will be an ideal opportunity for
the President to focus on teacher quality. First, Governor Hunt has been spearheading a state and
national effort to focus on raising teacher quality, providing a sensible context for the President to
applaud Hunt's work in North Carolina, cite Hunt's proposal to provide a 12% bonus (serious $) to
national board-certified "master teachers" as the basis for a national challenge, and describe the
President's vision in context of a hard-hitting report on teaching released last fall by a bipartisan
commission co-chaired by Hunt. Last week's announcement that North Carolina had the nation's
largest increase in math scores can underscore the effectiveness of focusing on good teaching.

Second, a presidential focus on high standards for teaching is a natural immediate next step after
addresses on challenging standards and tests for students. The public intuitively understands that the
key to raising standards is good teachers, and the President can use this address to help show how to
address this challenge. Timing is also ideal, coming the day after a North Carolina meeting on
teaching that can foreshadow and generate interest in the President's speech. That meeting will be
televised to educators around the state, and will include Governor Hunt, teachers, university leaders,
and -- by satellite, at 4pm the day before the President's address -- Secretary Riley.

Third, the national board teaching standards -- championed by Hunt -- provide the best possible
concrete illustration of how the President and his budget will help make high standards for teachers
real. The President's budget contains $100 million over 5 years to help the national board complete
its assessments in all major academic areas, and to provide seed money to help teachers undergo the
board's intensive review. The board already has bipartisan endorsements from such leaders as Hunt
and Voinavich, and unusual support from education groups who have traditionally opposed efforts to
distinguish among teachers at different levels of quality.
Components of announcements/ major policy address on teaching standards:
                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion

Call on state legislatures around the country to enact major pay incentives for master teachers
who become certified by the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards (such as the
12% bonus Governor Hunt has proposed to the North Carolina legislature).

Explain how the President's $100 million budget will help set this new national standard of
excellence in teaching -- i.e., support for completion of teacher assessments in all academic
areas and seed capital for master teachers to undergo an intensive board review, leading to a
master teacher for every school in the nation within 10 years. Call on Congress to enact this
budget.

Invite "our nation's best teachers" -- the 50 state teachers-of-the-year and others -- to the
White House South Lawn for a celebration of good teaching and announcement of the new
national teacher-of-the-year during the week of April 15th (The scheduling office confirmed
today that this event will take place, but it has not yet been made public). Call for a national
day of recognition that day for America's best teachers.

Announce details of a national forum on recruiting and preparing teachers to take place the
day after the White House event. This forum will provide an opportunity for 50
teachers-of-the-year to discuss with higher education leaders how to do a better job at
recruiting and preparing the highest quality teachers. Also announce opportunity for
communities around the country to participate in the event by satellite, and to organize local
discussions with their best teachers and university leaders about how to recruit and prepare
outstanding teachers. (USA Today and other papers gave considerable coverage to the
Secretary's announcement of this forum last month, but no details have yet been made
public.)

Challenge talented young people and mid-career professionals to go into teaching. Speak
directly to parents and grandparents, asking them not to discourage young people from
entering teaching.

Announce national forum that would take place later in the year on rewarding good teachers
and weeding out those teachers who are incompetent or burnt-out.

Issue broad new challenge such as calling on states and communities to raise teacher salaries
generally, or to offer tax incentives for young people who teach in high-need areas.
Alternatively, challenge school districts and teacher unions to examine their contracts and fmd
new ways to reward good teachers and weed out incompetent or burnt-out teachers quickly,
fairly, and less expensively.
