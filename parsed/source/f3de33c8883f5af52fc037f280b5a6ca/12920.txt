PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
REMARKS ON MOVIE RATINGS ENFORCEMENT
THE ROOSEVELT ROOM
June 8, 1999

Now, I hope it wonD,t confuse anybody when I say that I just met with
representatives of NATO and we talked about the movies.

1D,m referring, of course, to a somewhat different D&NATOD8 than usual 0) the
National Association of Theatre Owners.  We did have a very good
discussion.  I spoke with NATO President Bill Kartozian and his colleagues
about the ways creative and committed people are worki~g together to
prevent youth violence, and the ways the theatre industry in particular is
stepping up to its responsibility.

        It was not even two months ago that the tragedy at Columbine High
School seared itself into our national consciousness.  But ever since that
day we have, I think, moved surely and steadily toward the kind of future
we want for our country.  People from all walks of life are coming
together in a national grassroots campaign to prevent youth violence and
to give our young people the safe childhoods they deserve.

        We all know that parents are the first and most important
influence on a child.  But we also know that the demands on parents are


increasing. As more and more parents work outside the home, they have
less and less time for their children.  Parents in the average family now
have 22 fewer hours each week to spend at home than parents did a
generation ago.

        since my first days as President we have worked hard to help
parents balance home and work.  One of the ways weO,ve done that is by
giving parents better tools to make immediate but informed judgments 0)
about the shows their kids watch, the music they hear, and the video games
they play. We have worked hard to give parents new tools like the V-Chip,
which, by the end of next month, will be in half the new television sets
sold in America, and will help parents block violent programming from
their living rooms. WeO,ve also made progress on parental screening for
the Internet and ratings for Internet game sites.

        But we must do more.  We must ensure that children are not targets
in the marketing of violence. That is why, last week, I asked the
Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission to study the extent
to which the video game, music and movie industries market violence to
children 0) and whether those industries are abiding by their own voluntary
systems of regulation.

For ratings systems to work, they must be enforced. Not just by watchful
parents, but by retailers at the point of sale, and theatre owners at the
multiplex.  The great thing about the multiplex is that thereO,s a movie
for every member of the family.   But not every movie is for every member
of the family.   When you drop them off at the theatre, you shouldnO,t have
to worry that your 0&G08-rated kids are getting into violent or suggestive 0&
R08-rated movies.   Still, too often, children get past the ticket counter 0)
unescorted and underage.

I am pleased to announce that today, we are drawing the line.  The nationD,
s largest group of theatre owners has agreed to ask young people for IDs
at 0&R08-rated movies.  From now on, parents will know that the 0&R08 rating
means what it is supposed to mean: 0&Restricted.08 No one under 17 gets in
without a parent or guardian. No exceptions.

Last month, when I challenged theatre owners to step up to their
responsibility, I could only have hoped they would respond so quickly.  I
want to applaud Bill Kartozian [kar-TOE-zhan] and his organization for
doing their part.  [I also want to thank Senators Hatch and Leahy for the
work they have done on this issue.]  Everyone of us has something to
contribute.

The Congress, too, must step up to its responsibility 0) for the sake and
the safety of our children. This week, the House will take up important
legislation, already passed by the Senate, to help prevent youth
violence. This includes common-sense measures that close the deadly
gun-show loophole; require that safety locks be sold with every handgun;
ban the importation of large-capacity ammunition clips; and ban violent
juveniles from owning guns as adults.  I strongly urge the House not to
riddle this legislation with loopholes, but to pass it into law, and to
pass it without delay.

I hope Congress will follow the lead of these theatre owners.  In our
growing national campaign to prevent youth violence, none of us can stand
aside, and none of us should stand in the way. Our national campaign is
gathering members and gaining momentum.  And in the weeks and months
ahead, I believe we will continue to move forward as one nation, striving
together to build a better future for all our children. Thank you.

    Now, IO,d like to introduce Bill Kartozian to tell us more about the steps
    that theatre owners have agreed to take.
