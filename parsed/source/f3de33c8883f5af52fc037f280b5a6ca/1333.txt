TEXT:
Can we sit down for a bit later today? Pauline and I plan to send to HRC
by COB today an overview of where we are on the Conference and present a
list of questions and outstanding issues, including Reiner issues, etc. --
would love your input before that, but, as you know, she leaves for Africa
on Saturday so we really need to get her to focus before tonight.  Thanks.
