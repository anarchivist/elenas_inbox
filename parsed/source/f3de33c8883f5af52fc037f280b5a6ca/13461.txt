      This rises to the level of legislative violence against women.
      Maybe we should hold *citizen* hearings on Canady's committee?

 Subject: CONGRESS

 When we start to get complacent about getting involved in politics,
 remember this, and WRITE CONGRESS, RAISE MONEY, WORK IN CAMPAIGNS, AND
 VOTE THESE VICIOUS IDIOTS OUT OF OFFICE.

 This week, there was a special hearing held to entertain anti-abortion
 anesthesiologists who claim those who oppose the D&X ban have lied about
 the fact that anesthetic causes fetal demise prior to D&x.   (Note that
 physicians who use this procedure in fact often use digoxin, injected into
 the fetus itself, causing fetal demise before D&x.)

 A member of NAF observed the hearing, and wrote the following account of
 what she observed.  I think this should motivate us all to contact our
 reps. and let them know what we think.



 From: naf@prochoice.org (National Abortion Federation)

 Today's hearing in the House Judiciary Committee's subcommittee on the
 Constitution on H.R. l833 and the ridiculous smokescreen anesthesia issue
 was a true travesty.  Two patients had flown thousands of miles
 (Mary-Dorothy Line from Chicago and Coreen Costello, who is seven months
 pregnant and scared to death of flying, from California) to testify.   The
 hearing dragged on with the first two panels. When it came time for the
 patients to testify, Congressman Charles Canady (R-FL), the bill's sponsor
 and subcommittee chair, said that they would adjourn for two hours because
 they had to go vote.  Congresswoman Pat Schroeder (D-CO) was appalled and
 pointed out that there was no vote. Canady insisted on adjourning -- for
 the obvious reason that he wanted the press to go home without hearing the
 women testify.

 When they returned and the women were allowed to testify, Canady broke the
 testimony up by insisting on taking another break for yet another
 nonexistent vote.   (You can always tell if there is a vote in Congress;
 there is a bell and buzzer system.) He cut Coreen Costello off and told
 her her time was up; Pat Schroeder yielded her time to Coreen but Canady
 still kept trying to cut her off. Both Coreen and Mary-Dorothy were
 wonderful, providing moving testimony and not giving any ground to the
 antis. They fought back, taking on the anti-choice members' falsehoods
 and deception during the question-and-answer period. Core en , when cut off
 by Canady, said fiercely that she had flown all the way from California
 even at seven months pregnant, scared to death of flying, because she
 wanted to tell the truth and she couldn't believe they didn't want to hear
 the truth.  Coreen, by the way, is from a staunch Republican family and
·
    was always very anti-abortion. She has been horrified at the behavior of
    the Republicans in these hearings.

    Particularly hateful was Congressman Bob Inglis (D-SC), who, as he had in
    the original markup of the bill, accused the women of being
    "exterminators" who hate children.  (Coreen has two kids already and will
    have her third in June; Mary-Dorothy is expecting her first child in
    September. )

    Congresswoman Schroeder was so upset by the outrageous behavior and
    manipulation of Canady and his cohorts that she literally had to move the
    microphone away as she was brought to tears.   She said that she was happy
    to be leaving Congress if this was what the House of Representatives had
    deteriorated into, and that she was ashamed to be a Member of Congress if
    this was the way women were treated.   "A witch hunt," she called it.  Even
    Canady and Hyde were stunned into silence by Schroeder's condemnation, but
    Inglis didn't shut up even then.

    It's ugly up here, folks.  The House will vote on the Senate-passed
    version of H.R. 1833 next week. We know it will pass, of course, and then
    go to the President, but we would like to win back some of the usually
    pro-choice or squishy Members who were swayed by the propaganda to vote
    against the bill the second time.  They had a veto-proof majority in the
    House the first time (though not in the Senate); let's give Clinton a
    little more reinforcement so that his spine doesn't give way on this one.
    Members who need calls:

    Charlie Rose (D-NC)
    Blanche Lambert Lincoln (D-AR)
    Jim Moran (D-VA)
    Patrick Kennedy (D-RI)
    Jim Traficant (D-OH)
    Rick Lazio (R-NY)
    Marcy Kaptur (D-OH)
    Susan Molinari (R-NY)
    Bill Zeliff (R-NH)

    Obviously, you should call your members regardless of whether they're on
    this list or not and tell them to vote against'the bill.

    By the way, does anyone know who, if anyone, is running against Canady and
    against Inglis this year?

    Sorry for the long post but I thought everyone should know about the
    unbelievable behavior that just went on.  People at the hearing were
    saying they had never seen things get quite this bad in terms of abuse of
    power.
