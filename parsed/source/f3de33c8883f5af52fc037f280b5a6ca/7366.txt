 "McCaffrey Vows No Free Needles"
 Washington Times (04/29/98) P. AI; Bedard, Paul
      Gen. Barry McCaffrey, the White House drug policy director,
 asserted Tuesday that the government will never fund
 needle-exchange programs, and he disagreed with studies showing
 that the programs reduce the spread of HIV and curb drug use.   He
 said that he had convinced President Clinton that studies
 supporting needle-exchanges were incomplete and that more
 research on the matter is required.  The administration recently
 announced that it supports the scientific evidence that
 needle-exchange programs help reduce the spread of HIV and do not
 encourage drug use, but said it will not allow federal money to
 be used by the programs. Washington, D.C. Delegate Eleanor
 Holmes Norton, chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, and
 Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) last week called for the
 resignation of McCaffrey. McCaffrey replied that he would be
 responsive to the concerns of some caucus members, but that he
 would "try to defend it [his decision] and make sure [he is]
"sensitive to the threats of the black community." McCaffrey
 contends that the government should first focus on drug policy
 and treatment.  He claims that while the programs may reduce the
 HIV incidence, there are associated problems with the exchanges
 to be dealt with, including increased crime in the program areas.
