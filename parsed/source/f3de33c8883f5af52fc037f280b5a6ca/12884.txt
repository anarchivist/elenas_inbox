 TEXT:
 Here is an excellent memo from Jim K on the Sanders piece. In addition,
 you all may wish to consider this issue in a broader context of how
 electronic commer'ce/lnternet can affect democratic institutions. There is
,a joint Canadian/American industry effort underway (to be announced in 3
 weeks) to look at these issues.

You gave me a copy of the Bernie Sanders letter on a National Commission
on Voter Turnout.  I think its an interesting idea, but a commission does
punt the issue down the road.  There are two things that we are doing now
that we can point to:

In order to reconnect our citizens to the political process, we need to
connect them to the voting booth. That means two things 1) using the
Department of Defense's pilot project where they are allowing the 6
million eligible American citizens living abroad to vote electronically
for the first time, to spin off new technologies to states, and 2)
encouraging same day registration electronically.  Same day registration
is something that a commission could look at -- registration remains one
of the biggest barriers to voting.  Currently there are web sites that
allow you to fill out a form on line, the fill out the form and mail it to
you for signature. The motor voter law we signed started us down the road
of easier registration, but now we could finish the job.  For electronic
voting, DOD has to resolve issues of security, authentication, and privacy
and get more states to buy in. Right now their pilot, known as the
Federal voting Assistance Program, only deals with people voting in
Missouri, Utah and ,Florida. But the technologies they develop are very
'.

     relevant.

     Voter Apathy. The other problem is that all people get is 8 second
     soundbites on the news and 30 second ads.  That is why we need 5 minutes a
     night of Free Time for better public discourse.

     It might be interesting to appoint a commission with a specific set of
     ideas to explore. There is obviously nothing you can doe for the 2000
     elections, but it might fit well our campaign finance reform ideas since
     we will continue to be attacked there -- and we can talk about reforming
     the entire election process, from finance to voting.
