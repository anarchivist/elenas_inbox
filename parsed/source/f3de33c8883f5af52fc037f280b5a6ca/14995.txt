TEXT:
No problem talking to DOJ about policy and strategy as long as we're not
talking about an action against a specific company.  So o.k. to ask if we
should sue industry to recover Medicaid costs; to discuss potential
statements responding to pending decision on FDA rule; to talk to DoJ
about advertising on internet (but not FCC); etc.

Thanks Cheryl; please correct me if I'm wrong.
