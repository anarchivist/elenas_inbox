TEXT:
The Department of Justice has asked that, for the time being, NO
CALLS be made to people today regarding the pleadings expected to
be filed today.
The Solicitor General has instructed Justice attorneys to reframe
the nature of the pleadings. From our perspective, this is
largely a matter of terminology.  Justice remains on exactly the
same substantive course we discussed yesterday.  But, from the
perspective of the Solicitor General, the district court, and the
Justice attorneys, this is a very important matter. We have been
asked to ask you to make no public statements and to do what you


can to make sure others make no public statements regarding these
pleadings.
The Department of Justice is providing comments on the second
draft of the proposed statement. When received, we will
recirculate to all of you. We expect that this draft will be
cleared for release later today. We simply do not have that
clearance now.
Thank you for your cooperation.
