                            December 30, 1997


MEMORANDUM FOR ALL STAFF OF THE EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT

FROM:           CHARLES F. C. RUFF
                COUNSEL TO THE PRESIDENT

                SALLY P. PAXTON
                SPECIAL ASSOCIATE COUNSEL TO THE PRESIDENT

SUBJECT:         REQUEST FOR DOCUMENTS

We have received Congressional subpoenas for documents from the House
Government
Reform Committee which relate to the White House Office Database ("whoDB")
and
other matters.  Every employee is responsible for searching all of his or
her
own White House records for materials (whether in hard copy, computer or
any
other form) to ensure a comprehensive search.

The head of each office must also provide a signed certification that all
staff
within that office have searched their records and provided copies of any
responsive materials in their possession. Additionally, the Counsel's
Office
has been working with the staff of the Office of Records Management to
find
responsive material located in storage.  If you believe materials that you
have
sent to Records Management may contain responsive information, please let
us
know so that we can ensure that all responsive materials are found.

In responding to the following requests, "EOP" includes any person
employed by
or assigned to any office of the Executive Office of the President,
including
the White House.  "Malone" includes W.P. Malone, Inc. or Percy Malone.

REQUESTS:

           1.   All materials reflecting involvement or communications by
EOP
                personnel, from January 20, 1993 through the present,
regarding
                any database implemented or discussed, contemplated or
planned


                 to be implemented, by or on behalf of Clinton/Gore, the
 DNC, or
                 any Clinton Presidential campaign entity, for the purpose
 of
                 maintaining any list of, or information about, supporters
 or
                 contributors.

           2.    All materials reflecting contracts or terms of contracts
                 (including "use agreements"), whether in draft or final,
 between
                 the EOP and any vendor, the DNC, Clinton/Gore or any other
 party
                 with respect to the 1993, 1994, 1995 or 1996 White House
 holiday
                 cards.

           3.    All materials reflecting any restrictions on the use by
 either
                 the DNC or Clinton/Gore of information contained in any
 White
                 House database.

         4.      All materials relating to PeopleBase.     This request
 includes any
                 documents, whether in draft or in final, which reflect any
                 agreements between either (1) the EOP and Malone, or (2)
                 Clinton/Gore and Malone.

           5.    All materials which reflect the non-disclosure statement
 between
