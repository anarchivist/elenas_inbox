Here are the Treasury Enforcement requests:

1. ATF -- Total appeal of $29.325 million. Half of this $14.232 is for
Brady/YCGII -- our priority -- and the remainder is for a series of other
ATF enhancement, including $6 million for tobacco compliance, $6 million
for their crime lab, etc. This should be a big priority for us.

2. Money L~undering -- $29.4 million for a Custom's money laundering
initiative.  I'm not sure of the details, but they claim it's for efforts
like Casablanca and to develop a National Anti-Money Laundering Strategy,
as required by legislation signed into law this year.

3.  Drugs -- $62.628 million for Custom's drug and border enforcement,
including new agents, inspectors and x-ray machines along the border.
McCaffrey should be pushing for this, too.

4.  Counterfeiting -- $13.616 for the Secret Service to acquire advanced
technologies to help them fight high-tech counterfeiters and identity
theft.  Identity theft is an up and coming issue. We signed legislation
on it this year.

5. Cybersmuggling/Child Porn -- $8 million for Customs to hire more
agents and computer specialists to crack down on the "cybersrTIuggling" of
child porn into the country. Their successful cases in this area have
received lots of press attention.
