TEXT:
Yesterday afternoon I got a report from Perrelli on what their antitrust
division is doing to follow up with the state AGs. They've reached out to
Gregoire et. al. Not much is happening now because of vacation schedues.
DOJ is planning to outline some general parameters to the AGs, and then
ask them to come back to them with any specific proposals they could
evaluate.  I pushed Perrelli about couldn't they do more to help the AGs
come up with a creative solution, but he pushed back saying 1) there
probably isn't one that's permissible -- the tobacco companies are just
going to have to live with the risk of having the small companies undercut
them and 2) they don't think it would be appropriate to deviate from
standard procedure, which involves evaluating proposals brought to them.
