TEXT:
The new interns have arrived! We have a mixture of part-time and full-time
interns this semester, and they are ready to make our lives around here a little
easier/less frenzied.  If you see a new (and young) face around our offices,


please introduce yourself. And if you need any help today, or anytime, please
call me at 6-6229. Thanks.
