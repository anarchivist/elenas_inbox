HEADLINE: UPI Focus) Court looks at the future of tobacco

BYLINE: BY MICHAEL KIRKLAND .

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 26

BODY:
    The Supreme Court says it will argument next term on the authority of the
Food and Drug Administration to regulate tobacco as a drug. Industry officials
warned last week that regulating tobacco as a drug -- something a lower court
has blocked -- would ultimately lead to the banning of their product. According
to the Justice Department, which asked the Supreme Court to hear the case, the
FDA considered banning tobacco when it first tried to regulate the product in
1996. But the agency rejected a ban because "the sudden withdrawal from the
market of products to which so many millions of people are addicted would be
dangerous." The agency also feared the effects of a black market. Industry
officials argued last week that even if the FDA doesn't want to ban tobacco
immediately, provisions of existing law might compel the agency to ban it as a
drug without therapeutic value or as "an unsafe medical device." And even if
the FDA disagrees with that interpretation, the officials said, regulation would
open the way for an immediate private lawsuit by anti-tobacco activists to force
a ban in compliance with federal law. In a petition to the Supreme Court, the
Justice Department said tobacco-related diseases kill more than 400,000 people
each year, "more than AIDS, alcohol, car accidents, homicides, suicides,
illegal drugs and fires combined." President Clinton first announced FDA
regulation of tobacco in 1996. The regulation relied on the 1938 Food, Drug and
Cosmetic Act, which expanded the legal definition of a "drug" to include
non-food "articles intended to affect the structure or any function of the body
of man or other animals. The act also authorized the FDA to regulate
"devices" as well as drugs. A device is defined as the method by which a drug
is introduced into the body. The Justice Department said the FDA conducted an
extensive study before the 1996 regulation, determining that tobacco causes
nicotine addiction. The study also found that tobacco companies manipulated the
nicotine content of their cigarettes, and that tobacco use is a "pediatric
                                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion

disease" acquired before someone is an adult. Ifsomeone doesn't smoke as a
teenager, the study determined, he or she is unlikely to smoke as an adult. The
regulation prohibited the sale of tobacco anywhere to those under 18, required
retailers to check the identification of those under 27 and banned vending
machines and self-service displays of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco outside
of adult-only locations. The regulation also required that all tobacco
advertisements appear in black and white, text-only format, except in adult-only
publications and facilities; no outdoor ads within 1,000 feet of a school or
playground; no sale or distribution of hats, T-shirts and other non- tobacco
products that bear a tobacco product brand name or logo, and finally, no
tobacco-brand name sponsorship of events, such as sports or cultural gatherings.
The major tobacco companies filed suit against the regulation in federal court
in the tobacco-growing area of Greensboro, N.C. Though a federal judge ruled
for the FDA, an appeals court panel reversed, blocking all the regulations
except for age limits on sales. The Clinton administration then asked the
Supreme Court for review. But lawyers for the tobacco industry 'had urged the
justices to let the appeals court ruling stand, saying the 1938 law, enacted
five years after the end of Prohibition, was not intended to let the FDA
"institute a new Prohibition." Argument in the case, though not yet scheduled,
should be heard next winter unless either side asks the Supreme Court for an
expedited process. (No. 98-1152, FDA et al vs. Brown and Williamson et al)
