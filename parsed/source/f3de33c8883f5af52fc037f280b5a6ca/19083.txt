Elena,
Attached is a revised draft of the POTUS statement reo H1B.  It may still
be a little long, but could be shortened more by eliminating the detail on
training and reforms.  Peter tells me that Kennedy is making his statement
on Wed., so I assume that is our target date for getting this done.   Ceci
is also sharing this draft with Sally. Thanks.

Julie

The President supports efforts in the Congress to develop a comprehensive legislative package to
address the increasing demand for skilled workers in industries where there has been substantial
job growth -- including the information technology (IT) industry. In the short term, we may need
to temporarily increase the number of temporary visas for foreign workers. However, this effort
must be combined with both a reform of the HI B visa program and a concerted effort --
including commitments from both government and industry -- to find, place, educate and train
U.S. workers for these high-growth and high-wage jobs.

Investing in training and education is the critical strategy to sustain our economic growth and
make sure that all of our people benefit from this growth. Key components of this strategy are
our HOPE Scholarships, the Lifetime Learning Tuition Credit, the expansion of Pell Grants, and
the extension and expansion of Section 127 (that excludes employer-paid tuition assistance from
income). This is also why it is critical that Congress pass the G.I. Bill for America's Workers
this Spring.

The other essential component to ensuring an adequate supply of skilled workers to meet industry
needs is reform of the current H 1B visa program. Since 1993, this Administration has sought
reforms of the HIB program, such as requiring employers to "recruit and retain" U.S. workers
before hiring temporary foreign workers, prohibiting lay-offs of U.S. workers to replace them
with foreign temporary workers, and reducing the maximum stay for HI B workers from 6 to 3
years. These reforms, if enacted, would help to target HI B usage to industries and employers
that are exhibiting genuine labor shortages.

The nation's immigration system is not the solution for widespread U.S. skill shortages. We
need to redouble our efforts -- through education and training for both new workers and those
who wish to upgrade their skills -- to ensure that U.S. workers are prepared to meet the demands
of our rapidly changing economy.
