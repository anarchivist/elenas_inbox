  Elena -

  I would like to follow up with you on the Immigration meeting and to try
  to explain what I have been doing these last 4 weeks and why I hesitated
  about the schedule of meetings over the next two weeks.

  First,  I want you to know that I am fully committed to this job and know
  that I am capable of doing a good job but I know that I can and should do
  better. During the last 4-1/2 weeks in addition to learning new systems,
  meeting and calling key staff, and learning many new issues,  I have been
  working to develop policies; to identify issues that require policy
  development; to hold meetings; do research; etc. but certainly I could
  have done more and I will do more and stay on top of policy issues in my
  area.   For the upcoming meetings on immigration proposals, I will prepare
  a document that outlines policy proposals on NACARA, Late Amnesty, and
  Criminal Detention. On battered immigrants, I succeeded in convincing DOJ
  to include battered immigrant provisions in the crime bill and I am


negotiating with them which proposals will be in the bill.

The reason I hesitated about the schedule of the meetings over the next
two weeks is that I will be on leave.  I had discussed this with Bruce
when I arrived and had sent both of you a reminder e-mail earlier today.
I apologize if this a surprise to you and for the problems that this
causes but as I mentioned earlier, I will do everything I can to prepare
materials for the upcoming meetings and when I return I will do more to
stay on top of policy issues in my area.

You and I are scheduled to meet on Friday at 2 pm.  If you have time to
speak to night, I will be in my office all evening.

Thank you.

    Irene
