TEXT:
Mary Smith sent a draft letter to you for clearance addressed to Sen.
McCain regarding the concern involving Indian tribal sovereignty and the
collection of state taxes. Would you please give me a status report.  Lynn
Cutler and I are meeting with a number of Tribal chairs and others at Ipm
tomorrow (you, and Sylvia have been invited) and we will certainly be
asked for our support to prevent any real or perceived errosion of tribal
sovereinty. IGA feels strongly that we need to lay down an early marker
that once again the President is on the side of the Native American
Community on this issue. Thanks.
