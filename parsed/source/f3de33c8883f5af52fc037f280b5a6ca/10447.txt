SUBJECT:                DPC Weekly Report


        Health Care -- Meeting with Senator Kennedy on· next year's budget: On
Monday, you are scheduled to meet with Senator Kennedy to discuss the FY2000 budget.
He will undoubtably raise a range of issues, including his health priorities. He will thank
you for your advocacy for a strong Patients Bill of Rights as well as for your positive
remarks on behalf of the Jeffords-Kennedy Work Incentives Improvement Act. Beyond
indicating that he believes that both bills have a very real chance of passage this year, he
will lobby hard for you to use tobacco funds for a new Medicare prescription drug benefit.
Depending on how such a benefit is designed, it would likely cost between 5 and 15 billion
dollars a year, funding we currently cannot envision in the context of this year's budget.
Having said this, we do believe that a prescription drug benefit is an essential component
of any substantive reform of the Medicare program. Because we cannot fund a drug
benefit with currently available resources, you could offer to work with his staff to begin to
review options and indicate your desire to find a way to address this shortcoming of the
program. You may want to use this opportunity to highlight another aging priority -- our
long term care initiative -- and advise him that you are interested in working with him on
that as well.

    Education -- Scholarships for Teachers: In our budget discussion you requested
information about our scholarship program to help recruit new teachers to teach in
high poverty areas. The teacher recruitment program is part of a Teacher Quality
and Recruitment program in the newly enacted Higher Education Act, which also
provides grants to partnerships between school districts and institutions of higher
education to improve teacher education, and to states to help raise teacher licensure
standards and for other related purposes. The teacher recruitment program
receives 10% of the appropriation for the entire program, ($75 million in FY1999)
and funds approximately 1,400 scholarships.

        Welfare -- IRS Notice on Workfare and Taxes: The IRS this week issued a
long-awaited notice clarifying that welfare recipients who participate in workfare programs
do not need to pay income taxes or payroll (FICA) taxes. This clarification will make it
easier for state and. local governments to operate workfare programs, because it makes clear

that the state and local governments or their contractors employing these workfare
participants do not need to pay the employer's share of FICA taxes. As you will recall,
numerous governors, including Governors Carper and Chiles, had urged us to take this.
step. We were able to work with the Treasury Department to include important language
to make clear that this notice does not affect worker protections such as the minimum wage
and workplace safety rules, which are determined by other provisions of law, such as the
Fair Labor Standards Act. The notice was released under the IRS' normal procedures for
releasing tax notices.

       Welfare Reform -- GAO Report on Access to Jobs: GAO's first report on the
Access to Jobs program commends the Administration's early implementation efforts.
When Congress included your welfare to work transportation initiative in TEA-21, they
required GAO to review the program every six months. GAO praises DOT's effort to
coordinate this program with other federal welfare to work initiatives and specifically
applauds the joint transportation guidance issued by the Secretaries of Labor, HHS and
Transportation in May to help state and local officials use available funds to provide
transportation for welfare recipients going to work. (An updated version of this guidance
is about to be released that reflects enactment of the Access to Jobs program.) We
developed this guidance in response to your comments following last year's State of the
Union that we take steps to urge Governors to make full use of all existing resources to
help address the critical transportation needs of individuals moving from welfare to work.

        Drugs -- Youth Drug Use: On Friday, the Department of Health .and Human
Services released the 1998 Monitoring the Future (MTF) study on drug use patterns and
trends among 8th, 10th, and 12th grade students. The study, which sampled nearly 50,000
students from 422 secondary schools, found -- for the second year in a row -- a flattening of
drug use rates generally, with significant decreases in some categories of use.

   Good news:
   (1) amongst 10th graders there were declines in past year use of any illicit drugs (from
   38.5% to 35.%), marijuana (from 34.8% to 31.1%), and stimulants (from 12.1% to
   10.7%); and past 30-day use of marijuana and cigarettes (from 29.8% to 27.6%);

   (2) amongst 8th graders, there were decreases in past 30-day use of inhalants (from
   5.6% to 4.8%) and LSD (from 1.5% to 1.1 %);

   (3) amongst 12th graders, there was a decline in daily use of LSD (from 0.2% to
   0.1 %), smoking (from 24.6% to 22.4%), and for smoking half a pack or more per day
   (from 14.3% to 12.6%); and

   (4) the overall declining trend in perceived harmfulness of drugs for all grades appears
   to have ended, with an increase in perceived harmfulness of marijuana use and drinking
   among 8th graders.

   Bad news:
   (1) use of drugs remains at unacceptably high levels -- for instance, 25.6% of 12th
   graders, 21.5% of 10th graders, and 12.1 % of 8th graders used an illicit drug in the past·
   30 days, typically marijuana;

   (2) cocaine use -- while low overall -- continues to rise, with an increase in past year
   use of crack by 8th graders (from 1.7% to 2.1 %);

   (3) increased use amongst 12th graders of tranquilizers (from 4.7% to 5.5%),
   barbiturates (2.1 % to 2.6%) and inhalants (0.25% to 0.9%), and hallucinogens (0.4%
   to 0.8%).

        Crime -- National Instant Check System (NICS) Update: As of Tuesday, there
have been a total of 434,631 background checks conducted through the NICS since it took
effect on November 30. Of this total, 249,424 checks were conducted by the FBI, and the
remainder were completed by the State points of contact for the checks. . Of
FBI-conducted checks, 4,039 resulted in deriials of sales to prohibited purchasers -- a
denial rate of 1.6 %.

        Crime -- Juvenile Brady: During the briefing for the 12/5 radio address on the
National Instant Check System, you asked how many of the states already had adopted
laws prohibiting violent juveniles from owning firearms as adults. According to the most
recent survey by the Justice Department, 22 states prohibit firearms possession by
delinquents who have been convicted or adjudicated for offenses that would be felonies or
violent offenses if committed by an adult. Of these 22 states: 4 permanently prohibit
possession of firearms by adjudicated delinquents; 6 retain a prohibition on possession
until a court or the Governor orders a restoration of rights; and the remainder prohibit
possession for a set period of tim~ (e.g., 10 years), usually following adjudication or
release from a juvenile facility.
                            ,
         Tobacco Attorneys' Fees: This week, attorneys representing Florida, Texas and
Mississippi settled with the tobacco industry over fees and were awarded $8.2 billion.
The fees will be paid by the industry, over the next 15-20 years, in addition to the funds the
industry will pay the states. The legal fees were determined by an arbitration panel set up
under an agreement between the tobacco industry and plaintiffs' lawyers. The panel will
also be used to award legal fees from the larger $206 billion, 46 state settlement reached
last month, unless the attorneys and industry can agree ori fees without arbitration (the
settlement offers attorneys an option for "liquidated fees" which are generally lower but are
paid more quickly). Overall, the settlement provisions limit the industry's annual
arbitration settlements to $500 million a year.




                                                                                                     4

            In detennining fees, the three-person arbitration panel started by awarding lawyers
    in Florida, Texas and Mississippi' 10 percent of their state's settlement. Then the panel
    multiplied those figures by 1.9 to 3.5 depending on what it perceived to be the risks and
    work undertaken by the lawyers in each state. The fonnula resulted in lawyers in Florida
    receiving $3.4 billion, in Texas $3.3 billion, and in Mississippi $1.4 billion. Attorneys in
    Mississippi got the highest percentage award, 33 percent, after the panel detennined that
    they had taken the greatest risk by representing the first state to sue the tobacco industry.
    Minnesota's attorneys settled earlier this year for approximately seven percent of the state's
    award. Because the risk factor in the yet-to-be-decided cases was negligible, attorneys
    from other 46 states are likely to negotiate directly with the industry for liquidated fees,
    which are expected to be considerably lower.

             Children and Families: New Report on Lower Teenage Births: On Thursday,
    December 17, HHS released a new study titled Declines in Teenage Birth Rates:
    National and State Patterns 1991-97, which reports that while teenage birth rates have
    declined substantially dunng the 1990s, the most dramatic decline is in the birth rate for
    young women who have already had one child. While there was a 6 percent decline in
    first births to teenagers, the rate of second births for teens was down by 21 percent between
    1991 and 1996; the overall teen birth rate dropped 15 percent from 1991 through 1997.
    Rates are down more for younger teens (15-17) than older teens (18 and 19). In addition,
    teenage childbearing is down in all race and ethnic groups, but the largest declines
    documented are for black teenagers, especially younger black teens. Despite the reduction
    in repeat childbearing, about 90,000 teens gave birth to their second child in 1997, out ofa
    total of just over 500,000 births to teenagers. The report, which tracks teenage
    childbearing in the United States, was issued by the National Center for Health
    Statistics.
