PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
RADIO ADDRESS ON SCHOOL SAFETY
MAY 23, 1998

        Good morning.  This weekend marks the time when we honor the brave
men and women who gave their lives to serve our country, and we thank the
hundreds of thousands of Americans in uniform who protect and defend us
every day around the world.  But this Memorial Day weekend, Americans are
also praying for the people who lost their lives and for those who were
wounded when a 15-year-old boy with a semi-automatic weapon opened fire in
Springfield, Oregon this Thursday.

        Like all Americans, I am deeply shocked and saddened by this
tragedy, and my thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their
familieS.  Like all Americans, I am struggling to make sense of the
senseless, and to understand what could drive a teenager to commit such a
terrible act. And like all Americans, I am profoundly troubled by the
startling similarity of this crime to the other tragic incidents that have


stunned America in less than a yearD,s time: In Paducah, Kentucky     in
Jonesboro, Arkansas     in Pearl, Mississippi ... and in Edinboro,
Pennsylvania.

        We must face up to the fact that these are more than isolated
incidents.   They are symptoms of a changing youth culture that
desensitizes our children to violence, where the average teenager has seen
hundreds of murders on television and in movies and video games before he
graduates from high school '" where too many young people fail to take
responsibility for themselves and for their actions. And as a result, it
is a culture where all too often, everyday conflicts are resolved not with
words, but with weapons.

        We cannot afford to ignore these symptoms -- we must take action:
in our communities, in our schools, and in our homes.  For more than five
years, we have tried to do our part. We have worked hard to give
communities the tools they need to make our schools safe -- from tighter
security, to more police, to better prevention. To promote discipline and
maintain order, we are encouraging curfews, school uniforms, and tough
truancy policies. We will continue to do everything we can to keep guns
out of the hands of our children and out of our schools. And we will
continue to demand responsibility from our young people with strong
punishments when they break the law.

        But this is not a job that government can, or should, do alone. Parents
must teach their children the unblinking distinction between right and
wrong. We must exercise responsibility over the images our children are
exposed to. We must teach young people to resolve conflicts peacefully.
We must make sure that they know that they will be held accountable for
their actions. And we must learn to read the early warning signals we
know troubled young people send before they commit acts of violence.

        Last month, I met with a panel of youth violence experts from
around the country.   I heard from an elementary school principal in
Montana who reached out to police and helped take back her school from
violence after an ll-year-old boy was killed by another student on school
grounds. And I heard from a California man who started a foundation with
the grandfather of the l4-year-oldgang member who had killed his teenaged
son. Together, they are teaching the young people of their community how
to to take responsibility for their actions, and resolve conflicts
peacefully.

        I learned many lessons that day, but one stood out above the
rest. A seventeen year old high school junior from Cleveland, Ohio, who
is a trainer and a mediator in his schoolD,s conflict resolution program,
told me this. Given the right example and given the right tools, young
people will not choose violence.

        It is our duty -- and our moral obligation -- to set that example,
to provide those tools, and to give our children that choice.

       Thanks for listening.
