Attached is a 2-pager describing our education initiatives, made to sound
like they are more broadly Democratic initiatives.  Bruce wanted you to
have this for the 3:30 conference call.

He's not sure what we are supposed to do with the paper,a nd is counting
on you to figure that out on the call.

Depending upon how this will be used, it may well need additional
editing.  let me know.==================== ATTACHMENT   1 ====================

              DEMOCRATIC UNITY EVENT: EDUCATION INITIATIVES

             Now we must make our public elementary and secondary schools the world's best...by
                     raising standards, raising expectations, and raising accountability.
                            President Clinton, 1998 State of the Untion Address

Democrats are proposing new initiatives that will dramatically strengthen elementary and
secondary education. These proposals will help ensure that all students start out in a small class
with a good teacher, in a safe, modem school. They will help ensure that students, especially in
high poverty urban and rural areas, attend schools where high standards are taken seriously and
kids are given the help they need to succeed. These proposals will dramatically expand access
to safe havens for after-school learning, put computers in the classroom and help make teachers
as comfortable with computers as they are with the blackboard. The High Hopes initiative
recently announced by President Clinton will help provide low-income students with mentoring
and encouragement to help them finish school and continue on to college.

Small Classes with Qualified Teachers to Improve Reading in Grades 1-3. President
Clintonis proposing a $12.4 billion initiative over 7 years ($7.3 billion over 5 years) to help
local schools provide small classes with qualified teachers in the early grades. This will help
ensure that every child receives personal attention, learns to read independently and gets a solid
foundation for further learning. The new initiative will reduce class size in grades 1-3 to a
nationwide average of 18, providing funds to help local school districts hire an additional
100,000 well-prepared teachers. The initiative will also provide funds to states and local
school districts to test new teachers, develop more rigorous teacher testing and certification
requirements, and train teachers in effective reading instruction practices.

Modern School Buildings to Improve Student Learning. In order for students to learn and to
compete in the global economy, schools must be well-equipped and they must be able to
accommodate smaller class sizes. To address these and other critical needs, Democrats are
proposing Federal tax credits to pay interest on nearly $22 billion in bonds to build and renovate
more than 5,000 public schools. The tax credits will cost the Treasury $5 billion over 5 years,
and $11.6 billion over ten years. Of the $22 billion in bond authority, nearly $20 billion is for
new School Modernization Bonds. Half of this bond authority will be allocated to the 100
school districts with the largest number of low-income children, and the other half will be
allocated to the States. In addition, Democrats are proposing a more than $2.4 billion
expansion of the Qualified Zone Academy Bonds, school-business partnerships that will include
funding for school construction and renovation.


Education Opportunity Zones: Helping Students in Poor Communities Reach High
Standards. This initiative will strengthen public schools and help students master the basics
where the need is the greatest. The Education Department will select approximately 50 high
poverty urban and rural school districts that agree to: (1) use high standards and tests of student
achievement to identify and provide help to students, teachers and schools who need it; (2)
prevent students from falling behind by ensuring quality teaching, challenging curricula, and
extended learning time; and (3) end social promotion and tum around failing schools. Added
investments in these communities will accelerate their progress and provide successful models of
                                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion


system-wide, standards-based reform for the nation. This initiative will invest $200 million in
FY99, and $1.5 billion over 5 years, to raise achievement and share lessons learned with school
districts around the country.

Expanding Access to Safe After-School Care. To help create safe, posItIve learning
environments for American school-age children who lack adult supervision during a typical
week, Deomcrats will work to increase the 21 st Century Learning Center Program to support
school-community partnerships that expand or establish programs providing after-school care for
up to half a million children a year. To accomplish this, the President has proposed to increase
funding by $800 million over five years.

Educational Technology: Democrats will continue the effort to make sure that all of our
children have access to the "information superhighway," and to broaden access to high quality
learning opportunities for adults using the Internet and other new technologies. This year, the
Administration's educational technology investments--$770 million overall--will place special
emphasis on technology training for teachers, so that all new teachers entering the workforce can
use technology effectively in the classroom, and that there is at least one teacher who can serve as
a technology expert in every school to help other teachers. Democrats, together with the
Administration, will also fight to preserve the $2.25 billion per year in discounts to connect
schools and libraries to the Internet (the "e-rate") -- which was authorized by the
Telecommunications Act of 1996.


High Hopes for College: Democrats have been leading the effort to give information about
college opportunity to all Americans, especially those in poor neighborhoods. Democrats are
now advancing a new initiative to inspire more of our young people to have high expectations, to
stay in school and study hard, and to go to college. This long-term investment -- starting with
$140 million in the FY 99 Budget -- would promote partnerships between colleges and middle or
junior high schools in low-income communities, to provide children with the support they need
starting in sixth or seventh grade and continuing through high school graduation. Working with
parents, community and religious groups, and businesses, the partnerships would provide
information about what it means and what it takes to go to college, as well as support services --
such as mentoring, tutoring, college visits, summer programs, after-school activities, and
counseling -- to help the children stay on track. The partnerships will help ensure that children
have access to the rigorous core courses that prepare them for college and let parents know how
they can help their children prepare for college. High Hopes would also provide children and
their families at middle and junior high schools in low-income communities with a 21st Century
Scholar certificate, an official, early notification of the amount of their eligibility for Federal
college aid, so that families will know that college is affordable regardless of their income.
