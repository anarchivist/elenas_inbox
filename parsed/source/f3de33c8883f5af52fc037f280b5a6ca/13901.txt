TEXT:
A number of the fall legal intern applicants have inquired about
final decisions for the fall session (e.g., Staci Coleman called,
Joe Fanaroff stopped by, etc). They are trying to make decisions
themselves regarding their plans for Fall semester, and want to
know what's going on ...
What should I be telling them?
Thanks!
Marna
