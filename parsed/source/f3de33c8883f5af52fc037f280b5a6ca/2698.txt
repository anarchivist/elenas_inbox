TEXT:
These notes will supplement the phone call to Elena and staff briefings in
passing.

Process.    To recap expected timing of next steps:

Haskins    expects his draft Monday morning.  He will make it available to us
through    Palast, who takes responsibility for getting to HHS and us.   If it
doesn't    come directly to DPC, I'll get it there, and will get it to
Stegman    at HUD and Barr at Treasury (who called about all this Friday
night) .

Haskins is open to meeting with a small group late Monday to provide
comments and input to a second draft. AS noted below, he accepts that he
needs some input on several issues.

Haskins expects to be able to circulate a draft Tuesday or Wednesday at
the latest, with mark up scheduled for Friday, for WTW and other matters:
immigrants (grandfathering all on the roles instead of the Agreement on
new applicants; deportation; sponsorship at 150% of poverty eliminates
benfits; no AIDs aliens; et al -- Tarplin has a complete list); FLSA;
privatization; TANF transfers for Title XX and childcare; limiting amount
of high school and voc ed that can count for TANF requirements; and UI
(Pennington) .

Colton provided a preliminary list of minority amendments to the expected
bill.  (Kagan has by fax; OMB staff: in your boxes).


Colton may want Administration people at meeting of Dem LAs; she will call
WH and/or Palast and Tarplin.

W&M and E&W. Haskins reported that he and the Education and Workforce
committee staff have been unable to agree on a WTW design.  Haskins favors
competition and qualitative judgements on plans. E&W favors including the
WTW money in the broad block grant approach it has approved as the
replacment for JTPA. Not clear how this will play out among the members,
but Haskins is drafting his way for now.

What do the cities think. Not yet clear.   Some think they would accept
the pass through from States approach (see below), in lieu of direct
grants from the Feds.  Palast is to get a straight story from the Conf of
Mayors.

Content.

Some mix of competitive and formula grants. Proportion likely to be a
members issue. Formula will focus on poverty and unemployment and numbers
on welfare.

DOL administers.

Split between States and cities, and degree of control over money by
cities not clear, but may be achieved via a statutoriliy required
pass-through from States, as in JTPA.  Substate formula based on poverty
plus welfare rolls, long term recipients.  The Agreement says local areas
must have poverty 20% above State average, but Haskins is sceptical of
reality of that figure.

Funding from State or locals has to be approved by PICs. This is confused
due to limited understanding of the JTPA/PIC structure; DOL will provide
some drafting clarity
                                                                                 (J



One/third State match ($1 State to $2 Fed), with State $ not usable to
meet any other Federal match.  States must meet TANF 80% MOE.  15% admin
cap.

Eligible individuals are:

1.    On welfare for 30 months; or
2.    Have less than one year before mandatory TANF termination; or
3.    Meet any two of the following four conditions (each to be defined by
the   Secretary):
a.    School dropout;
b.    Low skills;
c.    Less than 3 of the last 12 months in the labor force;
d.    Drug abuser.

HHS (not DOL) receives .5% of the annual appropriation for evaluation,
developed in consultation with DOL. (On $3 billion, this is $150 million,
which has to be a typo; must be .05%).

State legislature must appropriate the grant to States; role not clear for
grants to cities.

Allowable activities:
Job creation, through public or private sector wage subsidies;
On-the-job training;
Contracts with job placement companies or public job placement programs;


 Job vouchers;
 Job retention services or support services if not otherwise available.

No performance bonuses.
