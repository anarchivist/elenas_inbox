Executive Order - - - - - - - -

Federalism
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and laws of the United States of
America, and in order to restore the division of governmental responsibilities, embodied in the
Constitution, between the federal government and the States that was intended by the Framers to
ensure that the principles of federalism guide the Executive departments and agencies in the
formulation and implementation of policies, it is hereby ordered as follows:

Sec. 1. Definitions. For purposes of this Order:

(a) "Policies that have federalism implications" refers to regulations, legislative comments or
proposed legislation, and other policy statements or actions that have substantial direct effects on
the relationship between the federal government and the States, or on the distribution of power
and responsibilities among the various levels of government.

(b) "State" or "States" refer to the States of the United States of America, individually or
collectively, and, where relevant, to State governments, including units of local government, tribal
government, and other political subdivisions established by the States.

(c)   "Agency" or "agencies" mean any authority of the United States that is an "agency" under
44 US.c. 3502(1), other than those considered to be independent regulatory agencies, as defined
in 44 US.c. 3502(10) ..

Sec. 2. Fundamental Federalism Principles. In formulating and implementing policies that have
federalism implications, agencies shall be guided by the following fundamental federalism
principles:

(a) Federalism is rooted in the knowledge that our political liberties are best assured by limiting
the size and scope of the federal government.

(b) The people of the States created a federal government of limited powers. All other
sovereign powers are reserved to the States, save those expressly prohibited the States by the
Constitution, or to the people.

(c) The people of the States are free, subject only to restrictions in the Constitution itself or in
constitutionally authorized Acts of Congress, to define the moral, political, and legal character of
                                               -2-                       Hex-Dump Conversion
their lives.

(d) The nature of our constitutional system encourages a healthy diversity in the public policies
adopted by the people of the several States according to their own conditions, needs, and desires.
  Effective public policy is often achieved when there is competition among the several states in
the fashioning of different approaches to public policy issues.

(e) The search for enlightened public policy is furthered when individual States and
communities are free to experiment with a variety of approaches to public issues. Uniform,
national approaches to public policy problems can often inhibit the creation of effective solutions
to those problems.

(f)  In most areas of governmental concern, the States uniquely possess the constitutional
authority, the resources, and the competence to discern the sentiments of the people and to
govern accordingly. In Thomas Jefferson's words, the States are "the most competent
administrations for our domestic concerns and the surest bulwarks against antirepublican
tendencies."

(g) Acts of the federal government -- whether legislative, executive, or judicial in nature -- that
exceed the limited powers of that government under the Constitution violate the principle of
federalism established by the Framers.                                    .

(h) Policies of the federal government should recognize the respon~ibility of -- and should
encourage opportunities for -- individuals, families, neighborhoods, local governments, and
private associations to achieve their personal, social, and economic objectives through cooperative
effort.

Sec. 3. Federalism Policymaking Criteria. In addition to the fundamental federalism principles
set forth in section 2, Executive departments and agencies shall adhere, to the extent permitted by
law, to the following criteria when formulating and implementing policies that have federalism
implications:

(a) There should be strict adherence to constitutional principles. Executive departments and
agencies should closely examine the constitutional and statutory authority supporting any federal
action that would limit the policymaking discretion of the States, and should carefully assess the
necessity for such action.

(b) Federal actions limiting the policymaking discretion of the States should be taken only
where constitutional authority for the action is clear and certain.

(c)   With respect to national policies administered by the States, the federal government should
                                                -3-                   H~~C~~moo

grant the States the maximum administrative discretion possible.     Intrusive federal oversight of
State administration is neither necessary nor desirable.

(d) It is important to recognize the distinction between problems of national or multi-state
scope (which may justify federal action) and problems that are merely common to the States
(which will not justify federal action because individual States, acting individually or together, can
effectively deal with them). In general federal action is warranted only in the following
circumstances:

(1) When the problem to be addressed by federal action occurs interstate as opposed to being
contained within one State's boundaries.

(2) When the source of the problem that is sought to be redressed occurs in a State different
from the State (or States) where a significant amount of the harm occurs. [This type of issue
often exists in the environmental area when the State which is the source of the environmental
harm is often not the State which suffers the greatest effed of that .harm.]

(3)   When there is a need for uniform national standards.

(4) When decentralization increases the costs of government thus imposing additional burdens
on the taxpayer. [For example, in an increasingly technologically and economically sophisticated
environment, regulatory intervention often requires the use of highly-skilled experts, analysts, and
accountants; and the costs inherent in maintaining this type of regulatory task force are quite
sizable. It is therefore less costly and far more efficient for there to be one regulatory authority
incurring the costs of these analysts and experts than to have fifty similar regulatory task-forces
throughout the country.]

(5)   When State and local governments have not acted to protect individual rights and liberties.

(6) When decentralized authority will lead to circumstances in which a State will be reluctant to
impose necessary regulations on its industry for fear of losing that industry to another State.

(7) When placing regulatory authority at the State or local level will seriously undermine
regulatory goals because enforcement costs will effectively place the regulatory matter beyond the
resources of State and local enforcement authorities. [As industries expand in size and complexity
and the dangers they pose to the society become more severe, the cost of monitoring and
regulating their activities also become greater. Federal action may be justified to assure that
industry does not escape regulation based upon its size alone.]

Sec. 4. Consultation. (a) Each agency shall develop an effective process to permit elected
officials and other representatives of State, local, and tribal governments to provide meaningful
                                                                   Reii4Jump Conversion

and timely input in the development of regulatory policies that have federalism implications.


        (b) To the extent feasible and permitted by law, no agency shall promulgate any
regulation that is not required by statute and that has federalism implications, unless the agency,
in a separately identified portion of the preamble to the regulation as it is proposed for public
comment in the Federal Register, provides a description of the extent ofthe agency's prior
consultation with representatives of affected State, local, and tribal governments, a summary of
the nature of their concerns [with its federalism implications], and the agency's position
supporting the need to issue the regulation.

Sec. 5. Increasing Flexibility for State and Local Waivers. (a) Each agency shall review its
waiver application process and. take appropriate steps to streamline that process.

         (b) Each agency shall, to the extent practicable and permitted by law, consider any
application by a State, local, or tribal government for a waiver of statutory or regulatory
requirements in connection with any program administered by that agency with a general view
toward increasing opportunities for utilizing flexible policy approaches at the State, local, and
tribal level in cases in which the proposed waiver is consistent with the applicable Federal policy
objectives and is otherwise appropriate.

        (c) Each agency shall, to the fullest extent practicable and permitted by law, render a
decision upon a complete application for a waiver within 120 days of receipt of such application
by the agency. If the application for a waiver is not granted, the agency shall provide the
applicant with timely written notice of the decision and the reasons therefor.

        (d) This section applies only to statutory or regulatory requirements of the programs that
are discretionary and subject to waiver by the agency.

Sec. 6. Independent Agencies.   Independent regulatory agencies are requested to comply with the
provisions of this order.

Sec. 7. General Provisions. (a) This Order is intended only to improve the internal management
of the executive branch and is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit,
substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or equity by a party against the United States, its
agencies or instrumentalities, its officers or employees, or any other person.
        (b) This ordershall supplement but not supersede the requirements contained in
Executive Order No. 12866 ("Regulatory Planning and Review") and Executive Order No. 12988
("Civil Justice Reform").

       (c) Executive Order Nos. 12612 of October 26, 1987, and 12875 of October 26, 1993, are
revoked.
