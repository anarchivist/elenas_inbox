TEXT:
My apologies' to Lynn - Please note the input she received (and let me know
if anyone else's information is not in the summary):

Cutler: The feed back from the mayors was terrific and I also had a
meeting with forty urban county officials this afternoon. We gave them
the paper and talked about the speech and initiative. There was a real
excitement in the room. We had county people from Dade (Miami), Fulton
(Atlanta), Cook (Chicago), King (Seattle), Hennepin (minneapolis) and all
the others Sylvia met in the lobby.

The only negative feedback I've had was from Indian country--extreme
disappointment that there was not a Native American on the Advisory
Board.  I said all the things I was supposed to--just hope the speech has
a good piece on Indians in it.
