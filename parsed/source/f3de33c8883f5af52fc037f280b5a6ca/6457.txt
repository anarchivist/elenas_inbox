TEXT:
FYI we have under.review a major DOT proposal regarding ADA access for
over-the-road buses.   Some people believe that all buses are over the
road.  But not so -- this is secret government language for passenger
buses like Greyhound and Trailways. Our staff is just starting its review
-- if you are interested, I will let you know what things look like once
I've found out myself.

Don
