           Laura    since I have meetings all morning, could you make whatever
           changes Elena makes, and then send the final copy to the press office and
           to Andrea and me?

                            Andrea -- would you then get it to Michael Kharfen and
           others at HHS?

                           Thanks. ==================== ATTACHMENT    1 ====================

                             Questions and Answers on Illegitimacy Bonus
                                            March 2, 1998


     Q:     What's the purpose of the "illegitimacy bonus" that's being released today?

     A:     HHS is publishing a proposed regulation in today's Federal Register defining how it will
            distribute $100 million a year in illegitimacy bonuses to states that reduce the percentage
            of children born out of wedlock. The bonus, which was part of the 1996 welfare reform
            law, is designed to encourage and reward state efforts to develop effective solutions for
            this growing problem. The proposed rule provides more specific guidance on how
            the bonus will be awarded and what data states need to submit in order to qualify.

     Q:     Will the illegitimacy bonus encourage or discourage abortions?

     A:     The statutory language makes clear that the bonuses will go only to states that
            simultaneously reduce both out of wedlock births and abortions. Under this provision,
            HHS will first rank states on how much they've reduced the percentage of births that are
            out of wedlock, since reducing those births is the main purpose of the bonus. Then the
            top five qualifying states will be asked to provide abortion data, and only those that show
            a decrease in abortions will receive a bonus. Thus, unlike earlier versions of the bonus
            considered by Congress, the final version makes sure that we are not awarding bonuses to
            states that decrease their out of wedlock birth rate simply by increasing abortions. The
            regulation closely tracks the statute in this area.

     , Q:   Will this bonus help prevent teen pregnancies?

      A:    Reducing teen births is a top priority for this Administration and we're proud that we've
            reduced the teen birth rate five years in a row. Because three-quarters of teen births are
            out of wedlock, state efforts to reduce out of wedlock births will help us do even more to
            prevent teen births. However, this bonus will be awarded to states not just on their
            success in reducing teen out of wedlock births, but on their success in reducing all
            out-of-wedlock childbearing -- regardless of age or welfare status. While teenagers are
            much more likely to have children out of wedlock than are older women, the majority of
            out-of-wedlock births are actually to women age 20 and above, since the adult female
            population is so much larger than the teen population.

                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion
