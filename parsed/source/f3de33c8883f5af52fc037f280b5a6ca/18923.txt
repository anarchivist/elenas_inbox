Acknowledgments: Sen. Chris Dodd, Rep. Chris Shays, Rep. Barbara Kennelly, Rep. Rosa
DeLauro -- One of the reasons I came to Connecticut is because this state's leaders and
representatives have been some of America's foremost advocates for better child care; Pamela
Price, parent.

          In last page of the Early Childhood Lab School's parent handbook there's a saying, "A
child is like a butterfly in the wind. Some can fly higher than others, but each one flies the best
it can ... Each one is special. Each one is different. Each one is beautiful."

        After my visit, I could tell that it's a motto every teacher in this school lives by, that
every child feel here is made to feel special every day. Every child in America deserves the
same kind of high-quality care that the children here have, whether it's at a school like this one, a
church, a neighbor's house, or at home. Today I want to talk about the urgent need to make
child care in America better, safer, and more affordable. I want to talk about what we in the
federal government will do to improve child care. And I want to talk about what Congress must
do over the next 70 days that it is in session to help every working family in America provide
their children with the care they need to thrive and grow.

        These are good times for America. Over the past five years, we have successfully
abandoned the false choices of the past and replaced them with a new economic strategy. We
proved that we could indeed balance the budget and invest in our people and the future. As a
result, our economy is booming. We have 15 million new jobs. Unemployment is the lowest in
24 years. Inflation is the lowest in a generation. Our social problems are bending to our efforts.
 Last year's historic balanced budget agreement provided working families with a $500 per child
tax credit, made college affordable for every American, and expanded health coverage to five
million uninsured children. We are helping parents meet their responsibilities at home and at
work through the Family and Medical Leave Act and the Earned Income Tax Credit. The
American Dream is in reach for more and more families.

        Now, we must knock down a stubborn obstacle to the American Dream -- child care that
is often too hard to afford, too hard to find, or too dangerous for our children. With more
families relying on two incomes or working longer hours to make ends meet, millions of children
must spend time in care away from their parents. For them, child care is not just an option, it's a
necessity. No parent should have to choose between the job they need and the child they love.

        Since I took office, we have already helped the parents of one million children pay for
child care. But it's obvious that we must do more. Today, I am releasing a report that confirms
the urgency of our task -- and the overwhelming need that still exists in communities across
America. The report shows that though they are coming up with some of the most innovative
strategies to improve child care in America, states simply do not have the resources to meet the

        States have been forced to turn away thousands oflow-income families. Even in
Connecticut -- a national leader in its commitment to children and child care -- the state child
care bureau has been forced to restrict their aid to families on welfare or teen parents in high
school. They've stopped taking applications from working poor families altogether. At this
time of unprecedented prosperity for America, this simply should not be.

        Our child care challenges go beyond affordability alone. Caregivers are often
poorly-trained and poorly-paid for the very important jobs they do. In too many states, we don't
even check to see if our caregivers are trustworthy in the eyes of law. Though criminal
background checks are required in Connecticut, not every state requires child care centers to look
into their employees' pasts. This is unacceptable. Something is wrong when you need more
training to cut hair than you need to care for children, when the bank tellers who guard our
valuables require more background checks than the people who care for our children -- whose
worth is priceless.

         The federal government must do its part to change this situation. I want to make our
federal child care centers, which care for some 215,000 children, a model for the nation. So
today, I am directing my Cabinet to do four things to improve federally-sponsored child care
centers. First, I am requiring that all centers conduct thorough background checks on workers.
We must make sure that people who have no business taking care of children in the first place
never set foot in our child care centers. Second, I am directing all centers to take steps to
become fully-accredited by the year 2000. This way, we can make sure that our centers meet the
highest standards of care -- in terms of training for workers, child-to-staff ratios, quality of
facilities. Today, just 50 percent of federal centers are accredited. We'll make that 100 percent
in the next 700 days. Third, we must make sure that all federal workers know about all their
child care benefits and options in the first place. And finally, we must work with the private
sector to make federal child care better and more affordable.

        But Congress must do its part. In my balanced budget for 1999, I have proposed a
comprehensive and fiscally-responsible plan to strengthen child care in our country. If Congress
acts, we can double the number of children receiving child care subsidies, give tax cuts to
businesses who provide child care, and expand child care tax credits to three million working
families. These tax credits will mean that a family of four making $35,000 a year and saddled
with high child care bills will no longer pay a penny in federal income tax. If Congress acts, we
can make child care safer with stronger licensing requirements, tougher criminal background
checks, and scholarships to talented care givers. If Congress acts, we can expand after school
programs to keep 500,000 more children off the streets, off drugs and out of trouble.

        I call upon Congress to pass this plan right away. Child care is an issue that touches
nearly every family in America, one that should rise above politics and partisan interests. With
just 70 working days before Congress adjourns, there is no time to lose. Our working families


                                                2
then adults in the blink of an eye. We cannot afford to waste a second when it comes to giving
our children the care and education they need to become strong students and good citizens.

        One last thing. I urge all of you to press Congress put aside politics and pass
comprehensive tobacco legislation -- legislation that would not only protect our children from the
deadly threat of tobacco, but could also help make my child care plan a reality. The legislation
would reduce teen smoking by raising the price of cigarettes by up to $1.50 a pack over the next
decade, imposing strong penalties if the tobacco industry keeps selling cigarettes to our children,
affirming the FDA's full authority to regulate tobacco. I call on Congress to act now.

       1998 could be one of the greatest years for America's children or one of the greatest
missed opportunities to improve the lives of our children and our working families. Over the
next 70 days, let us all work to shape that answer.
