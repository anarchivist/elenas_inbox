                             STATEMENT OF THE PRESIDENT


       Today's study released by the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence confinns what we
have known all along: that the Brady Law is helping to keep guns out ofthe hands of criminals
and other prohibited purchasers. The study also gives us more good news about the Brady
Law-- that it has worked to help disrupt illegal gun trafficking patterns, making it more difficult
for gun traffickers do business.

       While states are no longer required to conduct Brady background checks in light of the
Supreme Court's recent decision, I am pleased that state and local law enforcement agencies
around the country are overwhelmingly continuing to do these checks on a voluntary basis. Our
goal remains unchanged: no background check, no handgun purchase.

        Today's study also suggests that -- whether they know it or not -- those few jurisdictions
that have stopped conducting background checks may be inviting traffickers to locate in their
communities. I hope that these jurisdictions will review the findings in this new report and
resume background checks.

        I have pledged to do everything in my power to make sure that we continue to keep
handguns out of the hands of criminals. Today's study further makes the case that for the safety
of our communities and of all Americans, Brady background checks must continue.
