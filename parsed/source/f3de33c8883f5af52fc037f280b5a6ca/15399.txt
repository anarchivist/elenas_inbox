DRAFT MEMORANDUM TO THE PRESIDENT

THROUGH:               ERSKINE BOWLES

FROM:                  RAHM EMANUEL

SUBJECT:               UNIONIZATION OF SECRET SERVICE UNIFORMED DIVISION

       Employees of the Secret Service Uniformed Division have asked you to amend an
Executive Order to allow them to unionize and engage in collective bargaining activities.
Before his departure, Jack Quinn conducted an administration-wide review of this issue and had
recommended a change to the existing Executive Order. The Department of Treasury is strongly
opposed to this proposal.

        We wanted to provide you with the arguments on each side of this issue so you can make
a decision on how to proceed.


Background

       Federal law gives the President authority to issue an order prohibiting the employees of
any federal unit that "has as a primary function, intelligence, counterintelligence, investigative or
national security work" from organizing and collective bargaining. Using this authority,
President Carter issued Executive Order 12171, which precluded the Secret Service Uniformed
Division from engaging in such activities. The E.O. also covered units from the Departments of
Treasury, Defense, Justice, Transportation and Energy.

        In March and May 1995, members of Congress (Reps. Trafficant, Frank, Conyers, and
Torres) wrote to you requesting you to exempt the Secret Service Uniformed Division from the
E.O., allowing them to unionize. The letters were referred to the Department of Treasury,
whose officials advised the Congressmen and two interested unions that national security
concerns required the ban to remain in effect. In September 1995, Judge Mikva affirmed this
determination citing a policy of deference to the Treasury Department on matters relating to the
security of the President and VicePresident.

         Last year, White House Counsel Jack Quinn received a letter from the Secret Service
Uniformed Division Labor Committee of the FOP asking for reconsideration of this issue. The
letter stated that, "national security concerns ... are being used as a convenient way to deny the
members of the Uniformed Division fundamental labor rights." Quinn proceeded to initiate


                                                               Automated Records Management System
                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion

       In a September 1996 FOP questionnaire for presidential candidates, you referred to the
controversy and stated: "To make a decision on this issue in as thoughtful and expeditious a
manner as possible, I have asked my counsel... to look into the competing arguments, and present
a recommendation to me ... "

       At a later meeting with the Executive Board of the FOP, you were careful to be
non-committal, but expressed sympathy for the position of the Uniformed Division employees.
The Wall Street Journal has quoted you as saying at that meeting that "it would be the height of
hypocrisy for me not to support [the right to unionize] for federal officers." Members of the
FOP left the meeting generally encouraged.

        As consideration of this matter has proceeded, labor-management relations at the Secret
Service appear to have deteriorated. Gil Gallegos, National President of the FOP, and
employees of the Uniformed Division have accused management of retaliating against union
supporters.     One incident has resulted in a lawsuit brought by the officers alleging various
constitutional violations.

Treasury Arguments

        The Department of Treasury offers three reasons for opposing unionization. The first
reason is that the obligation to bargain could compromise its ability to provide security by
decreasing its flexibility over such matters as the deployment and scheduling of officers and the
selection of equipment: Treasury cites its decision to close off Pennsylvania A venue as an
example. This decision affected many employees' schedules and work assignments. Treasury
argues that without a union, the Division could take this action unilaterally; without a union, the
Division might first have had to bargain about the proposed change-- losing flexibility and
causing delay.

       A second reason Treasury opposes unionization is the fear of disclosure of information
that would occur during the course of collective bargaining, which could compromise security
arrangements. Treasury notes that information about security procedures and techniques-- about
postings, manpower allocations, equipment and so forth-- is now provided on a "need to know"
basis. If the Division were obligated to engage in collective bargaining, it would have to
provide such information to union members, officials and possibly arbitrators.

        Treasury's third argument is that exempting the Uniformed Division from the E.O. will
place the government on a slippery slope toward exempting other covered employees or
eventually eliminating the E.O. Treasury is particularly concerned that if the Uniformed
Division are free to unionize, then the special agents of the Secret Service, who directly protect
you, the Vice President, and your families, will request identical treatment.



                                                 2
                                                                   Automated Records Management System
                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion

        The primary argument in favor of allowing employees of the Uniformed Division to
organize is this Administration's commitment to safeguarding the rights of employees to
organize and engage in collective bargaining. This commitment should be upheld unless there is
a strong countervailing interest.

        A key argument generally against unionization -- that it could lead to work stoppages of
essential employees -- does not apply to this situation. A federal statute makes it an unfair labor
practice for a union to strike at any federal agency. Thus, the point at issue is the right to .
unionize, not the right to strike.

        Allowing unionization will certainly limit the unfettered authority of Treasury
management over workplace decisions. But unionization may not undermine the ability of the
Division to provide security for a few reasons: first, with respect to a wide variety of issues such
as pay and benefits, the obligation to bargain will have no effect on security. Second, with
respect to more sensitive issues, bargaining often will not be required. Agencies have the ability
to take certain actions involving transfers, assignments and the like-- actions implicating
"management rights"-- without engaging in collective bargaining. If this authority is insufficient
for Treasury, they can negotiate contract provisions similar to those found in some employment
contracts, to give it certain emergency powers. (The proposed amendment to the E.O. could
perhaps reserve such powers to Treasury.)

         With regards to the disclosure of sensitive information -- each officer already has most
of this information or could acquire it by pooling their knowledge with others. In addition, the
Treasury Department could condition providing such data in collective bargaining on agreement·
by the union to confidentiality requirements.

        In response to Treasury's "slippery slope" argument, if exempting a group such as the
special agents of the Secret Service would pose a greater danger to security interest, then
continued coverage of that group should be justified, regardless of whether the Uniformed
Division is exempted. It is possible to make reasoned distinctions in this area, and the E.O. can
and should reflect these judgments.

        Four other agencies have weighed in on the "slippery slope" argument. When asked
their views of exempting Uniformed Division employees from the E.O., the agencies responded
as follows:

·      The Department of Energy has no objections, even though it is facing a similar request to
       unionize from its Nuclear Materials Couriers. The Department intends to oppose
       unionization of these employees, but is confident that it can support this position
       irrespective of the decision here.



                                                 3
                                                                Automated Records Management System
                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion




     ·      The Department of Justice expressed no view, stating that employees of its covered units
            (the Drug Enforcement Agency, and the Marshal's Service) would probably not seek
            unionization.

     ·      The Department of Defense also expressed no view, stating that its covered units are
            sufficiently different from the Uniformed Division to prevent them from "being pulled
            in. "

     ·      The Department of Transportation, which some years ago faced a unionization request
            from its Federal Air Marshals, expressed a "mild concern" of a "ripple effect," but
            stressed that this concern was indeed "mild."


             An alternative course to amending the E.O. is to leave it as is, but ask the Treasury
     Department to address the concerns of Uniformed Division employees in some way which falls
     short of unionization. For example, Treasury could initiate improved grievance procedures or
     employee participation devices. So far, however, Treasury has asserted that it cannot do
     anything more along such lines than it has done.

             You should be aware that both Treasury and the Uniformed Division employees have
     rejected any of our suggested compromises.

     Options for Responding

            Amend the E.O. to allow Uniformed Division employees to unionize.

            Leave the E.O. as is, continuing the ban on unionization, but ask the Treasury Department
            to make reforms affecting labor-management relations.
