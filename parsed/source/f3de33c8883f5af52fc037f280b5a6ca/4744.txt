TEXT:
Elena: Are there agency deliverables other than those specified in the
Presidential Directive to Glickman and Shalala? At a meeting I was at the
other day, FDA was talking about an FR notice laying out broad guidelines
for GAPs, etc. due in 90 days. They said this was based on a commitment
they made to the White House. Since this wasn't specified in the
directive, I was wondering if there could be some misunderstanding about
what is required and when. Are there two 90 day deliverables, the
report/plan and this FR notice, and the specific GAPs and GMPs due in a
year.  I have a conference call this morning and this might come up. Any
light you could shed on this for me would be appreciated.   Thanks,  Cliff
