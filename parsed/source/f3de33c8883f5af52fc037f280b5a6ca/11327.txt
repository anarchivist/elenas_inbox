2/23 Leadership Meeting Stakeout

Hastert:          Had a good disscussion with the president. Talked about
foreign                           relations - talked about Kosovo.

                  On domestic issues talked about commissions to look at
some ideas.

                  On social security don't want to raise taxes or diminsh
benefits
                  Reform has to come, reform must be part of surplus.

Lott:           Here to do people's business - work together across
party lines to do                        what american people expect of
us: provide best schools; on defense -                   pay for men
and women in uniform;  social security. Talked about a
                        range of issues.

                  Foreign policy:  talked about Kosovo - progress has been
made.                     Encourage parties to work together to stop
the fighting.

                  Medicare commission meetting this week  bipartisan group
- we need                         to support their work - critical to any
kind of reform.

                Missile defense - made some progress to have missile
defense but                     anytime you talk about missile defense
it has ramifications with the                   Russians. Need a
bipartisan national security working group to meet
                        that would meet with the Duma - need modifications of some e


                           treaties.

Q:                 Have you given up on idea of tax cut?

Hastert:           There are a lot of tax cuts in menu - lot of what we do
will be a mix.
                IRS and tax code need to be fairer; need to look at
eliminating the marriage                penalty tax. With any tax cut
have to keep in mind how to continue expanding          growth.

Lott:              Anytime we can talk about tax cut I am happy.

Q:                 Relations with Congress?

Lott:           First bipartisan meeting since July of 1997 -
speaker has been setting the right              tone.

Q:                 You said you couldn't trust trust the president?

Lott:           We will work together to move forward on people's
business - we are going to              work together.

Daschle:           Support efforts on Kosovo - need long standing resolution
to issue.

                On domestic side, what do we do with surplus? 77% wedded
to social secuirty               and medicare - need reform, need
committment from WH and Congress
                Target tax relief targetted to usa accounts, childcare.
                Talked about education: school construction, hiring
additional teachers, and                 technology for classroms.

Gephardt:          77% is the threshold issue in social security and
medicare.
                Also brought up speaker was not adamant that there be the
10% tax cut - if                that's the case then let's do targetted
tax cuts. Let's do minimun wage,                        patient bill of
rights, campaign finance reform in next 3 months - can get all
                passed.

Q:                 What do you think about meeting with Republicans?

Daschle:           Meeting was a good thing, productive, constructive.

Q:                 10% tax cut dead issue?

Gephardt:       President very clear about saving 77% of surplus -- it's
a threshold issue.
                If we can't agree on that threshold issue then we face a
much more severe set of                 circumstances. Have to
reach agreement in the next weeks. They said they               were
flexible, they have to go back and talk to their people, we have to talk
to              our caucus.

                If we pare down the national debt rather than do a tax cut
we can bring down               inflation, interst rates - economic
effects are really positive.

Q:                 Republicans did not directly repond to trust issue.


Gephardt:       They have to work with president of united states,
meeting was a good positive             development.  I don't have any
concern about our ability to work together.
