Boston Sues Gun Industry

                             BOSTON (AP)   -- Accusing the gun industry of
- -'negligence,
                             recklessness and greed, " Mayor Thomas M. Menino
                             announced the filing Thursday of a lawsuit
against 31
                             companies accused of flooding the city's streets
with guns.

                             The lawsuit, similar to a slew of litigation
filed in other cities,
                             said guns have created a public health problem.
It accuses
                            gunmakers of failing to incorporate all possible
safety devices
                             and unjustly making money from firearms flowing
to people not
                             authorized to own them.

                            The city is seeking more than $100 million in
damages for
                            police, fire and medical expenses caused by gun
violence, as
                            well as for increased security costs and
declines in real estate
                            values.

                            Among the companies named in the suit are
Springfield-based
                            Smith & Wesson Corp., Colt's Manufacturing
Company Inc. of
                            Hartford, Conn., and Browning Arms Corp. of
Morgan, Utah.

                             --These lawsuits, they have no merit, "   said
Travis Hall, a
                            spokesman for Browning. --Our industry is one of
the most
                            prohibited and monitored industries there is."

                            He said public officials should more rigorously


enforce gun laws
                    and not allow people accused of gun-related
crimes to make
                    plea bargain deals.

                    Boston joins 19 other cities, including Chicago
and New
                    Orleans, in filing suit against the gun
industry.
