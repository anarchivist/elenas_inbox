TEXT:
All:
Alan Ehrenbaum just returned from a meeting with Reyes, advocates
(including MALDEF, La Raza, National Immigration Forum, and others), and
Hill staff (including Gephardt, Watt, Berman, CHC, Gutierrez and Conyers
staff) on INS reform.  Essentially, they all communicated to Reyes that he
had been working with the wrong team on this and that he should be working
with the Administration. Apparently, Reyes got the same message yesterday
in a meeting with Gutierrez and Becerra.   At the end of today's meeting, Re
yes handed out an organizational chart that reflected the latest version
of his plan.  According to Alan, it looks just like our plan, except the
Commissioner is a Deputy Attorney General.

As soon as we can get our version of the reform legislation cleared (which
should be in a couple of days at the most), we can start working with
Reyes's staff on how he wants to proceed.

Julie
