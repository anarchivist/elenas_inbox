Subject: Food safety budget

The final food safety numbers are a significant defeat in our effort to
meet the commitments we have made in the President's Food Safety
Initiative. While USDA received $48.829M; $2.829M more than its request,
FDA received only $25M; half of its request.  Placing these numbers in
further context illustrates the problem. Virtually every report on the
nation's food safety needs has identified the funding problems at FDA
(e.g., the NAS report stated FDA has "insufficient resources to meet its
statutory obligations.")  This budget missed an opportunity to lessen the
problem.  FDA also took budget hits of $30M, as no funds were added to
provide for mandated salary increases and inflation, and $50M, because no
funds were added to implement the FDA reform legislation passed by
Congress.  I know we did a lot better on food safety than we could have,
but our negotiators should have insisted on at least a SO/50 split between
USDA and FDA of added food safety dollars.

Here are the final numbers on the Food Safety Initiative, not
     including the $5M part that went to CDC:

     Total from the Ag. portion:     73.829 million

     FDA:        25. million
     FSIS:       16.467 million
     Chief Econ:   .098 million
     ERS:          .453 million
     ARS:        10.98 million
     FNS:         2.    million
     CREES:      16.    million
     AMS:         2.831 million
