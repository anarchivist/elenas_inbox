MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:                     Bruce Reed
                          Elena Kagan

SUBJECT:                  DPC Weekly Report

        Tobacco -- Chiles Meeting: In a meeting with Erskine and us on Tuesday, Governor
Chiles encouraged the Administration to support compromise legislation that would eliminate the
federal government's Medicaid claim to state tobacco recoveries, in exchange for the states
agreeing to use half their money on the menu of seven items that we negotiated with the NGA as
part of the McCain legislation (child care, child welfare, the maternal and child health block
grant, the substance abuse block grant, the safe and drug free schools program, Eisenhower
education grants, and the state match for the children's health insurance program). Erskine
agreed that this represents a preferable alternative to the pending NGA proposal which would
simply eliminate our claims outright. While he indicated that we would support this
compromise in the end, he emphasized that we cannot be out front on this because it would
appear that we were undercutting the Kerry-Bond provision in the McCain bill which required
the states to spend half of their restricted funds on child care. Both Jack Lew and Secretary
Shalala approve of this strategy. While we have not yet seen the legislative language for Chiles'
proposal, DPC and OMB staff will review it closely to ensure it is acceptable to us and that it
adequately reimburses the federal government for the $1.2 billion over 5 years that the federal
government would otherwise recoup from state settlements.

       Health Care -- Event on Telemarketing and Elder Abuse: Next week you are
scheduled to participate in an event on elder abuse. At this event, we are announcing a new
study which concludes that elder abuse is a major problem .. The report will state that more
than 500,000 Americans aged 60 and over were the victims of abuse or neglect in their own
homes during 1996. In addition, fraudulent telemarketers continue to target frail and vulnerable
older Americans as their primary victims. You are taking a number of actions to crack down
on combat elder abuse and fraud, including: (1) announcing the creation of a new national
center on elder abuse that will train officials to better detect and respond to abuse and
neglect; (2) calling on Congress to reauthorize the Older Americans' Act, that helps states
prevent elder abuse, counsel seniors on their rights, and coordinate legal services for those
who can not afford representation; (3) launching a new partnership between the Justice
Department and AARP to create Elder Fraud Prevention Teams; and (4) releasing $3 million to
combat telemarketing scams and other forms of fraud against the elderly.

currently participating in the Medicare program are seriously contemplating pulling out of the
program prior to the October 1st plan emollment deadline. As ofthis writing, it appears that
plans serving between 100,000 and 500,000 Medicare beneficiaries may terminate their contracts
with the program. These numbers represent a relatively small percentage (5-7 percent) of the
5-6 million beneficiaries participating in Medicare HMOs and do not even include the
beneficiaries that would be served by the over 40 contracts HCFA has recently received for new
Medicare HMO business. However, ifplans follow up on their threat and there is any
significant dislocation, this development will no doubt receive a good deal of attention. The
HMOs blame inadequate payment rates and excessive regulation. Health economists are
generally dubious about "sky is falling" arguments and believe that some companies are simply
extracating themselves from some markets from which they cannot make immediate profits.
In practice, these HMOs are "cherry picking" the regional payment rates that are generous and
dropping those regions that are less lucrative and/or that have relatively small HMO market
share. Few experts accept the excessive regulation argument either, as most of these plans
comply with extremely similar rules in the private sector. To make the market more attractive
and (perhaps) increase the chances some of these plans stay in the program, the industry is asking
to be able to cost-shift onto beneficiaries by increasing premiums, co-pays or reducing benefits,
particularly drug coverage. Although beneficiaries have chosen to come into these plans
precisely because of the marketing of these benefits, the plans correctly argue that Medicare has
never guaranteed them. We are currently evaluating whether any of these options would have
any real impact on HMO participation in the program and, if so, whether they are worth any
serious consideration. We also need to start contemplating the implications of managed care
market trends on the upcoming Medicare reform debate. HHS will be briefing Erskine and
White House staff on our choices on Monday. In the meantime, we are developing alernatives
and alliances with members of the Committees of jurisdiction of both parties, as well as the aging
advocates (like AARP), to develop a common position. To date, few are very sympathetic to the
objections and proposals raised by HMOs. We will keep you apprised with developments.

        Health Care -- FDA Commissioner Update: Jane Henney, your nominee for FDA,
was reported out by voice vote out of the Labor and Human Resources Committee this week.
Although we remain concerned that one or more of the conservative RepUblicans (like Nickles)
will object to bringing her up for even a vote, this Committee action was extremely encouraging
and has brought a sense of optimism that --with some work and horse trading --Dr. Henney has a
shot of being confirmed this year. We will re-engage Senator Domenici, her homestate Senator
and ally, in pushing some of his Senate Republican colleagues. During the Vice President's
Cancer March speech on Saturday, he will challenge to Congress to confirm the first oncologist
and the first woman to serve as FDA Commissioner.

       Welfare Reform -- New Numbers on Employment of·Welfare Recipients: The
Census income and poverty numbers released on Thursday show that the rate of employment
among former welfare recipients is at an all time high. Thirty-four percent of the individuals
who received welfare in 1997 were working in 1998, an increase of one-third since 1996. It is

caseloads decline, indicating that movement towards work does not appear to be slowing even as
we begin to get to the harder cases. We are doing more analysis of these trends, with an eye
toward a possible welfare event in late October. Based on a preliminary look, the employment
trend for minorities is encouraging.

        National Service -- Joint Recruiting by AmeriCorps and the Military: You asked
about the status of AmeriCorps recruiting and the feasibility of a proposal to locate AmeriCorps
recruiters in military recruiting offices in order to improve AmeriCorps' recruiting success.

·      Recruiting Status -- This fall, AmeriCorps will pass the 100,000 member milestone.
       AmeriCorps in planning swearing-in celebrations nationwide on October 23 and has
       requested your participation in this event. It took the Peace Corps two decades to reach
       the 100,000 member mark. AmeriCorps has identified some specific proposals for
       improvement in the levels of participation that are being evaluated as part the budget
       process.

·      Joint recruiting wI military. AmeriCorps already participates in a limited joint marketing
       agreement with the Selective Service, wherein the acknowledgment sent to people who
       register with the Selective Service asks if the person who registered would like more
       information about joining the Armed Forces or AmeriCorps. Both the Selective Service
       and AmeriCorps have come under attack for this arrangement by the press and by
       Congressional opponents, and Rep Ron Paul (TX) has introduced legislation to end any
       collaboration between the Selective Service and AmeriCorps. These and other critics
       have suggested that AmeriCorps recruiting is interfering with military recruiting efforts.
       Given these factors, AmeriCorps is reluctant to pursue co-location of its recruiting
       personnel in military recruiting offices.

         Children and Families -- After-School Poll: Secretary Riley participated in the release
of a new national poll on Thursday finding that Americans overwhelmingly endorse the
expansion of after-school programs. Ninety-three percent of those surveyed said they favor
making safe, educational programs available to all children in the hours after school, with strong
support across party lines and among parents and non-parents. In addition, eighty percent said
they would be willing to use additional federal or state tax dollars to fund after-school programs
in their community at a cost of $1 ,000 per child, even if it raised their individual tax bills by $10
a year. According to the poll, respondents' chief concerns about the after-school hours were that
children are left alone and unsupervised, exposed to negative peer influences and spend too much
time watching television. The Secretary also announced a new partnership among the
Administration, NBC, "People Magazine," the Ad Council and the Entertainment Industry
Foundation to create a new public service announcement campaign to support the expansion of
high-quality after-school programs in public schools.

offices to plan an education event next week, that will showcase Democratic unity around
your education agenda and challenge the Republicans to (bring your agenda up for a vote
before Congress leaves) Q! (ensure that the final appropriations bill meets your overall
funding request for education and specifically includes funding for class size reduction) Q!
(ensure that the final appropriations bill meets your overall funding request for education
and specifically includes funding for class size reduction, and school construction).

 October 1 Education Event: We are working with Sen. Daschle's and Rep. Gephardt's
offices to plan a rally involving you and Congressional Democrats to insist that Congress
devote one day before it leaves to taking up your education agenda. Though we have not
yet finalized the combination of new initiatives and appropriations items to highlight, it is
virtually certain that some form of Patty Murray's class size initiative will be a
centerpiece. Sen. Murray has introduced your class size bill, including offsets that fully
pay for it. Together with Sen. Harkin, she has also prepared a scaled-down class size
initiative that would provide approximately $500 million in additional Title 1 funding for
the purpose of reducing class size.

         Education -- Charter School Legislation: We are continuing to work with
congressional staff to reach an agreement to bring a bipartisan charter school bill to the floor of
the Senate in the next few days. Secretary Riley persuaded Senator Harkin Tuesday to drop an
amendment that could block enactment of the bill -- as long as no other amendments to the bill
are offered. While we are not currently aware of any other possible amendments, it is still
possible that one could be offered -- leading Harkin to offer his amendment too and likely
blocking chances of enactment. We are working with congressional staff to resolve what we
hope are relatively minor disagreements (including an issue on charter schools and special
education also raised by Senator Harkin) through a consensus manager's package that could come
to the floor within a few days.

 Food Safety:USDA has prepared data on the effectiveness of your science-based food
safety program, Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP), which shows an almost
50 percent reduction in the frequency of salmonella in broiler chickens and an almost 40
percent reduction in the frequency of salmonella in swine. These data, while preliminary,
indicate that HACCP is already having a significant impact on the safety of food American
families eat. The DPC provided this data to the Washington Post which plans to use it in a
story this Sunday or Monday. We are using this study to demonstrate the effectiveness of
the Administration program and to urge Congress to provide full funding for your Food
Safety Initiative. It appears that the Agricultural Appropriations conference will meet
formally early next week, and we hope this study influences their deliberations.
