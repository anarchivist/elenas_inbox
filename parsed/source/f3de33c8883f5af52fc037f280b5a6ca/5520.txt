MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:          BRUCE REED
               GENE SPERLING
               CHRIS JENNINGS

SUBJECT:       Initiative to Reduce Racial Disparities in Health

        To support your race initiative, we have developed possible proposals that would commit
the nation to an ambitious goal of seeking to eliminate some of the most severe racial disparities
in health care by the year 2010. African-Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans, and Asian
Americans suffer from diseases up to five times as much as whites. To reduce these disparities
HHS must make a sustained effort to find innovative approaches an!! apply them across all health
programs. The FY 1999 budget could take a two-pronged approach to this issue: (1) expand our
most effective public health programs and directing them to focus specifically on the problem of
reducing these disparities; and (2) fund competitive grants to thirty communities and monitor
them closely with the goal of applying the most effective new strategies at a national level.

Racial Disparities in Health Care

        The initiative would focus on some of the most severe racial disparities in health care:
infant mortality, cancer, heart disease and stroke, AIDS, immunizations, and diabetes. Some of
these disparities are quite startling. For example, infant mortality rates are 2 V2 higher for
African-Americans and IV2 times higher for American Indians and many Hispanic groups than
they are for whites. African-Americans have a 35 percent higher cancer death rate than whites,
and African-Americans under 65 suffer from prostate cancer at nearly twice the rate of whites.
Similarly, Vietnamese women suffer from cervical cancer at nearly five times the rate of whites,
while Latinos have two to three times the rate of stomach cancer. African-American men also
suffer from heart disease at nearly twice the rate of whites. Native Americans suffer from
diabetes at nearly three times the average rate, while African-Americans suffer 70 percent higher
rates. Minorities account for 25 percent of the population yet make up 54 percent of all AIDS
cases. The Demographic changes anticipated over the next decade magnify the importance of
addressing these disparities. As minority populations grow, finding effective WflYS to close these
gaps will become a critical aspect of improving the health of the nation.

Validation

        An initiative that sets the ambitious goal of reducing these health disparities would
receive overwhelming support from the public health groups such as the American Public Health
Association, the American Heart Association and the American Cancer Society, as well as from
minority groups such as the Intercultural Cancer Council, the American Indian Healthcare
Association, the National Hispanic Council on Aging, the National Council of Black Churches.

       Options                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion

                HHS is proposing to spend $200 million in FY 1999 for this initiative. OMB is currently
        recommending $30 million and supports using these dollars to build on existing HHS programs,
        rather than the grant proposal discussed below. They also believe this initiative can be greatly
        enhanced by refocusing and retargeting programs with existing dollars. The DPCINEC agrees
       we can improve this effort with existing dollars, but believe that a strong initiative will require
       ,$100 million in your FY 1999 budget. This funding would be supplemented by money from a
        few other initiatives, such as the proposed increases in AIDS funding, some of which will be
        targeted specifically to minorities.

       ·       Accelerating Current Effective Public Health Approaches to Eliminate Disparities.
               We recommend that you propose $70 million to apply some of our most effective public
               health approaches directly to reducing these disparities. Our best public health programs
               already use strategies and have longstanding relationships with cominunity organizations.
                Partnering with these organizations, these programs would use additional funds to
               implement and adapt proven public health strategies in order to eliminate racial
               disparities. For example, CDC's breast and cervical cancer screening program already
               partners with community organization to target underserved communities. Additional
               dollars could be used to evaluate how their program could better reach minorities and also
               enable them to expand to their efforts to other cancers, such as prostate and colorectal
               cancer education.

       ·       Community Grants to Develop New Strategies to Eliminate Disparities. Eliminating
               racial disparities in health care will require not only the focused application of existing
               knowledge and best practices, but also the development of new approaches. We
               recommend you propose $30 million in FY 99 to enable thirty communities to develop
               innovative and effective ways to address these disparities. Each community, chosen
               through a competitive grant process, would commence an intensive program to address
               one of the six health areas. These grants will be used to develop new education,
               outreach, and preventive approaches that have not been attempted elsewhere. HHS
               would also hold periodic meetings and conferences to educate the public health and
               minority community about the new effective strategies learned by these communities and
               apply these approaches across all health programs. It is important to note that OMB
               believes that a major weakness of the grant proposal is the amount of time it would take
               to establish the necessary infrastructure to implement public health activities in each of
               the given communities and would prefer these dollars be spent on existing public health
               programs.

       ·       Beginning Today to Reduce Disparities. To ensure that we begin this initiative
               immediately, we are identifying ways in which the FY 1998 increases in these areas can
               be used to begin to address racial disparities. For example, AIDS education and training
               centers are beginning a new partnership with the Indian Health Service to develop new
               approaches to educate health providers about training and prevention. Also, the National
               Cancer Institute will expand efforts to help recruit more Hispanics into clinical trials.
