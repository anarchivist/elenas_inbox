PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
RADIO ADDRESS ON CHILD SAFETY SEATS
FEBRUARY 26, 1999

        Good Morning. One of governmentO,s first responsibilities is to
keep our people safe. And nowhere have governmentO,s efforts to protect
the public been more successful than in the area of auto safety. Hundreds
of thousands of lives have been saved thanks to laws requiring automakers
to include such safety features as bumpers, seat belts and air bags.

        Today, I want to talk about our latest efforts to make car travel
even safer for our smallest and most vulnerable passengers.

        Over the past 20 years, child car seats car have become a fact of
life for millions of parents. Where once small children bounced around
freely -- and dangerously -- around in the backseats of cars, today, the
majority now ride in car seats, whether for quick errands to the grocery
store or long journeys across America. Car seats have made a difference,
reducing injury and fatality rates for infants by 70 percent.  For
children ages 1 to 4, those rates have been cut in half.

        But all too often, car seats do not ~rotect children as well as
they should. The National Highway Transportation Safety Administration
estimates that up to 80 percent of all children riding in car seats are at
risk of injury because their seats have not been properly installed.
Anyone who has ever struggled to get a car seat to fit snugly into a
backseat knows what 10,m talking about.  Most seat belts were not designed
to hold car seats. And not all 100 models of car seats can fit all 900


 types of vehicles on our roads today.

        For Joe CollelaD,s [Koh-LEL-Ia] family, the consequences were
tragic.  Five years ago, JoeD,s three-year old niece Dana Hutchinson was
killed in a head on collision because her car seat was incompatible with
her family carD,s seat belts.   Ever since -- so that no other family has
to suffer the same tragedy -- Joe has worked full-time to improving car
seat safety and alerting parents to the dangers of poorly-fitting car
seats.

          A few years ago, my Administration appointed Joe to a blue ribbon
  panel of parents, consumer groups, medical professionals and car and seat
  makers to look into ways to make car seats safer and easier to install.
  Today, I am pleased to announce that their top recommendation -- a simple,
  universal system for attaching car safety seats -- will become the
  standard for every new car and light truck sold in our country. By the
  year 2002, the Department of Transportation will require every safety seat
. to have three standard attachments designed to fit three standard anchors
  in the back seat of every car. With this new rule -- with just three
  simple clicks of buckle -- we can save lives and prevent up to 18,000
  injuries each year.

        But the challenge of keeping our children safe in our cars and on
our roads is a neverending one. We must continue our nationwide efforts
to encourage all drivers and passengers to buckle up their seat belts, and
to use booster seats and seat belts for their older children. We must
work to make air bags are safer for children and smaller adults. And we
must press forward in our fight to keep more drunk drivers off our roads
by lowering the national drunk driving to standard to .08. Together we
can work to bring more Americans traveling on our roads safely back home
to their families and loved ones.
