TEXT:
You should have a copy. We should discuss what purpose this
letter serves.  It rambles on about legal issues raised (some
well-founded, others arguably not so, still others simply
mentioned as concerns) by the House and Senate bills, without
providing an easily discernible "bottom-line" of the changes we
want made. If we don't expect any changes to be made, why write a
long and boring legal critique of a (Senate-like) bill the
President may soon sign?
