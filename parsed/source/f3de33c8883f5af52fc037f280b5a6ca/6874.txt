Subject:         Kick Butts Meeting

Cabinet Affairs tentatively decided that we would try to have a stakeout
at the White House at 9 a.m. on Thursday with the VP and Cabinet
Secretaries who are going to go out on the road later in the day.  This
event would be a kick-off for the day as a whole. Barbara Woolley is going
to try to get 3 or 4 kids from the Campaign from Tobacco Kids to be there
as well.  Here is the list of folks they were thinking of the 9 a.m. event:

Erskine
Riley
Togo West
Janet Yellin?
Herman
Satcher?
Rubin

The VP's folks were not at the meeting -- so I don't know if this works in
his schedule.  Thanks, Mary
Howe
