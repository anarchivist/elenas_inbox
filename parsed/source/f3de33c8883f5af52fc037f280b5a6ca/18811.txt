TEXT:
Apparently Dorgan is going to introduce an open container issue in the
Senate and Leg Affairs is wondering if we should take a stand on this in
the remarks tomorrow.   They also think down the road this could be
another event to highlight the Pres's work on this stuff.

Any thoughts or guidance for us?   If you want to pursue this the contact                      ~
