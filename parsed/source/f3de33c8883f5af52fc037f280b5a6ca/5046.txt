TEXT:
Elena -- I sent OMB the memo about 10:45. I just left word at OMB asking
where the memo is in their process and telling them we'd like to make a
change given Bruce's conversation with the Senator.  Given Bruce's note
below, I'd recommend the following lead paragraph:

Changed graph:
Despite our many efforts we have been unable to persuade Senator Murray to
embrace our approach on welfare reform and domestic violence. We
recommend against supporting any legislative proposal in the Labor-HHS
conference such as hers that is at odds with our regulation. We believe
the issue would be better addressed through regulation; Secretary Shalala
strongly agrees.

The memo used to begin:
We recommend opposing any legislative proposals on welfare reform and
domestic violence waivers in the Labor-HHS conference -- including but not
limited to Senator MurrayO,s -- because we believe the issue will be
better addressed by HHSO,s forthcoming regulations.  Secretary Shalala
strongly concurs with our recommendation.

I think that's good. We might need to change the lead graph to suggest
that we have been unable to persuade Sen Murray to embrace our approach to
DV. We recommend against supporting any legislative proposal such as hers
that is at odds with our regulation, and we would be better off if we can
deal with this through regulation rather th~n a legislative fix.

Let me know what Mary says. I don't think we'll ever persuade Murray (or
the R's) to come around to our approach, but if we did, getting
congressional approval for the approach in our regulation wo~JsL-n9~_b~~__-.
such a bad thing, even if it complicates our lives a bit. [     P6/(b)(6)
