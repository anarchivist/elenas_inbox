TEXT: .
Jay Winsten of the Harvard Mentoring Project is very eager to come at
Harvard University. He has worked on this mentoring project in which all
the networks, and major cable stations have agreed to do PSA's
highlighting the importance of mentoring (ABC runs a lot of ads during
prime time).  He would come to discuss Hollywood's pro-social
responsibilities; he has worked with a lot of these folks and is willing
to help "open doors" at the meeting, whatever that means.

I'm not pushing him at all, I'm just putting him in the mix -- as we see
where we are with everyone else.  I think he'd be pretty soft on them, but
he would be able to talk about the positive things they have the power to
do.
