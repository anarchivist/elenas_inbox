TEXT:
I know you had said last week that we needed to oppose the Repub. bill
limiting lawsuits where volunteers are involved. But I seem to recall a
newspaper article in the past few days saying some kind of compromise was
struck which allowed 99 Senators to vote for it.  I think it protected the
volunteers themselves but not organizations. Do you 'know if we have
moderated our position to support this new version?
