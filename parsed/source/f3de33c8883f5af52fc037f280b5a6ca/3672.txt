 TEXT:
 The attached is the latest update on the Goodling amendment ; we suspect
 the most likely scenario is that Goodling will offer a sense of the
 Congress resolution.

 Riley has talked to John Porter, Obey and Gephardt from Las Vegas.   Porter
 told him that he is opposed to goodlings amendments and efforts to stop
 the tests, and will oppose him in Rules. He also said that Livingston will
 do the same--and Riley has placed a call to Livingston.  Obey told riley
 he will help, and Gephardt told Riley he would work the Dem. Caucus.

 The AFT and the Great CIty schools are targeting the Black and Hispanic
 Caucus. AFT is also trying to work moderate republicans. We are have
 also alerted the Business Roundtable, NAB and other business groups for
 help.

 I'll keep you posted.

            I just spoke with Tony McCann of House Approps.   He said that
       Goodling
           has three options for amendments.

             1. No national test until the Committee acts on legislation. RULES
       HAS
             SAID NO TO THIS APpROCH.

             2. A Sense of Congress resolution which would probably pass.

             3. an outright limition preventing the Administration from any more
             activity on the test which Goodling mayor may not offer.

            I just spoke with vic Klatt.  He confirmed that Goodling is
       testifying
            before the Rules Committee this evening to request that an amendment
            be made in order to, in effect, preclude any action on the test
            pending authorization by the Congress.

             Vic indicated that the Chairman would welcome any suggestions for
             alternative ways to achieve this end, but there certainly aren't any
             that would meet Goodling's aim and be acceptable to us. Therefore, I
             don't in all honesty see any value in getting involved in even trying
             to change what he is doing. Whether it is through a legislative
             provision that says that any work on the test must await
             authorization, a ban on use of funds in the bill for the test, or a
             cut in FIE funding with the intent of stopping the test, none of the
             options are desirable.

             I do think it would be useful to get materials up to the Democrats on
             the Rules Committee this afternoon that will highlight (1) that we do
             have the authority to develop the test and (2) that there are
             communities around the nation who are planning on the test being
             available.

             I would also suggest that you, Mike, may want to call John Porter on
             this.  I have a call in to the Appropriations Subcommittee staff to
             discuss, but especially with the First in the World Consortium in his
             district, and because of his desire to avoid controversial amendments
             to get his bill enacted, he may be persuaded to oppose this amendment.
