TEXT:
Diana and I spoke with Monahan to urge him to put the answers to
the two questions (waivers and 45 days) in a Revised Draft of the
Plan Guidance for Monday.
He says HHS will not agree to put anything in writing relating to
the waiver policy. They want a purely oral strategy.
I urged that (1) we are getting hit hard publicly for not
providing clear guidance to states on difficult questions; (2)
telling the 3 organizations on Monday orally does not guarantee
that all 50 states get a clear read on the definitive policy since
word-of-mouth from the meeting is likely to get mis-reported; (3)
leaving it to all of us to individually report this to those we
speak to is bound to lead to confusion.
I told him that if HHS would not agree to this, then the secretary
would have to call Leon to explain - or we might have to do it
ourselves for Monday.
That's how we lef.t it. I will do a note for John Angell so that
Leon is briefed if she calls.
I will also call Kevin to discuss.
