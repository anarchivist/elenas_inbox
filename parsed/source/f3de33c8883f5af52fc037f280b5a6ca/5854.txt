                              Remarks by Vice President AI Gore
                                 Child Care Announcement
                                Wednesday, January 7, 1998

       From the day we took office -- five years ago this month -- President Clinton and I have
had an unshakable commitment to making the toughest job in the world -- being a parent -- easier
for working Americans. And I believe we have achieved an enormous amount for those who are
balancing the demands of work and family.

        Family and Medical Leave has let millions of parents take time off from work to care for
their children. We expanded the Earned Income Tax Credit and increased the minimum wage --
so no parent working full-time has to raise their children in poverty. We expanded Head Start,
and created Early Head Start. We cut taxes for 27 million families with children -- insisting
that those tax cuts go to the hardest-pressed working families.

         Today, we take another giant step, to help parents succeed both at home and at work.
Today, with more children being raised by working parents than ever before -- and with the
leadership of President and Mrs. Clinton -- the issue of child care has been placed at the center of
our national debate. And that's exactly where it should be. Quality child care isn't a luxury,
it's a necessity. It not only gives parents peace of mind -- it gives children safe places to learn
and to grow. And as Tipper mentioned earlier, our Family Conferences have highlighted the
special role that after-school care plays in strengthening our children's future.

         For parents whose workday ends long after school has let out, after-school care means the
security of knowing that their children are in good hands, and not in harm's way. Every week, at
least five million children spend time as latch-key kids. At best, they walk home alone,
returning to empty houses. At worst, they end up on the streets, and in trouble. Children from
12 to 17 have the greatest risk of being involved with violent crime between the hours of2:00
and 6:00 p.m. -- that vast wasteland of time after the school bell has rung for our children -- but
before the work whistle has blown for their parents.

        Of course, getting kids off the street comers and into quality after-school care is about
more than just keeping them out of trouble.. It's about giving them something to say "yes" to.
We know that new economy requires our kids to learn more than ever before. But today,
children spend less than 20% of their waking hours in school. With after-school programs,
young people can expand their horizons of creativity, receive one-on-one mentoring and tutoring,
learn about computers, and learn the skills they will need to compete and win in the 21 st Century.
 It simply doesn't make sense to close down our schools every afternoon when they can serve as
sanctuaries of learning and centers of community all day long. Our schools -- at all
levels -- are public institutions built with public investments. And we'll get a better return
on that investment if we keep our school doors open and provide after-school programs for
our children. After-school care must be a part of our effort to build up America's public
schools, for the benefit of all Americans.

But this day would never have been possible without the leadership of President and Mrs.
Clinton. For five years, I have seen them take on the tough issues and stand up for hard-working
families. With a strong commitment and a clear vision, President and Mrs. Clinton are making
affordable and accessible child care a reality for millions of Americans. Now it is my honor to
introduce the President of the United States, America's first parent, Bill Clinton ...
