Welfare Reform and Fair Labor Standards Act/Minimum Wage

Background: As you know, this summer we worked with the labor unions in a successful effort
to defeat Republican legislation that would have weakened labor protections for welfare
recipients in workfare programs. The dispute began in May when the Department of Labor
issued its legal opinion that labor protections in current law apply to most people in state
workfare programs. This includes the minimum wage, health and safety, and anti-discrimination
protections. Governors of both parties argued strongly that this would make workfare
prohibitively expensive and create excessive administrative burdens on states. They worked
with Republicans on proposals to limit the application of labor laws, as well as to reduce the
welfare law's work requirements to make it easier for states to comply.

They also objected loudly to having to pay payroll taxes for those on workfare, even though the
Treasury Department has not yet ruled on whether FICA and FUTA taxes apply. (The Balanced
Budget Act made them ineligible for the EITC, with our support.) The FICAIFUTA exemption
is the only issue where we have indicated any willingness to compromise. In fact, we agreed to
such an exemption as part of a last-minute compromise that fell apart for other reasons.

Since the signing of the Balanced Budget Act, the Republican leadership has called this a top
priority for the remaining weeks of the session.  In August, Speaker Gingrich said ''the Clinton
Administration, working with the unions and the bureaucrats, is trying to undermine and destroy
welfare reform." Many Governors, including Carper and Chiles, remain very unhappy about
this issue.

Current Status: House Ways and Means Human Resources Subcommittee Chairman Clay Shaw
is quietly trying to gamer bipartisan support among Governors and House members for a bill to
address state concerns. The Administration has taken no position on it yet, but the confidential
draft we have seen has two major problems. First, it appears to weaken labor protections.
Although Shaw has stated that is not his intention, other Republicans may insist that this remain
in the bill. The unions are concerned about the draft bill, but have not yet taken a position on it.

Second, Shaw's draft bill significantly weakens the welfare law's work requirements. It
requires states to pay the minimum wage for work experience and community service programs,
but it limits the number of work hours to what states can afford to pay, based on the amount of
their welfare grant plus food stamps. The balance of a recipients' time could be spent on job
search and education activities. Thus, a welfare recipient could work 10 hours a week and do 10
hours of job search. Also, there is a concern that the legislation's definition of "work
experience" and "community service" may be so broad that nearly all subsidized work could be
defined as such, allowing low benefit states to require less than 20 hours of work from nearly all
their "working" recipients. The bill would also exempt workfare positions from FICA and
unemployment taxes, which we indicated during the balanced budget negotiations that we were
willing to do.
                                                                          Hex-Dump Conversion

Shaw originally planned to unveil this legislation this week, but problems with the Republican
caucus have pushed it back at least to next week. He apparently plans to move the measure as a
separate piece of legislation.


Privatization of Welfare Programs

Background: Labor unions, particularly AFSCME and SEIU, have waged a major fight against
state efforts to privatize their welfare, food stamp, and Medicaid functions. Last year's welfare
law allowed states to privatize the TANF welfare program without federal approval, and some
are moving to do so (Wisconsin, for example). However, states can privatize food stamps and
Medicaid only with pennission from the federal government.

After the Administration denied the state of Texas' request to privatize food stamp and Medicaid
earlier this year, the Republicans launched an effort to overturn this decision through legislation.
However, we were successful in defeating this effort. Governor Bush rejected a compromise
that would have allowed Texas to privatize in only part of the state.

Current Status: In contrast to the workfare fight, the Republicans have not resurrected the
privatization issue so far this fall.

The Administration has requests pending from Arizona and Wisconsin to privatize food stamp
and Medicaid functions. The Department of Agriculture is required by law to take some action
by October 3 on the Arizona request, which affects only 20% of the state. We are discussing
how to respond. There is no such deadline for Wisconsin.
