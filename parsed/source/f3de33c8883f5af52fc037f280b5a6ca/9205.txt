TEXT:
Bruce, re: your question about USA Today statement that downward trend in
caseloads is slowing , it looks like Rich Wolf used absolute numbers and
therefore his conclusion is WRONG.  In fact, as the attached analysis
shows, the rate of decline has held steady: case loads declined by 6%
between March 97 and June 97, and also declined by 6% between March 98 and
June 98 (depending on how many decimals you use, the rate of decline has
actually picked up slightly). On a national basis, the rate of caseload
decline -- both from month to month and year to year -- has held roughly
steady over the past year.  It appears that the slowing rates of decline
in some states (mostly small and medium) must be offset by increasing
rates of decline in other states.  Becky Blank has agreed to have CEA
staff do some more detailed analysis of state by state trends.
