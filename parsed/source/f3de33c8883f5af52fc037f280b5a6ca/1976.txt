TEXT:
The Corporation is touting an alternative to the Teach for America model
that they fund based at Notre Dame.  For what it's worth, here's the
details:

Recruits and trains recent college grads to serve as ArneriCorps members
teaching in severely undestaffed Catholic parochial schools across the
South.  Sponsored by Alliance for Catholic Education.

After 2 intensive summer trainings, two years of university courses, and
full time teaching, members earn a Masters of Arts in education.  Matched
with a mentor from that school. Their students do service-learning.   80
members last year; good record with principals.
