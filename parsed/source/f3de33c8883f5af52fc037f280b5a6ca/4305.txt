Since my voicemail was so convoluted and confused ... here's the info again.

The Chair of the US Commission on Immigration Reform, Shirley Hufstedler,
would like to brief the President on its final report report to Congress
which will be released on September 30. The Commission was created in the
Immigration Act of 1990 and has released interim reports on the
immigration-related issues facing the U.S.  The Chair of the Commission
has briefed the President on two of the interim reports (former chair was
Barbara Jordan) .

The final report to Congress will pull together the interim reports on
illegal and legal immigration, refugee policy, proposals to restructure
INS and new proposals on "Americanization"/ assimilation of new immigrants
into American society.

The chair will be in town on 9/29 and 9/30.  The Commission will have a
press conference on the morning of 9/30, so I think the briefing should be
on the 29th, if possible. Others attending briefing: Commissioner Bruce
Morrison, Commissioner Robert Charles Hill and Commission Executive
Director Susan Martin.

I think I covered everything you requested. Let me know if I missed
something. Thanks!---------------- Forwarded by Leanne A.

     Please email me the purpose and background (like what the meeting would be
     about and why it's important). Let me know of any other attendees and
     range of dates (also point out if there is a reason for the timing -- like
     it has to happen before the hill votes on ... ). I'll put it in the basic
     format and run the final back by you. Feel free to just leave it on my
     voice mail if it's easier. Thanks.
