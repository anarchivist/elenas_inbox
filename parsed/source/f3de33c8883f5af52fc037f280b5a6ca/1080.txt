TEXT:
Over the next half year or so, HHS is gonna put out a bucketful of
regulations on TANF.  I think we need to set up some kind of a
pre-consultation process with hhs so we can handle problems early and
expedite action.   Does it make sense for us to get together       possibly
with HHS - - to talk through how best to handle?
