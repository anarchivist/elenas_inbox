Administering Agency: Department of Labor should be the administering federal agency, and the local
Private Industry Councils (PICs) should administer funds distributed by formula to the local areas. (Support
House Committee positions, oppose Senate.)


Tier II

Funding Issues: To ensure funds are directed at cities:
·     Support at least 50% of funds distributed on competitive basis (Support Ways and Means)
·     Support city set-aside within competitive funds (Support House Ways and Means and House GOP
      Compromise)
·     Oppose small state set-aside (Oppose Senate)

Allowable Activities: ??Oppose addition of community service/work experience is added as an allowable
activity?? Public sector job creation already allowed. (Oppose House GOP Compromise).

Performance Bonus: ??Support Senate or suggest ways to strengthen, perhaps by instead requiring percentage of
Governor's funds be spent on performance bonuses.


Tier III

Geographic Targeting: Support higher "excess poverty factor" (7.5 vs. 5.0) which will better target high need
areas.

Individual Targeting: Support House GOP Compromise, which will target 70% of funds to the 10-15% of
caseload that is hardest to place.

Inter-Agency Coordination: ??Support allowing Governor to settle disputes between PIC and local T ANF
agencies with funding remitting to the Governor if PICs and T ANF don't adhere to agreement. (Support House
GOP Compromise).
