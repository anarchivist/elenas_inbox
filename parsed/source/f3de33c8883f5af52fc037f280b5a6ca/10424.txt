TEXT:
FYI -- Chris Edley called looking for the "fine paper on accountability"
Mike Smith told him about (that would be Mike's minor rewrite of my
accountability piece from last week).  I've shared it with him, and talked
him through it.  Chris likes it, and is pleased with the prospect of an
FY2000 initiative based on it.   I don't know how this will play into
whatever he may put on the table himself, though I hope his support of our
initiative reduces the odd he will pursue his own.
