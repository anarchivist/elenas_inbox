    This email is from Stephanie Streett, Amy Weiss Tobe, Jen Palmieri, Cherie
    Carter, Karen Skelton and Me.

    We have come together to organize a celebration for our Women friends on
    their way to new and exciting opportunities. We will be honoring the
    following WH Women:

                    Sylvia Mathews
                    Maria Echaveste
                    Susan Liss
                    Minyon Moore
                    Audrey Haynes


                     Linda Moore

     We would like to include you all as part of our organizing committee to
     throw a festive party for our top girls as they embark on their new
     journeys. We have made the following arrangements:

                     Date:              June 25, 1998
                     Time:              7pm - 9pm
                     place:             Music City Roadhouse
                                        1050 30th Street NW (Georgetown)
                     Refreshments:      Vittles and Beer will be provided

     As part of the organizing committee we have the following obligations to
     pull off a successful and enjoyable celebration:

                     1)  Invite women in your department that you think should
     be invited because of           their relationship or work with one
     of the women being honored.

                     2)  Invite any women outside the WH that you know are
     close with any of the           women being honored.

                     3)  To contribute $50 towards the overall cost of the
     party (if possible cash to Jen          Palmieri would be great --
     but we will get back to you on that.)

                    4)   To show up!!    And discourage gifts to any of the above
     honorees.

                     5) To offer any suggestions or ideas on how to·make this
     celebration a night that               our sister girls can always
     remember! !

     Thanks for your participation with this, it will be a fun night!  Please
     feel free to let any of us know if you are unable to participate as part
     of the organizing committee. Thank you.

      G. Smith, Collins, Dewine, Gregg, Grassley, D'Amato, Frist;

      2 Ds voted no: Robb, Ford

      The Senate will now vote on a budget point of order -- if there are not   60


 votes to waive the budget point of order (we don't expect there to be),
 then the bill will be sent back to committee.
