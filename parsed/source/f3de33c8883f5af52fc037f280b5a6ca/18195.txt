TEXT:
In her recent letter to the President, Angela Oh suggested that we create
something along the lines of an Indian Affairs Council, which is something
that Pres. Johnson created. The President noted that he thought we should
pursue this idea.  In so doing, I have come to learn that by an Executive
Order in 1994 an IWG on Native Americans and Native Alaskans was created,
and that you all are currently reviewing the final draft of a report to
Erskine or the President that summarizes the relevant activities of the
agencies vis-a-vis the tribal nations.

In order to be responsive to Oh's suggestion and the President's interest,
Sylvia asked me to find out what the status of your review is.  My sense
is that she is interested in seeing in completed as soon as practicable so
that we may respond to Angela.

Do I understand everything correctly?      Can you give me an update on where
we are? Thanks.
