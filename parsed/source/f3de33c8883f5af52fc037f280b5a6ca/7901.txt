Subject:         Re: Coverdell Bill

Richard:  The Coverdell bill (S. 1959) is sitting in the Labor Committee
and is unlikely to be acted upon.

The Senate is more likely to act on the Solomon bill (H.R. 3717) which
passed the House on Arpil 29 and is now on the Senate Legislative
Calendar.  There is also a rumor that Coverdell might offer his bill as an
amendment to the tobacco bill now pending in the Senate.
