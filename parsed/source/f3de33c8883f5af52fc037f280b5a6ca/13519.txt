Sounds good to me.
Their stories are the most compelling reason for the veto.
We will not plan on preparing any further paper for the event
(stories, summaries, articles, etc.) unless you specifically tell
us otherwise.
We are looking at a 3:30 prebrief for the women - probably at the
women's office, but someone will let you know specifically where.
Thanks for your help.
