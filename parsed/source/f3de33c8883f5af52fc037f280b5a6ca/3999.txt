                                                DRAFT -- August 16, 1997

                    We must make the thirteenth and fourteenth years of education -- at least two years of college --
                   just as universal in America by the 21st Century as a high school education is today, and we must
                   open the doors to all Americans.
                                                              -- President Bill Clinton
                                                                  State of the Union Address, February 4, 1997

            Today, as students prepare to head back to school, President Clinton encouraged families to take
            advantage of the new higher education opportunities contained in the historic balanced budget legislation.
            He also urged students and their parents to accept responsibility for preparing for college early, by
            choosing tough courses and working hard in school, beginning in students' middle school and junior high
            school years. To help families map out a bright future, the President released a new handbook on getting
            ready for college early, and a parents' guide to the new education tax cuts.

            WHILE MORE STUDENTS ARE GOING TO COLLEGE, TOO MANY OTHERS MISS THE
            BENEFITS OF A POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION. In 1996, sixty-five percent of high school
            graduates were attending college by the following fall, an all-time high. Yet far too many of our young
            people still lack a college education or advanced training, limiting their ability to prosper in the 21 st
            Century knowledge economy. College graduates are half as likely to be unemployed as high school
            graduates. Moreover, on average, a college graduate will earn $600,000 more over the course of a
            lifetime than a high school graduate -- and this gap is widening. Someone with an associate's degree
            from a two year college earns more than a high school graduate, as well.

            THE NEW TAX CUTS SIGNED BY THE PRESIDENT WILL HELP MAKE COLLEGE MORE
            AFFORDABLE FOR STUDENTS AND FAMILIES. President Clinton's new Hope Scholarship
            makes the first two years of college universally available, providing students with a tax credit of up to
            $1,500 -- about the same as the average tuition at a local community college. Moreover, college juniors
            and seniors, as well as graduate and professional students, and adults who want to go back to school will
            be eligible for a Lifetime Learning tax credit worth 20% of the first $5,000 of tuition and fees through the
            year 2002 (and 20% of the first $10,000 beginning in 2003). The new law also allows parents and
            grandparents to make penalty-free withdrawals from their IRAs to pay for higher education expenses, and
            enables them to open new Education IRAs where they can invest $500 per child every year to build up
            money, tax free, for college. In addition to the tax cuts, the balanced budget agreement also provides the
            largest Pell Grant increase in two decades, as sought by the President; Congress must fulfill this promise
            next month.

            STUDENTS SHOULD BEGIN PREPARING FOR COLLEGE EARLY BY TAKING TOUGH
            COURSES IN MIDDLE SCHOOL AND HIGH SCHOOL. Students who take algebra and geometry
            by the end of eighth and ninth grades are much more likely to go on to college than students who don't;
            in a national study, only 26 percent oflow-income students who did not take geometry went on to
            college, compared with 71 percent of those who did. Back to School is an ideal time for parents to talk
            with teachers, principals, and guidance counselors to make sure students sign up for a rigorous classes
            that will keep them on track for college. A new handbook, "Getting Ready for College Early," will help
            parents of students in middle school and junior high with choosing courses and other basics of college
            planning -- like where to fmd out how much college really costs and what resources are available make
            college affordable. "Getting Ready for College Early," together with "A Families' Guide to the 1997
            Education Tax Cuts," is available free of charge from the U.S. Department of Education by calling
            1-800-USA-LEARN.
