TEXT:
I haven't seen them, yet -- they are going to send me over a copy.   In our
phone coversation, they told me that the draft regulations provide a fair
degree of flexibility for the states to meet the minimum requirements
 (under the law, states would have to enact community notification laws or
risk losing 10% of Byrne Formula Grant funding --- funding that goes to
the states for law enforcement purposes) .

        States can't comply by just providing information to local law
enforcement or for employment purposes.  Some states were already trying
to comply by just notifying schools and Justice told them more was
needed. However, New Jersey has a state law that has risk levels and the
level of notice is determined by the risk level   (I assume that means that
sexual assault of an adult would be notice to law enforcement but sexual
child molester would be schools, neighborhood notice, etc. too) and that
is enough.  Some states have call-in numbers in which you can ask for a
list of where convicted child molesters live, etc.   I think she said that
would be in compliance.

        I will get you a copy of the guidelines when they come in so you
can see if they make sense.

        Supposedly, a majority of states have some form of community
notification law and DoJ thinks that most states will have already
complied with the Megan's Law regulations.
