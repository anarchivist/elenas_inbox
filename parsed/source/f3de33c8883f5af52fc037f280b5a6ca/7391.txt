                     Question & Answer on Immigration: H-IB visas
                                    May 1,1998

Q:   What is your position regarding the call by industry to increase the number of
     temporary visas available for highly skilled foreign workers?

A:   I believe that the first step in increasing the availability of skilled workers for industry
     must be increasing the skills of U.S. workers and helping the labor market work better to
     match employers with U.S. workers. Therefore, substantial additional efforts by industry
     to increase the skill level of U.S. workers and needed improvements in the H-IB visa
     program to protect U.S. workers by targeting the program's use to employers
     experiencing genuine skills shortages are necessary prerequisites for me to support any
     short-term increase in the number ofH-IB visas available for temporary foreign workers.

Q:   Yesterday the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration approved legislation
     that increases the number ofH-IB visas for temporary foreign workers_ What is
     your position regarding this legislation?

A:   I am pleased that Representatives Smith's bill is consistent with one of my primary
     objectives, insofar as it links a temporary increase in the H-IB cap to the enactment of
     meaningful reforms to the H-IB visa program. The bill would help ensure that U.S.
     workers would not lose their jobs to a temporary foreign worker and that qualified U.S.
     workers would have the opportunity to fill a job before a temporary foreign worker is
     hired. Moreover, the bill modestly expands enforcement authority to help prevent
     employer abuses of the H-IB program. These reforms will effectively target H-IB visas
     to industries experiencing skill shortages.

     Unfortunately, the bill does not contain any provision for additional training opportunities
     for U.S. workers. Training is a vital component of my strategy to address the long-term
     demand for highly skilled U.S. workers and to enhance the international competitiveness
     of important U.S. industries. I am also concerned that the increase in the annual number
     of H-I B visas reflected in this bill is too large, although I agree that the increase should
     be temporary.

     I would be pleased to support this bill if it included meaningful training provisions and a
     modest reduction in the level of increase in the annual H-I B visa cap.

Q:   What is your position regarding Senator Abraham's bill?

A:   Senator Abraham's bill includes a large increase in the annual number of visas and
     provides no meaningful reform of the H -I B program. I would be happy to work with
     members ofthe Senate to develop a bill that is more consistent with the Administration's
     principles.

Background

H-1B visas are temporary work visas that allow "highly skilled" immigrants (with a BA or
equivalent) to work in this country for up to six years. Under current law, the number ofH-lB
visas is capped at 65,000 per year. Last year, this cap was reached for the first time. The
information technology (IT) industry strongly supports raising the annual cap to address what
they maintain is a shortage of U.S. workers with IT skills. Others, including the Department of
Labor, challenge the industry's conclusions about a shortage and are concerned that the current
H-1B program does not target its use to employers who are experiencing skills shortages.

Though the Administration has never before squarely addressed the issue of the cap, we have
consistently emphasized training and re-training U.S. workers to enable them to move into jobs
within the high-tech industry. Also, since 1993 we have sought reforms to the H-1 B program
that would target their use to industries with genuine short-term skill shortages.

On April 2, 1998, the Administration (Secretaries Daley and Herman and Attorney General
Reno) sent a letter to Congress that opposed Senator Abraham's bill (that provided for a large,
temporary increase in the cap and the expansion of an existing scholarship program for
low-income students, but did not provide meaningful reform of the H-1B program) and endorsed
the approach advocated by Senator Kennedy (that would effect a temporary increase in the cap,
but also included reform to the H-1B program and increased training for U.S. workers). On
April 30, 1998, the Administration sent a letter to Congress supporting Representative Lamar
Smith's bill, if it is modified to include meaningful training provisions and a more modest
increase in the cap.
