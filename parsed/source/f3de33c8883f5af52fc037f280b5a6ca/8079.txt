     Subject:         Net Revenue Language for Gramm Amendment

     Here is language to modify the definition of net revenues in S. 1415 to
     specify that deposits into the tobacco trust fund are net of the costs of
     the Gramm amendment. This allows all of the existing percentage
     allocations of program spending from the fund to remain in place (although
     at lower dollar amounts, of course) .




     Amendment to S. 1415 to Reduce Net Revenues for
      Marriage penalty Tax Expenditure

     Amend Sec. 401 (c        (2) defining net revenues in the Tobacco Trust Fund as
     follows:

       (c) Net Revenues. For purposes of subsection (b), the term "net
     revenues" means the amount estimated by the Secretary of ,the Treasury
     based on the excess of

           (1) the amounts re,ceived in the Treasury under subsection (b), over

      (2) the decrease in the taxes imposed by chapter 1 and chapter 52 of the
     Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and other offsets, resulting from the
     amounts received under subsection (b). and



 (3) the decrease in the taxes imposed by chapter 1 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986 resulting from the provisions of Title [XX] of this
Act.
