1000 New Teachers for Native American Students

Only two-thirds of Native Americans successfully complete high school, a figure much lower
than for the rest ofthe population. Recognizing this need, the President has included in his
budget a proposal to train 1000 new Native American teachers who will teach in areas that will
benefit Native Americans. The President's goal is to both increase the number of American
Indians entering the teaching field and to enhance the skills ofthose already in the pipeline.
This $10 million proposal has three parts: (1) a program that will support the training of 1000
new American Indian and Alaska Native teachers over 5 years by providing for their expenses
while attending school, including child care; (2) funding for 20 grants to educational institutions,
with priorities for those institutions that partner with tribal colleges or consortia including tribal
colleges, to create teacher training programs in Native American communities; and (3) funding
for five ofthe 20 grantees to create professional development centers to provide continuing
education for in-service teacher training to improve the quality ofteaching in Native American
communities.

Providing Basic Health Care for Native Americans

The President's budget proposes an increase for the Indian Health Service (IHS) of $170
million or 8 percent over the FY 1999 level. This increase would enable IHS to continue
expanding accessible and high-quality health care to its 1.4 million Native American service
users. The budget enables IHS to further enhance current levels of direct health care
services, including providing 34,000 breast cancer screening mammographies to Native
American women between ages 50-69; creating 44 new dental unit teams to provide an
additional 25,000 dental visits; reducing the incidence of complications related to chronic
diseases such as diabetes through clinical monitoring and health promotion on life style
changes; and enabling approximately 130 new community-based public health nurses to
provide outreach activities, including home visitations, well-child examinations,
immunizations, prenatal care, health fairs, follow-up visits, and missed clinical
appointments. Within the overall IHS increase, the budget continues to support Tribal
self-determination by proposing a $35 million (+17%) increase for contract support costs,
to cover the costs of existing tribal contracts and compacts.
The President will also continue his efforts to elevate the Director ofIHS to the position of
Assistant Secretary.

Improving Food Safety with Increased Inspections and Surveillance

President Clinton will recommend increasing funds by $105 million -- or 12 percent -- in his
budget proposal to ensure food safety by improving inspections for both domestic and imported
food and by enhancing surveillance efforts. The President's proposal would significantly
expand inspections of domestic food products by enabling the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA), to use more than 60 new inspectors to inspect, at least once each year, every domestic
manufacturer of high-risk food products (generally, products that are not cooked by consumers)
from the current level of every 3 to 4 years. Additional funds for USDA would permit the broad

                                                                              Automated Records Management System
                                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion

      expansion of its science-based, prevention-oriented meat and poultry inspection system, called
      Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP). The President's budget would also increase
      scrutiny of imported food products by permitting the FDA to more than double the number of
      inspections conducted offoreign food processors. The President's budget also includes a
      significant component for surveillance and research activities. To help officials track pathogens
      back to their source and prevent outbreaks of foodbome illnesses from spreading, the Centers for
      Disease Control (CDC) will use new funds to almost double the number oflaboratories that do
      "DNA fingerprinting" of foodbome pathogens.

      Ensuring Equal Pay

      According to the Department of Labor, the average woman who works full-time earns just
      74 cents for each dollar that an average man earns. For women of color, the gap is even
      wider. This gap is, in part, attributable to differing levels of experience, education, and
      skill. However, even after accounting for these factors, a significant pay gap still remains
      between men and women in similar jobs. Recognizing this wage disparity, the President
      proposes a $14 million equal pay initiative for the Equal Employment Opportunity
      Commission (EEOC) and the Department of Labor. This funding would allow the EEOC
      to advance outreach to businesses and employees to educate them about the legal
      requirements for paying equal wages, provide technical assistance, improve training for
      EEOC employees to better identify wage discrimination issues, and launch a public service
      announcement campaign to highlight the wage gap. The Department of Labor will
      continue monitoring pay equity to reduce occupational segregation; provide enhanced
      technical assistance through the Internet such as providing descriptions of industry best
      practices; increase outreach and education; and provide a focused effort on women in
      non-traditional jobs by identifying best practices and assisting contractors in recruiting
      and developing qualified individuals in non-traditional occupations. The President also
      will continue to call on Congress to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act which improves the
      enforcement of wage discrimination laws and provides for research, education, training of
      EEOC staff, and outreach on this important subject.
