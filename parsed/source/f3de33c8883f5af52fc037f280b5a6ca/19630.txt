TEXT:
I completed convesations with Speaker Villaraigosa, Mayor Serna,
Supervisor Molina, Arturo Vargas (NALEO) and Richie Ross. In addition, we
completed heads-up calls and faxed Riley's statement to the IGA list of
local and state electeds I shared with you. The reaction of the leaders I
spoke to yesterday was universally positive both to the message and the
timing. I think the news reports are what we wanted today as well.
