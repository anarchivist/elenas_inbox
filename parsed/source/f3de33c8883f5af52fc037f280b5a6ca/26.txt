                 S. 1396 - Interstate Commerce Commission Sunset Act of 1995
                          (Pressler (R) Pennsylvania and 6 cosponsors)

The Administration strongly supports the termination of the Interstate Commerce Commission
(ICC), and has proposed legislation (H.R. 1436) for this purpose. Eliminating those elements of
economic regulation that no longer enhance productivity and competitiveness is a primary
Administration priority.

S. 1396, however, would accomplish no genuine deregulation but would simply merge the ICC's
most burdensome regulatory elements with the Federal Maritime Commission in a new Federal
entity. The Administration therefore strongly opposes S. 1396 unless it is amended to:

o       Eliminate the proposed Intermodal Surface Transportation Board. Rather than
        abolish all non-productive economic regulatory functions currently performed by
        the ICC, S. 1396 simply merges them with the FMC in new independent agency.
        (Although the new organization would technically be located in the Department of
        Transportation, it would not be responsible to the Secretary and would function
        much like the ICC does today.) Any regulations which continue to serve a
        useful purpose (such as protection of captive shippers under the Staggers Act),
        should be enforced by the Department of Transportation, not a new ICC.
        Nonproductive economic regulations affecting the trucking, intercity bus,
        household goods freight forwarder, broker, pipeline, interstate water carrier,
        interstate rail passenger, and ferry industries should, as the Administration has
        proposed, be terminated.

    o   Delete the extension of antitrust immunity for the railroad and motor-carrier
        industries. Consumers and rail and motor carriers should be permitted to
        benefit from the removal of unproductive economic regulatory burdens. This
        will not occur ifrail and motor carriers are permitted to impose artificially high
        rates on consumers. Price-fixing is not tolerated in the economy as a whole, and
        should not be permitted in the rail and motor carrier industries.

    o   Conform rail merger review standards to those which apply to other industries.
        Mergers in the railroad industry should be reviewed by the Department of Justice
        under the same standards which apply to other industries, rather than under a
        separate standard interpreted by a successor to the ICC.

o       Delete unilateral changes in rail labor protection provisions. The Administration
                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion


believes that the existing standards enable carriers to improve efficiency while
protecting the interests of affected employees, and therefore should not be
changed by Congress. Should a legislative solution be deemed necessary,
however, the Administration believes that it should afford no less protection than
comparable provisions in H.R. 2539, "The ICC Termination-Act of 1995," as
passed by the House. In addition, rail employee protection provisions should be
administered by the Department of Labor which already administers several
similar provisions, rather than by a new entity.
