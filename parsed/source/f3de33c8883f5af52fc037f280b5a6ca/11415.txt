TEXT:
Barbara Chow has looked at the latest draft and sent it back to her staff
to respond to an issue that.you raised regarding the 10-day rule and to
add a paragraph that discusses what is happening in states/communities in
the absence of any regulations being issued.

Barbara expects them to turn around another draft later in the afternoon.
I have been commenting directly to her staff on each version.  Barbara
wasn't sure whether this next version would be "final", (she still plans
to add some langauge to the introduction that isn't currently reflected)
but she welcomed your review of either these interim versions or the
"final" draft .
