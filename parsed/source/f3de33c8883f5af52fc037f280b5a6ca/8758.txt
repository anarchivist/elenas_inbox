TEXT:
This commentary on the new Camel campaign ran in Advertising Age (I
believe yesterday) .  Garfield appears to be their regular ad critic. I
am checking to see how respected he is. But from this piece, it looks
like an issue we should jump on asap.

                 Cigarette ads revive spirit of
                                  Joe Camel

                                     by Bob Garfield

                                    Advertiser: R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.
                                    Agency: Mezzina/Brown, New York
                                    Ad Review rating: One Star

                                    Mighty nasty.

                                    The new slogan for Camel cigarettes and
Camel Lights from
                                    Mezzina/Brown, New York, is supposed to
be "Mighty tasty."
                                    And it would seem to have a rather pleas
ing combination of
                                    directness and playfulness--until you
realize what they are up to,
                                    which, of course, is the usual.

                                    The usual trolling for adolescents,   that
is.

                                    Having taken a stab at more adult
imagery, the brand that
                                     improved its market share and wrecked its
industry with the
                                    infamous Joe Camel cartoon is backsliding
into juvenalia with a
                                    smart-alecky campaign that trades on a


Joe Camel-like dose of
                                   attitude.

                                   One of the spreads shows a handsome young
man running for his
                                   life from a shabby farmhouse, where the
incensed, geezerish
                                   farmer is chasing him with a double
-barrel shotgun, and the young,
                                   blond farmer's daughter is in bed,
sucking on a post-coital Camel.
                                   The farmer is old and dresses like Elmer
Fudd. The fleeing
                                   traveling salesman is young and buff, so
guess who we're
                                   supposed to be rooting for?

                                   On one level, for the shallow and
unworldly, this ad trades on the
                                   threadbare fantasy. But for extra credit
it takes a self-mocking
                                   tone in discovery of its own inner
cliche. A prominent "viewer
                                   Discretion Advised" warning in the corner
calls attention to: lOSS.
                                   Satisfied Smoking. FV. Farm Violence. AN.
Animal Nudity."

                                   Another ad has the same approach. It
depicts the butler and the
                                   babe-alicious maid in an aristocratic
home conspiratorially defiling
                                   the meal with a cigarette ash before
serving their mean employers,
                                   who are in the opulent dining room
callously ringing the service
                                   bell.

                                   The scenario plays off the insipid noble
poor vs. evil rich
                                 class-hatred mentality that made
"Titantic" such a hit with teen-age
                                 girls. But, once again, the ad comments
on itself via the warning
                                 panel (IR. Idle Rich. ABR. Abusive Bell
Ringing. PA.
                                 Premeditated Ashing.).

                                   This sort of postmodern self-reference
isn't as clever as it thinks, it
                                   is, nor even all that amusing. What it
is, however, is precisely the
                                   tack taken by many marketers to appeal to
the supposedly
                                   media-wise younger generation.

                                   How young?

                                   Very young. For instance, the principal
practitioner of this strategy
      ...
                                                                                  Page 3 of3


                                     is Sprite.

                                     Meantime,the whole idea of lampooning
    viewer-discretion
                                     advisories seems calculated to ridicule
    and undercut the whole
                                     class of authoritarian warnings--such as,
    urn, just to name one:
                                     SMOKING CAUSES LUNG CANCER, HEART DISEASE,
                                     EMPHYSEMA AND MAY COMPLICATE PREGNANCY.

                                     Hmmm, let's see. Who most responds to
    attacks on authority? Is it
                                     adults? No, not adults. Why--you know
    what?--it's teen-agers!
                                     For gosh sakes, it's probably just a
    coincidence.

                                     It's probably just a coincidence that,
    after being shamed into
                                     retiring Joe Camel, and replacing him
    with a sophisticated (and
                                     quite magnificent) campaign aimed clearly
    at adults, and watching
                                     sales flatten, R.J. Reynolds is back with
    ads using the psychology,
                                     sensibilities and iconography of the MTV
    crowd.

                                    This stuff isn't as nakedly despicable as
    Joe Camel, who seduced
                                    not only teen-agers but small children.
    And it's tempting to give
                                    RJR the benefit of the doubt when it
    argues this campaign is aimed
                                     at over-21-year-olds.

                                     But, once again, advertising is a
    shotgun, not a rifle, and the issue
                                     is who unavoidably--or
    intentionally--will be caught in the spray.
                                     Considering the company's history, and
    these ads' sly assault on
                                     protectors of the commonweal, giving RJR
    the benefit of any
                                     doubt would be, shall we say, mighty
    hasty.
