MEMORANDUM FOR ERSKINE BOWLES

THROUGH:                   Franklin D. Raines

FROM:              Donald R. Arbuckle

SUBJECT:                   Heads-up on EPAC,s proposed rule on the Identification of
Lead
                           Standard


         We expect to complete our review this Friday of EPAD,s proposed
standards that identify hazardous levels of lead-based paint,
lead-contaminated dust, and lead-contaminated soil for residential
housing.   EPA estimates costs associated with this rule of more than $50
billion over the next 50 years.   These costs represent the lead hazard
testing and abatement likely to occur in response to the new proposed
standard. EPA estimates the benefits to range from approximately $40
billion by one model to $160 billion by another model. The benefits are
largely from the avoidance of IQ loss due to lead exposure.

         In the course of our review, EPA agreed to expand their discussion
of key elements of the proposal, such as the effect of different levels of
soil standards, in order to set out alternative options for public
comment.   EPA has also agreed to conduct further analysis of these    .
alternatives before submitting a final rule in order to provide a more
complete picture of their preferred option and the identified alternatives.

        Environmental and child safety groups support a more stringent set
of hazard standards than that proposed by EPA.  In contrast, associations
of real estate agents and multi-family dwelling owners support less
stringent options. On balance, we believe the rule fairly describes
EPAU,S preferred standards while also preserving the option to go with
alternative standards if compelled by public comment or further analysis.

           Please let me know if you have any questions.
