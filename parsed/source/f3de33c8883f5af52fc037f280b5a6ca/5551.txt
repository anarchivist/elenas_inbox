TEXT:
2 questions about this initiative -- which you can ignore if we don't have
time to answer.

First, why $lOO million? That's the lot for a program that doesn't buy
much tangible (beyond the $30 million for 30 communities). I would be
happy with $60m.

Second, are the disparities on these 6 diseases all race-related? What
happens when you control for class? Poor uninsured whites must do badly,
too.  I'm just wondering whether we can make this more consistent with our
overall opportunity agenda.
