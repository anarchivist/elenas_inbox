TEXT:
Event is at 2:30 in 450 OEOB wi
        Slater
        four former DOT Secretaries
        Gov. Glendening
        Possibly Senators Chafee and Lautenberg
        Auto and insurance industries
        air bag coalition
        safety and health advocacy groups.

Event will announce national goals and highlight:
        3 Presidential actions -- NEXTEA grants (previously released) ;
SAFETEA soft            sanctions, and EO (still being cleared)
        Broad support for the initiative.

OUTSTANDING ISSUES

DOT's on notice you may want to do prebrief for WH press on two EOs wi
Browner.  Slater's out of town until 1:15 pm doing event for Gore in
Detroit, however.     Elena -- Brad told me you talked to him -- how
should we move forward from here? Are the communications folks engaged?

Also, we are not doing WH fact sheet for seat belt event -- just DOT press
release per WH press.  If we do EO briefings,  will we need any other
paper?
