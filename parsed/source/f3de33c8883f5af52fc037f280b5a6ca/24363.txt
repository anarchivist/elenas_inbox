MEMORANDUM FOR ERSKINE BOWLES

THROUGH:              Jack Lew

 FROM:        Donald R. Arbuckle

SUBJECT:              FDA Final Rule on MedGuides


        We are about to conclude review of a final FDA rule requiring the
distribution of patient labeling (known as medication guides or
D&MedGuidesD8) for selected prescription drugs and biological products.
The labeling is intended to provide patients necessary information so that
they can use their medications more safely and effectively.   FDAD,s
proposed MedGuide rule, published in August of 1995, would have applied to
all prescription drugs and biological products.  However, following
intense criticism from health professionals and industry officials, and
legislation enacted by Congress which limited FDAD,s ability to regulate
in this area, FDA has revised the rule to apply only to products that pose
a serious and significant public health concern (only approximately 4-5
new products or product classes a year) .

        FDA believes that opposition to the rule will be minimal. Most
health professionals have known that FDA was moving forward with the rule
and have not provided significant feedback.  FDA also has stated that
Congress, at the time the MedGuide legislation was enacted, had agreed
that this part of the rule could go forward.

              Please let me know if you have any additional questions.
