RE:                 ITEM VETO - ADMINISTRATION LANGUAGE

        FYI -- Attached is our line
o
-item veto language, which I've
given to Bob Damus for inclusion in the budget enforcement title
of the January 18 bill.   (We haven't discussed whether to include
this in the budget enforcement title, or as a separate title
but it probably makes sense to include this as a "budget
enforcement" item since this will arguably assist future
Administrations in living within the discretionary caps) .
        The attached revised draft" reflects comments I received
earlier today. Note that the section setting forth congressional
procedures for consideration of disapproval bills has been
omitted, on the grounds that we should not be proposing to the
Congress how to structure its own internal procedures. Also, the
sections pertaining to an advisory report by the JCT on targeted
tax benefits, and an annual GAO report, have been deleted, on the
same grounds.
        Finally -- with respect to direct spending and targeted tax
benefits -- DOJ has appealed the use of the term "cancel";   they
continue to prefer "suspension," on the grounds that suspension
might be construed as less similar to "repeal," and therefore


less constitutionally suspect.  However, this draft uses the term
"cancel," as defined in section 4 of the bill, because it is our
understanding that the Senate has settled on this term, and it is
in our interest to provide input into defining "cancel" -- rather
than continuing to insist on "suspend."
WORD PERFECT FILE FOLLOWS.
