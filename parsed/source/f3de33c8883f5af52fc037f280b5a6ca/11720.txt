                     Q AND A ON CLINIC SECURITY FUNDING
                                January 14, 1999


Q.   How would the Administration's proposed clinic security funding have addressed
     the clinic bombing in North Carolina that took place over the weekend?

A.   The Administration's FY2000 budget request includes $4.5 million for DOJ's Office of
     Justice Programs to provide security assessments and, where necessary, security
     improvements to women's health care clinics at high risk of violence. A security
     assessment is a review of a facility by a security expert to identify vulnerabilities and
     recommend ways to address them. Security improvements can include measures like
     closed circuit camera systems, improved lighting, motion detectors, alarm systems,
     bullet-resistant windows, and access control systems. The clinic in North Carolina has
     received threats in the past, and therefore could be determined to be at high risk of
     violence, enabling it to receive fill~ds for security improvements.

     This clinic safety proposal builds on the Justice Department's National Task Force on
     Violence Against Health Care Providers, which coordinates the investigation of violence
     against women's health care clinics nationwide. The Task Force has begun working
     closely with local authorities and U.S. Attorneys investigating acts of violence against
     clinics by: coordinating national investigative efforts; creating an investigative
     clearinghouse for information related to clinic violence; and providing training to federal,
     state and local law enforcement personnel. The Task Force will also investigate this
     recent bombing in North Carolina to fully determine its connection to past attacks on
     clinics.
