CBO Analysis of Medicare Buy-in. Late this week, the Congressional Budget Office released
extremely positive estimates on your Medicare buy-in proposal. CBO's estimates confirm that
your proposal will have no notable impact on the Medicare Trust Fund and projects even greater
participation and lower costs than HCF A initially estimated. In fact, they assume that your
proposal would provide coverage for 410,000 individuals, 33 percent higher than our internal
estimates. Moreover, they projected that beneficiaries would have to pay less in premiums after
they tum 65 to cover the costs of the buy-in. We are hopeful that these estimates will give a
needed shot in the arm to this policy and its perceived viablity. Also, we believe that Senator
Moynihan will likely introduce this legislation sometime in mid-March.

AMA Speech. On Monday, you are scheduled to give a speech to the American Medical
Association (AMA) to outline your shared goals of enhancing quality in the health care system,
stopping children from smoking, and providing health insurance for as many children as possible.
 This is also a great opportunity to thank the AMA for their extremely helpful efforts to confirm
the new Surgeon General, Dr. David Satcher. This will be the first time you have addressed the
AMA and the first time that any President has spoken to the AMA since Ronald Reagan did in
1983. You will release a new patients' bill of rights survey prepared by the Domestic Policy
Council that documents how many states have enacted the consumer protections recommended
by your Quality Commission. Specifically, the survey will report that more than forty-three
states have enacted one or more of the consumer protection laws, and that more than twenty-five
of these states have Republican Governors. The report will also point out, however, that state
laws are limited in scope and they have no jurisdiction over 140 million Americans.

The AMA strongly supports Federal legislation, including one provision that is particularly
objectionable to the business community -- the enforcement of these standards through the
removal of current ERISA barriers that in essence prohibit litigation. As controversial as
this provision is, it is now included in the Norwood bilI, which the AMA endorses, as well
as the Democratic leadership bilI, which will likely be introduced later this week. The
Administration has yet to take a position on the best way to enforce the patient protections,
primarily because the ensuing business opposition resulting from such an endorsement
might prove so great as to stop any patients' rights legislation from becoming law. This
speech will lead off a number of quality events that will take place this week, including the final
report from your Quality Commission and the likely introduction of Democratic patients' bill of
rights outlined below.

Final Quality Commission Meeting and Report. On Thursday and Friday, your Quality
Commission is scheduled to release its final report on the second part of its charge: how best to
develop and use health care standards for both businesses and consumers. There are currently
numerous quality problems in the health care system, such as avoidable errors, over utilization
and variation in services. For example, each year 80,000 women undergo unnecessary
hysterectomies and more than one million Americans are injured as a result of avoidable errors.
The Commission is proposing a Quality Council to develop goals to improve health care quality
and strategies to achieve these goals. They are also suggesting a Quality Forum, comprised of
private and public sector purchasers, that will develop a consistent set of health quality measures,
so that meaningful comparisons can be made. This aspect of the Commission has not received
                                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion

 as much attention as the consumer bill of rights but many health policy experts as well as a range
 of providers, consumers, and insurers believe it may have the greatest potential to positively
 affect the health care system. Since this is the final report of an unusually successful
 Commission, the media is clearly interested in their findings. However, because of the
 Democratic Leadership's intention to introduce a bill next week and because of scheduling
 conflicts we have yet to make a final decision as to whether it is advisable to hold a Presidential
 event around the release of the report.

  Democratic Patients' Bill of Rights Legislation Bill. Next Thursday, the Democratic
  leadership is scheduling an event to unveil their patient protections bill. This proposed
  legislation will receive a broad-based support among Democrats in the House and less diverse
  support in the Senate. However, it includes a number of controversial enforcement provisions
  that allow remedies through state courts as well as new benefits requirements which would direct
  all health plans to cover all clinical trials, include a mandatory point-of-service option, pay for all
  services associated with mastectomies, and breast reconstructive surgery. The business
  community will no doubt argue that these provisions will lead to uncontrollable litigation, higher
  premiums, and more uninsured Americans. While you will clearly want to be supportive of this
  Democratic effort, this legislation stands little chance of passing the Congress and as such we
  may want to be careful about our positioning as it is introduced. In particular, too strong a
. signal of support may significantly accentuate the business community's opposition to this
  legislation and alienate particular Republican members such as Congressman Hastert, Thomas,
  Bilirakis, Bliley, and others who have indicated a desire to work with us on the consumer bill of
  rights. We will be holding an internal meeting on Monday to develop a recommendation on
  how you should respond to this bill.

 Update on Kyl Private Contracting Issue. Last week, Nancy-Ann DeParle testified before the
 Senate Finance Committee on Senator Kyl's legislation on private contracting. Senator Kyl's
 bill makes it much easier for physicians to privately contract out with Medicare beneficiaries,
 thus allowing these providers to charge whatever amount they desired to these beneficiaries.
 With the exception of Senator Kyl and United Seniors, a right wing aging group, all of the
 witnesses in the hearing were extremely critical of this legislation. They particularly focused on
 concerns that this legislation has great potential to increase fraud and to limit access to needed
 services. Moreover, Chairman Roth castigated the United Seniors Organization for scaring
 hundreds of thousands of older Americans into incorrectly believing that they could not obtain a
 service or pay for a service that is not covered by Medicare. Most policy and political analysts,
 including the AMA -- one of the Kyl amendment's most ardent supporters -- believe that this
 legislation is dead at least for this Congress.

 Missouri Update. Early next week, the Department of Health and Human Services will be
 meeting with Governor Carna4an's staff to get resolution on the approval of their children's
 health insurance proposal. This follows Governor Carnahan's request to you and the Vice
 President for a rapid response to their proposal. They have previously insisted on retaining a
 financing mechanism that HHS interpreted to be illegal. Although this new proposal is
 extremely encouraging, HCF A has not finalized its review to ensure that the financing approach
 is acceptable. Having said this, this development is extremely encouraging in that it represents
 never explicitly say this and have made clear that this proposal should have no bearing on how
 the Federal government should enforce their past reliance on their provider taxes.
 These negotiations are at an extremely delicate phase. As such, we are advising all within the
 Administration to remain quiet until they have been resolved.
