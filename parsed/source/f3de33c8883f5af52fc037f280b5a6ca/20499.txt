TEXT:
FYI.  Broderick is trying to set up meetings with Hill staff for tomorrow
afternoon (after 5:30pm).  The group will likely include a mix of
Democratic authorizers and appropriators (both within and without the CBC)
and Cassandra from Gephardt's staff. Martha is still a bit worried that
we will be talking to the staff before we have fully resolved all of the
five remaining issues (particularly the one about allocation of lawyers'
time between litigation and charge processing). However, she agrees that
we have to talk to them soon to get .them to understand where we are.

EK      I am checking with Laura re: your availability.

Also, I just got word from Martha that the EEOC got $18.5 million in the
subcommittee mark-up. This is half of the President's request of $37
million. There was no report or bill language and nothing in the mark-up
notes. Also, there was very little discussion during the mark-up on
this.   Mollohan stated that he didn't know how. the EEOC could address the
backlog without the full amount requested and that he will work on this·
(getting more money) as the process continues.    Dixon said that he wanted
to work with the Chairman on report language (for the full committee's
report) .
