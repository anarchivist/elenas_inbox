TEXT:
Right now the plan for tomorrow is that the President will make an
education statement at an elementary school in Montgomery County in Wynn's
district.   The President will tour a classroom and then make a statement
outdoors to approximately 100 people including NEA/AFT and other school
modernization advocates.   The proposal is for the President to speak and
for Oaschle, Gephardt, Glendening, and Wynn, etc. to stand by side and not
speak.   (Leg. is checking w/ the leadership to see if they will agree to
that. )
