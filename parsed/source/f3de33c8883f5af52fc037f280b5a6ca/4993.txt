TEXT:
Still hoping to push a bit of service into the DLC speech, although I know
main topic{s) are taken. But perhaps something like this could go in an
intro, where he would presumably talk about the DLC role or his
relationship with the DLC....   I will be pushing this with Silverman.


Our work together has borne fruit in many areas, including moving toward
our vision of revitalizing citizen service. We had to overcome obstacles,
but today members of the AmeriCorps program are making contributions all
across the country.

Six months ago today, I convened a President sO, summit on service in
Philadelphia that focused on service for children.   Today I will sign an
appropriations bill that will give AmeriCorps its first [significant]
increase in funding since [AmeriCorpsO, founding?).   Those funds will
support one of my highest priorities, the America Reads initiative, the
national campaign to ensure that every child can read well and
independently by the third grade. They will allow us to demonstrate that
service gets things done, even as the act of serving transforms the
individual and contributes to a renewed sense of citizenship.
