FROM:      OMB LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS

DATE:      JULY 23, 1997

SUBJECT:           LEGISLATIVE REPORT

CONGRESS TODAY (7/23)
SENATE
Passed (81-19) S. Res. 109 - resolution expressing the sense of the Senate
condemning the Canadian government's failure to accept responsibility for
the illegal blockade by Canadian fishermen of a U.S. passenger vessel in
the Canadian province of British Colombia. The resolution also calls on
President Clinton to take appropriate actions compelling the Canadian
government to prevent such harassment of U.S. citizens.

Continued consideration of S.1033 - Agriculture FY 1998 Appropriations
bill (stacked votes on amendments & final vote expected tomorrow morning)
[SAP sent 7/23: Admin. urges the Senate to "reduce funding for lower
priority programs, or for programs that would be adequately funded at the
requested level, and to redirect funding to programs of higher priority,
such as WIC. "1

While under consideration, the Senate took the following action on S. 1033:
o       Passed (voice vote) Roberts amendment that delays the obligation
of $4 million for Agriculture's Risk Management Agency as a result of
RMA's inability to produce a report on regulation reform related to the
crop insurance program.
  o     Tabled (53-47) Durbin amendment (and all secondary amendments)
that would have prohibited the USDA from providing crop insurance to
tobacco farmers.  A 2nd degree amendment by Senator Ford (Kentucky) would
have prohibited crop insurance for farms with farmland in excess of 300


acres (both provisions were defeated) .
o       Tabled (76-24) Helms 2nd degree amendment to the Harkin amendment
- the Helms amendment would have financed the FDA anti-drinking/smoking
initiative through a 3 cent increase on the ethanol assessment paid to the
CCC.
o       Tabled (52-48) Harkin amendment that would have provided $34
million (compared with $4.9 million in the bill) to the FDA for
enforcement of the FDA rule on smoking. The additional funds would have
been provided by an assessment on tobacco marketing companies.
o       Tabled (59-40) Bryan amendment that would have capped funding for
the Market Access Program at $70 million, a reduction of $20 million from
current law. The amendment would have also restricted support provided to
foreign companies.

HOUSE
Rejected (81-347) H.R. 2003 Budget Enforcement Act for FY 1998
[SAP sent 7/23: Admin. does not support because "it would impose an
unworkable and unadministrable system of constraints and automatic
triggers on the Federal Budget."]

        o       Rejected (148-279) motion to recommit H.R. 2003 - Budget
Enforcement Act for FY 1998

Passed (424-5) H.R. 2169 - Transportation Appropriations Act for FY 1998
[SAP sent 7/23: Admin. will seek restoration of certain of the
CommitteeO,s reductions from the PresidentO,s request]

While under consideration, the House took the following action on H.R.
2169:
o       All Amtrak amendments were dropped in reliance upon Chairman Wolf's
assurances that he would resolve the issue of operations funding in
conference because many members expressed concern that Amtrak would go
bankrupt before the end of FY 1998 unless the requested $344 million (as
opposed to the $283 provided in the bill) is not granted.
o       Withdrew Barcia/Stupak/Stabenow amendment concerning ISTEA
formula funds after Chairman Wolf and Minority Leader Sabo assured the
members that the bill will not in any way effect ISTEA formulas.
o       On a point of order, Wolf language creating a Commission to study
the future of Amtrak was deleted from the bill.

Continued consideration of H.R. 2160 - Agriculture, Rural Development,
Food and Drug Administration and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for
FY 1998
[SAP sent 7/16: Admin. will seek restoration of certain reductions to the
PresidentO,s requests, such as WIC]
