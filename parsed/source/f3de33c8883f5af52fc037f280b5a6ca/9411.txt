      Assessing the New Federalism

      KEY CHALLENGES OF WELFARE-TO-WORK GRANTS OUTLINED IN NEW POLICY BRIEF

      For More Information:   Cinnamon Burnim Bowser, 202-261-5231

      (Washington, DC; September 23, 1998) The main features and key
      challenges of implementing the $3 billion Welfare-to_Work (WtW) Grants
      Program are discussed in a new policy brief from the Urban Institute's
      Assessing the New Federalism project.
'.
     The Welfare-to-Work Grants Program: A New Link in the Welfare Reform
     Chain, by Demetra Smith Nightingale and Kathleen Brennan, analyzes the
     latest component of federal welfare reform -- the only one to provide
     federal funds specifically designated for work-related activities for
     welfare recipients.  WtW is designed to serve people with the greatest
     difficulty finding and keeping a job.

     WtW shares the same overall objectives of the Temporary Assistance for
     Needy Families (TANF) program, but has some unique characteristics.
     Administrative responsibility rests with the u.s. Department of Labor
     (DOL) and local Private Industry Councils (PICs, which oversee
     workforce and training policies), not the U.S. Department of Health
     and Human Services (DHHS). It focuses on jobs with potential for
     upward mobility rather than quick placement in any job.  WtW funds
     work- related services, not cash benefits.  Finally, WtW targets a
     group of people not eligible for TANF benefits, including those who
     have reached their time limit and noncustodial parents of children on
     TANF.

     The brief also describes the types of WtW grants available,
     requirements for receiving these grants, and challenges to using the
     funds.  Three challenges to state implementation stand out. Since WtW
     money is not a permanent authorization, state and local initiatives
     must be mounted quickly. While DOL has primary responsibility for
     WtW, collaboration with DHHS and coordination with the TANF program
     will be critical.  Finally, since WtW will increase the variation
     among work-related programs at the local level, local administrators
     will have to minimize duplication of effort and maximize services and
     resources.

     Assessing the New Federalism is a multi-year project designed to
     analyze the shifting responsibility for social programs from the
     federal government to the states. The project, conducted by the Urban
     Institute in collaboration with Child Trends, Inc., analyzes changes
     in income support, social services, and health programs in child and
     family well being.  For more information, visit the Urban Institute
     web site, http://www.urban.org.

     The Urban Institute is a nonprofit, nonpartisan policy research
     organization established in Washington, D.C., in 1968. Its objectives
     are to sharpen thinking about society's problems and efforts to solve
     them, improve government decisions and their implementation, and
     increase citizens' awareness about important public choices.
