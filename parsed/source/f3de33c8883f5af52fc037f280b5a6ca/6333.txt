TEXT:
As you know, as a conclusion to her cross-country welfare tour, Secretary
Herman will give a speech at the National Press Club on Feb 17th (next
Tuesday) and will also be preparing a report to the President.  I've been
promised a chance to review all these materials.

I now have a copy of the galleys for a booklet she wants to distribute to
reporters on the 17th called "About Welfare: Myths, Facts, Challenges, and
Solutions."  It's quite good although I'd like a few changes.   In some
ways, it's similar to some of the materials the Partnership has produced
to assure companies that many welfare recipients have high school diplomas
and previous work experience.   Here's what it says:

The "Welfare Myths" section cites myths and counter-facts:

        "Too many people are on welfare" [I'm going to edit this myth to say
"More and more people are on welfare"] -- the facts show 5.5% of
population were on welfare in in Jan 1993 and 3.9 percent in Jan 1997.

         "Welfare costs are out of control" -- facts show that welfare's share was
about 1.2% of the federal budget in 1979, .8% in 1995.   [I'm going to push
to get rid of this page -- what do you think]

        "People on welfare don't really need it" -- facts show the overpayment
rate of 6.1% in 1993. [We should get rid of this page too]

        "Welfare grants are too high"    facts show average monthly AFDC income
of $499 with a poverty line of $1,043 (family of three) [They should add
in food stamps here]

        "Most welfare parents are teenagers" -- facts show 6 percent are age 19
or under.

The "Welfare Facts" section says "welfare families are much like other
families"

           "Most welfare families are small" --43% have one child

           "Welfare families are diverse" -- 37% African American, 36% white, 21%
Hispanic



           "Over one third have stayed on welfare for one year or less"

           "Most welfare mothers have some work experience: 61%

The "Welfare Challenges" section says "weifare families often face greater
challenges to independence"

           "Most welfare mothers are single parents"

        "Some of the most powerful predictors of long-term stays on welfare are
marital status and education level"

           "Most welfare children need reliable child care in order for the mother
to work"

        "Child care costs continue to rise"    [I'll check to make sure this
comports with other data we've released]

           "Nearly half of welfare mothers have less than a high school education"

           "Many welfare mothers have only worked in low-wage, low-skilled jobs"

The "Welfare Solutions" section --

        Has a signed narrative from Herman lauding the $3 billion and
challenging the private and nonprofit sectors to do their part. It's a
fairly "work first" message, saying getting we need to help those on
welfare not only get their first job but once they're in that job, get the
skills to move to their second or third job. It also has two sentence I'd
like to edit as follows:

"But ending welfare as we know it is not the goal enough.    It is a means
to the end of assuring We must assure that every family has the
opportunity to make. a fair claim on our nation's prosperity."
