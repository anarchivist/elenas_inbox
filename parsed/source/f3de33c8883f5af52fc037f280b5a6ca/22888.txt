TEXT:
The President said the following in today's press conference:

 And then we have probably, oh, I don't know,
S or 10 bills that I can conceive of us getting agreement on -- I
mean, really significant bills, a lot of them -- between the two
parties.

Anybody have any idea what bills he was talking about, and if not, can we
make a few assumptions?
DO you think he means long-term care, for example?

I'm being asked by BNA.
