TEXT:
You asked for information on the data collection issues pending at Labor:

1.       Scheduling Request at OMB to collect detailed wage data by mail from
the 5000 or so federal contractors that are scheduled for compliance
reviews.   While OFCCP currently is able to obtain this data on-site at a
later stage of the review process, OFCCP requested to get it by mail at
the early D&desk auditD8 stage of the process.   This data would be used
for technical assistance and enforcement.   Labor's Solicitor's Office
intervened and asked that OMB extend its decision until the later part of
May.   In the interim, Labor is gathering more data to support its
request, has met with women's groups, and has offered to meet with
contractor groups.

2.      OFCCP Affirmative Action Summary (also known as 60-2).  For several
years, OFCCP has been authorized to issue a regulation that would allow
them to collect summary information from all the approximately 200,000
federal contractors, including wage data, by mail. OFCCP informs us that
this proposal currently is being reviewed by their SolicitorD,s Office.
OFCCP believes the advantages of this proposal are two-fold: (1) OFCCP
will be able to get some idea of how the entire universe of federal
contractors, not only those scheduled for compliance reviews, are imp
lementing the civil rights laws; and (2) every federal contractor, simply
by being required to compile this data, will become more aware of how they
can better implement the civil rights laws by paying equal wages, etc.
Labor is actively looking at the proposal in the context of broader data
collection issues.
