Elena,
Tomorrow morning (9:30am) Commissioner Meissner is holding a press
conference to announce Congress's final approval of the INS's FY98
budget.  INS wants the President to release a short statement of support
prior to the press conference. According to INS, the President has issued
such a statement (related to final budget release) in each of the last two
years.

Attached is a draft.    I am also faxing you a copy of the statement that
was released last year.  Thanks.

Julie

        DRAFf -- INS Statement


                   STATEMENT BY THE PRESIDENT ON 1998 APPROPRIATIONS


                Five years ago, we began an effort to revitalize the INS by providing the resources and
        commitment to fulfill our responsibilities. Since then, INS funding has increased 1S3 percent.
        This increase has allowed our borders to be greatly strengthened through the use of added
        personnel and better technology. In addition, workplace enforcement has gotten tougher, and
        criminal and other illegal aliens have been deported in record numbers. By year's end, INS will
        surpa~s my goal of employing 7,000 border patrol agents -- more than double the number
        employed in FY93. Also, the INS has made needed reforms to our asylum system for refugees
        fleeing persecution and is working to guarantee integrity and provide improved customer service
        within the naturalization process for all qualified applicants.

                Today's announcement represents continuing wise management of the additional
        resources requested by me and provided by the Congress. And it represents my
        Administration's continuing commitment to an immigration policy that recognizes the value of
        legal immigration while strengthening our efforts to restrict illegal immigration.
