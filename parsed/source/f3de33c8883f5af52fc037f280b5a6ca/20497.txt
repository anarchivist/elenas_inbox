TEXT:
The House will probably pass the child support incentives bill tomorrow
morning, and the Senate may pass it Friday.   (Another signing?)

In case we get asked what we think of it, we've drafted the following
positive but vague response (we haven't actually seen the compromise yet,
so we should be a bit careful). Laura, can you ask Elena to clear this?

While we have not yet had a chance to review the legislation just passed
by the House, we are pleased that Congress appears to be moving toward
passage of such a bill. We strongly support the billD,s provisions to
reward states based on their performance on key child support enforcement
goals -- provisions that are based on an Administration proposal. We also
support the billD,s concept of an alternative penalty structure to
guarantee that states face automatic and escalting penalties if they fail
to automate their child support enforcement systems on time.  We look
forward to enactment of a bill that would accomplish these important goals.
