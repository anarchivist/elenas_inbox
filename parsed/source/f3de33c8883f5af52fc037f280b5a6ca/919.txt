Subject:         Re: Service summit

thanks for your update.  the mtg was fine, just more high-level anxiety on
Republican involvement, what's happening with Americorps, etc. Harris is
preparing a memo for the President to calm him down. We should start
sending POTUS a weekly update on commitments (ripping off the Newsweek
box) .

Also, Lisa Caputo from CBS called to say that one of their hit shows,
Touched by An Angel, wants to do 3 shows around the service summit theme.
They're going to call me. Any ideas?
