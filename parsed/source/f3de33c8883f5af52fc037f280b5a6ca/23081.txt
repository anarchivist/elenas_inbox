Subject:         ED 800 Ed-Flex SAP w/ED Dept. edits

Below is the pending version of the Ed-Flex SAP containing ED's proposed
edits. I understand that ED and Barbara are discussing, in particular,
the last-paragraph referencing amendments to ensure funding for Title I
funding is preserved to an acceptable level.

House Rules Committee
March , 1999

H.R. 800 - Education Flexibility Partnership Act of 1999
(Rep.Castle (R) DE and 59 cosponsors)
'.    ·

     The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 800, which would expand
     the D&Ed-FlexD8 demonstration authority to permit all States that meet the
     eligibility criteria to waive certain statutory and regulatory
     requirements of Federal education programs.  The Administration has long
     supported the concept of expanding ed-flex demonstration authority in a
     manner that will promote high standards and accountability for results,
     coupled with increased flexibility for States and local school districts
     to achieve those results.

     The Administration is pleased with the amendments made at Committee
     mark-up to D&sunsetD8 the bill upon reauthorization of the Elementary and
     Secondary Education Act of 1965 (to ensure consistency between that
     statute and Ed-Flex), to terminate local waivers if achievement levels
     decline, and to require public notice and comment before waivers are
     requested and granted.

     The Administration strongly supports an amendment that is expected to be
     offered to H.R. 800 that would implement the President's proposal for a
     long-term extension of the one-year authority to help school districts
     reduce class size in the early grades, which the Congress approved last
     year on a bipartisan basis.  In order to hire qualified teachers, arrange
     for additional classrooms, and take other steps that are necessary to
     reduce class size, school districts need to know, as soon as possible,
     that the Congress intends to support this initiative for more than one
     year.

     The Administration also supports amendments designed to: (1) strengthen
     accountability provisions to ensure that the Ed-Flex program results in
     improved student achievement; and (2) ensure that Federal education
     dollars continue to reach the schools and students they were designed to
     serve.
