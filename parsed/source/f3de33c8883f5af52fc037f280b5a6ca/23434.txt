                         STATEMENT BY THE PRESIDENT

        Today, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is publishing promising new
results from the youth anti-smoking program launched by the late Florida Governor
Lawton Chiles_ The study shows that in just one year, smoking has declined by 19 percent
among middle school students and by 8 percent among high schoolers. These results show
why every state should have a comprehensive program to reduce youth smoking and why I
oppose any legislation waiving the federal government's claim to tobacco settlement funds
without making a commitment from the states to fund such efforts. Without such
legislation, states won't have to spend a single penny ofthe $246 billion settlement to
reduce youth smoking. We must act now: every day, 3000 children become regular
smokers and 1000 will have their lives cut short as a result.
