TEXT:
I've got a line on a parent of a 4 yr old inolved in a preschool program,
with a preschool PTA.  The good news is that they live in Manassas, VA,
which will make transportation, etc. a lot easier.

A couple of questions:

1.  I'm pretty sure this is a Caucasian parent (the search for others goes
on); how important is diversity at this point in the game, vs. nailing
someone down quickly?

2. What exactly are we asking this person to do: when is the panel; how
long should their remarks be; who will moderate and will POTUS and FLOTUS
both be participating in this session; are they invited/expected to come
for the whole conference; etc.
