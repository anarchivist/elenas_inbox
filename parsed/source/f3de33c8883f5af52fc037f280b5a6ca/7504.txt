 TEXT:
·A point of contention has arisen between HHS and OMB over the
 circumstances under which we agreed to fund part of the adoption bill by
 cutting the contingency fund by $40 million. Mary Bourdette says that
 Levin was very unhappy about this funding source, and she is adamant that
 we told him at the time that we· would "revisit" the issue in the future to
 see whether there was some better source of $40 million. OMB denies there
 was any such commitment to Levin, or at least keeps repeating that they
 don't have a $40 million alternative. Mary counters that we didn't
 guarantee anyone a substitute $40 million, but we did agree to reexamine
 the issue.  She said Josh was definitely aware of this.

 (The practical effect of this dispute is whether to include a sentence in
 an HHS report on the contingency fund saying that "one alternative is to
 look for another source of the $40 million. Mary says Levin will be very
 chagrined if the report doesn't say this.)

 I wasn't around for this debate, so I'm not taking a side at the moment.
 Let me know if any of you have a position on this.
