Subject:         Question re: FL, TX, and MS $$

Am I right in understanding that the bill does not currently have any
formula by which the state funds would be apportioned?

Bruce was wondering if we know how TX, FL, and Mississippi would fare
under their own settlements vs. the current bill. Without assuming a
formula, I assume we couldn't figure that out?

The state of Florida believes they will get less money under the current
bill than under their settlement.   Florida, like TX and MS, has a clause
in its settlement saying it will superceded by "substantially similar"
federal legislation.    Thus, they can't take advantage of the state
opt-out now in the bill (though they could litigate whether the law is
"'substantially similar"). Minnesota, whose settlement gives the companies
an explicit credit against federal tobacco-related payments, does not have
seem to have this problem.
