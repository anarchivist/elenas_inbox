TEXT:
I'm still trying to get an answer out of OMB (Barbara Chow).    Here is the
status of the wage proposal.

 We've now talked to every interested party and basically gotten sign-off
from everyone (except OMB) with some suggestions that don't rise to the
level of demands:  On the business side -- Treasury; Commerce; CEA; and
SBA have all signed off although I think we shouldn't publicize that fact
to the groups. On the other side Labor and EEOC have seen it and agreed
Shirley Wilcher of EEOC and Sally Paxton that is, they are telling Kitty
about it but they seemed pleased and I don't know what concern they could
have) .  EEOC is fine, but recently raised the idea of getting $8 million
to do the study/regulation instead of just the current language "funds
authorized as necessary" -- they would go down to $2 million.   Caroline F.
thinks Daschle will go for it, NEC is ok (they are sending Gene a memo),
Beier is fine with it, suggests adding a "study of the lessons learned
from the public sector activities and/or best practices in the private
sector studies" and something on privacy which I will take up with
Daschle. OPL has had it read to them and are fine if the groups are,
(Jenny would like to be on the phone when you call the groups.)   I
described it to Counsel's office here as well.

After we get OMB,  you can do the call to the groups, then Caroline F. has
set up a meeting with Daschle for Wednesday where we will give this to
them.
