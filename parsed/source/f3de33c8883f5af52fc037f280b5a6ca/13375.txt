TEXT:
ok.   the problem here is that we do not have the bill at this
point. we have seen earlier versions, but they are moot almost
immediately upon printing -- murray's staff is getting heavily
lobbied and is significantly rewriting.   we need the bill so we
CAN opine.
having said that, i have to reiterate that it is not acceptable
for us to continue to entertain that we would come out somewhere
other than in support of murray (assuming that she will take
whatever changes we need in the bill) .
daschle's office called me to say that they were indeed pushing
murray's bill as the substitute to hatfield's provision and that
they were successfully lining up support including moderate r's.

as you also know, the likelihood is that peter defazio will
introduce the bill on the house side.
there is therefore some chance that we could actually pass


something here so i would urge that our posture switch immediately
to support of repeal and replace and going great guns to get this
bill in as good a shape as possible.
meanwhile, the press is ringing our phones off the hook. we can
hold them at bay with the --- "we have not seen the final
language" for right now, but, of course, since she is introducing
it tomorrow that excuse is lost.
you should know that the pnw press is reporting that murray is
working on this bill "at the president's request."
i think we urgently need a meeting with leon on this to force a
decision. we will need to have a position on this tomorrow or we
will get pummeled in the' pnw press.
 (p.s. on a note to me in my weekly report, the president asked why
we had not decided to be supportive of murray's approach and said
"if we are mute, the announcement i made out there will look like
hypocracy. " )
