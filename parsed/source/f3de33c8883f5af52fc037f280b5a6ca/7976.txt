                          ..
The House tonight (6/4) approved the Conference Report on the Agriculture
Research bill which includes $800 million for the restoration of food
stamp benefits for legal immigrants.  It also includes important funding
for agriculture research and crop insurance programs. As you all know,
this bill which reflected a carefully crafted bipartisan compromise has
been a high priority for the President and Vice-President. We should
definitely try to do a statement highlighting this achievement despite
some Republican efforts to dismantle it.  The vote on final passage was
364-50. I particularly recommend statements targeted to specialty press.
We should also consider pushing for a signing ceremony. Legislative
Affairs will be coordinating a sCheduling request, please let me know if
you are supportive and would want your name listed on the scheduling
request.  Thanks.
