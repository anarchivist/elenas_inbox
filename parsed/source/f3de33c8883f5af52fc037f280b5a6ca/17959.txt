TEXT:
Oh what fun I have been missing! That meeting made the TANF reg look
easy .... A few thoughts to follow on all your real work:

Welfare vs Working Poor Families
I was a bit puzzled, as I think you were, by the dicotomy some were
drawing between "welfare families" and "low-income working families."
First, welfare families who need child care are working families (or they
are at least preparing for work).  Second, many low income women cycle on
and off of welfare, using welfare as a form of unemployment insurance --
there is no bright line between the populations.

I think the key questions we should ask ourselves are: Do we want states
to treat two mothers making $12,000 a year differently because one used to
be on welfare and one did not? I think we do not -- we want to encourage
states to develop seamless child care systems that focus on incomes, not
categories.  In that case, what is the best way to encourage states to
develop seamless systems? I think it is not by setting benchmarks or
other rules which encourage the new funds to be used for the not-formerly-o
n-welfare working poor to counterbalance current practice of focusing
dollars on former welfare recipients.  I think it is by providing funds
for states to raise their eligibility criteria to include more low-income
families.

We do not need new targetting of the block grant in order to have a
proposal which helps moderate income working families.  Even without new
targetting, we can talk about any expansion of the child care and
development block grant as "child care for hard working minimum wage
families" or "low income families making less than $24,000 a year" and we
can describe the tax credits as help for the "middle class families
earning between $24,000 and $59,000."



So count me as a vote against benchmarking!

Stay at Home Parents
Regarding stay-at-home parents, I will admit I am completely unschooled in
this issue.  I do think we will be able to argue that we are helping
stay-at-home parents through the $500 per child tax credit.  I do also
think, as I think you do, that an additional proposal here would be very
helpful.
I think such a proposal should focus on parents who stay home for more
than 6-24 weeks. Thus, I would like to see something like the
demonstration project idea, which would provide funds to community and
religious groups (including the latter would be helpful) who provide
support and assistance to stay-at-home parents, by offering parenting
classes or hotlines, play groups, two hour "relief" or "emergency" child
care, or which distribute materials to new parents (I thought Barry's idea
of promoting connections to WIC was promising) .

In fact maybe the quality fund should have two parts 1) to promote Smart
Start-like local efforts to improve the quality of formal child care and
2) to promote local efforts to assist stay-at-home parents.   This would
allow local organizations to provide culturally-sensitive programs for
parents of particularly ethnicities, which the Hispanic caucus encouraged
us to do.   In fact, in my in-box is the new issue of Univ of Wisconsin
Institute on Poverty magazine which highlights an evaluation of a program
called Avance that has worked with low-income Hispanic infants and their
families in San Antonio since 1973 which has the explicit goal of "helping
mothers become better teachers of their children." The evaluation found
"positive and significant differences between participant and control
mothers on three measures of teaching effectiveness." I can fax you a
copy if you like (it's only one page).
