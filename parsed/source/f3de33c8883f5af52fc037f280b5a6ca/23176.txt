     TEXT:
     Here's an update on the preparations for the discussion of education at
     the June G-8 summit in Cologne:

     Several weeks ago, the NSC sent out without change the U.S. proposal that
     ED drafted and that you and Bruce reviewed.   Thus far, the Germans, Brits,
     Canadians, and the European Community have come in with their own written
     proposals for the education session, and the Russians have advanced some
     general thoughts in the Sherpa discussion meetings.   On Thursday the 18th,
     Jim
     Steinberg heads off to Europe for another summit planning session with his
     Sherpa counterparts. To prep Steinberg on the education issues, ED put
     together a two-page summary of our ideas and reactions to key points in
     the other countries' proposals   (ED's paper is attached -- it is also
     summarized below)

     ED's proposal tried - as the NSC requested - to take into account as many
     of the other countries' suggestions as we found relevant to the
     President's education agenda. That said, considering that the Leaders
     will have a single hour and a half discussion,  ED also feels that less is
     definitely more.  From the two-page briefing memo ED prepared, here are
     the key points they think should be used to tee-up Steinberg to talk with
     his counterparts:

     1. To create a broader context for the Leaders discussion of specific
     programs and policies, they should begin the session with a fairly
     conceptual discussion of the skills and abilities citizens will need for
     success in the 21st century. The U.S. proposal suggests this should
     include not just requisite skills for success in the information age job
     market, but also the principles and values for democratic citizenship.

     2.  Having established this broader conceptual framework, the Leaders
     should then consider a limited number of specific strategies for equipping
     all citizens with the skills for success in the 21st century. Of the
     ideas that we and others have put on the table, I think Steinberg should
     focus on three :

     A.  Establishing or raising academic standards for primary and secondary
     schooling.
     Summit Outcome: Call for continued and expanded effort by OECD and other
     relevant organizations to develop valid comparative international measures
     of student achievement.

     B. Strengthening the teaching profession for the 21st century.
     Summit Outcome: Expanded teachers exchange among the Eight


 C, Using educational technology to improve students performance,
 including the Internet and distance learning.
 Summit Outcome; Call for cooperation among the Eight in improving the use
 of educational technology and agreement to work together and through
 international institutions to help developing nations put educational
 technology to work in addressing their own pressing educational needs.

 These three subjects would allow the President to highlight both areas in
 which his administration has already established a record of success and
 also areas in which his current legislative efforts are focused.

    Education and Training Brief for March 19-20 Sherpa Meeting

    ISSUE:
    How to structure the G-8 Heads' discussion of education and training and proposed
    summit deliverables, including language for G-8 Heads Communique.

    KEY POINTS FOR U.S. SHERPA DISCUSSIONS:
    Agreement on broad approach:        The United States welcomes the inclusion of
    investment in education and training as a theme of the Cologne summit, and agrees
    with the broad conceptual approach to that subject as expressed in the German, British,
    Canadian and EC papers.

    Proposal to increase public attention: The United States proposes that the education
    and training session be at least in part open to the press, and that it feature an
    exchange with a panel of experts and practitioners on one of more of the subjects that
    the Heads will be discussing. Participants in such a panel could be drawn from the
    ranks of educators, education researchers or CEO's in the G-8 countries.

    Proposal for focus and structure of the discussion: To be most useful to the Heads
    and their governments, the summit discussion of education and training should be
    organized around a unifying theme, and should focus on a limited number of common
    concerns.

    Toward that end, the United States suggests the theme "Preparing Citizens for Success
    in the Information Age" and recommends dividing the Heads' discussion into two broad
    parts:

    Discussion Part A: Defining the Skills for Success in the Information Age
    In the workplace: The Heads could highlight the skills that their governments regard as
    priorities for the next century, such as entrepreneurship as outlined in the German and
    UK proposals. Additional possibilities might include: the need for all citizens to
    possess solid skills in mathematics and literacy, to be able to solve problems where
    hypotheses must be formed and tested and to work cooperatively in groups with
    persons of diverse backgrounds.
    In a democratic society: The Heads could also consider the ideas and values that they
    believe will form the foundations of democratic citizenship in the next century. Among
    those ideas might be: respect for the political, civil, and human rights of all people, an
    appreciation for the values of tolerance, pluralism and diversity, and a commitment to
    voting and participation in the political process.        This discussion could include
    consideration of ways that educational institutions can promote active citizenship as
    suggested in the EC paper.

    Discussion Part B: Helping All Citizens Master the New Skills for Success
    Primary And Secondary Education: The United States enthusiastically endorses the
    British proposal for discussion of raising academic standards and the German proposal

                                             Hex-DiJmp Conversion

         for discussion of effective strategies for improving the educational performance of
         disadvantaged youths. In addition, we endorse the EC proposal for consideration of
         the application of information technology to education in general, and the Canadian
         proposal for discussion of distance learning in particular.
         While we agree with the Canadian. paper that distance learning is a promising vehicle
         for educational collaboration among the Eight and developing nations, such
         collaboration raises complex issues that would need to be carefully considered prior to
         the summit, including the significant cost of developing the technological infrastructure
         upon which distance learning depends.
         The United States strongly believes that the Heads should also consider ways to
         strengthen the teaching profession for the 21 st century. The Heads could discuss
         varying approaches to a number of critical issues, among them teacher recruitment,
         training, compensation, and professional development, and could call upon the DECO
         to study international best practices in these areas.

         Higher Education: While the United States agrees that the role of universities in
         promoting innovation and economic growth would be a useful topic for discussion at
         Cologne, we also believe that the Heads' consideration of higher education should
         stress the need to improve access to higher education for all citizens, particularly those
         from traditionally excluded groups.

         The Private Sector: The United States supports the proposal outlined in the German
         discussion paper for consideration of the vital role that private enterprises playas
         investors in human capital, and agrees that the Heads should exchange effective
         strategies for promoting access to high-quality training for both employed and displaced
         workers.

         Summary of summit outcomes proposed in March 5 U.S. discussion paper:
         A declaration of the importance of investment in education and training
         A joint statement highlighting a number of commonly agreed-upon skills for economic
         success and core values for democratic citizenship in the 21 st century
         A call for continued and expanded DECO efforts to develop high quality comparative
         international measures of student achievement and the factors that influence it
         A commitment to increase support for exchanges of teachers among the nations of the
         Eight and a call on the DECO to study international best practices in teacher
         recruitment, training, compensation, and professional development
         A commitment to consider ways to work among the Eight and through international
         institution
