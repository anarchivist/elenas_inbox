TEXT:
You will recall that USDA told washington state that current law doesn't
permit them to buy food stamps from us and give them to legal immigrants,
and we developed a legislative proposal. Washington lobbied their
delegation, and it now looks like Congress has agreed to this as part of
the supplemental, except for electronic benefits transfer states.
Maryland will not be happy because they are an EBT state.  We supported it
with or without EBT.

(Sounds like a weekly report item .... )
