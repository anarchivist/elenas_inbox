                Rewarding Excellence in Teaching to Strengthen Our Schools

       To have the best schools, we must have the best teachers . .. We should reward and
       recognize our best teachers.
                                            -- President Bill Clinton
                                                 State of the Union Address, 1997

The President Meets with 200 Master Teachers: President Clinton met today with the
National Board for Professional Teaching Standards and close to 200 Board-certified master
teachers from all over the country. These teachers met rigorous standards and passed rigorous
tests developed by the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards, an independent,
nonfederal board comprised of teachers, businesspeople, and other leaders in education. The
Board was established in 1987, and has been chaired over the past X years by Gov. James Hunt
of North Carolina. To ~ate, the board has established assessments in seven fields of
specialization, including Early Childhood, middle school English, and high school mathematics
and science, that cover half the teaching population, and awarded the first national board
certification to 5 teachers in 1995. Today there are nearly 600 board-certified teachers, and
teachers in all 50 states are able to participate in the National Board certification process.

The President's Plan for Supporting Board Certified Teachers: In his State of the Union
Address, President Clinton proposed a plan to help 100,000 teachers seek board certification as
Master Teachers. In his balanced budget plan, President Clinton requested $105 million over 5
years to help the Board complete assessments in 25 academic areas covering the fields of 90% of
the nation's teachers and to help defray the cost to teachers of taking part in the rigorous Board
certification processs. The President's proposal is designed to help reach the target -- set by the
National Commission on Teaching and America's Future, chaired by Governor Hunt -- of
certifying over 100,000 teachers within the next ten years. Today, President Clinton called on
Congress to include funding for this program in the FY 1998 appropriations bill (status check)

The President's Challenge: Every School District and Teachers Organization in the
Country Should Have a Plan for Rewarding Excellence and for Removing Incompetence
Today, President Clinton will challenge every state to provide significant and meaningful
rewards for master teachers. He will note that eight states and many local school districts are
supplementing the salaries for National Board Certified Teachers, and that thirteen states are now
paying the certification fee. And he will announce that, just this week, the New York City
schools received a grant to boost the number of classrooms with Board-Certified teachers, and
the Los Angeles schools have agreed to pay their National Board Certified teachers an additional
15%.

The President's Plan for Recruiting and Preparing Teachers for High Poverty
Communities. The President will also call on Congress to approve his $350 million initiative,
announced at the NAACP convention this summer, to attract talented people of all backgrounds
into teaching at low-income schools across the nation, and to dramatically improve the quality of
training and preparation given to our future teachers. This new initiative will help bring nearly
35,000 outstanding new teachers into high-poverty schools in urban and rural areas over the next
                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion

five years. In addition, it will upgrade the quality of teacher preparation at institutions of higher
education that work in partnership with local schools in inner city and poor rural areas. The
President's initiative will help recruit and prepare teachers nationwide to help our neediest
students succeed in the 21 st century.

Comprehensive reforms to improve public education. The President will contrast his broad
reform agenda, including high standards, better teaching, helping children to read better, getting
more technology into the classroom, and public school choice through expanding charter schools,
with the narrow Republican agenda that features vouchers that drain resources from our public
schools.
