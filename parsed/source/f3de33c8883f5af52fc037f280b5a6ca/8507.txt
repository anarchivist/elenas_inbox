            Larry agrees and does not feel that we should do a SAP.

            OMB asked if we want a SAP. NEC said no. We have our letter up there
            our views are known -- and with the confusion about baxter, would only
            muddy the waters. Tried to reach Peter but we haven't hooked up yet.
            Assume Larry agrees.  If not, please let us know. Thanks.
