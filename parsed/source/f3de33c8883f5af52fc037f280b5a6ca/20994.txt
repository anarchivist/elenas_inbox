       SEXUAL ORIENTATION EXECUTIVE ORDER UPHELD

       The House blocked a measure, sponsored by Rep. Hefley, that would have prohibited funding to
       implement your May 28 executive order which prohibits discrimination based on sexual
       orientation in the federal civilian workforce. By a vote of252 to 176, the House rejected
       arguments that this executive order would lead to affirmative action for gays and lesbians.
       Sixty-three Republicans joined 188 Democrats and the one independent in voting against the
       measure. The DPC, along with Counsel's Office and OPL, worked closely to ensure that House
       members had information to rebut arguments about special preferences. A recent Wall Street
       JoumallNBC News Poll showed that 72 percent supported the order against anti gay bias in
       federal agencies, while only 20 percent opposed it.
