     DRAFT   4: /22/99 4: 30 p. m.

           Section 1111. America's Education Goals Panel.
     Section 1111 of the bill would move the authority for the
     National Education Goals Panel from Title I I of the Goals
     2000:   Educate America Act to a new Part C of Title XI of
     the ESEA, and rename the panel the "America's Education
     Goals Panel." This conforms to the renaming of the
     National Education Goals as "America's Education Goals" and
     their placement in proposed new section 2 of the ESEA, as
     added by section 2 (b) of the bill.

          The statutory authority for the Goals Panel would be
     largely unchanged from current law, apart from some minor
     stylistic changes, updates, clarifications, and the
     elimination of current provisions relating to voluntary
     National content standards, voluntary National student
     performance standards and the work of the Panel's Resource
     and Technical Planning Groups on School Readiness.

          The current authority for the National Education Goals
     Panel, Title I I of the Goals 2000: Educate America Act,
     would be repealed by section 12    of the bill.
