Subject:         NT 4.0 Roll-Out

First, I apo.logize for the length of this message, but there are some very
important issues that I need to address.   As I have mentioned over the
last several months, the entire EOP complex will be getting a new load on
their computers called NT 4.0.   It will look very different from the
current load, but similar to Windows 98.   Lotus Notes will remain our
e-mail system. Netscape will remain our web browser.    The main reason for
the new load is to become Y2K compliant.   The roll-out of this new load
for OPD will begin on Monday, March 29th.

There are several new pieces of software that will be provided as the
"standard load" which are mostly Microsoft Office products including Word,
Excel, powerpoint, etc.  WordPerfect, Lotus 1-2-3 and All-In-1 will be
provided until September 1st in order for staff to become accustomed to
the new software and for the staff to transfer their WordPerfect and Lotus
documents to Word and Excel, respectively.

We need to identify the staff's calendar needs.   IS&T thinks (although
they're still checking) Lotus Organizer and Calendar Creator will continue
to be provided, I just need to know who prefers what.   If IS&T doesn't
provide these, then we'll have to buy licenses for the calendars people
use.  The 'current version of On-Time is not Y2K compliant and it is not
possible to transfer data in On-Time to another calendar product.


Therefore, I need a list of staff who absolutely need On-Time so we can
look at buying licenses for the current, Y2K compliant version for those
staff.   It would be nice for everyone to us~ the same calendar, but I
understand the need for staff who use On-Time to keep their data and not
lose it.

The most immediate action we need to take is to identify any
'non-standard' software that OPD staff use for official business functions
that will not be provided with the 'standard load". These include, but
are not limited to, On-Time, Lexis Nexis, Travel Manager, Time and
Attendance (PPI), Haver Analytics, and Bloomberg.  IS&T did a software
inventory which picked up such software as PalmPilot Desktop, Ghostscript,
postScript Text Viewer, The PointCast Network, RealPlayer, Microsoft
Bookshelf and many others.

Note:  PalmPilot is currently not supported by IS&T and will not be
approved as a non-standard software package.  IS&T is focusing most of
their attention to Y2K efforts and this is not part of those efforts.
IS&T understands the importance of this software and plans to address it
in the future.

In order for staff to continue using these special programs, they must 1)
identify the software package needed 2) state an official business need
3) if they already have the license for it, provide me the license 4)
provide the CD or disk for the software, if available and they have the
license 5) present proof of Y2K compliancy.   please provide this
information to me by 12 noon Friday or earlier, if you can.

I am sending to each of you information provided by IS&T with specific
information about what to expect from the roll-out, NT 4.0 and training
opportunities for staff to get used to the new load before it is
installed.

Thank you in advance for your help with this project!!    Call me with any
questions.
