TEXT:
The First Lady is planning to do a mentoring event in which she would
announce $16 million in mentoring grants, release a report on the
effectiveness of mentoring, as well as promote a new psa campaign on
mentoring. We are also exploring additional mentoring announcements from
the Department of Education. This announcement will be ready around
mid-January, and could be made by the President and First Lady.
