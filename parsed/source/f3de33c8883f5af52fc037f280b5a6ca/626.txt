TEXT:

I need to revise one of our responses for the immigration
resolutions:
2.1.8   Research and Data Collection
The Administration supports strengthening the reliability and
capability of data collection and research on migration issues.
However, we do not support reinstatement of the program of annual
registration and reregistration of all legal immigrants in the
United States as called for by this resolution.
Also, I am trying to determine whether NSC is submitting the
refugee responses themselves or whether they plan to incorporate
their responses into the DPC document.  I have not heard back yet.

thanks
