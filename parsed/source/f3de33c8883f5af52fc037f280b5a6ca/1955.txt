 THE UPCOMING MEDICARE REPORT WILL NO DOUBT CONFIRM WHAT THE
 PRESIDENT HAS CONSISTENTLY STATED -- THAT REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS
 SHOULD COME TOGETHER AND ENACT MEDICARE REFORM THIS YEAR.

 WE WELCOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE TRUST FUND. PRESIDENT CLINTON HAS
 BEEN ACTING TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM SINCE HE TOOK OFFICE.

      The President's 1993 Economic Plan extended the life of the Trust Fund by three years.

      In 1994, the reforms included in the Health Security Act would have strengthened the
      Trust Fund by five years.

      In 1995 and 1996, the President proposed a Medicare plan that would have extended the
      life of the Trust Fund for at least a decade.

 THIS YEAR THE PRESIDENT'S BALANCED BUDGET GUARANTEES THE LIFE
 OF THE TRUST FUND FOR A DECADE.

      HCFA's Chief Actuary confirms that the President's Medicare proposals would extend the
      life of the Trust Fund by at least ten years.

 ACTION IS NEEDED -- REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS SHOULD USE THIS
 OPPORTUNITY TO COME TOGETHER IN A BIPARTISAN MANNER TO ADDRESS THE
 NEED FOR REAL MEDICARE REFORM.

      The need for responsible intervention to improve the Trust Fund is real. The President has a
      proposal that addresses this need in ~ responsible way, without imposing devastating
      provider cuts, increasing beneficiary costs, or enacting structural changes that devastate the
      program and the people it serves.

      This report should not be used irresponsibly. The upcoming Trust Fund report should not
      be used to recklessly frighten the 38 million Medicare beneficiaries and their families into
      thinking that their benefits are in imminent danger. They simply are not.

      We have time to act this year.   Over $120 billion remains in the Trust Fund (as of March
      1997). While incoming revenues are somewhat less than outgoing payments, the current
      balance in the Trust Fund means that there is no danger that claims will not be paid.

IT IS TIME TO PUT PARTISAN DIFFERENCES ASIDE AND AGREE ON MEDICARE
REFORMS THAT WILL EXTEND THE LIFE OF THE TRUST FUND AND STRENGTHEN THE
MEDICARE PROGRAM.

                                                                        Automated Records Management System
                                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion
