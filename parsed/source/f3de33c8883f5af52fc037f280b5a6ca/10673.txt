TEXT:
FYI.  I just got a call from Brad Woodhouse in Rep. Etheridge's office
saying the congressman wanted to get across: 1. he'd heard tobacco was
getting "trashed" in the SOTU and that would cause enormous political
problems for members like himself; and 2. the district's farmers are
"reeling" from the recent quota cuts and will be upset by more tough
rhetoric.
