BR/EK:

Cathy called to ask me about the SW Border meeting at 4pm.  I'm afraid I
don't know much about it. All I know is that it's w/Rubin and Kelly from
Treasury, Reno and Holder from Justice, McCaffrey, and probably Rahm and a
few others. As I mentioned, McCaffrey had a meeting w/Reno, Kelly and
enforcement types on Tuesday. Much of its was focused on how ONDCP was
not planning to put itself in charge of the Border, and that the proposed
SW Border Czar would probably be a DOJ or Treasury employee. Also, McCaf
frey passed out an organizational chart, different from what he gave EB,
that had the agencies listed over the proposed SW Border Czar.
Interesting, huh?

Let me know how it goes.  I know DOJ and Treasury are talking about the
need for their own proposal, but I don't expect them to put anything solid
on the table today.  I'll shoot over another note if I find anything else
out in the next 1/2 hour.

Jose'
