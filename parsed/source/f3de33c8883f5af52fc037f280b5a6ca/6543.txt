MEMORANDUM FOR THE CHIEF OF STAFF

FROM:                   Bruce Reed·

SUBJECT:                Meeting with Senator Domenici


[Boilerplate intro]

Talking Points

       Senator Domenici has proposed that any tobacco funds should "go towards keep the
Medicare system solvent, not new Washington spending." His gave GOP radio address on
February 7th on this topic saying "We should save Medicare first." This is obviously in conflict
with our budget, which provides unrestricted funds to states as well as nearly $15 billion in child
care and education block grants.

       We want to work with Senator Domenici to ensure that the budget resolution he crafts
does not limit all tobacco spending to Medicare. To that end, we could say:

        ·        The President believes it is critical that we enact comprehensive, bipartisan
                 legislation to dramatically reduce teen smoking this year.

        ·        Obviously, there are many members of Congress have different ideas about how
                 tobacco funds should be spent. We think it is critical that we leave our options
                 open while the remainder of the tobacco bill is being debated.

        ·        Thus, we urge you to propose a budget resolution that does not limit tobacco
                 spending to certain categories, but has enough flexibility to allow these decisions
                 be made as part of a larger legislative package. Restricting our spending options
                 may make it more difficult for us to garner enough votes to enact comprehensive
                 tobacco legislation.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE CHIEF OF STAFF

FROM:                   Bruce Reed

SUBJECT:                Meeting with Senator McCain

[Boilerplate intro] .

Talking Points

        Senator McCain is planning to report a bill out of the Commerce Committee by March
18th, and his staff tells us they would like to produce a bill that we would support. They are
starting with S. 1415, McCain's bill codifying the Attorneys' General settlement, and we are
providing him with advice and technical assistance. As you know, we responded last week to
74 written questions posed by Senator McCain.

        We should start by reiterating the President's commitment to working on a bipartisan
basis on this issues. We should then make clear that there are five key provisions -- the
principles that the President announced last September -- that must be in his bill in order to gain
Administration support:

                 1. Tough penalties and price increases to reduce youth smoking. Price
                 increases of up to $1.50 if necessary over the next ten years.

                 2.Full authority for the FDA to regulate tobacco products. Nicotine is a drug.
                  Its use in a product needs to be regulated by the Food and Drug Administration.

                 3. The tobacco industry must change the way it does business, including
                 stopping advertising to children.

                 4. There needs to be progress towards other public health goals including
                 cutting second-hand smoke and better funded programs to help people quit
                 smoking.

                 5. There should be protection for tobacco farmers and their communities so
                 they do not suffer economically because' of this legislation.
