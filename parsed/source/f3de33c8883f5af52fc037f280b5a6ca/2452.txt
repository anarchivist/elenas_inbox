TEXT:
I've reserved the VP's Ceremonial office (OEOB 276) for the meeting w/

womens groups tomorrow.     It is on the VP's schedule from 5:00 p.m. -       5:30

p.m. w/ a five minute brief in his    ww   office from 4:50 - 4:55.     The room

is reserved until 6pm if others want to stay and take questions.



I am told that 20 people max fit comfortably at the table (including the

VP and the First Lady), so please keep that in mind when you are inviting,

especially if you want any senior staff at the table.



Audrey, our Counsel's office needs to vet all people who attend meeting w/

the VP.    Can you e-mail to me the full names of the participants, the

dates of birth if possible and the state they live in ASAP.          Thanks very

much.
