  TEXT:
  As I mentioned to a couple of you this morning, I think it would be weird
  for Shalala to read a letter from the POTUS to Lowey at an event.  It
  should be instead a Statement by the President.  I have tweaked this a bit
  (along with Barry Toiv's good editing).

  Please make sure it meets with your (or your bosses') approval.  Most
  importantly, please check the Congressional references -- sponsors of the
  bill, which members are mentioned, etc.

  please look at this quickly, as we need to get it to HHS so Shalala can
  look at it.

                                      March 30,1998




      Although my trip to Africa precludes me from joining Congresswoman Nita Lowey,
Congressman _ Kennedy and others gathered in the Roosevelt Room, I want to state
once more my strong support for legislation to put the brakes on drunk driving.

       Setting a uniform limit for impaired driving at .08 blood alcohol content (BAC) will
help us crack down on drunk driving nationwide. At a time when crime all across
America is going down, we still lose an American to drunk driving every 30 minutes --
every half hour a family is shattered, a child, a parent, a neighbor, is lost forever.

       By establishing a strong but sensible limit on blood alcohol content, we could save as
many as 600 lives a year. And a uniform drunk driving standard would still allow adults
to drink responsibly and moderately -- since the .08 BAC standard is not reached until a
170-pound man has had more than four drinks in an hour, and three for a typical woman.

       This should not be a partisan issue. Indeed, the bipartisan work of
Congresswoman Lowey and Congressmen Ben Gilman in the House and Senators
Lautenberg and DeWine in the Senate, proves that when leaders from both parties come
together, we can set aside political differences to save lives and serve America. It is my
fervent hope that the majority of the House will join the large bipartisan majority in the
Senate, and send me legislation that will save lives, make our streets safe, our drivers
sober, and our laws more sensible
