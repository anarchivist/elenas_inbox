     WHITE HOUSE CONFERENCE ON SCHOOL SAFETY_ President Clinton announced
     today that he will hold a White House Conference on School Safety on October 15. The
     conference will bring together students, parents, educators, police and juvenile justice officials,
     community based organizations and mental health experts to review what is know about the most
     effective ways to prevent school violence, and to respond to serious incidents of violence in our
     schools when they do occur. The conference will lead to the development of a national action
     plan for keeping our schools safe, disciplined (and drug free???), including ways of strengthening
     the federal Safe and Drug Free Schools Program.

     PRESIDENT CLINTON CHALLENGES CONGRESS TO STRENGTHEN PUBLIC
     SCHOOLS. President Clinton called on Congress to support his efforts to improve and reform
     K-12 education by putting standards, accountability, and choice back into our public schools.
     The President said that we must make the strategic investments necessary to ensure that our
     children are prepared for the 21st century, by reducing class size, modernizing our schools,
     investing in technology, expanding after-school learning opportunities, raising standards and
     ending social promotions. The President criticized Congress for taking steps in the opposite
     direction, by cutting $2 billion from his request for education investments, short-changing
     initiatives on education reform, on raising educational achievement for our children, and on
     providing focused help for students who need it most.

      RAISING TEACHER STANDARDS. With two million teachers to be hired in the next
     ten years to accommodate booming student enrollments and an aging teaching force,
     President Clinton called on Congress to approve his legislative agenda to boost teaching
     quality. He called on Congress to enact his proposals provide financial incentives for
     talented young people and mid-career professionals who commit to teaching at high-need
     schools, and improve the preparation of future teachers. He also called on Congress to
     enact his proposals to help high-need urban and rural school districts undertake serious
     reforms to raise standards -- including rewarding good teachers and identifying
     incompetent or burnt-out teachers, giving them intensive assistance, and finding ways to
     make sure that those who don't improve leave the classroom. Finally, he called on
     Congress to enact his class size and teacher quality proposal, which would help local
     communities hire 100,000 new teachers to reduce class size in grades 1-3 to a national
     average of 18, and would require new teachers hired under the initiative pass competency
     tests before entering the classroom. Praising AFT's appeals for higher standards for
     students and teachers, the President called on every AFT affiliate to become full partners in
     boosting the quality of teachers and of all public schools.
