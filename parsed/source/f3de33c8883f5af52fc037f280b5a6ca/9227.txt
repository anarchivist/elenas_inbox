TEXT:
As you know, the President will speak very briefly tomorrow about how
mentoring can help reduce racial disparities in the fields of science and
technology. Disparities in these fields are already high and likely to
grow, according to at least one study which shows that first year
enrollments in related graduate programs by African Americans and
Hispanics have decreased by 20 and 18 percent, respectively.

Issue is: study attributes the drop to Adarand and Hopwood, Prop 209,
etc. My inclination is to reference the report, while steering clear of
any mention of affirmative action or our position on the issue.

Does this make sense to you?   Please let me know as soon as you can.
Thanks.
