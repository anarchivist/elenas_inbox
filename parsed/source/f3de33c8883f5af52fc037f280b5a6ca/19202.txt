Elena,
Attached are the draft q&as on INS reform.   Also, Leanne and I spoke with
Peter tonight.  He agrees with INS and DOJ that they should have an
executive summary (along with our package) that he could use on the Hill.
Leanne and I have worked on the Julie Anbender document, and have fowarded
it to her for her comments. As soon as we get the INS/DOJ comments, we
will send it to you for your review.  Peter would like to be able to have
this when he goes to the Hill on Friday.   Thanks.

Julie

                                    March 26, 1998

Q:   What is the Administration's plan for reforming the INS?

A:   The Administration's plan will make federal immigration activities more effective by
     separating enforcement and service operations within INS -- from headquarters to the
     field -- while preserving the necessary integrating functions for supporting and
     coordinating both operations. The key features of the Administration's plan are:

            Effect an operational split between enforcement and services, resulting in
            two distinct, clear lines of authority from the field to headquarters, with an
            INS Commissioner continuing to be responsible for overall agency
            operations;

            Eliminate the current "district" field structure, and replace it with a
            functional and geographic-based organization that allows for the creation of
            service offices in areas convenient to their immigrant "customers" and the
            creation of enforcement offices focus at border areas, ports of entry and
            significant interior locations;

            Restructure management operations to ensure an effective "shared support"
            operation (e.g., records and data management, technological support,
            employee relations, and administrative support) that will serve both the
            enforcement and the service sides of the agency.

     The result will be an INS organization with strengthened accountability and
     improved efficiency and effectiveness that allows each operation to focus on the
     unique management, knowledge, skills, and abilities of its function.

Q:   Everyone agrees that the INS has substantial problems. Why, then, did the
     Administration reject the CIR recommendation to dismantle the agency?

A:   The CIR concluded that the INS's dual responsibility ofweIcoming legal immigrants and
     deterring illegal immigration has resulted in "mission overload." To address this issue,
     the CIR recommended disbanding the INS and reallocating its primary responsibilities to
     the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the State Department. We believe those
     recommendations would only compound the current problems with the nation's
     immigration system.

     First, such a substantial reallocation of authority could require a six- or seven-year
     transition, exacerbating existing concerns about long delays in immigration
     activities. Second and even more important, this reallocation would hinder the
     coordination and communication necessary to maintain the integrity and efficiency of
     both immigration enforcement and immigration service operations. To be most
             effective, all immigration policy and management should remain within one agency
             at the Justice Department.
        Q:   How will this reorganization address the frequent complaints about inefficiency and
             delay at the INS?

        A:   The Administration's reform plan will untangle the INS's overlapping and
             frequently confusing organizational structure and replace it with two clear
             organizational chains of command -- one to accomplish its enforcement mission and
             the other to provide immigration-related services.

             This separation will result in an INS organization with better accountability and
             improved efficiency that allows each operation to focus on the unique management,
             knowledge, skills, and abilities of its function. For example, service area directors
             would have the flexibility to move case processing responsibilities among offices within
             their area to maximize efficiency. Service area directors would be held accountable for
             meeting a nationally-established standard for timely processing and courteous service at all
             of the locations throughout the area's jurisdiction.

        Q:   How will your plan affect the Border Patrol?

        A:   The border patrol will perform its current border management functions, including the
             facilitation of legal traffic across our nation's borders and the enforcement against illegal
             entry. The Administration's plan creates an operational chain of command dedicated to
             immigration enforcement. Within this structure, the border patrol will be able to better
             coordinate enforcement activities with other enforcement officers, including inspectors,
             detention and deportation agents and investigation and removal officers. With this
             structure, INS can focus comprehensively on illegal immigration problems at the border
             and in the interior, and create a single point of accountability for performance.

        Q:   Did the Administration consider Congressman Reyes's proposal to pull all of
             enforcement operations out of INS and into Main Justice?

        A:   We did consider Congressman Reyes's proposal to move the enforcement operation into
             Main Justice. Consistent with his recommendation, our plan consolidates all
             enforcement operations to create a single point of responsibility and accountability.
             However, we concluded that creating a separate immigration enforcement agency within
             the Justice Department could ultimately result in hindering the coordination and
             communication necessary to maintain the integrity and effectiveness of both immigration
             enforcement and service operations.

             There are a variety of ways in which service officials depend on data collected by
             enforcement officers, and vice versa, to ensure the integrity and effectiveness of both
             functions -- as when, for example, a service officer discovers that a person has overstayed
             his visa and become an illegal alien.

                                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion

        Q:    Is this proposal any more than just another shuffling of the boxes on an
              organizational chart?

        A:     The Administration's plan is a fundamental change in the way the INS conducts
               business: this restructuring involves a total overhaul of both enforcement and
               service operations. One of the most dramatic features of this plan is the
               replacement of the district field structure with separate enforcement and service
               areas. This clear delineation of functions will address long-standing concerns
               about lines of authority and responsibility, consistency of operations, and
               performance within the INS. It will result in improved enforcement coordination
             . and measurable changes in the way INS provides services to the immigration
               community.

        Q:    When will we learn more about the Administration's plan for reform?

        A:    Congress directed the Attorney General to review the CIR recommendations and develop
              a restructuring plan that would result in greater effectiveness and efficiency in the
              performance of the core functions of the federal immigration system. On March 31 st,
               INS Commissioner Doris Meissner is testifying before the House Appropriations
              Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice and State, and will, at that time, present the
              Administration's reform proposal in more detail.
