             Study: Abortions Lowest in 20 Years

             By The Associated Press

             NEW YORK (AP) -- Effective contraceptive methods have contributed
             to the lowest nationwide abortion rate in more than two decades,
             according to a new study released this week.

             But the United States still has a high abortion level compared
with other
             developed Western countries. And poor women in rural America
have the
             hardest time having their pregnancies ended.

             The U.S. decline in abortions was accompanied by a drop in the
number
          of providers, some of whom may have been frightened by
anti-abortion
          violence, according to The Alan Guttmacher Institute, which
published the
          study:

             "When providers face harassment or violence from anti-abortion
groups,
             and abortion is a very small part of their revenue, it may not
be worth
             doing it,"   said Stanley Henshaw, author of what experts


consider the most
          accurate look at abortion in the United States.

             Abortions between 1992 and 1996 among women ages 15-44 decreased
             from about 1.5 million to 1.4 million, the lowest rate since
1975. That
           year, the abortion rate was 22 per 1,000, compared to 23 in
.1996. About
           1 million American women had abortions in 1975.

           Still, the number of abortions in the United States was higher
than in many
           other Western developed countries, the study said. In 1995 in
Sweden,
           the rate was 18 per 1,000; 16 in Canada; 15 in England and
Wales; and
           six·in the Netherlands. Russia's rate was 68 per 1,000 and
Romania's 87.

             Henshaw said much of the drop in the U.S. figures reflects more
effective
             contraceptive methods, especially among teen-agers.

             During the four years through 1996, the number of facilities
providing
             abortions dropped from 2,380 to 2,042, a decline of 14 percent.
For last
             year, with data still incomplete, that trend appears to have
continued,
             according to the study,   "Abortion Incidence and Services in the
United
             States, 1995-1996."

             The institute' found no abortion providers in 86 percent of all
U.S.
             counties; among rural counties, 95 percent provided no abortion
services.
             And abortion was unavailable in 89 of the 320 cities surveyed,
or 27
             percent.

          The greatest decline in services was among hospitals and
physicians'
          offices -- respectively 18 percent and 26 percent -- where women
in rural
          areas tend to have abortions. Less than 10 percent of the total
abortions
          are performed at such facilities, compared to clinics, whose
services
          generally have declined by only 2 percent by 1996.

             Of the 338 fewer facilities noted in the study, a decrease of 20
or more
             was registered in California (down 62 to 492), New York (down 23
to
             266), North Carolina (down 27 to 59) and Pennsylvania (down 20
to 61).

          All states had at least one provider in 1992, as they did in
1996; North


                Dakota and South Dakota had only one each .in both years
surveyed.

          Several areas experienced increases in services: New Jersey,
Utah and the
          District of Columbia.

                The study, conducted among residents of communities from July
1997 to
                March 1998, is published in the November/December issue of the
                institute's journal Family Planning perspectives.

                The Guttmacher Institute, a not-for-profit organization based in
New York
                and Washington, focuses on reproductive health research, policy
analysis
                and education.
