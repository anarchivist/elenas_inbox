TEXT:
Josh has asked to meet internally with Legis Affairs, the Women's Office,
and Tom and me today at 4:30pm in Room 248. He wants a prebrief for a
meeting with the women's groups on Monday. The women's groups want to
talk about OFCCP's request, which is currently pending at OMB, to collect
wage data from federal contractors at the desk audit phase., The
Department of Labor has requested a 90-day extension for OMB to decide,
but this has not been announced yet.  Labor is considering rescinding
their request to collect this information. We suggest that Josh use this
as a listening session.  In case you don't want to attend, is there
anything else you want us to emphasize? Thanks, Mary
