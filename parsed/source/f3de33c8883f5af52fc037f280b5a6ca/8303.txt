The Social Office has authorized each staff member to now bring 2 guests
to tomorrow's Staff Picnic.  You do not need to RSVP the second guest's
name.  However, guests must accompany the passholder/ticket holder. Also,
staff do not need to bring the enclosure card in the invitation -- all
they need is their pass or their ticket. An alpha roster will be at the
gate as a back-up.

Thanks for all your help with this event.    Hope to see you there!

Brooks
