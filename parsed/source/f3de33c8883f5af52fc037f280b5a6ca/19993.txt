 Dear Senator McCain,

         I support your efforts in helping to pass comprehensive tobacco legislation which
 dramatically reduces youth smoking and to remove Section 604 which requires Indian tribes to
 collect state taxes on sales of tobacco products.

          Since the formation of the Union, the United State has recognized Indian tribes as
 "domestic dependent nations" that exercise governmental authority over their members and their
 territory. Where Indians manufacture tobacco products on their own lands, state taxes on
 reservation-generated tobacco products would normally be pre-empted under the tribal
 self-determination doctrine; Section 604, as currently drafted, interferes with this fundamental
 principle. Even with respect to state taxes collected on sales of pre-packaged goods to
 non-Indians, Section 604 violates traditional principles of comity and federalism, which demand
 that state-tribal relations be developed based on dialogue and cooperation between states and
 tribes.

         Section 604 establishes a complex scheme to address a problem that many states and
 Indian tribes have already resolved. At least eighteen states have entered into state-tribal tax
 agreement with numerous Indian tribes. These agreements ensure that a single tax is imposed,
 provide a stable tax framework, and ease tax administration significantly. By unilaterally
 requiring Indian tribes to collect the state taxes arid also adding the federal government as an
 intermediary, Section 604 enormously increases the burden of collecting taxes, without any
 benefit to the states or the Indian tribes. Federal accounting, oversight, and administrative costs
 will increase to implement this new legislative scheme.

          Agreements are the best mechanisms for mutually satisfactory resolution of tax collection
  issues between states and tribes. Even if states and tribes are unable to reach agreement,
. however, states may impose their taxes at the wholesale level to collect taxes on goods that are
  destined for sale to non-Indians.

         As originally drafted, the McCain bill did not disturb the current system, which has
 worked for both the tribes and the states. It permitted the states and the tribes to work together
 to collect the state's revenues and to share revenues if they so desire. Moreover, it vindicated the
 federal government's trust responsibility to Indian tribes and recognized their status as domestic
 dependent nations.

         I hope that you will continue to work to remove Section 604, as currently drafted, from
 the legislation. Thank you for your important work in this area.

        Sincerely,
