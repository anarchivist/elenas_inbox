TEXT:
According to Lynn, the idea for a farmworker   housing pilot was raised by
the Mayor of Salinas in a meeting last week.    Salinas received some HUD
money from the current budget that they want   to use for this purpose and
suggested that they may want to connect with   USDA in designing their
project.
