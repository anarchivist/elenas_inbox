                                                  April 29, 1998


        The Honorable Bob Livingston
        Chairman
        Committee on Appropriations
        U.S. House of Representatives
        Washington, D.C. 20515

        Dear Mr. Chairman:

                The Administration strongly objects to the inclusion of any provision in the FY 1998
        Supplemental Appropriations Conference Report to allow for the importation of any modified
        semiautomatic assault rifles that accept large capacity military magazines. The Secretary of the
        Treasury, consistent with his authority under the Gun Control Act of 1968, recently concluded
        that these firearms do not meet the sporting purposes test and are generally not importable.
        Thus, the President would veto any supplemental appropriations bill that includes language
        undermining this decision.

                The proposed language would potentially allow for as many as 600,000 modified Uzis,
        AK 47s and other assault-type rifles to be imported into the country. While we know that an
        estimated 3,000 of these firearms have already reached our shores, we have almost no way of
        verifying the precise number of firearms "in transit." Moreover, we know from our experience
        in implementing a similar amendment in 1994 that an such an exemption will be nearly
        impossible to implement and could allow hundreds of thousands of modified assault weapons to
        circumvent the Secretary's decision.

               I strongly urge the Committee to reject this provision.

                                             Sincerely,



                                             Franklin Raines
