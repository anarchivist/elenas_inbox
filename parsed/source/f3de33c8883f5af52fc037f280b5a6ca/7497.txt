TEXT:
Q:      Do recent events -- the tobacco settlement in Texas or the
release of documents showing some companies were marketing to children
diminish the need for legislation or the chance that it would get passed?

A:      No. It is a good sign that industry is being held accountable
for the harms it has caused, and that we are getting information out about
how the industry has hurt children.   That should serve as still further
impetus for comprehensive legislation. We need a comprehensive system of
penalties to make sure companies reduce teen smoking; we need the FDA to
have authority over tobacco products to protect our health; and we need to
make sure tobacco companies donO,t market to children.  I think all the
attention from these events makes it clear why we need a national
solution, and why itO,s so important to get it done soon.


Q:      Lawyers in both Texas and Florida have asked for obscene amounts
of money for their role in bringing about settlements with the tobacco
industry. will you support a provision in national legislation to limit
fees for lawyers?

A:      IO,m primarily concerned with ensuring that tobacco legislation
reduces youth smoking and protects the public health -- not with
collecting and distributing money from a settlement. The lawyers who
brought these suits have expended lots of time and effort, and deserve to
be well recompensed for their work.  But everyone agrees that fees
shouldnO,t be out of proportion to the work that was done.
