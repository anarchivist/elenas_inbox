                                  Promoting Values and Fighting Crime
                                             July 22, 1998

    Recognizing the important role that civic, community, and faith-based organizations can play in
    reducing crime, President Clinton will unveil a new Values-Based Violence Prevention Initiative.
    Specifically, Justice Department will make $2.2 million in grants available to 16 community-based
    collaboratives -- including religiously-affiliated organizations -- that target youth violence, gangs,
    truancy, and other juvenile problems by promoting common-sense values and responsibility.

    Value-Based Violence Prevention

            Building on the Boston model. The Values-Based Initiative stems from the successful
            approach taken in Boston, where local law enforcement joined forces with preachers and
            other faith organizations to protect youth from violence and give them alternatives to crime.
            The whole community worked together -- from the district attorney, to the federal prosecutor,
            probation officers, police, social service workers and neighborhood ministers -- to combat
            gangs and prevent juvenile crime. The result: juvenile crime plummeted and youth
            homicides with firearms came to a halt.

            Linking stronger values to less violence. Values are a strong predictor of violent crime. The
            initial findings of a long-term study on violence in Chicago neighborhoods found that
            communities with strong sense of shared values that were reinforced by adults had 40% less
            crime than those that did not. In fact, a community's willingness to work together to
            reinforce certain behaviors and maintain order was a better predictor of crime rates than other
            factors, such as poverty or race.

           A comprehensive response to youth violence. The initiative builds on existing
           Administration efforts to reduce juvenile crime. Cities taking part in this Values-Based
           Initiative are already participating in the President's Youth Crime Gun Interdiction Initiative,
           Anti-Gang COPS initiative, and Justice's Weed and Seed program. Today's initiative will
           help more cities replicate the Boston model by enhancing these efforts with the involvement
           of community-based groups -- including religiously-affiliated organizations -- to reach out to
           at-risk youth, instill values, and improve public safety.

           Expanding partnerships in 16 cities. The initiative will provide grants of $135,000 for gang
           intervention, truancy prevention, mentoring, drug and alcohol abuse, conflict resolution, job
           training, and other activities. The 16 cities selected for the demonstration are: Salinas, CA;
           Los Angeles, CA; Washington, DC; Miami, FL; Chicago, IL; Indianapolis, IN; Baltimore,
           MD; Detroit, MI; Kansas City, MO; Hempstead, NY; Portland, OR; Philadelphia, PA;
           Charleston, SC; San Antonio, TX; Richmond, VA; and Seattle, W A.

    Fighting for a Tough. Smart Juvenile Crime Bill

           The President continues to call on Congress to enact his Anti-Gang and Youth Violence
           Strategy -- to allow more communities to achieve Boston's success in attacking juvenile
           crime. The President's strategy includes money for prosecutors, courts, and probation
           officers to promote and enforce tough standards for juveniles, as well as funds for
           community-based anti-gang prevention similar to today's initiative.

                                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion
