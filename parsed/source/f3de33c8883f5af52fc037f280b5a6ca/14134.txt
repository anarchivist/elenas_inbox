Hi Elena,
Following is the Striker Replacement language.       Please let me know if its o.k.
Thanks.

Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me regarding
the hiring of permanent replacement workers by employers who have
contracts with the federal government.
On March 8, 1995 I issued an executive order banning the use of
permanent replacement workers by employers who have contracts
with the federal government. As you know, enforcement of this
order has been blocked by a u.S. Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia Circuit, and my Administration has decided
not to challenge that decision. While I firmly believe that my
Executive Order preventing government contractors from replacing
striking workers was within the law, further litigation on the
validity of the Order would not be productive.
My Administration continues to believe that protecting legally
striking employees from the threat of permanent replacement is an
important component in promoting the kind of stable collective
bargaining relationship necessary to maintain our nation's
productivity. Replacing legally striking workers makes labor
disputes worse for all concerned. Please be assured that we will
continue to explore ways to protect the rights of American
workers, to promote stable collective bargaining, and to ensure
the efficient completion of government contracts.
