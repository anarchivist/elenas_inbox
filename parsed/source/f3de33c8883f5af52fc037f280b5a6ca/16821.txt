  TEXT:
  Thank you for your attendance and input at today's meeting -- it was very
  productive.

  My notes reflect the following assignments:

  1)   more info/research on Msgr Higgins - Maria Echaveste
  2)   more info/research on Mario Obledo (sp.) - Maria Echaveste
  3)   more info/research on Bishop Roman - Melanne Verveer
  4)   more info/research on Frances Hesselbein - my office
  5)   more info/research on Ernesto Cortez - my office
  6)   more info/research on Max Kampelman - my office
  7)   check with Katie on Mardy Murie - me
  8)   check with Chuck Ruff on Elliot Richardson - me

  After getting this information L will circulate another list for your
  comments.  Shortly thereafter, we'll get a memo to the President -- no
  need for another meeting.

  FYI -- NSC will be recommending that the President award the MoF to Shali
  at his retirement ceremony.   Therefore, I think we can treat Shali
  separate and apart from this process.
