TEXT:
There is some" chance that the Riggs bill will come up on the House floor
before recess, though it is not on the tentative schedule for next week
right now, we believe that Riggs is trying to push for a vote.

We need a decision as to    whether we are trying to collaborate with the
CHC and House Dems on the   need for/timing of an alternative bill, or
sending one up regardless   of their views. Without this basic sense of
direction it is difficult   to reach out to the Dems and try to build
support for our approach.

So, while I did not have a sense of urgency about this earlier today, it
now seems more urgent to get the decision memo to POTUS.
