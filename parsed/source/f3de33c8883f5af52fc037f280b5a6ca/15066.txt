Our understanding is that HHS is about ready to talk to the State -- maybe
today or tomorrow    and has a draft set of terms and conditions ready for
discussion too.

The general asessment is that MD is in pretty good shape. The gist of MD
is the same as Illinois -- the "guardianship" demo -- except that here a
kid would only have to be in Foster Care for 6 months to be eligible for
the guardianship benefit, versus 2 years in Illinois.  From our end, this
raises a question of whether there would be cost shifting from TANF to
Foster Care.   But since MD will have a control/comparison group and cost
neutrality, I think the only issue is making sure that HHS will study the
effect and that they will be able to measure it. They agree,  and we will
be working with them on the language to be sure.
