$3B Left unspent From Welfare Funds

                            By LAURA MECKLER Associated Press Writer

                            WASHINGTON (AP)    With welfare rolls at a
30-year low,
                             states have yet to spend some $3 billion of
federal welfare
                            money. Congressional Republicans are seizing on
the figures
                            released Monday to argue that new money is not
needed for
                            child care and other services.

                            In 1996, Congress overhauled the nation's
welfare system,
                            giving states a total of $16.5 billion each year
rather than money
                            for each person who needs public assistance as
it did for 61
                            years.

                            The House Ways and Means Committee said in a
statement that
                            states have a total of $6.2 billion in unspent
welfare money, but
                            that counts funds states have already obligated
for specific
                            payments. Counting only unobligated money,     the
total is just
                            over $3 billion.

                            States say they need to save the unspent money
in case of an
                            economic downturn and to provide special
services to people
                            with the most problems who will be toughest to
move off
                            welfare.



                           Republicans agree it is time to turn attention
to such people.

                           "The next phase of welfare reform is the key to
permanently
                           lifting more families from poverty and giving
them opportunities
                           for brighter futures, "    Rep. Nancy L. Johnson,
R-Conn. ,
                           chairwoman of the committee's welfare panel,
said in a statement
                           Monday.

                           Johnson released a report by the Congressional
Research
                           Service detailing the unspent money.

                           Republicans argue that states have enough money
without new
                           spending proposed by President Clinton. In his
budget, Clinton
                           seeks billions of dollars to provide more child
care and to offer
                           job training for those hardest to remove from
the welfare rolls.

                           "We'd like to understand the president's
reasoning, especially in
                           light of the fact that they'll get another $16.5
billion next year, ' ,
                           said Ways and Means spokesman Trent Duffy.

                           There are proposals to cut that spending,    too,
although states
                           argue the fun9ing level was a promise made
during the 1996
                           welfare debate.

                           House Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich,
R-Ohio, has
                           said he will propose cutting welfare money
because caseloads
                           have dropped so fast -- an idea states have
vigorously
                           protested.

                           State welfare balances vary widely. New York has
the most
                           unspent money -- $689 million, and Pennsylvania
is No.2 with
                           $245 million. But many states have nothing left
over, including
                           Alaska, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine,
Oregon, Virginia
                           and Wyoming.
