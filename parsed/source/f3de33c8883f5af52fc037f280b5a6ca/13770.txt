TEXT:
Elena - heard nothing else from Katie about this today, and just
realized that and that sh~ has departed.  I suspect the lack of
dialogue reflects - frankly - the low priority that either she or
Ron are assigning to this particular issue, but i know that
doesn't resolve your problem.
i'll be out of the office Monday, Tues. and Wed.; back in office
Thursday.  I can reached at either (hotel) 303 444-3330 or
(conference - End. Species Act) 303 492 12186; fax 303 492-1297.
Call if i can be of use.  However, in pursuit of the elusive
KM/RK connection, i'd pursue it directly with Katie.
Tom will be here and is looking forward to a brief plunge back
into the world of timber.
