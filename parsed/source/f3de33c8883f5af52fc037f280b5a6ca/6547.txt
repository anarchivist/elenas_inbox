TEXT:
A couple of quick updates as I head out to a hill discussion on Unz:

1. I am waiting for a response from Jen/Stephanie on whether we can make
the 20th work for the meeting--and for the earliest possible time Gerstner
can get here for a meeting that day; I know it is sometime in the
afternoon, but Gerstner's folks aren't more specific yet.

2. Looks like we won't be able to get Hunt on either the 16th or the
20th; among other things; he has a special sessing for .the following week
that he will be focused on.

3. I'll get back to you soon with more thoughts about gov's.
