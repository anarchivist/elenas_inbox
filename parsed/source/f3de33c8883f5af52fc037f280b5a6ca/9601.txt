TEXT:
Ed-FLex:  The governors continue their singular focus on Ed-Flex; last
week there was a bipartisan gov. letter to House and Senate leadership,
urging them to include the Ed-Flex bill we support in the omnibus
appropriations bill. We support this effort, but think it is most likely
to happen if the R's push for block grants, and we counter with Ed-Flex.
Now, Gov's Carper, Chiles and Romer have told Fred Duval they want to talk
to someone here who is driving our Ed-Flex effort (but not me--they want
someone who will be personally involved in the end-game negotiations on
appropriations). Fred is looking for someone willing to take the
call--Erskine, Jack Lew or Sylvia Mathews are on his list.  I'll work on
talking points for whoever gets the call.
