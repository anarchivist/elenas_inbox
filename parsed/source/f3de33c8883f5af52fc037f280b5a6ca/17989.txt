TEXT:
For all of you who played any part in the preparations for and
implementation of the Town Hall meeting in Akron yesterday, thank you for
the tremendous teamwork that made the meeting a success.  So many people
worked extremely hard to make the meeting work, and it did work.  Thank
you.

For many in the country, it may have been their first exposure to the
President's Race Initiative.  For them, I believe it was a tremendous
introduction to what the President hopes to accomplish with the
Initiative.

We on the Initiative staff can always do more and better.      I welcome any


suggestions that you may have for us for specific events, such as town
meetings, or any other aspects of what we want to accompliSh.

Thank you again!
