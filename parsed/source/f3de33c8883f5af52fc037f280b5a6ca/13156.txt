DRAFT STATEMENT
ON THE NINTH CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS DECISION TO FORCE
ADDITIONAL SALES OF OLD GROWTH TIMBER
        I am very concerned about the rush by special interests and
their [Republican] friends in Congress to reignite the timber
wars of the Pacific Northwest, and I am deeply disappointed in
the court's decision to force us to release these sales of
healthy ancient timber.
        I had expressed my concerns about the environmental
consequences of the logging legislation, but I received repeated
assurances from Congress that we could implement the statute in
an environmentally
o
-responsible way. We strongly believed that
these sales of ancient timber were not covered by that
legislation.
        I am sorry that the courts found differently. We fought
this case to the bitter end and now the Justice Department has
advised me that there is no viable appeal.  Therefore, we have no
choice but to comply with the court's decision.  The court's
decision forces us to release timber that may lead to grave
environmental injury to chinook salmon and other wildlife, damage
our rivers and streams, and hurt sport and commercial fishers.
        Consequently, I calIon the timber industry to work
voluntarily to mitigate this harm or to restrict cutting to those
areas less likely to harm salmon and other species. They tell
the Forest Service they want to do the right thing. Now, they
should do the right thing.
 [      These same battles were fought in the years before my


Northwest Forest Plan. We were able to maintain a balance
between timber sales and a healthy environment. We ushered in a
new era of sustainable, stable and predictable timber supply. As
a result, management of our public lands in the Northwest moved
out of the courts and back into the hands of public lands
managers where it belongs. 1
 [      In signing the 1995 Rescission Act and in subsequent
directives to my cabinet, I pledged to uphold existing
environmental laws and standards except when forced to do
otherwise. We will continue to do that and challenge those who
interpret differently the language in that law. 1
        As displayed through their actions and rhetoric, it is clear
that many congressional Republicans are more interested in
appeasing special interests than listening to scientists warning
of environmental damage -- or to a public demanding environmental
protection.
