Michelle, et.al.:

Here's the quickie statement Rahm wanted on this case. Someone will have
to run it by Counsel. Bill Marshall already told me we shouldn't do
one ... not a constitutional case, etc.

                                            Statement by the President

                 I applaud the Supreme Court's decision today to make sure that drug traffickers who carry
         firearms -- whether on their person or in their car -- are subject to the stiffest penalties possible.
         Crime rates have fallen in America for six years in a row, but guns and drugs remain serious
         problems among our youth and in many of our neighborhoods. Today's decision is one more
         victory for law enforcement and law abiding citizens in the fight against crime and drugs.
