 Subject:         Domenici/Kasich Reolutions on Tobacco and Welfare

 Cynthia Rice had asked whether we had any information on what , if
 anything, the House and Senate Resolutions might do in tobacco. Based on
 the materials we have seen, neither resolution appears to include the
 Budget's tobacco tax increase or recoupment policies, nor specifically
 addresses tobacco-related programs in the discretionary funding
 allocations.

 Information on both resolutions is generally available for only broad
 functional categories, so it is difficult to be precise about effects on
 specific programs. However, since the Senate resolution could produce a
 12.2 percent across-the-board reduction for non-defense discretionary
 (NDD) funding, the President's proposed increases for tobacco spending in
 CDC and FDA would be in jeopardy.  Information available on the House
 resolution is very limited at this point and it is not possible to
 speculate what its effects might be.
