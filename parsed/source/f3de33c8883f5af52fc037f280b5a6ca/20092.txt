         Weekly Report -- Welfare Reform Team
         5/28/98

                   Welfare Reform -- State Reinvestment ofTANF Savings: During your meeting with
         Welfare-to-Work Partnership Board members last week you stressed the importance of states
         reinvesting their welfare savings in child care, transportation and training. We will work with
         HHS to analyze state expenditure data for T ANF and child care. This data is not as timely as we
         would like. In the meantime, there is some encouraging information in the NGA Fiscal Survey
         of States released on May 27th. The way states are spending their federal and state welfare
         funds is shifting from cash to work-related supports. Comparing expenditures of state funds in
         1996 with planned spending for 1998, spending for cash assistance decreased 26 percent, while
         spending for child care increased 85 percent and spending on work activities increased 34
         percent. Total state welfare spending declined by 9 percent, but given caseload reductions, this
         actually represents increased spending per person.
