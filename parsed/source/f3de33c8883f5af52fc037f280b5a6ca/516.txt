This morning, I submitted your paperwork to set up your computer and telephone.
Office of Administration was still waiting on receiving a signed copy of your
paperwork from the CoS.
About files you cannot access on Jeremy's computer, the bad news is that you
will have to copy them onto a disk if you need to use them.  The good news is
that I will make sure you are the first one in the office to be switched to
Lotus Notes. The DPC office switch to Lotus Notes should be occuring very soon.
As information becomes available on any of these things, I will let you know
ASAP.  If you have any more questions, please ask!  Thanks.
