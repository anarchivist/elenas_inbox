TEXT:
i would really like to move us along immediately in releasing the
statement that we held back on saturday. press office held it
back (understandably) cause they did not want to interfere with
our main saturday event and message. BUT, we now need to move it
--- we are getting innumerable calls from the press, the governors
offices, the delegation, etc. all wanting clarification on
exactl~where we stand.   moreover, there are important parts of
our stmt that did not get into the oral things we said -- like
that we will make good on our contracts and find replacement
timber as a preference to buyouts, etc. all of these things are
very important to rounding out our msg.
i mentioned this to leon at sr. staff this am.  he was agreeable
that we should get the stmt out -- tho he seemed to suggest that
maybe we should consider a different fprm (e.g. a letter to the
hill) .
what say all of you???   thx.
