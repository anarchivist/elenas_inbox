TEXT:
I wanted to give everyone an update on the content of the Democratic Unity
Event on Wednesday. As of a meeting that just happened with the Hill,
this is who's talking about what:

Gephardt                 FAMILIES -- to include minimum wage, fair pay,
PBOR, etc.
Daschle         SENIORS -- to include long-term care; pensions;
crimes against seniors
VPOTUS          EDUCATION -- also a small bit on the environment
POTUS                    Emphasis on SOCIAL SECURITY/ECONOMY, with
touches on all the                       other topics within the larger
framework of his budget.

They are looking for 2 real people:  l)business person to talk about the
economy, social security, etc.; and 2) a young person or young teacher to
talk about education.
