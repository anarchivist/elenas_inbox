The Honorable Henry J. Hyde
Chairman
Committee on the Judiciary
U.S. House of Representatives
Washington, D.C.  20515


Dear Chairman Hyde:

        Today, your Committee will mark-up H.R. 3736, the 'i&Workforce
Improvement and Protection Act of 199B1l8 which is intended to address the
growing demand for skilled workers in the information technology (IT)
industry.  H.R. 3736 enacts a temporary increase in the annual cap on the


    number of visas for temporary foreign O&specialty08 workers under the H-IB
    program, while also effecting reforms to the H-IB program that would help
    target usage of H-IB visas to industries and employers that are actually
    experiencing skill shortages.

             The Administration believes that the first response for increasing
    the availability of skilled workers for industry must be increasing the
    skills of U.S. workers and helping the labor market work better to match
    employers with U.S. workers.   Therefore, additional efforts to increase
    the skill level of U.S. workers and needed improvements to the H-IB
    program are necessary prerequisites for the Administration to support any
    short-term increase in the number of H-IB visas available for temporary
    foreign workers. Modifications to the H-IB program that appropriately
    protect U.s. workers are fully consistent with the AdministrationO,s
    longstanding support for legal immigration.

            We are pleased that H.R. 3736 as reported from the Immigration and
    Claims Subcommittee is consistent with one of our primary objectives,
    insofar as it links a temporary increase in the H-IB cap to the enactment
    of meaningful reforms to the H-IB visa program. H.R. 3736 would help
    ensure that U.S. workers do not lose their jobs to temporary foreign
    workers and that employers have made serious efforts to recruit U.s.
    workers for open positions so that qualified U.S. workers have the
    opportunity to fill a job before a temporary foreign worker is hired.
    Moreover, H.R. 3736 expands enforcement authority to help prevent employer
    abuses of the H-IB program.  These reforms will effectively target H-IB
    visas to industries experiencing skill shortages.

            Unfortunately, H.R. 3736 does not contain any provision to
    encourage additional training of U.S. workers.    Training is a vital
    component of our strategy to address the long-term demand for highly
    skilled U.s. workers and to enhance the international competitiveness of
    important U. S. indus.tries. An e.ffective training strategy would also work
    to reduce the demand for H-IB visas.    The Administration strongly supports
    amending H.R. 3736 to provide for additional training opportunities for
    U.s. workers and believes that this training should be funded, in part,
    through a modest H-IB application fee paid by employers.

            The Administration is also concerned tha·t the increase in the
    annual number .of H-IB visas reflected in this bill is too large, although
    we agree that the increase should last for only three years.   In addition,
    the Administration does not support provisions in the bill that would
    impose occupation-based restrictions on the first 65,000 H-IB visas.

             The Administration believes that the reforms included in H.R. 3736
    would substantially improve the current H-IB program. with the addition
    of a meaningful training provision, a modest reduction in the level of
    increase in the annual H-IB visa cap, and modifications to make the bill
    consistent with U.S. international trade obligations, H.R. 3736 would
    garner .the AdministrationO, s strong support. However, if amendments are
    adopted that substantially weaken the reform or enforcement provisions of
    H.R. 3736 or if meaningful provisioris for increasing the skill levels of
    U.S. workers are not adopted, the Secretary of Labor and the Attorney
    General would recommend that the President veto this legislation.

            The Office of Management and Budget advises that there is no
    objection to the submission of this report from the standpoint of the
    AdministrationO,s program.



Sincerely,




JANET RENO          ALEXIS HERMAN
Attorney General            Secretary of Labor
