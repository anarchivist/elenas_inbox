TEXT:
Elena Kagan has asked that we change the meeting time to sometime later
tomorrow afternoon.  I suggest we do it anytime after 1:30pm, if we can all be
there.  I suggest 2:00pm, if that isn't too late.  Please respond to me ASAP to
let me know if you can make it.  I should be able to keep room 211.  Thanks.
