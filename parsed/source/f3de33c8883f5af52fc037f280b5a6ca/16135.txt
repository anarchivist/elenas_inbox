TEXT:
Jack and Josh are having a reconciliation conference call with the
agencies tomorrow (Tuesday, 7/8) at 4:00 p.m.  PAD offices are responsible
for letting their agencies know about the call and giving them the
conference number. The numbers are:

456-6755
456-6766
456-6777
456-6799

All use code 0072.

Only 28 people can get on the lines (7 on each line) -- so please do not
make individual calls (e.g., DADs should call in with their PADs, other
2nd floor folks should come to Jack's office, etc.)   We need to reserve
lines for people calling in from the agencies.

Thanks in advance for your help.
