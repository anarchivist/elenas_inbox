TEXT:
I wanted to let y'all know that I just had a very encouraging meeting Tom
Freedman and Julie Fernandes about the concerns I raised in my earlier
e-mail about the public argument for increased EEOC funding.  Tom and
Julie responded immediately and were eager to discuss all aspects of this
issue. Together we came up with a short term plan to develop external and
internal strategies for addressing this issue in an effective, accurate,
and coordinated way.  I am sure that Tom and/or Julie will be sharing this
information with you soon.  Please feel free to call me at ext. 5-1025 if
you have any questions.  thanks
