TEXT:
Dan Mendelson prepared this language for the Labor/HHS/Ed House Floor
SAP. We'll be circulating it tonight for WW clearance but wanted to run
it by you first.  Please let me know if you're ok or need changes.  Thanks.

The Administration strongly objects to language in the House Committee
bill, and to any related potential amendments, that would have the effect
of requiring family planning or other health care grantees to receive
parental consent or provide advance notification to parents before giving
contraceptives to minors.  Mandating parental consent discourages minors
from seeking health care and reproductive services and thus leads to more
unintended pregnancies, abortions, and sexually transmitted diseases,
including HIV.  Federal health program costs could also increase if this
amendment interferes with the prevention of teen pregnancy.  The
Administration urges the House to adopt the proposed Castle/Greenwood
amendment, which will ensure that grantees will encourage minors to seek
their family's participation in family planning decisions.

The Administration adamantly opposes the proposed Tiahrt amendment that
would mandate onerous and ill-defined physical separation requirements
between Title X supported family planning projects and non-Title X
activities related to abortion.  The Department of Health and Human
Services already provides safeguards, as well as performs periodic
rigorous site reviews, to ensure that no Title X funds are used to conduct
abortions or abortion related activities.
