     TEXT:
     This is the language I drafted for the Erskine letter to respond to the
     CBC's concerns with the juvenile bill.  Obviously, the letter didn't go
     out today (Thursday).  The underlined headings were what the CBC
     specifically asked him to respond to.  I based pretty much everything on
     the section-by-section on the Administration bill and some materials
     prepared for the AG when she met with some members with similar concerns.

     I have given this to Andy Blocker as draft only.  I told him you would
     review.  Let me know what you think and any specific changes you suggest.

     Thanks!==================== ATTACHMENT     1 ====================

           DRAFT


           1. Incarceration of juveniles with adults in the federal system

           Under the Administration's proposed legislation, the "Anti-Gang and Youth Violence Act of
           1997", juveniles prosecuted as juveniles could not be housed with adults until they reach age
           18, regardless of the offense. Moreover, no juvenile under age 16 who has been charged or
           convicted as an adult, can be housed with an adult under the proposed bill. Juveniles prosecuted
           as adults can be housed with adults after they reach the age of 16, at the discretion of the Bureau
           of Prisons.

           As juveniles have become increasingly violent, however, housing such dangerous juveniles with
           other juveniles can endanger younger, and sometimes more vulnerable, delinquents. The
           Administration believes it is more appropriate to give federal prison authorities the ability to be
           flexible depending upon the needs of the individual defendant.


           II. Prosecution of more juveniles as adults

           The current process for determining whether ajuvenile will be prosecuted as an adult or as a
           juvenile is often highly unpredictable. The Administration's bill does not add any new offenses
           for which ajuvenile can be charged in federal court.

           However, the Administration bill does expand the circumstances where a juvenile can be charged
           as an adult by giving federal prosecutors the discretion to transfer juvenile offenders to adult
           criminal court. It should be noted that except for the most serious juvenile offenders, age 16 and
           older, juveniles charged as adults may petition the court to be tried as juveniles rather than adults.


           III. More mandatory minimum sentences for juveniles

           The Administration's legislation increases mandatory minimum sentences from one year to three
           years for three narrowly targeted crimes: selling drugs to minors; using minors to distribute
           drugs; and trafficking drugs in or near a school or other protected location. The Administration
           believes that the proposed increases are necessary to punish persons who endanger children by
           selling illegal drugs to them, or employ or otherwise use them in their drug trade, and to deter
           others from engaging in such reprehensible and dangerous conduct.

           The mandatory minimum sentences could apply to juveniles who are prosecuted as adults.
           However, it should be noted that "safety valves" on mandatory sentences may be applied to
           13-15 year olds in certain circumstances.                    "


           IV. Availability of public records

                                                                        Automated Records Management System
                                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion




     President Clinton has had a longstanding commitment to fight for the rights of victims of crime.
     The Administration's bill contains important protections for the rights of victims, including the
     victims of crimes committed by juvenile offenders. The bill clarifies current law by extending
     to victims of juvenile offenders the right to information about the juvenile proceeding that they
     might need or be entitled to under state or federal law. For example, victims would be able find
     out about the status of the proceedings, or the release status of the offender. Fingerprints and
     photographs of adjudicated delinquents found to have committed the equivalent of an adult
     felony offense or a federal gun offense would be sent to the FBI and made available in the same
     manner applicable to adult defendants.

     The Administration believes these changes represent a fair balance between maintaining
     important protections for juveniles and expanding the information available to their victims.
