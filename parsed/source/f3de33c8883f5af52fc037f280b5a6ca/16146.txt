TEXT:
Below is my cut at the substance of what we agreed to at yesterday's Ed
Strategy meeting as a possible substitute for the Cardin amendment.
Please let me know if this strikes you as a sensible approach and whether
it accurately captures what we discussed.   It would be particularly
helpful to get your feedback on the bracketed portions, which I don't
think we really addressed yesterday, and which differ from Cardin's
approach.  I will separately circulate this to Mike Smith and others at
Education for their reactions.

If folks agree that this is basically on the mark, I also need guidance on
next steps.  I think drafters would need to put this more in the form of
legislative specs.  Education would need to be involved, especially
because this is designed to parallel key aspects of Title I and take into
account Agostini v. Felton.  On the other hand, because it is tax
legislation, presumably Treasury needs to be involved at some point, as
well.  I can imagine ED taking a first cut, and then passing over to
Treasury, but what do others think? And once that is settled, who should
take the lead in shopping this with Cardin?

Thanks.



ROUGH DRAFT -- July 8, 1997

An Amendment to Allow a Tax Credit for Costs and Fees Paid for
Supplementary Educational Services for Children
[possible substitute for Cardin]

  Credit would be for up to [$150 or 50% of the costs incurred, whichever
is less--Cardin amount] per year per child ages 6-18, enrolled as a full
time elementary or secondary school student


 Credit would be for costs and fees paid

 Services provided must be supplementary to the basic educational program,
and can include extra help/tutoring in core academic subjects, including
reading and math [that the student is studying in school] [as well as
enrichment in arts, music etc.]; the credit is not available for regular
tuition costs

 Allowable services may not include college entrance test preparation

 [Allowable services may not include sectarian instruction]

 Services must be provided outside the regular school day, which can
include before- or after-school, during summers, or on weekends

 Services must be provided through a local school district, consistent
with Title I

 Consistent with Title I and the Supieme CourtO,s ruling in Agostini vs.
Felton , services may be provided at a public school or at another site
(including private religious schools)

 Consistent with Title I, services may be provided directly by the local
school district, or under contract to the local school district

Note: Some districts currently provide after-school or summer services for
free; others have elected to charge for them.   In localities where the
services are provided for free, there is no need for the tax credit
because after-school services are already available.  In localities where
services are only available for a fee, the legislation would aid families
that want extra services for their children. In communities where
after-school tutoring is primarily provided in venues such as Boys and
Girls Clubs, the school district could agree to contract with such
organizations to provide the services. Where no services are currently
offered, the tax credit may encourage districts to begin offering such
services.

Because the services would be provided under the auspices of the local
school district, there would be no need for any sort of O&certification08
process as envisioned in the Cardin legislation.  Services could be
provided through private organizations under contract to school districts
to the same extent they can presently be provided under Title I.
