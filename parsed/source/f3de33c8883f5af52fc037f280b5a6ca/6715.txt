Subject:

Thanks to Melanne, Mrs. Clinton will participate in the launch of
AmeriCorps reauthorization Thursday morning on the Hill (either 10:30 or
11). In addition to the First Lady, a bi-partisan group of Senators and
Members will speak, as well as Harris Wofford, and former AmeriCorps and
senior corp participants. Phil is finalizing the legislation and letter to
the Hill. A draft press release is coming over for review.  I am told that
Potus may mention the launch in his school violence event on Thursday, as
well. Thanks all for your help and support. Steve
