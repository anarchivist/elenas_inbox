TEXT:
Right now no one is scheduled to travel to the Family Conference from DPC,
although I think that is just an oversight. Bruce is the staff contact
for the event and there are education announcements being made. Mike
Cohen cannot go.

Elena do you think you should go? Cathy, can you start to get her travel
ready in the event that she does? Let me know what I can do.
