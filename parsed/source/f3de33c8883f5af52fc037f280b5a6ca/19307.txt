TEXT:
Josh will be on vacation next week, will actually depart mid-afternoon
this Friday, April 3rd and will return to the office Monday, April 13th.
He will have a laptop with him and will check it periodically, but will
NOT have a skypager.  I'll know how to reach him in case of emergencies.

please call or email Josh if there are issues to discuss before he departs
for the week. We're hoping to keep his week away quiet.

many thanks.
