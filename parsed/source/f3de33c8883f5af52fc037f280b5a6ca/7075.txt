TEXT:
This is my draft for the weekly (part of HEA).              Should I add DPC, and/or
do you have any other suggestions?

Old Professors: The House bill includes a provision that would allow
colleges to offer financial incentives for tenured professors to retire
early, to make room for younger (and generally lower-paid) professors.
The EEOC -- and the AARP -- have opposed this provision as permitting
O&age-based, arbitrary distinctions in employee benefit plans which would
disadvantage older workers08 because it would allow the colleges to deny
the incentive to older professors. The colleges argue that the tenure
system is unique, and that this will allow them to diversify the faculty.
My staff is working with Education and the EEOC to determine whether there
is any reason to reconsider the AdministrationD,s position on this issue.
