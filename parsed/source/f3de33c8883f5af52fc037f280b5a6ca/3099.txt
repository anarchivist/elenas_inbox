TEXT:
Bruce -- as you suggested, I had a long talk with Richard Schwartz who
used to run NYC's workfare program and who is now a consultant for other
local governments and some companies.  Here are his views about what's
important to make welfare reform work in the real world:

        He thinks 20 hours of real work is enough -- that's what they did in New
York (20 hpw for single parent families and 26 for two parent families).
The remaining hours could be filled in w/job search and training.   He
says the value of workfare is it teaches people the "soft skills" like
showing up every day on time and that companies like to hire people with
an attendance track record.  20 hours a week is enough to accomplish this.

        He thinks its fair to count Medicaid, child care, housing if necessary,
although he doesn't oppose dropping them from the latest proposal.

        He says lots of local governments want to contract out workfare to
non-profits, have them operate and supervise workfare programs (Newark,
which he's now advising, is doing this).  He thinks non-profits operating
workfare programs should operate under the same rules as government
agencies.  More important, he says, is to ensure that any exemptions are
only for 'workfare' defined as a program having people do work which would
otherwise not get done.

        He thinks strong anti-displacement language is needed, but he worries
about opening up the possibility of lawsuits that could tie up welfare
reform programs in the courts (he didn't have another enforcement
mechanism to propose). He's more worried, by the way, about the
possibilities of displacement and wage depression through the use of
private sector wage subsidies than through workfare -- which is an
argument for applying whatever new anti-displacement rules get through
Congress to all of TANF, where more of this is likely to happen.

        He strongly dislikes the idea of time-limiting workfare -- i.e., saying
someone can be put in workfare for only 9 months.  He thinks that workfare
should be used to give someone a track record of recent job experience,
and that kicking them off of workfare will make employers less likely to
want to hire them.
