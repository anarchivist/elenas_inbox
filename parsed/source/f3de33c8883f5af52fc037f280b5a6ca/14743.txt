                              REMARKS ON HUMAN CLONING

                                  Tuesday, March 3, 1997

       In recent days, the world witnessed the successful cloning of a sheep by Scottish
researchers. It is a discovery that could yield enormous benefits -- enabling us to reproduce the
most productive strains of crops and livestock; holding out the promise of groundbreaking
medical treatments and cures; helping to unlock the greatest secrets of the genetic code.

        But like the splitting of the atom, this is a discovery that carnes burdens as well as
benefits. Today, science often moves faster than our ability to understand its implications.
That is why we have a responsibility to move slowly and cautiously -- to harness the powerful
forces of science and technology, so that we can reap the benefits, while avoiding the potential
dangers.

       This new breakthrough raises the troubling prospect that it might someday be possible to
clone human beings from our own genetic material. There is much about cloning that we still do
not know. But this much we do know: any discovery that touches upon human creation is not
simply a matter of scientific inquiry. It is a matter of morality, decency, and spirituality as well.

        My own deeply-held view is that the prospect of human cloning is morally repugnant. It
violates our most cherished concepts of faith and humanity. Each human life is unique -- born
of a miracle that reaches beyond laboratory science. I believe that we must respect this profound
gift, and resist the temptation to become our own creators.

        At the very least, we need a better understanding of the scope and implications of this
breakthrough. Last week, I asked our National Bioethics Advisory Commission, headed by
Princeton University President Harold Shapiro, to conduct a thorough review of the legal and
ethical issues raised by this new cloning technology, and to recommend possible actions to
prevent its abuse, reporting back to me in 90 days.

       In the meantime, I am taking steps to prevent the more imminent possibility of human
cloning. After reviewing the current restrictions on the use of federal funds for research
involving human embryos, we believe there are loopholes that could allow human cloning if the
technology were developed. Today, I am issuing a directive that bans the use of any federal
funds for human cloning. Effective immediately, no federal agency may support, fund, or
undertake such activity.

        Of course, a great deal of research and activity in this area is supported by private funds.
That is why I am urging the entire scientific community -- and every foundation, university, and
industry that supports work in this area -- to heed the federal government's example. I am
asking for a voluntary moratorium on all efforts to undertake human cloning, until our Bioethics
Advisory Commission and our entire nation have had a chance to understand and debate the
profound ethical implications.

        As we gain a fuller understanding of cloning, we must proceed not just with caution, but
with conscience as well. By insisting that not a single taxpayers' dollar supports human cloning
 -- and by urging a moratorium on all private efforts to pursue human cloning -- we can ensure
that as we move forward on this issue, we weigh the concerns of faith and family, and not just of
laboratory science alone.
