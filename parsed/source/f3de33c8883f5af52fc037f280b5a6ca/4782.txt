TEXT:
The AMA suggested an EO that would apply youth access restrictions to
federal facilities, including military bases and hospitals.   (p. 16 of
their review)

Jerry, could you take a look at what they said and see whether it's
something we could consider, or whether it requires legislation.  It would
be nice to give the military something constructive to do besides beg for
$.
