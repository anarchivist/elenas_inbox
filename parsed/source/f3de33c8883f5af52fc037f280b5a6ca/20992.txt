TEXT:
An update on child care in Senate Labor-HHS.  Mary says that they are
still planning to spend $180 million. They may choose not to earmark the
money for our programs (scholarships, standards, research), but instead
may just add it to the block grant.  She will keep us posted.

Subject:         Senate Labor-HHS and Child Care

Mary Bourdette reported today that Specter's staff told her that the
Senate Labor-HHS Appropriations subcommittee plans to fully fund our child
care request in appropriations (the discretionary request included $180
million of standards enforcement, research and evaluation, and
scholarships).  Since none of these new programs have authorizing
legislation, Mary is puzzled but elated, and HHS staff is trying to work
on appropriate language for this purpose, if we get that far.
