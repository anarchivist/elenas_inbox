TEXT:
Elena and Michael,

Katie and I would be happy to meet with the Utah education
representatives.  I'm not sure if they followed up on your advice, but
will check.

It may be best if you could forward a contact name and number, and I'll
give him/her a ring.

I'd note that even 15 minutes of involvement in this issue qualifies you
for a site visit this spring, your schedule permitting. April and May are
spectacular out there ....

Tom
