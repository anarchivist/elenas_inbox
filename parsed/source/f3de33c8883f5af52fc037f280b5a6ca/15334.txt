Question:   Doesn't the Medicare Trust Fund Report just confirm that President has continually
            demagogued Medicare and failed to address the real needs of the program?

Answer:     No. The Medicare Trust Fund Report confirms what the President has continually
            stated -- that Republicans and Democrats have to come together to enact Medicare
            reforms to extend the life of the Trust Fund. The President has been addressing
            this important issue since he came into office.

            His 1993 Economic Plan extended the life of the Trust Fund by three years. In
            1994, the reforms included in the Health Security Act would have strengthened
            the Trust Fund by five years. In 1995 and 1996, the President proposed a
            Medicare plan that would have extended the life of the Trust Fund for at least a
            decade. And this year the President's balanced budget guarantees the life of the
            Trust Fund for at least a decade.


Question:   Should Medicare beneficiaries worry that the Medicare Trust Fund is in imminent
            danger?

Answer:     This report should not be used irresponsibly. The upcoming Trust Fund report
            should not be used to recklessly frighten the 38 million Medicare beneficiaries and
            their families into thinking that their benefits are in imminent danger.      They
            simply are not.

            The need for responsible intervention to improve the Trust Fund is real. The President
            has a proposal that addresses this need in a responsible way, without imposing
            devastating provider cuts, increasing beneficiary costs, or enacting structural
            changes that devastate the program and the people it serves.

            We have time to act this year. Over $120 billion remains in the Trust Fund (as of
            March 1997). While incoming revenues are somewhat less than outgoing
            payments, the current balance in the Trust Fund means that there is no danger
            that claims will not be paid

            The President believes that it is time to put partisan differences aside and agree on
            Medicare reforms that will save the Trust Fund.

            nothing but preserve the status quo?

Answer:     That is absolutely not true. The President's budget takes important steps to
            modernize Medicare and bring it into the 21st century through a number of
            structural reforms including:

            ·     Establishing new private plans including Preferred Provider Organizations
                  and Provider Sponsored Organizations -- available to seniors and people with
                  disabilities.

            ·      Establishing market-oriented purchasing for Medicare including the new
                  prospective payment systems for home health care, nursing home care, and
                  outpatient hospital services, as well as competitive bidding authority and the
                  use of centers of excellence to improve quality and cut back on costs.

            ·     Adding new Medigap protections making it possible for beneficiaries to switch
                                                                                               ba

Question:   Does the President support creating a Medicare Commission?

Answer:     ·       The President has consistently said that we need a two step process to address
                    the financing needs of the Medicare program. First, he has called for
                    Republicans and Democrats to come together immediately to address the
                    short-term financing needs of.the Medicare Trust Fund. The President has
                    proposed a balanced budget plan to enact reforms that extend the life of the
                    Trust Fund well into the next decade. He also believes that we need to
                    develop a bipartisan process to examine and make recommendations on the
                    long-term needs of the Medicare program, and he looks forward to working
                    with both parties to develop the best process possible.


Question:   Democrats are saying that the Administration has gone far enough with
            Medicare savings. Are you concerned that your base Democrats will withdraw
            their support?

Answer:     The President has put forth a strong Medicare proposal that extends the life of the
            Trust Fund to 2007 while modernizing and strengthening the program. The
            President has always been and always will be opposed to excessive Medicare cuts.
            He is working with the Democratic Leadership to ensure that any Medicare proposal
            is based on strong policy rationale and does not excessively or unfairly burden
            Medicare beneficiaries or the providers who serve them. Democrats have always
            been responsible stewards of the Medicare Trust Fund, and the President is confident
            that there will be broad Democratic support for any necessary reforms to the
            program.

            plan?

Answer:     While everything will clearly be "on the table" in our budget discussions, we are
            extremely sensitive about making any changes to the important beneficiary
            improvements in our Medicare plan. Over three quarters of Medicare beneficiaries
            earn less than $25,000 per year. Improving benefits and fixing flaws in the program
            which place undue costs on this vulnerable population is a high priority for this
            Administration. The President's proposal to cover preventive services is recognized
            by Republicans and Democrats alike as a sound, cost-effective investment.




Question:   The President has induded a home health care transfer gimmick in the budget. How
            can he possibly defend it?
Answer:     Let's be clear: our $100 billion in Medicare savings does not include the home health
            care transfer. The $100 billion ($138 billion over six years) is the net reduction from
            the baseline that adds to deficit reduction.

            The policy you mentioned was in our budget last year, and it was in the House
            Republican budget in 1995 that every Republican in the House voted for.

            Our overall policy to home health visits in excess of 100 out of the HI trust fund
            is responsible and makes sense: it protects the Medicare Trust Fund till 2007
            while not putting harmful cuts on hospitals that would hurt quality or put
            excessive burdens on beneficiaries - while balancing the budget in 2002.

            Background
            Originally designed as a post-acute care benefit for beneficiaries who had been
            hospitalized, home health has increasingly become a chronic care benefit, not
            linked to hospitalization. Our proposal restores the original split ofhome health
                                                                 Automafed Records Management Syster
                                                                         Hex-Dump Conversion
            would be reimbursed by Part A and all other visits --including those not following
            hospitalization --would be reimbursed by Part B.


Question:   Follow: If home health transfer is not a gimmick then why don't you include it as
            part of the Part B premium?

Answer:     We have always been concerned about out-of-pocket costs for Medicare
            beneficiaries. Older Americans spend, on average, 20 percent of their income on
            health care and three-fourths have incomes lower than $25,000. We have to be
            careful that as we reform the Medicare program, we do not place undue burden on
            low-income seniors. .

Question:   Is the President now considering induding it in the premium or imposing copayments on
            home health services?

Answer:     The President is not ruling anything in or out at this point. The President looks
            forward to continuing our discussions with Congress. However, he will certainly
            not agree to any change that will place undue burden on Medicare beneficiaries.


Question:   Will you tell seniors -- at least high income seniors -- that we can't be giving them this
            huge subsidy while we are passing debt on to our children?

            The President is not philosophically against asking the highest-income seniors to pay
            a little more. In fact, in 1993, the Administration asked high-income seniors to pay
            more for their Part A benefits; so he is willing to make those tough choices. But the
            President has also found that we can present a strong and credible budget without
            having to start opening the door to premium increases on Medicare recipients.
