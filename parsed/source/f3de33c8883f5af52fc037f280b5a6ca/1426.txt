TEXT:
Tomorrow Judge Ross testifies on the child support incentive report.  Shaw
and Levin have asked HHS to provide a table showing the incentives
received state by state under the proposal versus current law. The table
shows that California, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Mississippi, New
Mexico, Tennesee will all lose money -- if they don't improve their child
support enforcement performance.

Tarplin is inclined to give them the table because--
        I) the request is bipartisan
        2) there's no good way to keep a lid on the info because it was
used by the state-HHS working group that prepared the report and one of
the state reps (former CA child support director Leslie Frye) is a witness
on the same panel.

He wants to make sure it's ok with us.

I think it's okay because our message should be: We want to be as tough as
possible on child support enforcement -- and that means holding states
accoutable for results.  Only states that perform well should get
incentives.  If California doesn't like these projections, they should
revamp their program to produce better results .... etc. What do you think?
