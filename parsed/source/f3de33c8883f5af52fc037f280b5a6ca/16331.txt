TEXT:
There are three forms which HHS is proposing to implement through an
emergency process. The forms will be published in the Federal Register,
the public will comment, and HHS can change them in response to comments.
Then, OMB must agree to let them go forward to be used on an interim basis
(until the final regulations are promulgated) .

Substantively, I don't think we have a problem with these.  Process-wise,
HHS totally dropped the ball on all of these, and with the result that I
didn't get a call from Monahan until late Wednesday and states weren't
told anything until today.  The forms are:

        1) Data Collection: the list of data states will have to provide
HHS.  It tracks the list in the statute (i.e, demographic information on
recipients, work participation status), and it should have been in place
before July 1 (states with TANF plans approved before January 1 are
supposed to start reporting data on July 1).  It will be shown to the
world via the Federal Register on Monday, then reviewed by OMB probably
for several weeks before it goes ahead.

        2) Two Financial Forms --- one for Child Care, one for TANF, which
asks states for certain financial information about how they are spending
their funds.
