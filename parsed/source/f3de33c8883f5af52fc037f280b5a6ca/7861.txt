                             STATEMENT BY THE PRESIDENT


Today, my Administration infonned the President of Ravenswood Hospital in Chicago, Illinois
that the hospital will lose its Medicare funding on June 19, 1998, unless the facility takes steps to
ensure that the events that led to the tragic death of Christopher Sercye will not be repeated.

xx days ago, 15 year old Christopher died of gunshot wounds just 35 feet from Ravenswood,
where friends had brought the young man for help. There is simply no excuse for this
unthinkable death. No one should be left untreated just footsteps from a hospital entrance. No
health care professional should tum the other way, and no supervisor should direct an employee
not to intervene in a medical emergency.

That is why the Health Care Financing Administration delivered a letter today advising
Ravenswood hospital that unless they provide credible evidence that its policies have been
restructured, it will lose all Medicare funding next month. This Administration stands ready to
take the same strong action against any facility that does not assist in a medical emergency.

I am also extremely pleased that the American Hospital Association has released new guidelines
that advise hospitals to change any policies that prevent taking appropriate actions in a medical
emergency. We cannot reverse last week's inexplicable tragedy, but we can and must take
action so that it does not happen again.
