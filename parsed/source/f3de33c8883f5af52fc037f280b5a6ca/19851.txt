TEXT:
The Senate just overwhelmingly approved the Ag research conference
agreement that restores $818 million in food stamps for legal immigrants
(along with crop insurance and other farm items). This is a large chunk
of our proposal to restore a total of $2.5 billion.  It had been stalled
for weeks by Gramm and Lott, but it came to the floor today.  Gramm's
motion to ding it was defeated, and it passed 92-8.   This should give us
some momentum in the House, where it will be less popular. We may do a
statement.
