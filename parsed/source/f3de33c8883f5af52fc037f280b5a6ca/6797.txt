  TEXT:
  Key points from the Deputies meeting yesterday:
  Big victories in Senate on most issues.   Slater was highly visible on the
  Hill last week.  Good interagency work.   Note: welfare to work
  transportation was prominently featured in Administration documents,
  including Slater's talking points (I'll copy for both of you).    Ended up
  with $150 M authorized.
  Need to handle funding issues delicately ... too much of a good thing (see
  McCurry Q&A--I'll copy for both of you)
  House mark up today at 3 p.m.  Expected to be short and clean--basically
  working off BESTEA developed last year.   Four key members had deal they
  had to agree on any amendments. This has been helpful to us.     Oberstar
  has carried our message, including welfare to work.    Manager's amendment
  is problematic: $9 billion in member projects and move to take highway
  trust fund off budget.
  Rest of Schedule: W&M on Thursday, Rules next Monday, floor vote next
  wednesday night.
  Big issues: .08, donor/donee states, funding levels, ethanol,    off budet.
  House Republican leadership want to include funding mechanism, including
  offsets, in the bill.
   Access to Jobs update: While currently only at $42 M, efforts are
. underway to raise level.  NOTE: based on my conversations with DOT staff,
  they are providing "technical assistance" to Pascrell (NJ) and
  Millender-MCDonald (CA) on Access to Jobs amendments; however, it's not
  clear whether Shuster will allow these amendments.    Interest in raising
  funding, may be amenable to removing 10 project cap.    DOT also suggesting
  amendment to allow the Access to Jobs funds to count as match for $3
  billion WtW funds.
