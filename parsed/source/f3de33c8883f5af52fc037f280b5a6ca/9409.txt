Subject:         REVISED (AGAIN) BANKRUPTCY MEMO

This time we tried to eliminate discussion of that about which we agree
and crystalize the disagreement between the parties.  I think this is
clearer and crisper. Thanks to Rob and Joe, I eliminated many extra words
and now hang over the 3 page limit I got from Staff Secretary by only a
paragraph.  Any help to eliminate a few more lines would be appreciated.

Treasury -- Note that on your last paragraph, re how shifting to chapter
13 helps child support and alimony payment, HHS asked us to qualify that
to be clear that it only helps IF we move the right people.  IF they fail
in chapter 13, then go back to 7, there are fewer assets and more, not
less, to pay the kids.

This draft is going to Gene tonight. Final comments due at 10:00 tomorrow
morning. We expect the final vote on passage tomorrow afternoon.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:          GENE SPERLING

RE:            BANKRUPTCY REFORM LEGISLATION

This memorandum seeks your guidance on whether we should take a very firm stance regarding
the upcoming bankruptcy conference, 'threatening a veto if many of our conditions are not met, or
whether we should be more willing to accept a bill meeting some of our goals and offering no
harm to child support and alimony but without key aspects of the administration proposal.

Background

In June, you approved an Administration bankruptcy reform proposal. Today, the Senate
passed, _ - _ , a bankruptcy bill that reflects almost all the major elements of our proposal.
While further improvements could be made, the Senate bill reflects a significant step toward
balanced bankruptcy reform, dealing with abuses by both debtors and creditors.

The House bill has some desirable features too, but overall is far more problematic. That bill,
which passed by a veto-proof majority over the Administration's strong opposition, uses a rigid
formula to exclude certain debtors from Chapter 7's full discharge of unsecured debt, creates new
nondischargeable debts that will compete with child support and alimony post-bankruptcy, and
addresses perceived abuses by debtors but not by creditors.

Administration Proposal

The key aspects of our proposal, incorporated into the Senate bill, are:

(1)    A Discretionary and More Targeted "Means Test" -- a discretionary approach to, and
       higher thresholds for, shifting borrowers from Chapter 7 to Chapter 13, instead of the
       House's rigid, arbitrary approach to determining whether a debtor can use Chapter 7;
(2)    Elimination of New, Nondischargeable Debts -- eliminate new provisions that could pit,
       post-bankruptcy, credit card debt against child support, alimony, educational loans, and
       taxes, except for debt incurred with an intent to defraud;
(3)    Balanced Reforms Affecting Creditors, as well as Debtors -- include balanced
       provisions that ask both debtors and creditors to behave more responsibly, including:
       (a)     adequate protection against coercive reaffirmations; and

                                                              Automated Records Management System
                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion
                   need to manage their budgets.

Prospects for Conference

Work on compromising the two bills will begin immediately. The most likely outcome is a bill
between the House and Senate approaches, with key Administration provisions watered down or
omitted. Senator Grassley will fight hard to preserve the Senate approach, but Chairman Hatch
expects the Senate approach to be compromised in conference. House Republicans have said that
they will not compromise on key issues with the Senate.

On the other hand, the legislative calendar works in our favor. A more extreme approach in
conference risks trouble on the Senate floor and a direct or pocket veto from you. Some
Democratic Senators supported the Senate bill because of its balance and moderation. In the
face of your strong opposition, the Senate [could, but is not certain to,] override your veto of a
House-like final bill. [NEED TO SEE FINAL VOTE ON PASSAGE BEFORE DECIDE ON
VIEW HERE.]

At best, conference will produce the minimum the RepubliGans think they need to give in order
to get your signature. At worst, the conference will stick largely with the House approach, as
Republicans may not believe you would veto a bill with such strong bipartisan support or may
believe a veto could be overridden. Legislative Affairs recommends a clear message about what
you would sign and what you would veto, if we hope to have any influence over the conference.

Staff have agreed on a letter to conferees laying out our position, but the language disguises a
core disagreement on the bottom line. A clearer message could be sent with your guidance.

OPTION 1:          INSIST ON INCLUSION OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S MODERATING
                   AND BALANCED PROPOSALS, AS IN THE SENATE BILL.

Proponents: NEC, OLA, CoS (Echaveste), OVP, OMB, WH Counsel, DPC, OFL, OPL
            (Women's Office), Commerce, OTS, USDA and DoLI

The majority of your advisors will recommend that you veto a bill that deviates substantially
from the Senate bill-- i.e., that: (I) retains the arbitrary House "means test" instead of the more
flexible Senate approach; (2) creates categories of non dischargeable debt that compete with child
support, alimony, educational loans, or taxes; or (3) fails to include some balance in the form of
enhanced disclosures and consumer protections.




          1 Education prefers this approach, but would not recommend a veto unless an issue within their jurisdiction is
implicated -- specifically, unless new nondischargeable debts are created that compete with educational loans.


                                                                                   Automated Records Management System
                                                              2
                                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion
adequately consider the unique circumstances of individual debtors. Any test that excludes from
Chapter 7 those able to repay significantly changes our bankruptcy system. We should be
cautious in that change, lest we deny access to bankruptcy to those who need it most. We have
offered an alternative between the House and Senate view that we could accept.

We all know that you will not accept any provisions that create new nondischargeable debts to
compete with child support and alimony. But these advisors feel that, even if child support and
alimony are untouched, no sufficient case has been made that certain credit card debt should be
given the same protection that we give to educational loans or taxes, for example.

Finally, these advisors believe you must insist on balance -- curbing abuse by creditors as well as
debtors. We are seeing more competition and dramatic changes in how creditors grant credit.
While beneficial for some, these changes increase the number of consumers who can get in over
their heads and dictate that we improve disclosures and enhance protections against coercion,
especially if we are going to foreclose access to a "fresh start" for some who make a mistake.

OPTION 2:      ACCEPT, IF NECESSARY, LESS IDEAL COMPROMISE AS AN
               IMPROVEMENT OVER THE STATUS QUO.

Proponents: Treasury and CEA.

Treasury and CEA believe that bankruptcy reform short of some Administration goals -- the
likely outcome -- would still markedly improve the current system. While they would not
support signing the House bill in current form, they do believe you should sign a bill with any
reasonable compromise between the House and Senate approaches, ifit meets our goals for the
protection of child support and alimony payments.

Treasury and CEA emphasize that the House means-test formula would affect only 10% of filers,
all with above-median income. Currently, these debtors escape their obligations, even though
many likely can repay at least part of what they owe. Reducing their debt charge-offs would
lower the cost of credit for all consumers -- a particular benefit for lower- and middle-income
Americans who depend on consumer credit for significant household purchases.

Finally, Treasury and CEA argue that any compromise bill will likely improve payment of child
support and alimony (provided that it creates no new post-bankruptcy obligations competing with
these payments). Under the bill, more debtors will enter Chapter 13 court-supervised
repayment plans, where child support and alimony receive first priority, and court supervision
and other authorities make payment ofthese obligations more likely, provided that the means test
used shifts the right people to Chapter 13.




                                                                    Automated Records Management System

While we seek no final judgement now regarding the bill to be produced by the conference, your
response to this memorandum will allow staff to negotiate with a clear sense of your objectives.
