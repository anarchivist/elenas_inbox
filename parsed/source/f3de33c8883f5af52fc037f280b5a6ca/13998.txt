Sorry - I guess I did not tell you I would be away.  Let's hook up
on Tuesday morning.  You have the right document alothough HHS
tells me they are changing it and won't have a draft for us till
mid-week.   They have to have it completed by the 9th when the
meeting with the states takes place so we are at crunch time.

Is the hhs guidance we were supposed to look at the one with the quote on the
cover page? when are we supposed to provide comments? I've looked at it
(assuming I'm looking at the right thing), and I'd love to get together with you
to talk a few things over.
