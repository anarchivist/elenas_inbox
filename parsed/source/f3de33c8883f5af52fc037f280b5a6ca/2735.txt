Would be nice to have a better handle on their process, especially since
Geri Palast seems to have one.

Ken's in a meeting, but I know he is working on this.

I gather that Jeri's report on yesterday's meeting (I wasn't there) echoes
what others heard. There is a general. position in OMB that at minimum,
among the Agreement bills, bills coming up for mark up in W&M and Finance
will be commented on by the Director, if we know with some certainty
what's to be in them. We expect to have that knowledge, at least in terms
of the Chairman's bill, by tomorrow, for the welfare to work and the
non-Agreement welfare stuff (FLSA, immigrants, etc), so the assumption is
that this fact situation fits the guidance.

Ken is working on what the process should be, with Lew.  I haven't heard
details yet. At yesterday's meeting, agencies were asked to prepare
material for such letters and send it to OMB, without being asked for it.
My assumption is that OMB will do first drafts and do the WH circulation.

Process certainty is running a tad behind the pace of events.
