TEXT:
A little while ago I faxed you a letter to the POTUS from the President of
the Arizona State Board of Education stating that the board does not
support the proposed national test and will not participate in it.   I'm
not sure if we had heard·that this was imminent, but it's not a big
surprise that we would get this kind of response from Arizona, whose state
superintendent of public instruction is one of those who quit the Chief
State School officers to start their own conservative rump group.
The letter implies that the national tests embody low standards, that they
take the "whole language" side in the reading debate ("a continuation of
the support from "It Takes a Village," it says), and lack of guranteed
financial support after the first year/costs involved in participating.

Should we do something in the weekly on this, but note that the Education
Department is hosting a meeting of representatives of chiefs and governors
offices later this month -- or should we hold off?

Thanks.
