 Timber Swap, 0450
 Agreement Near on Swap to Save Old Trees

      ROSEBURG, Ore. (AP)   Agreement is near on a timber swap that
  would save from logging centuries-old federal timber that has been


  the focus of demonstrations by environmentalists, the U.S. Forest
  Service says.
      Roseburg Forest Products could sign the agreement with the
  Forest Service as early as today, Umpqua spokeswoman Cheryl
  Walters. The company would trade the controversial First timber
  sale for 4 million board feet of other trees from partially logged
  stands.
       "An agreement is so darn close,"   Walters said. "RFP has
  agreed in concept and we don't see any reason why they would back
  out. I I
       Speaking to the Roseburg Area Chamber of Commerce, Umpqua
  National Forest Supervisor Don Otsby said Thursday the deal could
  be the first of a series of swaps to stop logging of '
  environmentally sensitive areas under the so-called salvage rider.
      Roseburg Forest Products began logging last month on the First
  timber sale after negotiations for the trade broke down. The sale
  is one of a number that were offered in the midst of the battle
  over the northern spotted owl and later withdrawn over
  environmental concerns.
      After finding at least one tree that appeared to be 1,000 years
  old, environmentalists tried to stop the logging. At one point
  three people were arrested when they chained themselves to junked
  cars to block a logging road.
       "We expect the cutting will stop immediately now that
  substitute volume has been explicitly authorized by the Department
  of Agriculture, identified by the Forest Service and offered to
  Scott Timber,"   said Ken Carloni, president of the environmental
  group Umpqua Watersheds Inc. Scott Timber is the logging subsidiary
  of Roseburg Forest Products.
       "Allyn Ford (executive vice president of Roseburg Forest
  Products) indicated to me that he would stop cutting as soon as the
  Forest Service offered suitable substitute volume and I am
  confident he will abide by his word."
      Roseburg Forest Products didn't immediately return a telephone
  call for comment.
      The sale was withdrawn by the Forest Service in 1990 after
  deciding that logging the old-growth timber would harm spotted
  owls, a threatened species, as well as cutthroat trout in the
  Umpqua River system.
      The sale was released to Roseburg Forest Products recently under
  the so-called salvage rider. The rider suspends enforcement of
  environmental laws to speed logging that was held up for years in
  the spotted owl fight.
