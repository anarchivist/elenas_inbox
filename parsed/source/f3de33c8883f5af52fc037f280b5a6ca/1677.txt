TEXT:
 Q    Does the White House look forward to privatizing
food stamps and Medicaid programs --

             MR. MCCURRY:  Yes, my understanding is we have not made
any final decisions on that. That's a matter that's under review.
It affects the waiver requests that the state of Texas has.  And
Secretary Shalala still has it under review.

Brilliant!
