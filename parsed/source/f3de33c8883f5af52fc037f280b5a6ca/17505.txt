 TEXT:
 Attached is the weekly.  Elena, you had asked about an item responding to
 the President's comments on the NYTimes article on the Commerce report on
 the shortage of skilled workers in the high-tech industry ..

 I've had a brief conversation with Tom Kalil about that, and we had
 arranged to take up the issue at a meeting of an interagency group on
 distance learning (which basically had the right players in it).
 Unfortunately, I couldn't stay for the meeting, and we have not had a
 chance to talk about how to proceed since.  So I have not been able to
 include anything in this.==================== ATTACHMENT   1 ====================

1996 NAEP Science Results. This week the National Assessment Governing Board (NAGB)
released a performance report on the 1996 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP)
in science, showing that less than 30% of U.S. students reach proficient levels of scientific
knowledge and understanding, with 29% reaching the proficient level at grades 4. and 8, and 21 %
demonstrating proficiency at grade 12. The basic level -- representing partial mastery of
fundamental knowledge and skills -- was reached by 67% of students in grade 4, 61 % in grade 8,
and 57% in grade 12. The 1996 science NAEP was developed from a new content framework,
so results cannot be directly compared to previous assessments. Numerical scores for the 1996
test had previously been released, but this week's report was based on levels for basic, proficient,
and advanced performance approved by NAGB in August.

Vouchers/CoverdeU. This week the House passed the Gingrich!Anney version of Sen.
Coverdell's K-12 education savings accounts legislation. Vote on final passage was 230-198,
with 8 Republicans voting against the bill and 15 Democrats voting for it. A Rangel substitute,
which would have expanded a school construction bond provision enacted in the tax reform bill,
was defeated 224-199. On Friday the the Republicans canceled a mark-up oflegislation that
would have allowed ESEA Title VI funds to be used to pay for private school tuition. Evidently
they were unable to muster sufficient Republican support to get the bill out of committee.
However, Republicans will probably attempt to attach voucher language to the Riggs-Roemer
charter schools bill on the House floor next week.

National Tests: Friday afternoon the AP ran a story indicating that the Republicans had decided
to send the Labor HHS appropriations bill to you, including Goodling's prohibition on
developing or implementing national tests. Others in the media are picking up this story, though
the only source for the story appears to be unidentified staff to Goodling or Ashcroft. Goodling
has in fact drafted a new provision that would (1) continue to prohibit the development or
implementation of national tests; (2) require the Education Department to cancel the current
contract for test development; and (3) direct the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a
study, with NGA and NCSL, of the feasibility of comparing the results from different, existing
standardized tests, as an alternative to the national tests. The Republicans have forwarded
Goodling's proposal to the Democrats, though it is not yet clear if this is intended as the first step
in negotiations, or if it reflects a decision to force a veto before any final resolution that
acceptable to you. We are working closely with Obey to determine how best to respond. In
addition, we have indicated to the press that this "compromise" is unacceptable to you, and that
this provision would cause you to veto the bill--as you stated clearly in your remarks to the
National Board for Professional Teaching Standards.
