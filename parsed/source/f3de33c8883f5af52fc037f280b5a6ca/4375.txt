TEXT:
I've given a list of today's attendees to Laura.

Background: President Clinton signed the law creating the Commission in
August 1996. The the Commission has gotten off to a slow start-- first,
with delays in appointments; and second, in getting an executive director.
The Chairperson is Kay James, a professor at Pat Robertson University who
is viewed as anti-gambling. The Commission has held two rounds of
hearings this year: one in June, and one in August. The Commission has
until July 1999 to submit a report to Congress.

I spoke with Bill Marshall last night about the meeting, and here are some
of the things we thought might be discussed for today's meeting:

I.    Process
          A. Determine goal of process

                     1.    Set overarching Administration policy on gambling
issue?

                2. Selective approach-- Administration selectively
engages on specific                                            issues?

           B.    Other process issues

                     1.    How will we develop Administration's positions?

                     2.    How do we want to impact and interact with the
Commission?

II.   Substantive issues

           A.    Which issues have we actively commented on/taken positions?

                     1.    Internet gambling

                     2.    Indian gaming

                     3.    Others?

           B.    Are there other issues we may actively want to comment on?

           C.    Which issues can we anticipate will be difficult?
