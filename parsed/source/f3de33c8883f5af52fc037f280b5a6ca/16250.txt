Q:   Can you say any more about the tobacco settlement now that your staff have had
     more time to review it?

A.     I have reached a final conclusion on only one part of the settlement: the requirement that
      the FDA find that there will not be a black market before mandating any product changes.
        That is an unreasonable requirement, which will too greatly limit the FDA's ability to
      make tobacco products safer or less addictive. My staff is still reviewing the settlement
      proposal, and I have not reached any further conclusions. As I've said before, the
     . settlement proposal provides an historic chance to further protect our children and our
       country from the dangers of tobacco. We must and will respond to it in a way that best
       advances the public health.

Q.   Some of your staff are saying that the penalties tobacco companies must pay if they
     fail to meet the targets for reducing children's smoking are too soft -- that those
     penalties must be increased or companies will still profit from hooking kids.

A.   I know that my staff are looking into this. We have to ask tough questions. We have to
     make sure the settlement holds industry accountable for reducing the number of children
     who start smoking. I will be looking carefully at this question.

Q.   Your advisors are meeting today with industry representatives. What do they
     expect to get out of this meeting?

A.   Secretary Shalala and Bruce Reed will ask the industry a lot of tough questions. They
     will let them know we will not just rubber stamp this agreement, and they will make it
     clear that the bottom line for my Administration is ensuring that any agreement is good
     for the public health, and particularly the health of our children.
