TEXT:
President Atkinson of the University of California will be at his office
in Oakland, California next week while we are there. He invited us to
meet with him to discuss the letter regarding minority enrollment in
higher education that he sent to the President.

It might be a good idea for us to talk this weekend about our schedule in
California, and whether a meeting with the President of the UC works.  I
will follow up with him after we talk.  I said I'd get back to him on
Monday.

Thanks.
