TEXT:
fyi.   Slater is getting a report from FAA on November 30th to identify
actions on airline safety that should be taken.
  Its actually a review of the implementation of the FAA's 9/96 Safety
review-- an assesment of what has been done and needs to be.   If the
report is big enough and suggests new steps, it might make a decent
event.
