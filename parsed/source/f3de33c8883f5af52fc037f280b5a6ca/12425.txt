 TEXT:
 As you recall Sen McConnell and others submitted written questions to the
 AG on the tobacco lawsuit.  Since the AG is testifying next Wednesday,
 we'd like to get these to the Hill tomorrow. There's one tricky one I'd
 like your help with.  Can you think of a better way to answer this
 question?

 Current version of Q&A

 Q: The Administration directly connects its proposed 55-cent increase in
 the cigarette excise tax to health care expenditures in various Federal
 programs.  See FY 2000 Budget of the United States Government, Table S-8
 (listing Veterans, Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, Department
 of Defense, and Indian Health Service).  Doesn" t this suggest that the
 amount of previously collected Federal tobacco excise tax revenues should
 offset any claims for past Federal health care expenditures?

 A: No.  The Department believes that liability for Federal tobacco-related
 health care costs properly may be assessed against the parties responsible
 for these costs.  The Department does not agree that excise taxes paid by
 smokers relieve or reduce the accountability of the tobacco companies for
 these costs.

 Background

 Table S-8 of our budget simply lists 1) the year-by-year revenue raised by
 the 55 cent excise and the accelerated 15 cent tax, 2) the year by year
 tobacco related health costs in Veterans, Federal Employees Health
 Benefits Program, Department of Defense, and Indian Health Service, and 3)
 the amount assumed from recoupment.

 The text of our budget (p. 88), however, says in the section disucssing
 the price increase: "The funds that result from this policy will offset
 tobaco-related Federal health care costs.  Each year, the ,Federal
 Government spends billions of dollars treated tobacco-related diseases for
 our Armed Forces, veterans, and Federal employees. It is fitting that the
 tobacco industry reimburse U.S. taxpayers for these costs, just as it has
 already agreed to do for the States."

 In the later section mentioning the lawsuit, the budget says "In addition


to these Medicaid costs, tobacco-related health problems have cost
Medicare and other Federal programs billions of dollars each year.  To
recover these losses, the Department of Justice intends to bring suit
against the tobacco industry, and the budget contains $20 million to pay
for necessary legal costs. The Administration will propose that
recoveries will be used to enhance the security of Medicare for future
generations."
