     TEXT:
     This is an update on a NACARA meeting I attended today chaired by Janet
     Murgia and attended by NSC, Justice and State staff.  (Sorry I missed the
     police brutality meeting but it conflicted with this meeting but I got a
     report of the meeting) .

     We discussed the options presented by Scott Busby.   The options were
     developed assuming that the DOJ regulations would provide the presumption
     of "extreme hardship"  for NACARA groups (ie Salvadoran and Guatamalans) .
     DOJ (James Costello) informed us that the regulations are not yet
     completed but he expects they will be soon.

     The option that had consensus at least for the President's upcoming
     visit to Central America is for the President to announce the
     regulation.   If the regulation is not ready, we will need to draft some
     language that communicates in the strongest terms possible that we are
     headed in the direction of providing presumption of extreme hardship.
     With regard to legislation to help other Central Americans, the President
     would indicate that the Administration will work with Congress to address
     this issue. I will bring you a copy of the list of options that Scott
     drafted. The consensus option is a modified option 1.

     While there are some downsides with this approach (doesn't resolve the
     parity issue, other Central Americans and Eastern Europeans are not left
     out),  I think that this option provides the right balance - targets and
     helps the Salvadorans and Guatamalans while at the same time not
     undermining our enforcement message by creating a magnet - if immigrants
     come here as undocumented immigrants that they will eventually be allowed
     to legalize.

     The immediate next steps are for Scott to draft talking points that will
     be circulated for clearance and James will continue to press on the
     regulations.     After the Central America trip, Janet, I and others will
     meet wi th groups and folks on the Hill to discuss next steps on
     legislation.

     Based on discussions with the Hill, immigrant groups and others, this
     option would be okay for now but the announcement of the regulations is
     key.  The Hill and some groups have another issue that may want to throw
     into the legislative mix dealing with Section 377 that requires a
     legislative fix (changing the registry date)  and it is unclear if they
     will tie this fix to the NACARA legislation.


     please let me know if you have any questions.

     Thanks.
