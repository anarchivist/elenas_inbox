TEXT:
I am certain what we want to do about this matter. Really have had anyone
dedicated to work on homelessness issues since Rasco left. Mary Smith
might be one possibility.  But the question ,is do we have a strong
interest in homelessness? Please advise.

Attached is a note from, Katherine on the current status of the Interagency
Council on the Homeless.    I concur with her judgment that the ICH is a
valuable coordinating body that has been underutilized, especially for the
past two years, probably weakening the Administration's response to
homelessness.

We have now learned that the NPR and Tipper Gore's staffs are considering
a project aimed at reducing or preventing homelessness.  They are
preparing to write to the VP about it. One way to ensure that any
NPR-sponsored project would be adequately coordinated would be through a
reactivated ICH.  Incidentally, Tipper Gore is a member of the ICH.


would you want to remind Bruce Reed or Paul weinstein that the ICH is
formally a DPC working group and ask whether they have any interest in
making it a more effective forum?

Subject:         Interagency Council on the Homeless

As we've discussed, the Interagency Council on the Homeless is no longer
the effective coordinating mechanism for homeless policy that it was in
previous years, including the first years of this Administration.
Although the ICH is presently coordinating the analysis of results from
the National Survey of Homeless Providers and Clients, it has not
undertaken any new substantive projects in almost two years.   It'is
hampered by the lack of a full-time director. And, despite its formal
status as a working group of the Domestic Policy Council, it has received
no leadership or attention from DPC staff.

In FY 1994, the Congress chose not to fund the staff and operations of the
ICH.  In response, and with OMB's (Chris Edley's) encouragement, Carol
Rasco, as Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, reestablished
the ICH as a working group of the DPC, while HUD absorbed the operating
costs and administrative coordination functions of the Council. However,
the Executive Director of the ICH moved to a new position in October 1995
and an acting Executive Director has been in place since that time.  The D
PC has not had a staff person assigned to the ICH since Carol Rasco left.

The ICH did sponsor a February 3rd advocacy roundtable meeting at HHS,
where advocacy groups identified several possible projects (see below)
that could be coordinated by the Council. However, without a full-time
Director and support by the DPC, it remains difficult for the ICH to move
forward on any of these.  The roundtable brought together approximately 90
persons from advocacy groups and various Federal agencies.   Five broad
issue areas were discussed (Emergency Shelter, Employment/Education,
Housing, Health/Treatment, and Rural), with each presenter offering up
trends and recommendations.  Important points were made about what is
missing at the Federal level. Some noted the lack of substantive projects
being accomplished by the Interagency Council on the Homeless. Specific
projects proposed included:   (1) developing a list of standardized
questions that all providers could ask their clients to get better
stats/information, and (2) developing government-wide baseline performance
measures for homeless programs.
