 Here's the story:

 1.   Coverage:     we added a couple little things; it is done.

 2. Medicare: I just this second got the cost estimate.    It will take me
 some time to incorporate them into the memo.  I also have to add Elena's
 memo.  I will do this in the morning.  The good news is that the costs of
 the 62 to 65 are low.

 3. NIH: No OMB comments yet; just got a slew of HHS comments.          Again,
 revised version over to you by noon.

 Thanks for your patience.======"============== ATTACHMENT         1 ====================

MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:                      BRUCE REED
                           GENE SPERLING
                           CHRIS JENNINGS

SUBJECT:                   Health Insurance Coverage Initiatives

        Throughout your Administration, you have worked to enact legislation to expand access
to affordable health insurance. The Balanced Budget Act included an unprecedented $24 billion
investment for state-based children's health insurance programs. This historic initiative will
clearly reduce the number of uninsured. However, there are other deserving populations whom
we could target in our step-by-step reforms. These include the pre-65 year olds (referenced in
the Medicare memo), workers between jobs, and workers in small businesses. In addition, we
are working on possible proposals to expand Medicaid coverage to people with AIDS and
disabilities through pilot programs. The policy development of these proposals is still
underway, so we have not included them here.

        Taken together, these initiatives total around $10 billion over 5 years. This amount is
less than half of the health investments enacted as part of the Balanced Budget Act and less than
4 percent of the premium assistance proposed in the Health Security Act. Having said this, none
of your advisors believe the Medicare and Medicaid savings left after last year's deficit reduction
effort are sufficient to fund these initiatives. There may be $0.5 to 1 billion over 5 years in
Medicaid savings, but those savings will be difficult to achieve and there may be other claims on
them (e.g., child care, benefits to immigrants). Another possible source of funds is the tobacco
settlement, given the natural link between tobacco and health care.

         Your advisors uniformly agree that we need to take all actions possible to achieve if not
exceed your goal of increasing insurance coverage for 5 million children. A series of proposals
are described in this memo to help accomplish that goal. There is less agreement on whether we
should address a new group of uninsured people in this budget. The Department of Labor
strongly supports the workers-between-jobs demonstration; of all health initiatives in the budget,
it is their highest priority. OMB also supports that demonstration if sufficient funds are
available. HHS believes that this proposal has merit, but is skeptical that it will attract any more
support than it has in the past three years.




                                                 1
A.      CHILDREN'S HEALTH OUTREACH                                         Hex-Dump Conversion

        The Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) provides funds for coverage of
millions of working families' uninsured children, a population that previously had trouble
affording coverage. It also builds upon the Medicaid program, which covers nearly 20 million
children. But important work remains to be done. In particular, ·we need to work with states to
enroll the millions of uninsured children in these programs.

        Medicaid eligible children are especially at risk of remaining uninsured. Over three
million uninsured children are eligible for Medicaid. Educating families about their options and
enrolling them in Medicaid has always been a problem, but it has recently become even more
challenging. The number of children covered by Medicaid leveled off in 1995 and, according to
the Census, dropped by 6 percent in 1996. While some of this decline may be due to the lower
number of children in poverty, another part may result from families' misunderstanding of their
children's continued eligibility for Medicaid in the wake of welfare reform.            .

Options to Increase Outreach for Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program

       To address the need for children's health outreach, we propose a series of policy options.
Together, these initiatives could cost $1 to 2 billion over five years (or more depending on policy
choices about the enhanced match). Preliminary discussions with NGA and some children's
advocates suggest they strongly support these efforts. In addition, the Administration is
developing partnerships to encourage a complementary range of private outreach activities.

        Enhanced match for outreach. One option for improving state outreach is to provide
an enhanced match to enroll children who are eligible for but not previously enrolled in
Medicaid. At the end of each year, if a state can document that it has increased its enrollment
over its baseline, it would receive an increased matching amount per newly covered child
(possibly through administrative payments). This policy rewards states only if they succeed in
outreach, rather than matching activities that mayor may not work. Depending on the amount
of the incentive and the administrative design, this option could cost to $0.5 to 1 billion over five
years.

        Moving outreach to schools and child care sites. We could build upon the
"presumptive eligibility" provision in the Balanced Budget Act to make it easier to enroll
children in Medicaid and CHIP. The BBA option allows limited sites (~., hospitals) to give
low-income children temporary Medicaid coverage on the spot while they are formally enrolled
in CHIP or Medicaid. This proposal would broaden these sites to include schools, appropriate
child care sites, and Head Start sites, at the state's option. HCFA actuaries preliminarily
estimate that this proposal would cost $400 million over 5 years. Also, under the BBA, states
that use presumptive eligibility must pay for its costs out of the CHIP allotment, reducing the
amount available for other coverage. States have advised us that this requirement discourages
them from taking advantage ofthe presumptive eligibility provision. HCF A actuaries

                                                                          Hex-Dump Conversion

preliminarily estimate that dropping this requirement would cost $25 million over 5 years.
        Accessing 90 percent matching funds for outreach. A third way to increase funding
for children's health outreach is to increase states' flexibility in using a special Medicaid fund set
aside in T ANF for outreach for children losing welfare. This $500 million fund is currently
allocated to states with a 90 percent matching rate for outreach activities to certain children. We
could expand its use to all children, not just welfare children. HCFA actuaries preliminarily
estimate that this policy would cost $100 million over 5 years. NGA supports this change.

        Simplifying enrollment. A simple, accessible enrollment process could encourage
more families to enroll their children in Medicaid or CHIP. To help create such a process, we
propose several actions, all of which are inexpensive. First, we could streamline the application
process by simplifying Medicaid eligibility and by encouraging the use of simple, mail-in
applications. HCFA has already developed a model single application form for both Medicaid
and CHIP. We could condition some of the financial incentives described above on using a
single or simple application. Second, we are reviewing the feasibility and cost of a nationwide
1-800 number that will link families with their state or local offices. Such a number could be
placed in public service announcements, on the bottom of school lunch program applications,
and on children's goods like diaper packages.

Discussion

        There is unanimous support across agencies for focusing on children's health outreach.
HHS, Treasury and CEA believe that such outreach should be the Administration's first priority.
NECIDPC and OMB believe that aggressive outreach will be needed to meet or exceed the
Administration's goal of covering 5 million uninsured children. Although OMB is supportive, it
points out that because some children may be impossible to reach and some states may not use
these options, we are unlikely to enroll all 3 million children. NEC, also supportive, raises the
concem that spending on an outreach initiative may be a communications challenge so soon after
the enactment of the $24 billion base children's health program. However, policy experts,
Governors, and children's advocates alike will endorse this initiative.

         One great challenge is the difficulty of finding savings from Medicaid to offset the costs
of this initiative. With this in mind, your advisors are considering the tobacco settlement as a
financing source. Specifically, we are exploring the advisability of allowing states to retain the
Federal share of the tobacco funds !fthey dedicate those funds to high-priority Administration
initiatives like child care, education, and health care. Govemor Chiles would support such an
approach if we dedicate the funds to children's health care, not just outreach.

B.     WORKERS BETWEEN JOBS DEMONSTRATION

        Families who lose health insurance while they are between jobs are a small but important
group of uninsured Americans. These people pay for health insurance for most of their lives,
but go through brief periods without coverage when they are temporarily unemployed. If they·
experience a catastrophic illness during this transition, the benefit of their years' worth of
premium payments is lost. In addition, they could lose protection under the provisions of the
Kassebaum-Kennedy legislation once they regain coverage. Coverage at that point could be
subject to a new pre-existing condition exclusion period.

Limited Demonstration

        This policy option is a modification of the program that we have carried in our last two
budgets. It would award grants to several states to provide temporary premium assistance to
eligible low-income families. States would use this money to partially subsidize families'
premium payments for up to 6 months. To test how best to address this population's needs, we
would select states using a range of approaches like a COBRA-based subsidy, Medicaid, or
covering the parents of children covered by CHIP.

        Since it is a grant program, we could make this program as large or small as we want.
To give a sense of the options, last year's $10 billion proposal over four years covered about 3.3
million people with incomes below 240 percent of poverty. If we assume the .same set of policy
parameters, a demonstration of$1 billion over 5 years would cover about 230,000 people; a
demonstration of$2.5 billio~ would cover about 600,000; and a demonstration of about $3.5
billion would cover about 800,000 people. OMB has suggested that we could limit the costs by
reducing the eligibility for assistance to people below poverty. However, NECIDPC advisors
oppose such a limitation because it shifts the target away from the middle-class families we
originally intended to help.

Discussion

         On policy grounds, all ofthe agencies support this policy. It has been in our last two
budgets because of its merits. This policy remains Labor's first priority because it targets a
particularly vulnerable group and addresses the worker insecurity issues that played such a large
role in the debate over Fast Track. OMB and CEA would support this initiative ifthere are
sufficient funds. HHS believes that this policy is no more viable this year than it has been in the
past; HHS would also object to using Medicare and Medicaid savings to fund this proposal.
DPCINEC are concerned about dropping this policy altogether and support a demonstration that
is large enough to be viewed as improving coverage. If resources are limited, however, we
would prefer the children's outreach initiative to this proposal.

C.     VOLUNTARY PURCHASING COOPERATIVES

        Workers in small firms are most likely to be uninsured. Over a quarter of workers in
firms with fewer than 10 employees lack health insurance - almost twice the nationwide
average. While 88 percent of workers in firms with 250 or more workers are offered health
insurance, only 41 percent of workers in firms with less than 10 workers are offered coverage.
This disparity reflects the poor functioning of the small group health insurance market. Studies
have shown that administrative costs are higher and that small businesses pay more for the same
benefits as larger firms.

Grants to States

        Given the disadvantages faced by small firms, the question is: are there policies that can
make insurance more affordable for small businesses and their employees? In the last two
budgets, we have included a policy to provide seed money for states to establish voluntary
purchasing cooperatives. These cooperatives would allow small employers to pool their
purchasing power to try to negotiate better rates for their employees. This year, we propose both
the original policy and a variation: a competitive grant approach so that a more limited number of
states could receive a smaller, but more targeted, pool of funds. The total costs would be $50 to
$100 million over 5 years.

Discussion

        All agencies remain supportive of this policy and believe it should be included in this
year's budget. In the past, we have failed to enact this proposal because Congressman Fawell
has pushed an alternative approach more attractive to small businesses. Fawell's proposal
would help small businesses to self-insure and in so doing escape all state regulation.
Governors and consumer groups have consistently opposed the Fawell approach, fearing that it
would leave the small group market with only the most risky and expensive groups, as low-risk
groups move into the self-insured, non-regulated market. Our recent conversations with Fawell
suggest that he may be open to compromise this year in a way that he has not been in the past.
