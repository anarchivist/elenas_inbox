TEXT:
Rather than hold an interagency meeting this week, we thought it would be
helpful to send out a memo tomorrow to the interagency group reminding
them that we are serious about the March 24 date for final responses to
the EO, and we need immediately a preview of their list of existing and
new initiatives they would like to highlight or announce before, during,
or after the conference, if they have not already given it to us in
response to previous requests.

We could also make clear that final decisions are being made in the next
few days on invitations so they need to immediately send anyone they think
needs to be invited.

HHS has not sent us their list of proposals and people, promised they
would today, but did not.

Would you like me to draft such a memo for you?   Could your intern fax it
out and receive the responses?
any people they would like to
