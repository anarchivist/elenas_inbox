H.R. 4579 - Taxpayer Relief Act of 1998
(Archer (R) Texas)

The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 4579.   If the bill were presented
to the President, either as a stand-alone bill or combined with other
legislation, he would veto it.  By draining billions out of projected
budget surpluses, this bill violates the PresidentO,s unwavering
commitment to save Social Security first.  None of the surpluses should be
touched until the long-term solvency of Social Security has been fully
secured. We must not squander this unique opportunity to save Social
Security.

Last February in the FY 1999 Budget, the President proposed tax cuts
targeted to help American families -- and proposed offsets to fully pay
for the tax cuts. The Administration urges the Congress to consider tax
cuts only if we can do so in a manner that -- like the Democratic
substitute -- adheres to the budget rules, maintains fiscal discipline,
and meets the President's commitment to reserve the entire surplus until
we have strengthened Social Security.

H.R. 4579 would cut taxes by $85 billion over five years and $176 billion
over 10 years. Virtually none of the bill~J,s costs have been paid for.
This blatantly violates the pay-as-you-go fiscal discipline of the Budget
Enforcement Act -- discipline which has been an essential component of our
remarkable economic revival.

The bill's exemption from the Budget Enforcement Act evades this fiscal
discipline. The Administration strongly opposes this exemption from the
fundamental budget. laws.
