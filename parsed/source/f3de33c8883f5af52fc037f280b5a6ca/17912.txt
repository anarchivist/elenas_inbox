Here's a few paragraphs on the juvie stuff.  I hope it works.  Also, this
info is from a '96 study that relies on '93/'94 data -- a little older
than I would like.  I'm trying to see if we have any of the new numbers
similarly broken down by city to make sure they still hold up.

Taking the Next Step on Juvenile Crime

         Although Congress failed to pass juvenile crime legislation last year, it nonetheless
provided funds for much of the Administration's Anti-Gang and Youth Violence Strategy.
Specifically, Congress provided $110 million in targeted block grant funding for thousands of
new prosecutors and probation officers (CJS), $40 million for new after school programs
(LaborIHHS), $195 million for a youth-focused anti-drug media campaign (Treasury/Postal) and
other important resources (full funding for COPS, $1 million for Youth Crime Gun Interdiction
Initiative). Equally important, the Administration successfully negotiated an agreement with the
nation's largest gun manufacturers to have child safety locks included with the sale of handguns.
With these combined resources, communities will be in a better position to keep their youth from
turning to gangs, guns and drugs next year.

       But there are two important things we still need to do if we are going to take juvenile
crime head on:

       1. Crack Down on Kids and Guns. We need to extend the Brady Bill and ban violent
       juveniles from owning guns as adults. There is no denying that guns have fueled the
       surge in juvenile murders and are at the heart of our nation's youth violence epidemic.
       While non-gun homicides have remained essentially unchanged since 1984, the number
       of juveniles killing with a gun has quadrupled during that time period. Congress must
       past legislation the stops crime-committing kids from buying a gun on their 21st birthday.

       2. Target Juvenile Murders. While the Administration's juvenile crime legislation
       provided direct and flexible resources to the communities with the worst juvenile crime
       problems, Congress has rejected this approach. Unfortunately, that means it will be
       more difficult to target resources and replicate Boston's successful youth violence
       strategy, which has helped to dramatically cut Boston's crime rate and put a stop to
       juvenile gun murders. Not a single juvenile has been murdered by a firearm in Boston in
       more than 2 years (since July 1995).

       Too much is at stake to wait for Congress to act. That is why we are launching a new
       initiative to do everything we can, to use every resource we have (i.e., more police, gun
       tracing and enforcement, increased prosecutions, safer schools and more), to translate
       Boston's success to New York, Chicago, Detroit and Los Angeles -- the cities with the
       most serious juvenile murder problem.

       Targeting these cities can help substantially reduce the murder rate for juveniles. More
       than 80% of the counties in the country did not report a single juvenile homicide arrest,
       and more than 90% reported arresting only 1 or fewer juvenile murderers. On the other
       hand, 6 states (Florida, Michigan, Illinois, New York, Texas and California) account for
       more than half (56%) of all arrests for juvenile homicides, and these 4 cities (New York,
       Chicago, Detroit and Los Angeles) account for nearly a third of all juvenile murder
       arrests.
