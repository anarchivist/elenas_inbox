                                 PRESIDENT CLINTON:
                        STANDING UP FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES

                                                  June 18, 1998

"Today, like every other day, 3,000 children start to smoke, and 1,000 of them will have their lives shortened
because of it. If more members of the Senate would vote like parents rather than politicians, we could solve this
problem and go on to other business of the country. "                                                          .

                                                                                President Bill Clinton
                                                                                June 17, 1998

Yesterday, a bipartisan majority of the Senate signaled its readiness to vote on m!!aningful tobacco
legislation to reduce teen smoking, but were blocked by a minority of Senators. President Clinton is
committed to passing this important legislation, and will continue to fight for the health and well-being of
our children.

A STRATEGIC PLAN FOR REDUCING YOUTH SMOKING. For the last three years, the President has
worked tirelessly to reduce teen smoking. The President has stated that tobacco legislation must meet 5
objectives: 1) a reduction in youth smoking by raising the price of cigarettes by up to $1.10 over 5
years, with additional surcharges on companies that continue to sell to kids; 2) full authority for the
Food and Drug Administration to regulate tobacco products; 3) changes in the way the tobacco
industry does business, including an end to marketing and promotion to kids; 4) progress toward
other public health goals, including biomedical and cancer research, a reduction of second-hand
smoke, promotion of smoking cessation programs and other urgent priorities; and 5) protection for
tobacco farmers and their communities.

THE SENATE REFUSED TO VOTE ON A BILL TO REDUCE TEEN SMOKING. The President supported
legislation introduced by Senator John McCain (R-AZ) that contained the strongest anti-youth
smoking provisions in our history and would cut youth smoking in half over the next five years.
Yesterday, when Senators could have sided with families and children, a minority of Senators chose
instead to side with the tobacco industry, and blocked a vote on this important legislation.

THE PRESIDENT WORKED COOPERATIVELY WITH CONGRESS TO PRODUCE STRONG LEGISLATION.
In order to get a tough anti-smoking bill, the President was willing to accept a tax cut to eliminate
the marriage penalty for couples making less than $50,000 a year, and increased funding for
anti-drug measures. The President earlier worked to secure several improvements to the tobacco
legislation, including stronger lookback surcharges, stronger environmental tobacco smoke
protections, and substantial funding for public health and research as well as for states and tobacco
farmers.

THE TOBACCO LOBBY VS. CHILDREN AND FAMILIES. The Senate's vote, and the lobbying effort by
the tobacco industry, which spent $40 million to defeat this measure, will not reduce the President's
resolve or effort to pass tobacco legislation. The facts are clear: Smoking kills - 3,000 children
every day start smoking and 1,000 of those children will die early as a result. Instead of supporting
a plan to reduce teen smoking, the Senate sided with the tobacco lobby. The Senators who blocked
this vote are on the wrong side of this issue, and they are out of step with the communities and
families of this country.
