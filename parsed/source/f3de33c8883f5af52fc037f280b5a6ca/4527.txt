TEXT:
As you may recall, Romer and the western governors are into the idea of
making all their universities' courses available over the internet
(Western Governors University). The NEC (Kalil) has started its own
distance learning project and pulled in a bunch of interested agencies.

Mike and I met with Kalil and came up with a tenative game plan:  continue
vetting out an intiative with the agencies to help promote distance
learning generally, bring Romer/Levitt in to help inform the process,
shoot for an intiative that could be announced at the SOTU.
