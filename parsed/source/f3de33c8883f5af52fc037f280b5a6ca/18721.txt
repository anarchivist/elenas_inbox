TEXT:
Do you have time today or tomorrow morning to meet with Rob and I to
follow-up on the questions/suggestions Elena raised at our benchmarking
meeting last week? This would be separate and apart from Sylvia's meeting
tomorrow to go over roll-out. Let me know your availability either later
today or tomorrow morning.
