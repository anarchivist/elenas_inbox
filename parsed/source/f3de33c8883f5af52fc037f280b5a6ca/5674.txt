TEXT:
Sorry folks--I also forgot to ask Janet--where are we on the. congressional
participation--who is coming. Please advise. Also do we need a prebrief
meeting per Susan's suggestion. Lastly, we have told the groups that we
are having ano·ther race initiative meeting with some of the civil rights
leaders in January--is there more prepping that we need to do?
