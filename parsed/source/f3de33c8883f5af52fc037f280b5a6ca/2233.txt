TEXT:
I sent you a fax, which. I don't entirely understand, but it seems clear
that only a few officers are exempted.   I think this is an analogous
situation - only some of the Uniform Division members would need to be
exempted, b/c those protecting the grounds at the White House are the same
as those protecting the grounds of the Capitol, and those detailed to the
principals could also be considered the same and may need to be exempted.
If you think it's a weak argument -- I definitely trust you!!   I thought
you could say something like:   "Under the Congressional Accountability
Act, the capitol police have the right to collectively bargain, and steps
have been taken to ensure that this does not pose any threat to national
security. Additional steps could be taken to account for the unique
security threats the Uniform Division must protect against."    I guess I
see this as useful b/c it's an area of potential compromise -- even if we
exempt half of the Uniform Division, we've at least given greater
protections to some officers -- and neither side feels defeated.
