TEXT:
I just got an urgent message from Tim Dudgeon with Distilled Spirits
regarding a letter that went to Reed Hundt from Attorney General Reno
asking him to act.  Dudgeon's call has a very urgent tone and he is
concerned that the AG's letter to Hundt is the WH's answer to their letter
to POTUS. We need to talk about this asap ... please call me at 62682.
