                              Questions and Answers
                                   May 15,1997


Q.   What is the Peace Officers Memorial?

     The Peace Officers Memorial is one of several events that takes place during National
     Police Week each year to commemorate the deaths oflaw enforcement officers slain in
     the line of duty. It is sponsored by the National Lodge of the Fraternal Order of Police
     (FOP) -- the nation's largest law enforcement organization with some 277,000 members
     -- and has been held every year since 1982. Thousands of law enforcement officers from
     across the country attend each year.

Q.   What anti-crime initiatives did the President announce at the Peace Officers
     Memorial today?

A.   First and foremost, the President attended the Peace Officers Memorial to commemorate
     the deaths of the 116 law enforcement officers slain in the line of duty in 1996. While
     fewer officers died this year than in any other since 1959, too many of our officers are
     killed and assaulted every year. The President has always honored the service and
     sacrifice of these officers and their families by attending police memorials during Police
     Week.

     At today's service, the President announced two actions taken by the Administration to
     continue to fight crime and violence. These are:

            (1) Child Safety Locks -- Consistent with his March 5th directive, the President
            reported that all FBI and ATF agents -- about 13,000 or 20% of all federal law
            enforcement officers -- have been issued child safety locks for their firearms, and
            that the remaining officers will be provided with locks by October 15th at the
            latest.

            (2) Revised Brady Forms -- The President also announced that the Treasury
            Department has sent out revised Brady forms (Form 4473) to all federal gun
            dealers to help ensure that only legitimate residents of a state are able to purchase
            firearms.

Q.   How many officers were killed in the line of duty in 1996?

A.   In 1996, 116 federal, state and local law enforcement officers were killed in the line of
     duty -- a 35% decline over 1995.        This is the lowest number oflaw enforcement
     officers killed in the line of duty since 1959 -- and well below the annual average over the
     past decade of about 160 deaths.
Q.   Why such a sharp decline in the number of police officers slain?


                                                 Automated Records Management SysteJTI
                                                         Hex·Dump Conversion
     victims groups agree on 3 important reasons: (1) more and better-trained police officers
     (nearly 700,000); (2) a reduction in the number of firearms-related fatalities (from 71 in
     1995 to 55 in 1996, or about half of the overall decrease); and (3) increased used of bullet
     resistant vests.

Q.   Can you tell us more about the revised Brady form? How has it been changed?

A.   Last March, in response to the tragic Empire State Building shooting by a foreign visitor,
     the President asked Secretary'Rubin to review options to address existing deficiencies
     relating to the purchase of firearms by nonresident aliens. In response, the Treasury
     Department has revised the Brady form (Form 4473) to help ensure that only legitimate
     residents of a state are able to purchase firearms.

     These new forms will require prospective gun purchasers to formally attest that they are
     residents of the state in which they are purchasing the firearm. For noncitizens, the
     revised Brady form requires proof that the 90-day residency requirement in federal
     regulations has been met. This can be accomplished through supplementary forms of
     identification, such as utility bills or lease agreements.

Q.   What was the President's directive on child safety locks?

     On March 5, 1997, President Clinton directed all federal agencies to issue child safety
     locks for guns issued to federal law enforcement officers. Today, President Clinton
     announced that the Federal Bureau ofInvestigation (FBI) and the Bureau of Alcohol,
     Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) have already provided safety locks to all their law
     enforcement agents. All other Federal law enforcement officers -- such as the Drug
     Enforcement agents and U.S. Marshals -- will be equipped with child safety locks no later
     than October 15th of this year.

     Together, the FBI and ATF represent about 20% of the total number of federal law
     enforcement officers.

     Additionally, the President renewed his challenge to Congress to pass comprehensive
     juvenile crime legislation that includes his proposal to require all federally-licensed gun
     dealers to provide child safety locks with every gun sold. This provision has the strong
     support of national law enforcement organizations, such as the Fraternal Order of Police
     and the Major Cities Chiefs.

Q.   Can child safety locks really make a difference?

A.   Every day, firearms claim the lives of too many children. They are responsible for 12%
     of fatalities among American children and teens, including many tragic accidents.
     Many of these deaths are preventable. A safety lock can prevent a child from hurting
      criminal. Moreover, child safety locks are simple devices-- costing as little as $4 each.
      These devices prevent a gun from being discharged without first being deactivated--
      through a key or mechanical or electronically-operated lock.

Q.    What is the Administration's position on the HR.3, the Juvenile Crime Control Act?

A.    The President is opposed to the legislation because it is not a comprehensive plan to
      attack gangs and juvenile crime. A 1996 report released by the Justice Department's
      Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention projected that if trends continue as
      they have over the past 10 years, juvenile arrests for violent crime will more than double
      by the year 2010. This is why President Clinton has made juvenile crime and gangs his
      top law enforcement priority over the next four years.

      America's Anti-Gang and Youth Violence Strategy must declare war on gangs; target
      funding for additional local prosecutors to pursue, prosecute, and punish gang members;
      extend the Brady Law so violent teen criminals will never have the right to purchase a
      gun; require federal dealers to sell a child safety lock with every gun, to protect our kids
      from using guns to hurt eah other or themselves; and target resources to keep schools
      open late, on weekends, and in the summer to keep young people off the street and out of
      trouble.

      The legislation passed in the House last week fails to provide any of these necessary
      measures to give law enforcement, prosecutors, and parents the tools they need to combat
      gangs and youth violence in their communities.

      The President will continue to work with Congress to ensure passage of legislation that
      will give our children the safest and most secure future as possible.

Q.    What does the Administration's juvenile justice proposal do?

A.     The legislation that President Clinton announced on February 19 is part of his overall
       Anti-Gang and Youth Violence Strategy. The strategy seeks to break the back of violent
     . gangs, reduce youth violence, and provide our kids with positive alternatives to steer
       them away from gangs, guns, and drugs.

      Among many other measures, the strategy provides critical resources for state and local
      prosecutors to target, prosecute and convict violent youth gangs. It permits Federal
      prosecutors to prosecute juveniles in adult court when they commit violent crimes.

      It requires child safety locks for guns to prevent accidents and thefts and extends the
      Brady Law so that violent juveniles can never own a gun.
      It also creates afterschool initiatives to keep kids off the streets and give them positive
      alternatives. It will give communities the resources and support to establish
      comprehensive curfews, anti-truancy efforts, create youth violence courts, and effective
