                       Military Surplus Guns ("Curios and Relics")
                                  Question and Answer
                                   September 10, 1997


     Q.   What is the Administration going to do about the provision in the House Treasury
          appropriations bill on the importation of U.S.-manufactured military surplus
          firearms?

     A.   We strongly opposed this provision last year and succeeded in getting it removed from
          the emergency spending bill. And we are equally opposed to it again this year and are
          working to make sure that it is not included in the final Treasury-Postal appropriations
          bill.

          This amendment would force the Administration's hand in approving applications to
          import military surplus firearms that have been provided to foreign governments at little
          or no costs over the past several decades. We are extremely concerned with this
          amendment's impact. It would effectively make huge quantities oflow-cost firearms
          available on America's streets. Moreover, many of these firearms --like the M-I rifle--
          are easily convertible into fully automatic weapons which have been outlawed since the
          late 1930s.

          With all the success we've had in reducing crime and violence over the past few years, it
          makes absolutely no sense to tack a provision like this onto an appropriations bill and
          quietly flood our streets with cheap military firearms. At a minimum, Congress should
          hold hearings on such an important issue. So in the meantime, we will continue to fight
          this provision as the appropriations process continues.
