Attached please find a draft of the one-page cover memo that Staff
Secretary was looking to attach to Judge Oberdorfer's "get out of jail
free" proposal.  Let me know what you think.  I think Se",n Maloney was
trying to get something by tomorrow, so that POTUS could review over the
weekend. No strict timeline though.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM           BRUCE REED

RE:            Proposal on Sentencing Certain Drug Offenders


Attached is a proposal from U.S. District Judge Oberdorfer for you to issue an Executive Order
creating a "blue ribbon" panel empowered to commute the sentences of certain drug offenders in
the Federal Bureau of Prisons. He specifically suggests that such a panel consider the cases of
individuals convicted of being crack "couriers" or "cookers" (those who convert powder
cocaine to crack) and grant them clemency after serving the powder equivalent of their sentences
if they hold the promise ofliving crime- and drug-free lives. Taking such action, Judge
Oberdorfer believes, would go a long way towards addressing the disparity between federal crack
and powder cocaine sentences.

Without speaking to the legality of Judge Oberdorfer's proposal, we recommend against its
adoption for several reasons. First, we believe his proposal is too broad. While our own
proposal increases the trigger for mandatory minimum sentences for crack from 5 to 25 grams, or
ounce quantities (28 grams) that are trafficked by mid-level dealers, Judge Oberdorfer's
recommendation is not limited to offenders within this range. As it stands, according to the
Justice Department about 80 percent oflow- to mid-level crack defendants, those caught with 50
grams or fewer, also possessed a weapon or had a serious criminal history. Thus, we would
recommend against any proposal that does not focus on lower end crack offenders.

Second, Members of Congress would undoubtedly contest any executive action you take to
reduce sentences for crack defendants. Already, key Republicans (Senators Lott, Hatch,
Abraham, and Speaker Gingrich) have strongly criticized the Administration's proposal to reduce
the disparity between crack and powder cocaine sentences by increasing the trigger for crack.
Instead, Republicans are threatening to pass legislation simply reducing the trigger for powder
cocaine, for which they have bipartisan support. We believe then that any Executive Order you
sign on this controversial Will be overturned by legislation -- either as a stand alone bill or as an
amendment to juvenile crime legislation or ONDCP's reauthorization bill.

Third, we believe much of what Judge Oberdorfer wants to accomplish overlaps with the
mandatory minimum "safety valve" that passed as part of the 1994 Crime Act. This provision
allowed federal judges to exempt certain drug offenders from mandatory minimum penalties if:
(l) they did not have a significant criminal history; (2) they did not use violence, possess a
firearm or commit serious injury; (3) they did not playa lead or organizing role; and (4) they
provided information about the offense to the government. At the time of passage, the U.S.
Sentencing Commission estimated that about 600 drug offenders would be immediately eligible
for this exemption.
