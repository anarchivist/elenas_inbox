PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
REMARKS ON THE NEXT GENERATION COPS INITIATIVE
ALEXANDRIA, VIRGINIA
January 14, 1999

        Acknowledgments: AG Reno; Alexandria Chief of Police Charles Samarra; Joe
Brann, director of COPS program; official TBD; Arlington police officer TBD

        For years, police, families, and the victims of violence waged' the
fight on their own for safe streets and safe homes.  Washington sat on the
sidelines. Six years ago, we moved to the frontlines -- joining the law
enforcement officials we have here today in the fight against crime.

        Today I want to talk about the progress weD,ve made in our
countryD,s fight against crime and the steps we must take to build on that
progress. When I became President, I committed my administration to
recovering our nationD,s streets from crime and violence, to providing
security for AmericaD,s families.   It required a new, comprehensive
strategy of law enforcement, based simply on what works: on community
policing, strong anti-gang efforts, and targeted deterrence; on tougher
penalties and smarter prevention.
,.
             Our strategy -- from the Crime Bill to the Brady Bill to the
     assault weapons ban -- is showing remarkable results, as the Attorney
     General has noted.  Since 1993, all across America, crime rates overall
     have dropped to a 25-year low.   Property crime is down; and, as you can
     see [point to chart], the number of violent crimes has declined 20 percent
     in the last six years and continues to plummet.

             The murder rate, too, is down dramatically, to its lowest level in
     30 years, mostly due to the dropping number of youths wielding guns. We
     can take pride and comfort in this steady progress.   Neighborhoods are
     safer; families are more secure; Americans have a new feeling of freedom.

             There are many reasons for the drop in crime in our country:
     Stricter penalties.      Stronger efforts to get guns out of the hands of
     criminals.      The burning out of the crack epidemic, as the terrible
     human toll of that destructive drug scares more and more young people
     away. And, perhaps most important to the peace of mind of our people, the
     substantial, visible increase in the presence of police on our streets.
     Across America, you are stepping out of squad cars, joining our
     communities, protecting our people.  To those of you who are out there,
     putting your lives on the line, America owes you a tremendous debt of
     gratitude. And ID,m pleased to report that ahead of schedule and under.
     budget, weD,ve helped fund more than 92,000 of 100,000 community police
     making us all partners in the fight against crime.   I used to say that the
     number of police had not gone up as the number of crimes had gone up; but
     now, with more police on the streets and fewer violent crimes, we are
     turning that around.

             America is pressing its advantage in the fight against crime.  But
     no matter how low crime rates go, we can never stop and say they are low
     enough. There are still too many neighborhoods in America where crime has
     not fallen as far or as fast as it should. There are still too many
     officers in the line of fire, where 155 of your colleagues lost their
     lives in the past year. There is still more work to do, even though the
     funding for our community policing effort is set to expire after the year
     2000.

             We know what works in the fight against crime, and it is working in
     communities across America. But now, we have a chance to focus our
     efforts on any stubborn pockets of resistance where the criminal culture
     holds sway. Today, I am announcing that my balanced budget will include
     nearly $1.3 billion -- an increase of more than'$6 billion over 5 years --
     to renew and redouble our community police program.  That will help hire
     and re-deploy an additional 50,000 community police officers over that
     same period. We should refocus our resources -- and the energies of our
     men and women in blue -- on the high-crime, high-need neighborhoods where
     we know they can make a difference.

             But community policing is not just about putting more officers on
     the street.  It is also about giving our police the 21st Century tools
     they need to do the job -- crime-fighting, crime-solving, crime-preventing
     tools. Today, drug dealers communicate by cell phones and pagers.
     Scam artists work the Internet.    . Gangs carry cutting-edge weaponry.

             If criminals have the best technology, police should, too.  That is why,
     today, I am proposing that we devote $350 million, paid for in my balanced
     budget, to put crime-fighting technology into the hands of our police
     officers.  For too long, we have seen some criminals go free because the
     methods used to gather evidence were not up to date.  But when police can


     report from their squad cars, rather than return to the station to fill
     out paperwork, they can spend more time on the beat.  When officers can
     track crime as it happens, using innovative crime mapping technology, they
     can respond more quickly and effectively. Chief Samarra has told us what
     a difference these new tools make.

             Police carry a heavy burden; but we know they cannot carry it
     alone. There is more we must do to engage the entire community in .the
     fight against crime -- to help win the fight police have been waging so
     successfully. My balanced budget targets additional funds for
     community-based crime-fighting -- everything from neighborhood DAs who
     work closely with police and residents, to faith-based organizations that
     help prevent juvenile crime.
,.
             I have put these programs in our budget; now, I want to do what we
     did on the Crime Bill, which is to sit down with law enforcement officials
     and talk about the best ways to make this initiative work.  Because
     together, we can and will make it work.

             America is grateful for the hard work of our men and women in
     uniform. Every day, you make our streets and schools safer, our homes
     more secure, our people more free.  Still, we know you cannot do it
     alone. By working together and giving you the tools to do your job, we
     will make this a better and a safer nation in the 21st Century.
