TEXT:
Please note -- the Senate Labor and Human Resources will be
marking up S. 1221 (Legal Services Reform Act) on Wednesday, June
5th. This bill was introduced by Sen. Kassebaum and would
authorize $278 million annually through fiscal year 2000. S. 1221
would also limit the types of cases that LSC attorneys could work
on and require additional record keeping.
You may recall that Attorney General Reno and then White House
Counsel Mikva sent a letter on S. 1221 to Senator Kassebaum on
September 19, 1995, which discussed the Administrations concerns
with the bill.  (A draft of this letter was circulated in LRM 2567
dated September 18, 1995.)
I will keep you posted as I hear more about the markup.
