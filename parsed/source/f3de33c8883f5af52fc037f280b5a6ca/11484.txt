TEXT:
As I mentioned, the VP will go to NYC Thursday where he'll call on the
Senate to enact the Murray-Kennedy class size measure.   Here's our plan
for the next couple of days, assuming you're OK with it.

1) Tomorrow, OVP press office will work with the President's press office
to advance the story of the VP's visit with state-by-state press releases
that will include 7-year estimates of teachers to be hired and $ spent.
I think we can get stories on this around the country in Thursday's
newspapers, since no one has yet picked up these #s.  It would be great if
one of you could put in a word with (the president's) press office about
really helping with this. It will take some work faxing press paper out to
all of the states.

2) Riley will release the state-by-state NAEP scores Thursday morning.
Education's press 'paper won't make a tight link to the class size
initiative because of concern about "overpoliticizing" the NAEP #s, but
Riley's office says his remarks will use the NAEP scores to make the
argument for the class size initiative.

3) The VP will do the event Thursday where he'll focus on the NY and CT
class size #s, and use the NAEP reading scores to underscore the message
that we're headed in the right direction, but we need to pick up the pace
of progress, and that's why Congress needs to enact the President's class
size initiative.  The First Lady will mention this in her education events
Wednesday and Thursday as well.

4) The VP will not do a conference call Thursday, because the Education
Dept argues (convincingly) that by Thursday, reporters will be writing
about the state-by-state NAEP scores.

5) Julie Green will continue to pitch the class size story to reporters
and editorial writers.

Finally, the VP has a slot for an education event next Wednesday that I am
trying to move ahead one day to be sure the event happens before the
vote. He would again call for the Senate to enact the Murray-Kennedy
amendment, and we could try to get time on his schedule for a conference
call that day as well.
