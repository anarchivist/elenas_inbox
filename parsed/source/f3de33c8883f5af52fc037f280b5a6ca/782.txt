TEXT:
Attached is a draft memo from you to Sylvia reo the WSJ article you gave
to me.   I've left a hard copy withe article and FDA's letter to the WSJ in
your box.   FDA's letter aside, I can tell you from my work on FDA reform
that the article's discussion of FDA's views on approving drugs for
life-threatening illnesses is flat out wrong.   I don't think there's
anything here.==================== ATTACHMENT     1 ====================

FROM:          Elena Kagan

SUBJECT:       Wall Street Journal article on Ethics at FDA

The accusations made in the attached Wall Street Journal (WSJ) article you forwarded to me
should not affect PDUF A reauthorization or the process of confirming a new FDA
Commissioner. Robert Goldberg's assertion that Kessler has let politics and political
contributions influence his decisions is simply not credible. In the attached letter to the Journal,
FDA refutes the facts and events Goldberg uses to support his conclusions.

Kessler's integrity has previously been attacked by conservatives. The Washington Times' and
the WSJ's editorial pages have criticized the Commissioner's policy decisions and occasionally
attacked him personally. But reporters at the WSJ, the Washington Post and the New York
Times have not echoed these attacks. Press on FDA's actions (e.g. those to speed drug
approvals and regulate kids' access to tobacco) and recent editorials on Kessler's tenure at the
FDA have been overwhelmingly favorable.

Regardless of their views on Kessler, Members of Congress are not likely to support our nominee
for FDA Commissioner unless they are very confident he or she has integrity and can be trusted
to act independent of politics. .Nothing in the WSJ article changes that. Finally, FDA reports
that its negotiations with industry on PDUF A reauthorization are progressing well.
