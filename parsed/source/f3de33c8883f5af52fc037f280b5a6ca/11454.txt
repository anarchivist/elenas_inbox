In meeting with Sen Harkin and Del Norton on Thursday we discussed a
Presidential event for Equal Pay Day which is April 8. Eleanor
specifically suggested a roundtable discussion on issue.
  John observed President was busy that day so we would look at day
before. AFL-CIO is probably going to do events around country on this
,and House and Senate Dems will want to join in (this is during their
recess) -- so if we can tentaively look at date it would be helpful.
