TEXT:
Elena,
As you know, yesterday Abraham, Smith, Armey, Phil Graham and Hyde met to
discuss how to resolve the conflict between fhe House and Sen. Reps. on
HIB legislation.  Peter had some preliminary discussions with Smith's
staffer (George Fishman) earlier this week and outlined a few options for
compromise that we could agree to (these were agreed to after discussions
with Labor, OMB and Commerce). These options included (I) the reforms
being implemented for a period of years, to be evaluated at the end to
determine whether to continue with them (a bit looser than a straight
pilot); (2)  having the recruit and retain attestation only apply to
positions that pay <$75K (according to DOL, only 7% of computer
programmers are paid >$75K; calls industry's bluff reo their shortage of
really highly skilled and desirable workers); and (3)  excluding truly
casual users from the recruit and retain attestation (those who have hired
fewer than 10 HIBs over the last three years). According to Smith's
staffer, there has been no movement between the two sides. However, they
are meeting again this afternoon at 5pm.

I would like to propose to him that the recruit and retain attestation
only apply to employers whose workforce is more than 5% HIB (including the
requested HIB workers). The theory here is that an employer with a 95%
u.S. workforce is likely doing a sufficient job of recruitment and thus
should not be scrutinized on this by DOL. However, we anticipate (based
on some preliminary discussions with DOL) that they may not agree to pitch
this.  Sally may want to pull together a quick meeting this afternoon (wit
h DOL, OMB, Commerce and us) to try to get this resolved before the Reps.
meet again.
