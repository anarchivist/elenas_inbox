                         Funds set for education alternatives

                         By Mark Brunelli, 05/06/99

                             Boston School Superintendent'Thomas W. Payzant
   yesterday
                         outlined a long-awaited plan to deal with an
   overflow of students
                     who continually cause disruptions in class .

                    . The plan came after an announcement at a school
   committee meeting that
                      the city plans to set aside $1.2 million in the next
   fiscal year's operating
                      budget to implement recommendations of the Alternative
   Education Task
                      Force.

                         Under the plan, as many as 250 middle- and high-school
   students could
                     have seats in programs such as a new late-afternoon
   adult high school for
                     those over 20, and in a new middle school alternative
   class.

                         Other ideas are for' 'time-out rooms,"   an alternate
   teaching site for
                         90-120 high school students, extra school help, more
   slots for GED
                         programs for students to get diplomas, and working with
   community
                         colleges.

                         The task force started last November to figure how to
   duplicate the
                         success of Community Academy in Roxbury, the city's


best-known
                     alternative education center.

                  Elliot Feldman, director of alternative education
programs, said many of
                  the seats for disruptive students will come as the
result of expanding
                  existing programs to work with community groups.

                  The site for the program for students over 20 has not
been decided, but it
                  will be inside an existing high school and is slated to
begin this fall.
