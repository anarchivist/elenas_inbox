TEXT:
Here is some answers to questions you raised on tobacco that may be of use:

1. Ford and Mcconell have a new tobacco farmer proposal, the "Tobacco
Community Revitalization Act", summaries of which I will fax to you.
USDA's guy hadn't heard of it, but it just demonstrates that there wil be
alternatives we need to consider when vetting through Congress. One of
the articles mentions that a Hill Democrat thinks Bruce and donna will
support the bill.

2. the quota buy-out at the end of 8 years would not be the end of
tobacco growing, just the end of the federal program.  The rationale is
you should discontinue the program if it has deminished by 50%. You would
then be left with just a free market in tobacco growing. i.e.  If there
was a lot of demand for tobacco abroad or at home, our farmers could grow
it at going prices.

3. Burley tobacco is a different crop from flue tobacco-- more Kentucky
based and has often been thought of as almost a separtate program. Burley
farmers are less interested in a buy-out, more on stable prices. (Ford and
Mcconell are Kentuckians) .
