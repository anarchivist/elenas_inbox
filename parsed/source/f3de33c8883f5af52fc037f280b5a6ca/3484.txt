TEXT:
A couple of points for the meeting with growers:   1. the profitablity of
this crop is striking,  sometimes 10 times or higher compared to other
crops on a per acre basis; 2. accordingly,   a key recommendation from the
growers groups is the companies be required by the settlement to keep
buying 600 or 700 million tons a year.
