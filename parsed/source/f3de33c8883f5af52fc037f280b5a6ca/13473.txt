TEXT:
I am faxing to all of you this evening another draft of the
proposed letter to Hatfield.  I've got calls into some of you to
clarify some points. However, Barbara recommends moving it asap,
given that conference resumes at lO:30 am and that Hatfield is
already making the point that he hasn't heard back from us.
Two other points:
1. She recommends that we attach the Murray language on
replacement and buy-back. Any concerns?
2. The signatory - Barbara recommends L.P.
I'll be here tonight as long as any progress can be made to move
this along.
