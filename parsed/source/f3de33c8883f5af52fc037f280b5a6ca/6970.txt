       Pet your request.  I will be in tomorrow, but if you're in early and
       finish reviewing, it'd be great if you could just forward the memo to
       Phil. Both the one-pager and memo are based on the same text I worked out
       w/Counsel.  Page me if I'm not in yet, and you have major issues.

       Also, as I mentioned, Ray Kelly will brief after the event, so I think
       we've got plenty of Q/A to distribute before McCurry's gaggle.  Any Q/A we
       add, Counsel and Treasury would like to review.

       Finally, Rahm and Ray are talking to the major print folks tomorrow -- USA
       Today; Post, LA and NY Times, WSJ, and AP. And the speech, well, we may
       not have something final until Monday a.m; I don't think anybody's (Rahm,
       lawyers, etc.) focused on the current draft yet.  I left a copy in your
       office if you're interested in reviewing} .

               Banning the Importation of Modified Assault Weapons
                                   April 6, 1998


Announcement: Today, in response to a previously issued directive, the President
announced that the Treasury Department had completed its review of more than 50
specific modified assault weapons, and determined that those rifles that accept
large capacity military magazines (LCMM rifles) are not importable. This decision
will affect up to 1.5 million rifles.


·     On November 15, 1997, in his radio address to the nation, President Clinton
      announced that the Treasury Department was temporarily suspending the
      importation of certain modified assault weapons to review whether or not
      these weapons complied with current law. Today, the Secretary of the
      Treasury informed the President that most of the weapons studied should be
      permanently banned from importation.

·     Under current law (the 1968 Gun Control Act), the Treasury Department has
      the obligation to restrict the importation of firearms unless they are
      determined to be "particularly suitable for or readily adaptable to sporting
      purposes." After taking several months to review the weapons in question,
      the Treasury Department has concluded that modified semiautomatic assault
      rifles that accept large capacity military magazines -- or LCMM rifles -- do not
      meet the sporting purposes test and are not importable.

·     Since passage of the 1968 Gun Control Act, Administrations of both parties
      have repeatedly invoked this authority to ensure that only legitimate sporting
      weapons are brought into the country. In 1968, it was used to ban the
      importation of Saturday Night Specials and other small and inexpensive
      handguns; in 1984 and 1986, to ban the Striker-12 and USAS-12 riot control
      shotguns; in 1989, to ban 43 semiautomatic assault rifles; and in 1993, to
      propose a ban on certain assault pistols that were ultimately prohibited by the
      1994 Assault Weapons Ban.

·     The more than 50 firearms impacted by today's decision are modified versions
      of military assault weapons that were previously banned by the Bush
      Administration in 1989 or the 1994 Assault Weapons Ban and which are
      capable of accepting LCMMs with more than 10 rounds of ammunition.
      Most of these weapons are models based on the AK 47 assault rifle, but also
      included are variants of the Uzi. FN-FAL, HK 91 and 93, and SIG SG550.

·     Up to 1.5 million firearms whose importation had been suspended during the
      review may be affected by this decision. Importers will be notified in writing
      and given an opportunity to respond.

                       DATE:     April 6, 1998
                       LOCATION: Rose Garden
                       BRIEFING:         10:15 a.m, Oval Office
                       EVENT:            10:45 a.m. to 11:15 a.m.
                       FROM:             Bruce Reed and Rabm Emanuel


I.      PURPOSE

To announce that the Treasury Department has completed its review of more than 50 specific
modified assault weapons, and determined that those rifle that accept large capacity military
magazines (or LCMM rifles) are not importable. This decision will affect up to 1.5 million
assault-type.


II.     BACKGROUND

You will speak to approximately 50 individuals from the law enforcement, gun control, and
victims communities, as well as Members of Congress, on the importation of modified
semiautomatic assault rifles.

In your November 15, 1997, radio address to the nation you announced that the Treasury Department
was temporarily suspending the importation of certain modified assault weapons to review whether or
not these weapons complied with current law. Today, Secretary Rubin will recommend that most of
the weapons studied be permanently banned from importation.

Under the 1968 Gun Control Act, the Treasury Department has an obligation to restrict the
importation of firearms unless they are determined to be "particularly suitable for or readily adaptable
to sporting purposes." After taking several months to review the weapons in question, the Treasury
Department has concluded that modified semiautomatic assault rifles that accept large capacity
military magazines -- or LCMM rifles -- do not meet the sporting purposes test and thus are not
importable. LCMMs are those magazines that contain more than 10 rounds of ammunition and
which were prohibited by the 1994 Crime Act.

Since passage of the 1968 Gun Control Act, Administrations of both parties have repeatedly invoked
this authority to ensure that only legitimate sporting weapons are brought into the country. In 1968,
it was used to ban the importation of Saturday Night Specials and other small and inexpensive
handguns; in 1984 and 1986, to ban the Striker-12 and USAS-12 riot control shotguns; in 1989, to
ban 43 semiautomatic assault rifles; and in 1993, to propose a ban on certain assault pistols that were
ultimately prohibited by the 1994 Assault Weapons Ban.
                                                                   :iiJx-Dump Conversion   ·
The more than 50 firearms impacted by the announcement on Monday are modified versions of
military assault weapons that were previously banned by the Bush Administration in 1989 or the 1994
Assault Weapons Ban and which are capable of accepting LCMMs with more than 10 rounds of
ammunition. Most of these weapons are models based on the AK-47 assault rifle, but also included
are variants of the Uzi, FN-FAL, HK 91 and 93, and SIG SG550.

As a result of the recommendation, outstanding permits to import more than 600,000 of these firearms
will be revoked, pending a 30-day appeal process. Pending applications for permits to import more
than one million of these firearms will be denied.
