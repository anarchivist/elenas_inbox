                                          April _, 1997



Members of The Federal Election Commission
c/o Office of the General Council
999 E Street, NW
Washington, DC 20463


To the Members of the Federal Election Commission:

         I am writing to you, pursuant to 11 CFR Part 200, to request that you take action, under
your existing statutory authority, to ban "soft money" and end the system under which both
political parties compete to raise unlimited sums from individuals, labor unions, and corporations.

       The rules governing our system of financing federal election campaigns are sorely out of
date. Enacted more than two decades ago when election campaigns were much less expensive,
they have been overtaken by events, by dramatic changes in the nature and cost of campaigns
and the flood of money that has followed them. Today, money is raised and spent in ways that
simply were not contemplated when Congress last overhauled our campaign finance laws. We
must bring the rules up to date to reflect the changes in elections and campaigning that have
overtaken our political system.

       An important step in this process would be to change the rules governing the use and
solicitation of funds not subject to the contribution limitations and prohibitions of the 1971
Federal Election Campaign Act, as amended ("soft money"). Currently FEC regulations (11
CFR 106.5) allow political parties to raise and spend "soft money" in elections involving state
and federal candidates by providing an allocation formula between federal and non-federal
expenses incurred by party committees. These regulations, and limited additional guidance
provided through advisory opinions, are the basis upon which party committees make
expenditures and raise funds with respect to federal and state elections today. The use of
so-called "soft money" by party committees today is largely based on the direction provided in
these regulations.

       Whatever the merit of those regulations at the time they were adopted, it has become
abundantly clear today that they are no longer adequate to the task of regulating current
campaigns. The role of "soft money" has grown dramatically in the past several elections so
                             Hex-Dump Conversion

that by the 1996 elections the two parties raised more than $250 million; $138 million by the
Republican Party and $123 million by the Democratic Party, more than triple the total of four
years before.

         The current allocation system, in short, is simply outmoded. Accordingly, I propose that
the FEC adopt new rules requiring that candidates for federal office and national parties be
permitted to raise and spend only "hard money" -- funds subject to the restrictions, contribution
limits, and reporting requirements of the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) of 1971, as
amended.                      ·

       The "soft money"ban I seek achieves the same goals as provisions of the "Bipartisan
Campaign Reform Act of 1997", introduced by Senators John McCain and Russell Feingold, and
Representatives Christopher Shays and Martin Meehan. Specifically, I am requesting that the
Commission consider new rulemaking to accomplish the following:

1.     Prohibit national political parties (and their congressional campaign committees or agents)
       from soliciting or receiving any funds not subject to the limitations or prohibitions of
       FECA (This action would preclude, for example, contributions directly from corporate
       or union treasuries, or contributions from individuals in excess of the amount an
       individual can give to a national party's federal account.)

2.     Prohibit any federal officeholder or candidate (and his or her agents) from soliciting or
       receiving any funds not subject to the limitations or prohibitions of FECA (This action
       would preclude the same kind of contributions.)

3.     Provide that any expenditure by any national, state, or local political party during a federal
       election year for any activity that influences a federal election (including any voter
       registration or get-out-the-vote drive, generic advertising, or any communication that
       refers to a federal candidate) must be paid for from funds subject to FECA (This would
       end the allocation system, currently authorized by the FEC, under which "hard" and
       "soft" money are mixed for campaign activities that affect both state and federal elections.)

        These steps, available to you under your existing statutory authority, will enable our
election laws to catch up with the reality of the way elections are financed today, and along with
new camapign finance reform legislation, will take significant strides toward restoring public
confidence in the campaign finance process.

                                             Sincerely,
Hex-Dump Conversion
                                      William Jefferson Clinton
