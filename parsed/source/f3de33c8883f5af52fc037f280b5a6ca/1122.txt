                                        Possible Q's & A's

Question:

Why have you issued a directive prohibiting the use of Federal funds for cloning of human
beings?

Answer:

I believe we need to make it absolutely clear that Federal funds will not be used in this manner,
and the current prohibitions left room for other interpretations.

In 1994, I directed NIH not to support the creation of human embryos for research purposes, and
Congress extended this ban to cover other forms of human embryo research. However, neither
of these prohibitions would clearly cover the creation of human embryos by cloning that are
intended to be actually implanted in a womb and carried to term.

My directive today will make it clear that federal funds are not to be used for cloning humans.


Question:

Is this action really necessary? Are scientists really ready to clone human beings?

Answer:

While the majority of scientific experts believe that successfully cloning human beings is very
unlikely in the near future -- we can not rule it out. It is important that we stop now and
consider the ethical implications.


Question:

Would you support legislation to ban the cloning of humans?

Answer:

I think that legislation is premature at this time. I think that we need a serious, public
discussion-- which I have asked NBAC to lead -- rather than hasty legislation.
                                                                   Hex-Dump Conve:rsi.on
Question:

What impact does the directive have on the private sector?

Answer:

The directive only federally-supported research. Therefore, I am asking the broader scientific
and medical communities to also refrain from cloning human beings at this time, until NBAC has
had time for its deliberations.


Question:

What are the next steps?

Answer:

I have asked the National Bioethics Advisory Commission (NBAC) to report back to me in 90
days with recommendations for possible federal action. They will review the ethical and legal
implications in open, public meetings. I look forward to receiving and reviewing NBAC's
recommendations.


Question:

Is animal research like the sheep experiment affected by the directive?

Answer:

No. The directive refers to the cloning of humans. The legislative ban also covers only human
research. There is no ban, nor should there be any ban on animal cloning. There is very
important scientific work that can be accomplished using animals. This work will have
significant benefits for agriculture, medicine and veterinary medicine. It could also lead to
improvements in organ transplantation and better treatments for bum victims or cancer patients.
Also, by creating genetically identical animals, scientists testing drugs could use far fewer
animals than they now need.
