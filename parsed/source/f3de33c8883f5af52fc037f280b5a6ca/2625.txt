 Lauren has asked that we submit a weekly report to her for   distribution.
 Could you do this? I would suggest you list the activities   Sandy has
 participated in over the last two weeks and send it to her   tomorrow.  It
 goes through Elena/Bruce before it is finalized.
 Include a focus on outside group meetings and with the Gen   etc ...
