                             REMARKS ON LONG-TERM CARE
                                   THE WHITE HOUSE
                                     January 4,1999

        Another new year is upon us -- a time for celebration, and, perhaps, a time to feel a little
bit older. If we do, we are not alone. America may be young in spirit; our nation may have all
the energy and intensity and ambition of youth; but our people are aging. On the verge of the
new century, we are undergoing a profound, seismic demographic shift. Today I want to talk
about the ways we are going to meet the challenges of this new America.

        Simply put: The baby boom will soon become the senior boom. And, like the
baby boom did in decades past, the senior boom will change the face of America. During
the next 30 years, 76 million baby boomers will join -- and greatly expand -- the ranks of the
retired. The number of elderly Americans will double by 2030. By the middle of the next
century, the average American will live to 82, six years longer than today.

       Longer lives will also be stronger, healthier lives, thanks to medical science. Already,
older Americans are redefining retirement. They are proving that, rather than an ending, it can
be a new beginning: a time to learn new ideas, start a new business, travel to new and distant
lands.

        Still, aging is inevitable; and so are the infirmities of age. Nearly half the people over 85
-- one of the fastest-growing segments of the American population -- need help with everyday
tasks. Eating. Dressing. Going to the doctor. We cannot expect all or even most older
Americans to fend for themselves. We cannot expect it and we would never wish it. Nor
would we, in every case, send an aging relative to a nursing home. Millions require the kind of
care only a nursing home can provide, but millions more choose to remain at home, close to
family and friends.

         Indeed, the elderly and disabled are staying at home in record numbers, cared for by those
who care the very most. Today, more than 22 million households are caring for elderly relatives
and even neighbors. It is, more and more, a common choice, but it is rarely an easy one. Since
long-term care at home is rarely covered by private insurance or Medicare, out-of-pocket
expenses can be high. So, too, are the professional costs. Caregivers who hold jobs outside the
home -- and that is a vast majority -- may have to take unpaid leave or work fewer hours to fulfill
all their responsibilities. Caregiving is, in countless ways, vital, meaningful work; but it can
also be stressful work.
                                                                           Automated Recon!s Management System
                                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion

           The Vice President just told you what we've been doing to ease the burdens on families:
    by improving nursing homes, strengthening Medicare, and making Medicaid more flexible. But
    America, in the 21 st Century, will be a nation of caregivers; so there is more work to be done.

          Today, I am announcing a bold initiative to give care to the caregivers -- to help
    Americans provide for aging and ailing loved ones. The size of the senior boom demands
    it. The length of our lives makes it more important than ever. And so does the sacrifice
    of American families -- 22 million households putting the well-being of relatives or
    neighbors above their own.

            To improve long-term care in America, to give it the priority and support these families
    deserve, there are four things we must do. First, I am proposing a long-term care tax credit -- up
    to $1,000 for people with long-term care needs or for the families that shelter them. It is far
    better to devote this money to help keep the elderly and disabled at home than to spend the same
    amount to have them live away from home. Our parents worked and saved and sacrificed to
    care for us in our youth. Adult children are working and saving and sacrificing to care for their
    parents in old age. It is the cycle oflife -- a vital and sacred compact among generations -- and
    one we should recognize and reward as a nation. This targeted tax cut, paid for in our balanced
    budget, would help offset the direct costs oflong-term care -- home health visits, adult day care
    -- as well as the indirect costs, like the unpaid leave some caregivers take from work. The care
    they provide is invaluable; but we can show we value it very much indeed.

            Second, we should create a Family Caregiver Support Program -- a new national network
    to support Americans who care for the chronically ill or disabled. In decades past, families
    could do little for ailing relatives but give them shelter and love. Today, due to advances in
    science, caregivers tend to everything from dialysis to depression, and prepare everything from
    intravenous meals to the paperwork that is, it seems, an inescapable part of modem medicine.
    This initiative enables states to create "one-stop shops" -- providing critical information,
    caregiver counseling, and respite and adult day care services to families that need them. They
    want to provide the best possible care; we want do everything in our power to help them.

             That is why, third, we must educate Medicare beneficiaries about long-term care options.
    This is an efficient way to answer people's essential questions: What are my choices? What
    should I look for in a private long-term care insurance policy? By launching a national
    educational campaign, we can help ensure that people in need get the answers -- and the quality
    care -- they deserve.

           Fourth, I am proposing that we offer private long-term care insurance to federal
    employees. The federal government can, in this way, use its power as the nation's largest
    employer to set a national example -- promoting high-quality and affordable care to hundreds of
    thousands of workers.

           There is no single solution to the challenges of caregiving. But together, these initiatives


                                                    2
                                                                        Hex-Dump Ccnversion

represent a powerful force for positive change. To fulfill our fundamental obligation to
America's elderly and disabled, we, too, must act together -- as members of both parties, of two
branches of government, putting progress above partisanship for the sake of our people. That
means giving care to the caregivers by taking these important steps. It also means strengthening
Medicare, and, as I have said many times in the past year, it means saving Social Security for the
21 st Century -- for Social Security, too, is a sacred trust between generations. We now have a
remarkable opportunity to strengthen it for the future; we must make the most of it.

        The senior boom is one of the central challenges of the coming century. If we face these
challenges together and make them our top priorities, if we make the efforts I have described
today, then we can prove what no generation in history has had the opportunity to prove -- that
the infirmities of age need not be the indignities of age. Thank you.
