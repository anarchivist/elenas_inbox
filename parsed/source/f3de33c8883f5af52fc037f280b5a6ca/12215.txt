TEXT:
Bruce,

I have faxed over the profile of this year's national teacher of the year,
a male, kindergarten teacher from Georgia.  I hope this is helpful in
determining the appropriate announcement for the event on Monday.

Something important to note:  I have been informed that Sec. Riley is
currently scheduled to be in Puerto Rico on Monday, but would change his
schedule to be here if we were releasing the social promotions guide.

Let me know what you think about the announcement potentials, and what you
would like me to do on the Sec. Riley participation front.
