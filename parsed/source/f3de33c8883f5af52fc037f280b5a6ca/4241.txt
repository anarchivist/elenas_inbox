MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:                 Bruce Reed

SUBJECT:              Position Papers on the Proposed Tobacco Settlement


This briefing book contains position papers written by leaders in the public health community,
the Treasury Department, and the Justice Department. This book will provide you with a sense
of the context in which your announcement will be received, and the arguments that will likely
be made in response to the position the Administration takes on the proposed Attorneys General
tobacco settlement.

The first section of the book compares the proposed settlement to positions taken by the key
public health groups. There is a side-by-side analysis of the proposed settlement with positions
taken by: KooplKessler, AMA, American Cancer Society, American Heart Association, and the
American Lung Association. We have also included copies of the executive summaries or short
position papers issued by these groups and one from the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids. The
Campaign and the AMA were the only public health groups that participated in the settlement
negotiations.

The second section of the book contains papers written by former FDA Commissioner David
Kessler, Congressman Waxman, and Senator Kennedy. Along with former Surgeon General
Koop, they likely will be the key leaders shaping the public health community's response.

The third and final section ofthe book contains papers written by the Departments of Justice and
Treasury. The two Justice papers examine the impact of the proposed settlement on tobacco
litigation. The three Treasury papers examine the economics of the proposed settlement.
