PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
REMARKS UPON SIGNING THE CONTINUING RESOLUTION
THE WHITE HOUSE
September 25, 1998

        Good morning. A few moments ago, I signed stopgap legislation
that will keep the government open and running at the start of a new
fiscal year.  This legislation is a regrettable sign that the Republican
majority in Congress has chosen partisanship over progress, and has failed
to address the urgent priorities of the American people.

        There is only one week left in the fiscal year.  Yet thus far the
Congress has passed only one of fourteen appropriations bills to fund the
operations of the United States government.  This is a stark and
regrettable abdication of the CongressD, fundamental duty to tend to the
needs of the American people.   By failing to meet its most basic
governing responsibility, the Republican majority in Congress has its
priorities wrong -- choosing partisanship over progress.

        Moreover, on key national goals -- improving education, providing
affordable child care, expanding health care coverage, protecting our
environment, and stabilizing the international economy -- the House of
Representatives is moving in the wrong direction.    For example, at a time
when opportunity depends on education more than ever before, the House is
preparing to deny funding for smaller classes, after-school programs,
technology in the classroom, and summer job programs. At the same time,
some lawmakers have attached controversial and unrelated provisions
guaranteed to mire these bills in unnecessary delay.

        For six years, our new economic strategy of fiscal responsibility,
investing in our people, and expanding trade has spurred lower interest
rates and created the conditions for the strongest economy in a
generation. We are about to enter a new and promising era of budget
surpluses. We should use this time of prosperity to meet the challenges
facing our nation.  I have laid out a concrete plan of how we can continue
on that course -- make smart investments while maintaining the fiscal
discipline that has helped fuel our prosperity.  And I have reached out to
Members of Congress of both parties to work together toward this end.

        ItO,s time for Congress to buckle down, send me the measures to
keep the government open and invest in education, health care, and the
other needs of the American people, and put progress over partisanship.


  That~,s   the way to strengthen our nation for the 21st Century.
