Q:   Is it true that the President is planning to include in his budget the
     Jeffords-Kennedy proposal to allow Medicaid for people with disabilities?

A:   The President has not made any decisions about his upcoming budget. He is currently
     reviewing a range of policies. However, he does believe it is extremely important to find
     ways to help people with disabilities access the health care coverage they need to return to
     work. That is why he endorsed the Jeffords-Kennedy proposal earlier this year. Having
     said this, despite his support for initiatives, such as the Jeffords-Kennedy bill, he has not
     made any final decisions about any budget provisions.

     Background: The President endorsed the Jeffords-Kennedy legislation at an event at the
     White House commemorating the anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act on
     July 29th. The President and his senior advisors also pushed hard for Congress to pass
     this proposal in the budget negotiations this fall.

Q:   Why are you issuing a new directive that advises hospitals they will be liable to the
     anti-dumpling statue if they do not provide emergency medical care to patients who
     have not received pre-approval?

A:   This directive was issued in response to complaints that the HHS Inspector General has
     received from patients in managed care plans that they have been improperly denied
     emergency care coverage. The Department has also received inquiries from providers
     about the applicability of the anti-dumping statue in these types of situations.

     Today, we issued an alert that the anti-dumping statute does, in fact, apply to hospitals
     and physicians who are participating in the Medicare program. This Administration, led
     the President and the Vice President, has consistently worked to ensure that basic patient
     rights, such as access to emergency room care when and where the need arises, be applied
     to all health plans. This initiative is one more example of how this Administration is
     doing all it can to provide these protections through executive action. However, these
     protections cannot be assured by all health plans unless Congress passes a strong
     enforceable patients' bill of rights.

Q:   Do you have any comment on the Labor Department's amicus brief dealing with the
     ability of health plan enrollees to sue their HMO for wrongful actions?

A:   Today's amicus, filed by the Department of Labor in consultation with the Justice
     Department, underscores the Administration's strong belief that the Employment Rights
     Income Security Act (ERISA) does not preempt state insurance laws which provide
     patients with the ability to seek compensation through the courts when a plan's actions
     cause the patient harm or death. We are aware and are supportive of this amicus brief.

in 1987. It is consistent with the longstanding Administration policy that patients who
have been maimed or killed as a consequence of wrongful plan actions should have
access to adequate remedies.
