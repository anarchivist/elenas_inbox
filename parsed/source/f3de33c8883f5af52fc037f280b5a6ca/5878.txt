I don't think we should release it until we have briefed Bruce and Erskine
on the results.  I need some time to really digest it as well. Could you
give me    a
          copy of what you have when it's incorporated into your copy?
Maybe the three of us should sit down and discuss it then.  I don't think
we can hand htis out to Indian country before the interagency council,
chaired by Babbitt, which originated this whole thing, sees it. That
meeting is in the next week or so.
