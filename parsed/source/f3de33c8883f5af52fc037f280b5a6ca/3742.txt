  Employment Taxes
  Governors will Push Congress to Enact
  Tax Exemptions for Workfare Employers
  LAS VEGAS, Nev.--The nation's governors said July 30 they hope to use
  their united influence to urge Congress to append the budget deal to
  include exemptions for employers who hire workfare participants.
  "We're going to continue to work [with Congress] on part of it, the only
  part that still gives us a problem,"  said Nevada Gov. Bob Miller (D), who
  stepped down as chair of the National Governors' Association.
  "Most of use have no objection to the minimum wage part of it, and that's
  a big part, " Miller said. He passed the chairmanship of the organization
  on to Ohio Gov. George Voinovich (R).
  The governors do have a problem with employers who hire workfare
  recipients being subject to "some of the onerous aspects"   of the Fair
  Labor Standards Act, Voinovich said.


During the 89th annual meeting of the NGA in Las Vegas, the governors
reached a consensus on their own differences on workfare exemptions.
Delaware Gov. Thomas R. Carper (D), new vice chair of the organization,
said he regretted that the governors forged an agreement too late in the
budget negotiation process to have an impact.
He said governors hope to wield their influence in the remaining days of
the current congressional session.

 Workfare Recipients Not Like Regular Employees

Carper spelled out the governors consensus, saying the states agreed
workfare recipients should be paid the minimum wage. However, he said,
governors felt workfare recipients should not be treated as regular
employees with respect to Federal Insurance Contributions Act withholding
taxes, unemployment taxes.
Also, he said, "they should not be eligible for the earned income tax
credit." Coupled with the minimum wage, extending the earned income tax
credit to workfare workers would mean employers would be paying them as
much as $7 an hour, Carper said.
Carper told BNA a consensus is emerging among the governors on how
workfare recipients meet the minimum requirement of 25 hours worked a week
in the second year of work and 30 hours of work in the third year.
The governors also discussed whether job search time and vocational
training could be credited toward the minimum, Carper said.
Carper said Bruce Reid, adviser to President Bill Clinton on domestic
policy, was hopeful .the states could append the governor's concerns in the
appropriations bill.
voinovich said the White House and Congress are aware of the governors'
concerns and' 'will ·be responsive to our suggestions on how to fix the
problem.' ,
"Perhaps some of the members of Congress don't realize how important this
is to us, ' , ·he said. "We are real concerned about truly reforming our
welfare system from a way of· life to a way of work."
Miller stressed that governors' concerns about FLSA exemptions should be
weighed against the fact that states came out well in the budget agreement.
"This agreement contains an enormous amount of suggestions of the
governors, " he said. He noted that governors had unusual access to the
process, a few of them having met with the budget conferees last week in
Washington, D.C.
"The deal is overwhelmingly positive for the states," he added.
