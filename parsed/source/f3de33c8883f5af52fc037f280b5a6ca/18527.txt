    As I understand it. we were given two assignments -- (1) the one pager you
    have for communications and (2) paragraphs for NEC/DPC.  Attached are our
    paragraphs which, as you will note, are basically the same as our one
    pager with a little more detail. The only major difference is that in
    this version of the "21st century research fund", we discuss both NSF and
    NIH rather than just NIH.  It may make sense to modify the other one to
    include NSF. What do you think?

Passing Comprehensive Bipartisan Tobacco Legislation That Reduces Teen Smoking and
Changes the Way Tobacco Companies Do Business.

Every day 3,000 young people start smoking and 1,000 of them will die prematurely from a
tobacco-related disease. Moreover, 90 percent of adults who smoke began before the age of 18.
The President called on Congress to pass comprehensive national bipartisan legislation that
includes five key principles: (1) it must mandate the development of a comprehensive plan to
reduce teen smoking, including raising the cost of cigarettes by $1.50 per pack if that is what it
takes to stop children from smoking; (2) it must affirm the FDA's full authority to regulate
tobacco products; (3) it must include measures to hold tobacco companies accountable,
especially for marketing products to children; (4) it must include concrete measures to improve
public health, from investing in research to reducing second hand smoke to expanding smoking
cessation; and (5) it must protect the financial well-being of tobacco farmers and their
communities from the loss of income caused by our efforts to reduce smoking.

Protecting Patients Through a Consumer Bill of Rights.

A recent Kaiser report studying rapid changes in health care system found that 60 percent of
Americans believe that managed care plans have made it harder for the sick to see specialists.
It also reported that over three-fifths say they are very or somewhat worried that their health plan
would be more concerned about saving money than about the best treatment for them if they
were sick. The President called on Congress to pass Federally enforceable consumer health care
protections before it adjourns this fall. This health care bill of rights should contain a range of
protections, including guaranteed access to needed health care specialists to ensure that patients
are provided appropriate high quality care, access to emergency room services when and
where the need arises, an assurance that medical records are confidential, and access to a
meaningful internal and external appeals process for consumers to resolve their differences
with their health plans and health care providers. The nation's health care system has
changed dramatically, as more than 100 million Americans are now in managed care plans.
This legislation will ensure that whether Americans have traditional health insurance or
managed care, that they are assured quality care.

Providing New Options for Americans Ages 55 to 65 to Access Health Insurance, Including
Buying Into Medicare.

There are currently three million Americans ages 55 to 65 that are uninsured. This number will
likely increase as the number of Americans in this age groups is expected to rise by more than 50
percent [from the current 21 million to 35 million by 2010]. Americans ages 55 to 65 are one
of the most difficult-to-insure populations: they have less access to and a greater risk oflosing
employer-based health insurance; and they are twice as likely to have health problems. Some
lose their employer-based health insurance when their spouse (frequently the husband) becomes
eligible for Medicare. Many lose their coverage because they lose their jobs due to company
downsizing or plant closings. Still others lose insurance when their retiree health coverage is
dropped unexpectedly. The President's proposal gives this vulnerable population three new
options to access health insurance by: (1) allowing Americans ages 62 to 65 to buy into

                                                                            Automated Records Management System
                                                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion

    Medicare, through a premium that ensures that this policy is self-financed; (2) providing
    vulnerable displaced workers 55 and over access to Medicare by offering those who have
    involuntarily lost their jobs and their health care coverage a similar Medicare buy-in option; and
    (3) giving Americans 55 and over who have lost their retiree benefits after they retire access to
    their former employers' health insurance_

    Creating a Historic "21st Century Research Fund" With an Unprecedented 50 Percent
    Increase in Biomedical and Scientific Research.

    Scientists are on the cusp of important new breakthroughs in biomedical research which could
    revolutionize the way medical experts understand, treat, and prevent some of our most
    devastating diseases. New imaging technologies are giving new insights into the structure of
    disease and revolutionary progress in genetics are charting new ways to conquer diseases, such as
    cancer, Alzheimer's, AIDS, and brain tumors. In addition, this fund could lead to new
    missions to explore the solar system, cleaner sources of energy, and the Next Generation
    Internet. New investments also strengthen America's scientific and technological
    leadership, boost productivity, and create high-wage jobs. The President proposed a
    historic initiative that contains unprecedented investments in biomedical and scientific
    research. In FY 1999 alone, the "21st Century Research Fund" would provide the largest
    increases in history for the National Institutes of Health ($1.15 billion) and the National
    Science Foundation ($344 million). In addition to a historic up-front investment, for the first
    time, the President is proposing a sustained investment in biomedical and scientific research with
    a 32 percent increase by 2003. This includes a 50 percent increase in the NIH in the next five
    years, with over $20 billion dedicated to biomedical research the NIH in 2003.

    Eliminating Discrimination in Genetic Information in Health Insurance and Employment.

    While advances in genetic research hold much promise for disease prevention and
    treatment, genetic information can also be used to discriminate against or stigmatize
    individuals. Nearly one-fifth of the individuals who have a family member with a genetic
    disorder reported they had been discriminated against, including discrimination by
    employers and insurers. To ensure that new advances in genetics are used to improve
    health rather than to discriminate, the President has called for legislation that ensures that
    genetic screening is not used by health insurers and employers to discriminate against
    Americans.
