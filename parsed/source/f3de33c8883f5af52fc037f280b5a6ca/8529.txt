TEXT:
FYI.   I just heard from the Labor Department that Sen. Graham's office
called to say that he plans to introduce his H2A legislation this week
 (Friday).  According to Earl (from DOL) this bill should look like the
prior version -- creation of a registry of H2A workers; funded through H2A
fees (equal to what the employer would have to pay under FICA if hired a
U.S. worker); eliminates the adverse effect wage rate and instead requires
payment of 105% of the prevailing rate (based on a regional survey by
DOL).   It is still not clear whether this kind of legislation has legs,
though Earl remains skeptical. We hope to see a copy of this soon.
