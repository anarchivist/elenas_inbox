RE:            Background on H-IB Visa Refonn


        Though the Administration has endorsed a set of principles that should guide any
legislation that proposes to increase the cap on the number ofH-IB visas, we need to evaluate
key components of possible legislative proposals and decide our priorities. This memo outlines
aspects ofthe existing legislative proposals on which we need to focus.

Background

       The H-IB visa program was designed to allow for the temporary admission of foreign
"specialty workers" for employment in the United States. In its current fonn, it allows the
admission of up to 65,000 non-immigrant workers each year. Each visa lasts for three years, and
is renewable for another three. The program was designed to meet the short-tenn employment
needs of employers seeking highly-skilled workers. Currently, H-IB visas are issued on a first
come, first served basis.

        Under current law, before obtaining a temporary foreign worker under the H-IB program,
employers must attest that: (I) they will pay the prevailing wage; (2) notification has been
provided to their employees and the representing union; (3) there is no strike or lock-out; and (4)
the employment ofH-IB non-immigrants will not adversely affect the working conditions of
workers similarly employed. The Labor Department only has the authority to review these
attestations for completeness and obvious inaccuracies.

        Since 1993, the Administration has sought refonns to the H-IB visa program, including
requiring employers to attest that they have and are taking timely and significant steps to recruit
and retain U.S. workers in the jobs in which they seek to employ H-IB non-immigrants;
prohibiting employers from laying-off a U.S. worker to replace them with a temporary foreign
worker; and reducing the authorized length of stay from six to three years to better reflect the
temporary nature of the presumed employment need. INS and Labor agree that these reforms
would target H-IB usage to employers experiencing genuine skill shortages, thus relieving the
pressure on the cap.

       Industry is strongly opposed to these refonns. In general, they assert (1) that DOL's
occupational classifications do not reflect the breadth of occupations within the industry, thus
causing a recruitment or no lay-off provision to be unworkable; (2) that they do not want the
government to second-guess their hiring and firing decisions; and (3) that these refonns would be


                                                 1
                                                                Hex·Dump CQnversion

equivalent to the labor certification requirement that exists in the permanent visa program, and
thus would be slow and ineffective. Organized labor, however, supports these reforms, arguing
they are needed to protect U.S. workers.

Issues to Consider

1.     What does "recruit and retain" mean?

        According to the Department of Labor, the Administration has never defined what
precisely would satisfy the "recruit and retain" requirement. Industry opposes this provision, in
part, because it is not clear exactly what would be required.

         The Kennedy-Feinstein legislation includes a provision that would require employers to
attest to having taken timely, significant, and effective steps to recruit and retain U.S. workers
prior to obtaining an H-IB foreign worker, with compliance measured by comparison to
"industry-wide standards." However, it is unclear how this would work. For example, how
would these "industry-wide standards" for recruitment and retention be identified? Also, should
we endorse a process that simply identifies standards that reflect what industry is currently doing
(therefore codifying the status quo) or should we ask industry to do more to recruit U.S. workers
before being able to hire a temporary foreign worker? If we want them to do more, how do we
define what we want them to do?

        The "recruit and retain" provision of the now-defunct foreign nurses program (H-IA) set
out several steps that an employer could take to recruit and retain U.S. workers, and then defined
satisfaction of the statutory requirement as compliance with some subset of those. This method,
though effective in the context of a single industry (where it is easier to define the universe of
possibly acceptable recruitment methods), could prove unworkable for the H-IB program, given
the diversity of industries that use it.

2.     Occupational classification

        Industry objects to a proposal that would permit the Department of Labor to use "recruit
and retain" or "no lay-off' provisions to limit industry's employment choices based on
occupational classifications established by the DOL. At the same time, industry has argued for
broader occupational categories for the prevailing wage calculation since more general categories
usually result in lower wage estimates.

        Labor has agreed that it would not make sense to require employers to use existing
occupational classifications to establish compliance with a "recruit and retain" or "no lay-off'
provision. An alternative is to consider defining who needs to be recruited or who cannot be
laid-off based on skill-level (e.g., the ability to program in java) or on the amount of additional
training an incumbent or other U.S. worker would need to perform the job (e.g., someone who
could program in java with six weeks training), rather than on occupational classification (e.g.,


                                                  2
                                                                   Hex·Dump Conversion
3.     Practicability of a no lay-off provision

       Industry also argues that a no lay-off provision would be difficult to administer, given the
decentralized nature of employment decisions in large companies. They ask, for example,
whether a firm that lays-off a worker in Chicago, but wants to hire one in Houston, would be
considered to have "laid-off' the Chicago worker, and thus unable to hire an H-IB worker in
Houston.

       The Abraham bill includes a no lay-off provision that would not achieve our goals. His
proposal would prohibit an employer from employing a temporary foreign worker "at the specific
place of employment and in the specific employment opportunity from which a U.S. worker with
substantially equivalent qualifications and experience in the specific employment opportunity has
been laid-off." This language makes every employee unique, and thus is likely unenforceable.

4.     The role of job contractors

        In 1995, the Administration endorsed a proposal that job contractors seeking to use the
H-IB program would be precluded from placing H-IB workers at sites of customers that had not
also attested to complying with the H -1 B criteria. Given that the top ten users of the H-1 B
program are job contractors, we may want to consider this as part of our overall reform package.

5.     Reduced maximum stay from six to three years

        Under current law, the H-IB visa lasts for six years (it is a three year visa that is almost
always renewed for an additional three years). The proposed reform would eliminate the
possibility of renewal, thus creating a maximum stay of three years. In both 1993 and 1995, the
Administration strongly supported this limitation as better comporting with the "temporary"
nature of the presumed employment need.

        However, the Administration proposed this reform in the context of not increasing the cap
on the annual number ofH-IB visas. It would be somewhat incongruous to both increase the
annual cap and effectively limit by half the number ofH-IB visa holders in the country at any
one time. Thus, if we were to endorse raising the annual cap (even temporarily), this increase
should not be coupled with a proposed reform to limit the annual number of visas.

6.     Enhanced enforcement

        In addition to the above reforms to the H -1 B program, the Labor Department has
proposed that they be given greater authority and resources to ensure that employers comply with
the standards for hiring temporary foreign workers under the H-1 B program (either current or
proposed).


                                                  3
                                                               Hex-Dump Conv(;t"sion


        Under current law, it is not clear that the Department of Labor has independent authority
(i.e., where there has been no complaint) to initiate an investigation of an employer suspected of
not substantively complying with the labor market attestations. The Kennedy-Feinstein proposal
would give the Secretary independent authority to investigate (upon a finding of probable cause),
subpoena authority, an ability to conduct random audits, and would increase the penalties for
employers found in violation (from $5,000 to $10,000). These changes seem appropriate to
ensure compliance with the objectives of the H-1B program. However, though each element of
this enhanced enforcement is important, the subpoena authority and the ability to investigate
without a complaint are the most critical.

       The Abraham bill increases the penalty for willful violations of the H -1 B program, but
eliminates penalties for less than willful violations. In addition, the bill allows DOL to conduct
random inspections of willful violators (for 5 years), but does not authorize additional money to
do so. Also, under Abraham's bill, an employer could only be investigated for having violated
the "no lay-off' provision if the employer were already being investigated for another violation.
These reforms would weaken, rather than strengthen, the Secretary's enforcement authority.

7.     Prevailing wage

        Under current law, an employer must pay each H-1B non-immigrant the "higher of
prevailing or actual wage paid to similarly-employed U.S. workers." The Kennedy-Feinstein
bill would modify this requirement to include benefits and all other compensation when
calculating the wage standard. However, according to the Department of Labor, they would not
be able to calculate a reliable prevailing wage that includes non-wage compensation.

       While the Abraham bill uses the current definition of wages, it would allow employers to
use any published survey "which shall be considered correct and valid if the survey was
conducted in accordance with generally accepted industry standards and the employer has
maintained a copy of the survey information" to determine the prevailing wage. The
requirement would permit the use of outdated wage data and would give DOL little control over
the quality of the surveys used to determine the prevailing wage.

       In the past, DOL has advocated for a prevailing wage calculation based on the applicable
prevailing wage plus the same benefits and additional compensation provided to similarly
employed workers of the employer.

8.     An application fee

        Currently, employers only pay a small processing fee when filing for an H -1 B visa. The
Kennedy-Feinstein bill proposes a fee of $250 per H-1B visa application. An application fee is
a straightforward way to require employers who use the H-1B program to directly contribute to
more training for U.S. workers and to generate additional funds for enforcement. However, an


                                                4


                                                                   Automated Records Mam:gement Sy~tcm
                                                                           Hex-Dump Convf:::sion

        application fee will likely be perceived as a tax, and thus could be unpopular.

             If we decide to push for the establishment of an application fee, we may want to increase
     it to $500. First, the higher fee will generate more money for training. Second, as a tactical
     matter, if we begin negotiations at $500 we may end up at $250 (rather than beginning at $250
     and ending up at $0). We should be careful, however, not to endorse a fee that would create
     such a disincentive to participation that it would effectively prevent the United States from
    ,meeting its treaty obligations (under the GATS) to permit 65,000 persons to enter annually under
     the H-IB program.

        9.       Training

                In order to meet the short-term and long-term needs of industry, training should be geared
        towards incumbent workers as well as those who have yet to enter the workforce. In addition,
        there is widespread support among the agencies for programs that encourage employers to work
        together with educators or training providers.

                 The Kennedy-Feinstein bill contains a proposal for the creation of "Regional Skills
        Alliances." Money generated through application fees would be used to set up these Alliances
        that would bring together employers, organized labor, U.S. workers and educational institutions
        to focus on building the skills of U.S. workers. Another proposal is to allocate additional funds
        to the National Science Foundation's (NSF) Advanced Technological Education (ATE) program.
         ATE is an educational institution-based program that is designed to foster partnerships between
        two- and four-year colleges, secondary schools, government, and industry to improve educational
        programs through curriculum and teacher/faculty development. These programs, in
        combination, could address the training of both new and incumbent workers.

                There remains the question of whether the Administration should push for a provison that
        provides training money directly to individuals either through scholarships or loans. The
        Kennedy-Feinstein bill includes the creation of a new short-term student loan program. The
        Abraham bill adds funds to an existing scholarship program. According to OMB, the
        Department of Education, and others, there currently exists a variety of both loan and grant
        programs that are available to most workers. In addition, the Lifelong Learning Tax Credit is
        available to enable incumbent workers to obtain additional training. Thus, it may not make
        sense to spend any money generated by an H -1 B application fee to augment an already adequate
        pool of money for loans or scholarships.

        10.      Academic community concerns

                Some members of the academic community have expressed concern that a "recruit and
        retain" or "no lay-off' provision would unfairly limit their ability to hire H-IB non-immigrants
        as part of (temporary) research grant programs.
