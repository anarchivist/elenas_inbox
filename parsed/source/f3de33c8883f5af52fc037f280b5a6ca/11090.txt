Attached is the Secretary's entire testimony.


SUPPORTING STUDENTS WITH LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENCY

        Students with limited English proficiency (LEP) are the fastest
growing population served by the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.
According to State educational agency data, the number of LEP students
grew 24 percent between 1992 and 1995.

        Many of the fastest growing LEP student populations are in States
and communities that have little prior experience in serving these
students.  For example, ten States (Alabama, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana,
Nebraska, Nevada, North Carolina, Oregon, Tennessee, and Virginia)
reported increases in the numbers of LEP students greater than 46 percent
between 1992 and 1995.

        Our clear goal is that LEP students should be able to speak and
read English after three consecutive years in our schools.  We are equally
committed to ensuring that LEP students reach challenging academic
standards in all content areas.

        Our reauthorization proposal for the Title VII bilingual education
provisions seeks to achieve these two very important goals by emphasizing
the same two key strategies we are pursuing throughout the ESEA:
improving teacher quality and strengthening accountability.

            To increase teacher quality, for example, all institutions of
higher education applying for Title VII grants, would be required to show
that their teacher education programs include preparation for all teachers
serving LEP students.

        To strengthen accountability and ensure that LEP' students reach our
three-year goal of learning English, both Title VII grantees and Title I
schools would be required to annually assess LEP student progress in
attaining English proficiency.

        LEP   students who have been in a U.S. school for less than three
years would   continue to be included in the Title I assessment system, but
after three   years reading assessments would be conducted in English.
Schools and   districts will be held accountable, as part of the larger ESEA


accountability prov~s~ons, for their progress in ensuring that LEP
students reach the three-year English language proficiency goal.

        I also believe that AmericaO,s children need to become much more
fluent in other languages. We are very far behind other nations when it
comes to giving our students a mastery of other languages. There are
teenagers in Europe who can easily speak three languages.  I am certain we
can do a much better job at giving our students at least a fluency in
English and one foreign language. There are currently over 200 two-way
bilingual education programs that teach English and a foreign language and
allow all students to truly develop proficiency in two languages.

RIZATIOND
 heading 2 DXXXD#XP\       P6QXP#D
Good morning Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee.

I appreciate this opportunity to present the Administrations views on the upcom
ing reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA). The
Administration is working on a detailed reauthorization proposal that we plan t
o submit for your consideration next month. The Department will also soon subm
it to Congress several reports evaluating the implementation and impact of Titl
e I, other ESEA programs, and Goals 2000.   Today I will provide an overview of
 our reauthorization efforts, as well as some of our specific recommendations.
 If there is one overriding principle that defines what we hope to accomplish,
it is to end the tyranny of low expectations.

StyleO#XX2PQXP##XP\      P6QXP#Let me begin by urging the Committee to develop a si
ngle, comprehensive bill reauthorizing the Elementary and Secondary Education A
ct. Some have suggested a titlebytitle approach that could lead to a dozen or
so separate bills. This concerns me, because we have worked very hard with the
 Congress in recent years to develop a comprehensive approach to Federal suppor
t for education reform.  If our efforts are to be successful, it is very import


ant for all the pieces to fit together, complementing and reinforcing each othe
r, and working together to help States, school districts, and schools to make t
he changes needed to raise achievement for all students. This is why the Admin
istration is developing a single, integrated reauthorization proposal, and I ho
pe you will do the same.
StyleO
StyleO#XX2PQXP##XP\       P6QXP#I also want to point out that with the nearly simult
aneous reauthorization of the Departments Office of Educational Research and 1m
provement, we have a unique opportunity to align our research agenda with the p
ractices and priorities in elementary and secondary education. We should make
every effort to develop researchbased solutions to the many challenges we face
in elementary and secondary education, and to get the best information on what
works into the hands of parents, teachers, principals, and superintendents acro
ss the Nation.
StyleO
         heading 9#XP\    P6QXp##A\       P6QP#DBACKGROUND AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS
         heading 9 #XP\   P6QXP#O
This is, of course, this Administrations second opportunity to work with Congre
ss on improving the ESEA.   The 1994 reauthorization"the Improving Americas Scho
ols Act"took direct aim at transforming a Federal role that for too long had co
ndoned low expectations and low standards for poor children. Along with the Go
als 2000: Educate America Act, the 1994 reauthorization reflected a bipartisan
effort to raise expectations for all children by helping States and school dist
ricts to set high standards and establish goals for improving student achieveme
nt.   The 1994 Act included provisions to improve teaching and learning, increas
e flexibility and accountability for States and local school districts, strengt
hen parent and community involvement, and target resources to the highest pover
ty schools and communities.

There is strong evidence that these changes, particularly the emphasis on high
standards, have helped States and school districts carry out the hard work of r
eal education reform. States that led the way in adopting standardsbased refor
ms"like Kentucky, Maryland, North Carolina, Oregon, and Texas"found new support
 from Federal programs that helped them to raise reading and math achievement.
 In other States, the new ESEA and Goals 2000 encouraged and supported improvem
ents in teaching and learning tied to high standards.  For example, in a very p
ositive report on Goals 2000 by the General Accounting Office (GAO), we were mo
st pleased that State officials described Goals 2000 as a significant factor i
n promoting their education reform efforts and a catalyst for change.

Title# k\        P6Q P#O#A\      P6QP#Signs of Progress
#XP\      P6QXP#
OPartly as a result of changes at the Federal level and our new partnerships wi
th the States, 48 States have developed statelevel standards and two States hav
e pushed for standards at the local level. More importantly, there are promisi
ng signs of real progress toward meeting these higher standards. The National
Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) , for example, has shown significant i
ncreases in the percentages of 4th grade students scoring at both the basic and
 proficient achievement levels in mathematics, particularly among students in h
ighpoverty schools. The National Education Goals Panel reported that between 1
990 and 1996, 27 States significantly increased the percentage of 8th graders s
coring at either the proficient or the advanced level on the NAEP math test.

TitleTomorrow the National Center for Education Statistics will release its nat
ional report card on reading, and I understand we will see some improvement. 0
ver the past few years a strong, bipartisan consensus has emerged on the import
ance of helping all children to master reading as the key prerequisite for all
further learning. Title I provides substantial resources to help States and sc
hool districts improve reading instruction, and last year, Congress on a bipart
isan basis passed the Reading Excellence Act to strengthen State and local effo


rts to improve reading in the early grades. We also now have some 20,000 Colle
ge WorkStudy students serving as reading tutors.

          P6QP#D Leading Edge StatesD
         P6QXP#
Turning from the national to the State level, individual States have made notab
Ie progress in a very short period of time.  Texas, for example, increased the
percentage of its 4th grade students scoring at the proficient or advanced leve
Is on the NAEP math test from 15 percent in 1992 to 25 percent in 1996. North
Carolina more than doubled the percentage of its 8th graders reaching the same
standard in mathematics achievement, from 9 percent in 1990 to 20 percent in 19
96.

The National Education Goals Panel issued a report authored by the Rand Corpora
tion that examined the North Carolina and Texas experience. The report found t
hat the most plausible explanation for the test score gains was an organizati
onal environment and incentive structure based on an aligned system of standar
ds, curriculum, and assessments; holding schools accountable for improvement by
 all students; and critical support from business. As I will explain shortly,
we will be trying in this reauthorization to speed up reform by encouraging oth
er States to follow the example of North Carolina and Texas.

         P6QP#DNew Flexibility at the Federal LevelD
         P6QXP#
The 1994 reauthorization also brought real change to the way we do business at
the Department of Education. We made a very determined effort to give States a
nd school districts greater flexibility to make innovations that help all stude
nts reach high standards. Our regulatory reform effort, for example, systemati
cally examined every Department regulation and set very specific criteria for r
egulating only wh~n absolutely necessary. The Office of Management and Budget
and other Federal agencies have since adopted this approach as a model.  Under
our new regulatory guidelines, only five of the programs included in the 1994 E
SEA reauthorization truly required regulations; thus we eliminated a full twoth
irds of regulations previously covering elementary and secondary education.

Another major improvement was the adoption of a single, consolidated State appl
ication for the majority of ESEA programs. Moreover, States submit their singl
e plan just once during the life of the authorization cycle, with brief yearly
updates to ensure accountability. Not surprisingly, States reported in fiscal
year 1996 that the consolidated application slashed paperwork requirements by 8
5 percent.  I should add that the consolidated applications also encourage a co
mprehensive approach to planning for the use of Federal funds.

The Department also has vigorously implemented waiver provisions that were incl
uded in the 1994 reauthorization, which permit States, school districts, and sc
hools to request waivers of statutory and regulatory requirements that present
an obstacle to innovative reform efforts. We set up a Waiver Hot Line and prov
ided comprehensive waiver guidance at our site on the World Wide Web.

Since the reauthorization of ESEA in 1994, the Department has received 648 requ
ests for waivers from States and local districts and granted a total of 357 wai
verso Overall, the Department has approved 55 percent and disapproved 8 perc en
t of all waivers requested.  The waiver authority has also demonstrated that ES
EA is very flexible even without the authority.  In fact, 28 percent of waiver
applications were withdrawn largely because districts learned that they had suf
ficient latitude or flexibility under existing law to proceed without a waiver.


         P6QP#DEDFLEXD
         P6QXP#


Another approach to flexibility is the EDFLEX demonstration, which allows the D
epartment to give State level officials authority to approve waivers of certain
Federal statutory and regulatory requirements that stand in the way of effectiv
e reform at the local level. Under this pilot project, 12 States have been aut
horized to participate.

We are proposing to expand ED FLEX to allow all eligible States to participate.
 I believe such an expansion should be considered in the context of reauthoriza
tion, our emphasis on accountability for results, and other programmatic issues
   ED FLEX can be an important tool for accelerating the pace of real reform in
our schools, but it must be done thoughtfully.   In particular, we must be sensi
tive to civil rights concerns and be absolutely sure that all protections curre
ntly in law are maintained.

Body Text#&J\     P6Q&P##XP\      P6QXP#One final issue I want to touch on is the Dep
rtments performance in getting Federal education dollars to the local level whe
re they can do the most good. There have been a number of     dollars to the cIa
ssroom proposals over the past two years based on the assumption that the Depar
tment of Education retains a significant portion of Federal elementary and seco
ndary app,ropriations to pay for administrative costs.

The truth is that over 95percent of all the dollars appropriated by Congress fo
r Federal elementary and secondary programs already goes to local school distri
cts.  If that number sounds familiar, it is because some of those proposals I m
entioned promise to send 95 percent of Federal dollars to the classroom.

I recognize that some may argue about whether the local level is the same as
the classroom. My view is that once the funds reach the local level, it is up t
o local elected school boards to decide how best to spend them to achieve the p
urposes of the programs enacted by the Congress. We in Washington should not a
ttempt to bypass local school boards and deny them their lawful responsibility
to determine how to meet the educational needs of their students.

I believe that these accomplishments"widespread adoption of standards, promisin
g achievement gains nationally and even more improvement in leading edge State
s, along with new flexibility for States and school districts"show that we were
 on the right track in 1994. The evidence demonstrates a clear connection betw
een raising standards and raising student achievement. The record also shows,
however, that many States and districts are still phasing in the 1994 reforms.
 Taken as a whole, this experience provides a compelling argument for the Admin
istration and Congress to keep working together to help States and school distr
icts get high standards into the classroom, and to push for improved incentives
 and strengthened accountability mechanisms to ensure that these reforms take h
old.

#A\      P6QP#DTHE NEXT STEP:  TEACHER QUALITY AND
 HIGH STANDARDS IN THE CLASSROOMD#XP\    P6QXP#

I want to begin by laying out a broader context for our ESEA reauthorization pr
oposals.  In 1994, we broke sharply with the past and made a significant policy
 shift in putting an end to the practice of giving students a watered down curr
iculum.  I strongly believe that the tyranny of low expectations"and it is tyra
nny"nas been one of the great flaws of American education. We vigorously oppos
e the idea of   dumbing down American education.  Instead of dumbing down, we
want to achieve up.

To support this effort we have developed a comprehensive threepart strategy of
  (l)targeting investments to disadvantaged children, with particular attention
to the .early years of schooling;  (2) improving teacher quality, and (3) real ac
countability. All these pieces need to fit together if we want to raise achiev


ement levels.

First, our investments in the Reading Excellence Act, ClassSize Reduction, educ
ation technology, and afterschool programs"to name just a few"are all part of 0
ur effort to get teachers and principals the resources they need to raise achie
vement.  We have put a real emphasis on the early years of schooling because re
search and common sense tells you that if a young person can master the basic
s early on they get off to a much better start in their education. We want to
improve academic achievement for all students, with a special emphasis on closi
ng the gap upward between poor and minority students and other students. This
is why, for example, we are such strong supporters of reducing class size in th
e early grades. Research from the Tennessee STAR study demonstrated that reduc
ing class sizes in the early grades led to higher achievement for all students,
 with poor and minority students showing the greatest gains.

Second, we think it is absolutely essential to put a highly qualified, dedicate
d teacher in every classroom in America.  John Stanford, the inspiring former s
uperintendent from Seattle who recently passed away, had this marvelous slogan
that summed up his philosophy:   the victory is in the classroom.   If we are go
ing to achieve many more victories in the classroom we simply have to raise tea
cher quality and get many more certified teachers into our TitleI schools. Thi
s is why we asked the Congress to fund a strong teacher quality initiative in r
eauthorizing the Higher Education Act last year. Our intent here is to make hi
gh standards part of every teachers daily lesson plans.   I will discuss this pa
rt of our proposal in greater detail later on in my testimony.
o
#A\       P6QP#Accountability
#XP\      P6QXP#D
Improved accountability is the third part of our broad strategy of improvement.
  We believe that effective accountability measures"what business leaders call
quality control measures"can make sure that our new investments are used wisel
y and actually produce the desired results.   It seems to me that if a school di
strict using Federal dollars doesnt act to raise achievement levels and squande
rs taxpayers dollars the only responsible thing to do is to begin withholding t
he money. Here it is important to recognize that we are not talking about more
 regulations. We want better results. There is both a moral and a fiscal dime
nsion to being more accountable.    We cannot afford to lose the talents of one
child, and we cannot waste the substantial resources entrusted to us by America
n taxpayers.
 Body Text StyleO#XX2PQXP##XP\    P6QXP#
StyleOWe recognize that a complete accountability system should be multidimensi
onal and include high expectations and accountability for everyone in the syste
m. All of us are responsible for ensuring that all students reach high standar
ds.   The accountability measures in our reauthorization proposal are designed t
o (l)help school districts and states provide students with a high quality educ
ation, (2)focus on continuous improvement; and (3)hold students, teachers, prin
cipals, schools, and districts to high standards.

It is important to note that our proposed accountability measures reinforce and
 build on similar provisions approved in 1994, and on what many States are alre
ady doing.  For example, the underlying structure of the Title I accountability
 provisions is sound, and States like North Carolina and Texas are emphasizing
continuous improvement and holding schools and principals accountable for resul
ts.  Many States, however, have not fully implemented the TitleI provisions and
 have moved only tentatively to make other changes based on high standards and
accountability. We are proposing several measures to speed up the process.

         P6QP#DMeeting State StandardsD
         P6QXP#
First, we would retain the current law requirement that States establish conten


t and performance standards and assessments aligned to the standards by the 200
02001 school year.  States must also define adequate yearly progress for Title
I schools and local school districts in a manner that would result in continuou
s and substantial progress toward meeting State standards within a reasonable t
ime frame.
D
#A\       P6QP*Turning Around the Lowest Performing SchoolsD
#XP\      P6QXP#
Second, States would be encouraged to take immediate corrective action to turn
around the lowest performing schools.   Currently, there are over 6,500 schools
and 1,300 school districts designated under Title I as in need of improvement.
 These schools and districts were placed in school improvement status after mak
ing little or no improvement over a period of three years.   Many of these schoo
Is are still showing no improvement despite receiving additional support. We a
re saying that enough time has passed with our children in lowperforming school
s"it is time to take action now.

States should quickly identify the lowest performing schools and provide additi
onal support and assistance.  If any school continues to show no improvement, S
tates should take bold action such as reconstituting the school or closing the
school down entirely and reopening it as a fresh new school.  The Department's
2000 budget request includes a $200million setaside to help jumpstart this proc
ess of State and district intervention in the lowest performing schools.

         P6QP#DAnnual Report CardsD
         P6QXP#
Third, we would require annual report cards at the State, district, and school
levels as a condition of receiving ESEA funds.   The report cards should provide
 information on improvement over time or the lack thereof.   They should include
 information on student achievement and other indicators, such as teacher quali
ty, class size, school safety, attendance, and graduation requirements.   The re
port cards should be easily understood by and widely distributed to parents and
 the public.   While 36 States already require report cards, most parents and th
e majority of teachers say that they have never seen the report cards.   Our pro
posal is intended to give parents a tool they can use to join the debate over b
ringing high standards into the classroom, to advocate on behalf of their child
ren and their childrens schools, and to work with teachers and principals to ma
ke improvements.
StyleO#XX2PQXP##xP\       P6QXP#
StyleOI assure you, if parents find out that their children are going to an unr
uly or unsafe school there will be standingroom only at the next school board m
eeting and that is a very good thing.   If parents discover that test scores are
 down at their school but up at a nearby school they will start asking question
s and spark reform.   In short, a good, honest report card gives parents a real
accountability tool that allows them to make a difference in the education of t
heir children.

         P6QP#DEnding Social PromotionD
         P6QXP#
Fourth, all States receiving ESEA funds should end the practice of social promo
tion.  I want to be clear that we are against both a policy of social promotion
 and a policy of retaining students in grade.  We are for a policy of preparing
 children to achieve to high standards.  That is why we have pushed so hard for
 programs like Class Size Reduction, the Reading Excellence Act, and 21st Centu
ry Community Learning Centers afterschool initiative, which invest in the early
 years and help to minimize the number of children at risk of retention in grad
e.

The Presidents call for an end to social promotion is designed to tell students
 that performance counts, and to encourage districts and schools to take aggre


ssive action to help all students meet promotion standards on time.  States sho
uld target their efforts at key transition points, such as the 4th, 8th, and 10
th grades.  Strategies to end social promotion include early identification and
 intervention for students who need additional help, extended learning time for
 students who need extra help, and intensive intervention designed to prevent a
 student from having to repeat an entire grade.

#XP\     P6QXP#
Fifth, we would encourage States and school districts to do more to ensure teac
her quality.  Less than two weeks ago, we released our first biannual report on
 Teacher Quality.   In releasing this first biannual report, we are making a sta
tement that we are going to keep coming back to the issue of teacher quality ag
ain and again. This reports tells us that less than half of Americas teachers f
eel very well prepared to teach in the modern classroom. Teachers cited four a
reas of concern: using technology, teaching children from diverse cultures, te
aching children with disabilities, and helping LEP students.   This study really
 is a cry for help and we need to respondO.O

I know the Members of this committee share our concern about teacher quality, a
nd we want to work with you to address that concern. Research shows that quali
fied teachers are the most important inschool factor in improving student achie
vement.  Far too many classrooms are led by teachers teaching out of field, in
dividuals granted emergency certificates who do not meet State certification s
tandards, and even teacher aides with no more than a high school diploma. All
of these individuals are trying to do their best"and many are excellent aides"b
ut as long as they do not have the skills of a proven teacher we are short chang
ing our students.

Highpoverty urban schools are most likely to suffer from unqualified teachers.
 In Los Angeles, for example, 60 percent of the new teachers hired last year di
d not have a teaching license. Even when urban districts succeed in hiring qua
lified teachers, attrition rates during the first five years often reach 50 per
cent.  Partly as a result of difficulties in recruiting and retaining teachers,
 Title I schools are hiring teacher aides at twice the rate of certified teache
rs, and an increasing number of aides are providing direct instruction without
a teachers supervision.

Plain Text#d6X@DQ@##XP\ P6QXP#Our ESEA reauthorization proposal would begin to
 address these problems by encouraging States to adopt challenging, competency
examinations for all new teachers that would include assessments of subjectmatt
er knowledge.  We would also work to phase out the use of teacher aides as inst
ructors in Title I schools and urge States to make significant progress in redu
cing both the number of teachers with emergency certificates and the number of
teachers teaching subjects for which they lack adequate preparation. Our propo
sal also would encourage States and school districts to build career ladders to
 encourage paraprofessional to become certified teachers.

The issue of improving teacher quality is also of great importance to all of us
 who want to improve the education of children with disabilities.   ESEA is mean
t to serve all children and there are growing numbers of children with disabili
ties who have been successfully mainstreamed into regular classrooms. ESEA and
 the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act can work together to make a re
al difference for many more of these children. The Teacher Quality report told
 us that the majority of our teachers do not feel as wellprepared as they shoul
d to teach children with disabilities.   We want to work very hard to make sure
that teachers have the skills and the tools they need to teacher these children


 to high standards.

We made a good start in improving teacher quality last year when Congress passe
d"with strong bipartisan support"the new teacher training and recruitment provi
sions in TitleII of the reauthorized Higher Education Act. Our ESEA reauthoriz
ation plan would build on this success by providing resources to help states st
rengthen teacher certification standards and develop new ways to evaluate and c
ompensate teachers.   It also will include increased investment in the highquali
ty professional development teachers tell us they need to help all students mee
t challenging new State standards.

Just as we have real concerns about improving teacher quality, we need to recog
nize the growing shortage of qualified principals.  I was struck by a statistic
 in a recent article in The Washington Post, which indicated that about 50 perc
ent of all schools face a shortage of qualified principal candidates. That is
a very heavy statistic.  In response to this and other evidence about the need
for better training for principals and other school leaders, our reauthorizatio
n proposal will address the issue of developing the next generation of talented
 principals.

          P6QP#OTITLE ID
          P6QXP#
 !plain Text! I have described some of the key, crosscutting measures for getting
  high standards into all classrooms.   Now I would like to outline some programs
pecific issues and recommendations, beginning with Title I, which is the larges
t Federal investment in elementary and secondary education. This $7.7billion p
rogram reaches more than 45,000 schools in over 13,000 school districts.    With
the expansion of schoolwide projects following the last reauthorization, the pr
ogram now serves over 11million students.    In the 199697 school year, 36 percen
t of the children served were white, 30 percent were Hispanic, and 28 percent w
ere AfricanAmerican.    Seventeen percent of the children served were limitedEngl
ish proficient.

Historically, Title I has been the single largest source of federal funding tar
geted to raising the achievement levels of students in highpoverty schools and
helping to close the achievement gap between these children and their more adva
ntaged peers. The 1994 reauthorization focused on helping children in high pov
erty schools reach the same high standards expected of all students through sev
eral specific approaches.  In particular, States were required to develop conte
nt and performance standards in reading and math, with aligned assessments to m
easure student progress toward meeting the standards.

The 1994 act also improved targeting of resources, expanded the schoolwide appr
oach, and strengthened the focus on parental involvement. With regard to targe
ting, the GAO recently reported that Federal programs are much more target than
 State programs.  On average, for every $1 a State provided in education aid fo
r each student in a district, the State provided an additional $0.62 per poor s
tudent.  For every $1 of Federal funding districts received for each student, t
hey received an additional $4.73 in Federal funding per poor student. We belie
ve targeting works, and we recommend leaving in place the TitleI allocation for
mula adopted by the Congress in 1994.

The 1994 Act expanded schoolwide programs by permitting schools with poor child
ren making up at least 50 percent of their enrollment to use Title I funds in c
ombination with other Federal, State, and local funds to upgrade the instructio
nal program of an entire school. To date, the number of schools implementing s
choolwide programs has more than quadrupled, from 3,500 to approximately 16,000
   And a growing number of parents are more fully involved in their childrens e
ducation through the use of parent compacts encouraged by the 1994 Act.


I also want to stress that getting parents involved in the process of school re
form is often the spark that makes the difference.   I have been a strong advoca
te of increased parental involvement in education for many years and there is a
 good reason for it.   Parents are childrens first teachers and they set the ex
pectations that tell children how hard they should strive to achieve. And teac
hers tell us again and again that parents are too often the missing part of the
 education success equation.  If you look at the attached chart entitled Makin
g the Grade you will see why we are placing such a strong emphasis on developin
g compact between parents and schools for our Title I children.

Four years ago, we created the Partnership for Family Involvement in Education
with 40 organizations. This Partnership has since grown to 4,700 organizations
and it continues to grow quite rapidly.  Last month, the Partnership sent out i
ts latest publication a guide that tells teachers how to work better with paren
ts.

         P6QP#OProgress Since the 1994 ReauthorizationO
         P6QXP#
Current information on Title I indicates progress on several fronts.   Title I h
as contributed to the rapid development of challenging State standards that app
ly to all students in Title I schools. Teachers in Title I schools are increas
ingly reporting that standards are helping to guide instruction. Moreover, pre
liminary data gathered for this reauthorization from States that have implement
ed the Title I standards and assessment provisions generally show increased ach
ievement levels in highpoverty schools.   For the 199798 school year, seven of t
he 10 States with standards and aligned assessments in place for two years repo
rt increasing percentages of students meeting proficient and advance performanc
e standards in schools with poverty rates of at least 50 percent. This Statele
vel data is particularly encouraging since final assessments are not required t
o be in place until school year 20002001.   Soon to be released data indicates t
hat Title I is seen as driving standardsbased reform in poor districts and scho
ols. This and other information, including data indicating that TitleI is driv
ing standardsbased reform in poor districts and schools, will be discussed in g
reater detail in the Congressionally mandated National Assessment of Title I sc
heduled for release in late February.

Despite these initial signs of progress, I will be the first to tell that we ar
e not anywhere near where we need to be in turning around the thousands of lowp
erforming high poverty schools that are served by Title I. This is why the Pre
sident is so strong for improved teacher quality and increased accountability.
 We know that there is a great deal of disparity in achievement levels at the s
tate level. As I mentioned earlier in my testimony, a very significant number
of paraprofessionals are functioning as teachers and they simply do not have th
e skills they need to do the jobs demanded of them.

We are not going to turn around the long, sorry history of setting low expectat
ions for our Nations poorest children in just four years.  We are on the right
course in aligning Title I with the best efforts of State and local school syst
ems. We simply need to stay the course in fitting all the pieces together to r
aise achievement levels.

In looking at TitleI and its impact, we should keep in mind that despite its si
ze and prominence at the Federal level, Title I represents less than 2 percent
of national spending on elementary and secondary education. Title I is effecti
ve only when it works in partnership with much larger State and local resources
   Nevertheless, Title I can and should do more to assist State and local effor
ts to raise the educational achievement level of poor and minority children, an
d this is what we are trying to achieve through our reauthorization proposals.

#A\      P6QP#OProposed Changes to Title 10


#XP\     P6QXP#
Building on what we have learned since 1994, our reauthorization proposal would
 continue to hold at risk children in highpoverty schools to the same high stand
ards expected of all children, to tie Title I to State and local reforms based
on high standards, to target resources to areas of greatest need, to support fl
exibility at the local level to determine instructional practice, and to encour
age more effective implementation of schoolwide programs.

In addition to the accountability provisions that apply across the ESEA, we wou
ld improve Title I by targeting additional resources to help the lowest achievi
ng schools and by phasing in a setaside for professional development aligned to
 standards. We also would strengthen the schoolwide authority by borrowing som
e of the successful features of the Comprehensive School Reform Demonstration p
rogram, such as basing reforms on solid research about what works.  And in resp
onse to a key recommendation of the reading study conducted by the National Aca
demy of Sciences (NAS) , we are proposing the use of diagnostic assessments in
the first grade to ensure the early identification of children with reading dif
ficulties.

Separately, we support the continuation of the Comprehensive School Reform Demo
nstration program, which we believe is generating some good models for improvin
g the effectiveness of the broader Title I program and for strengthening both T
itleI and nonTitleI schools.

The Department also is considering proposals to promote high quality profession
al development for early childhood educators and others to help children better
 develop language and literacy skills in the early years.   The NASs reading stu
dy presented strong evidence that children who receive enrichment services focu
sed on language and cognitive development in early childhood show significantly
 higher reading achievement in the later elementary and middle school years.   W
e believe that professional development based on recent research on child langu
age and literacy development"including strategies that could be shared with par
ents"could make a significant contribution toward the goal of ensuring that eve
ry child can read well by the end of the third grade. This proposal would targ
et those children most at risk of experiencing difficulty in learning to read b
y working with early childhood educators in Head Start and Title I preK program
s.

#XP\      P6QXP#
While every State has developed high standards, States and districts now need s
ignificant support to continue the hard work of making these high expectations
into classroom realities. This is why we are proposing a new initiative called
 High Standards in the Classroom. This initiative would help States and school
 districts continue the work of aligning instruction with standards, while focu
sing most resources on improving teacher quality through highquality profession
al development. Our High Standards in the Classroom program would replace the
current Goals 2000, Title II, and Title VI programs.
 Body Text DBody Text 2#&J\       P6Q&P##XP\      P6QXP#
The National Commission on Teaching and Americas Future found that the biggest
impediment to improving teaching was the lack of access to the kinds of knowled
ge and skills teachers need to help students succeed. We know from the Commiss
ion that most school districts do not direct their professional development fun
ds in a coherent way toward sustained, standardsbased, practical and useful lea
rning opportunities for teachers.   We need to provide teachers with learning op
portunities to change instructional practices in order to ensure that all child
ren are taught to high standards.

Unfortunately, the education community has not done enough to support the profe
ssional growth of teachers. Currently, most school districts spend less than 3


percent of their budgets on professional development, while our best private co
mpanies spend as much as 10 percent to ensure that their employees have quality
 training and keep current in their work.   If we expect the best from our stude
nts, we need to ensure that we are giving our teachers the best support. And,
we know it works.  In New York Citys District 2, former Superintendent Tony Alv
arado made major investments in professional development"investments that paid
off in marked improvement in student achievement.

The 1994 reauthorization included a greater focus on researchbased principles 0
f professional development in the Eisenhower Professional Development program.
 Despite this emphasis, recent evaluations of the Eisenhower professional devel
opment program found that most districts did not receive enough funding to supp
ort the kind of ongoing, intensive professional development what we know works
best to improve teaching skills.

 Body Text As we move into the next phase of standardsbased reform, we must giv
e States and districts the flexibility they need to strengthen their local effo
rts to implement standards and to improve teacher quality.  Funding for High St
andards in the Classroom initiative would be allocated by formula to the States
, with States retaining 10 percent of their allocations to continue the develop
ment of standards and assessments and provide leadership to districts in the wo
rk of implementing standards and improving professional development for teacher
s.

The remaining funds would be awarded to school districts through a Staterun com
petitive process based on district plans to implement standards in schools and
to invest in professional development in core subject areas, with a focus and a
 priority on science and mathematics. Distributing the funding through a compe
titive process would promote innovation and encourage careful planning, while e
nsuring that a significant number of districts have sufficient funding to imple
ment the kind of comprehensive professional development programs that we know w
ork. Through the success of Goals 2000, we know that competitive grants have a
lready proved to be an effective vehicle for advancing the implementation of st
andards at the local level.

Funds would be used to advance teacher understanding and use of best instructio
nal practices in one or more of the core academic content areas"with a primary
focus on math and science, encourage collaboration among groups of teachers and
 administrators, support districtwide professional development plans designed t
o raise student achievement on State academic standards, help teachers integrat
e educational technology into classroom practice, and provide additional intens
ive support for new teachers during their first three years in the classroom

States would be required to design their grant competitions to target funds to

he recently established principles of effectiveness, including the adoption of
 researchbased strategies and setting measurable goals and objectives for drug

Program funds would be distributed in larger, more effective grants by requirin
g States to award competitive grants to a limited number of highneed districts.
  Program evaluations have consistently found that the current practice of allo
cating funds by formula to all districts spreads funds too thinly to have a sig
nificant impact in most districts.

Finally, we will propose a new provision authorizing the Department to provide
emergency services"especially mental health and counseling services"to schools
affected by the kind of violence or severe trauma we saw last year in Arkansas,
 Kentucky, and Oregon. This is the $12million Project SERV (School Emergency R
esponse to Violence) initiative included in the Presidents 2000 budget request.
  Our reauthorization plan also would set aside a small amount of funding at th

#A\      P6QP#DEXCELLENCE AND OPPORTUNITY IN PUBLIC EDUCATION
o


!lXP\     P6QXP!lAs I travel   around the country visiting schools I continue to see t
he spark of innovation and     creativity in many public schools.  Public education
  is changing quite rapidly    at the ground level and offering parents many more 0
ptions in the terms of the     type of schools that children can attend.

This Administration is a strong advocate of public school choice as a way to en
courage and stimulate the creative efforts of many schools districts to give pa
rents the opportunity to find a school that best fits the needs of their childr
en. Some public discussion about choice gets reduced to the idea that that the
re is only choice outside of public education. Well, that is an assumption tha
t I want to challenge because it really has no basis in fact.

You can go to school district after school district and find schoolswithinschoo
ls, schooltowork initiatives, high schools collaborating with local colleges, 0
ption and theme schools that focus in on specialized fields like the environmen
t, the visual and performing arts, communications and technology, backtobasics,
 classical studies, marine science, accelerated learning, the international bac
calaureate, and careerrelated areas like finance and medical sciences.

There is a great deal of variety in public education at the local level from al
ternative schools, to community based learning efforts, to schoolswithoutwalls,
 to public schools that focus in on the core knowledge approach to education.
 There are public school districts like Seattle that have a completely open cho
ice model and many other school districts that offer intradistrict choice, inte
rdistrict choice, and controlled choice.  Critics of public education would do
well to recognize that many public school districts are far more in touch with
parents than they think and they are giving parents the choices they seek.

I want to stress that one of the most important choices that parents can make a
bout a childs education is the choice of subjects and not schools. The best sc
hools in America"whether they are public, private or parochial"all share someth
ing in common:  they place a strong emphasis on a rigorous academic program. T
his is what makes these schools distinctive, and it is what makes them work.   T
hat is why President Clinton has spent six year years advocating the idea that
by raising standards and putting quality teachers into every classroom we can r
aise achievement for many, many more of our students "indeed, all of our student
s"than any private school voucher program. Private school voucher programs aff
ect only a small number of students and take scarce resources from the public s
chools that serve the vast majority of students.

 While the Clinton Administration strongly opposes efforts to divert public fun
ds to private schools through vouchers or similar proposals, we want to encoura
ge the development of new choices within the public school system.  This is why
 we worked very closely with Congress to reauthorize the Charter School legisla
tion that fostered creativity and accountability. This year we are considering
 a new choice activity that would help us identify and support new approaches t
o public school choice and promote a new, broader version of choice that works
within all public schools.

We are interested in promoting choice programs in which the schools and program
s are public and accountable for results, are genuinely open and accessible to
all students, and promote high standards for all students.  There are many succ
essful public schools that can provide models for improving lowperforming schoo
ls, and one of our goals should be to find way to replicate these successful mo
dels.
