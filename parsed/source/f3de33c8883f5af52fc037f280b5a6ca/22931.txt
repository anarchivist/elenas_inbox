TEXT:
O.K. team -- we have an obligation to get back to the congressional staff
(and groups?) in about three weeks and work in earnest toward "the event"
circa April 8th, give or take a day or two.

equal pay has been more a dpc than an nec thing, though something i've
cared about -- so i appreciate your letting me play

john seems to think i have something to contribute on the data collection
piece -- i'm happy to help.  for now, tom and mary have this process going
which i gather is quite productive.   should you want extra counselor
advice, you know where to find me.  it strikes me that we ought to have a
clear idea, fully vetted within the administration, of how far we want
to/can go on data collection in the next 10 days, two weeks (p;s. by that
time, i should be allowed phone privileges) .

finally, on the substance -- i just wanted to let you know that i stopped
heidi afterwards and confirmed that the 74 cents on the dollar disparity
in pay -- revised by cea to 85 cents on the dollar taking into account
experience, longevity, etc. --    was for the same job -- not a comparable
worth study -- thereby establishing that even though some think that "no
employer is stupid enough to pay the man sitting next' to the woman more
money for the same job,"   there is a lot of that still happening and that
the daschle bill would in fact help (by 15 cents on the dollar) .
