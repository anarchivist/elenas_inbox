TEXT:
WH leg affairs asked for inserts on crack and status offenders {JJ bill}
for a POTUS CBC follow-up letter.  The crack piece is taken from the
President's statement.  I added the first paragraph, which leg affairs
said was needed. The status offenders piece is new-- I didn't take it from
the Erskine letter to the CBC.

Could you please review so I can forward along to leg affairs?   Thanks!=============

Cocaine Sentencing

        Last month, the U.S. Sentencing Commission released a special report to Congress
containing new recommendations on sentencing for cocaine offenses. [Unlike the Commission's
recommendations issued in October 1995, the proposed sentencing changes contained in the
report require Congressional action before they could take effect.]

        I commended the Sentencing Commission for moving forward with recommendations to
Congress to reduce the disparity between crack and powder cocaine penalties. My
Administration will give these recommendations very serious consideration. Director
McCaffrey and Attorney General Reno are currently reviewing the recommendations and will be
reporting back to me by June 29. I look forward to working with the Congress on this issue.

        Current law creates a substantial disparity between sentences for crack and powder
cocaine. This disparity has led to a perception of unfairness and inconsistency in the federal
criminal justice system. Some adjustment to the cocaine penalty structure is warranted as a
matter of sound criminal justice policy. However, the sentencing laws must continue to reflect
that crack cocaine is a more harmful form of cocaine. The Sentencing Commission's new
recommendations do so. Trafficking in crack, and the violence it fosters, has a devastating
impact on communities across America, especially inner-city communities. Any change in
penalties must ensure that more dangerous offenders receive tougher sentences.

Status Offenders

        My Anti-Gang and Youth Violence Act of 1997 does not propose a change from existing
policy and practice on detention of status offenders. The bill would merely codify the federal
regulatory changes enacted last December. These regulations make it permissible to hold a
juvenile for up to 24 hours prior to, and immediately following, his or her initial court
appearance (excluding holidays and weekends). The provisions will enable state and local
governments to take into account the facts and circumstances of each juvenile taken into custody
and provide for their appropriate placement.
