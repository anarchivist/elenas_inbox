TEXT:
People have been looking into this question of whether we should
reconsider our (tentative) definition of means tested benefits, such that
it would exclude the new child health program. Everyone has concluded or
will probably conclude soon that we should give up on this. Apparently,
there is some legal argument that you could exclude the new program, on
the grounds that capped entitlements should be excluded. However, our
opponents might argue that this clouds our big argument (the colloquy when
the Byrd Rule knocked out a definition last year made an important
mandatory/discretionary distinction) .

  Also, even if this logic were acceptable to OLC, the same logic would also
  let TANF off the hook ~- and the only means tested programs we have
  defined in the entire government are SSI, food stamps, Medicaid, TANF, and
  probably now this new child health program.  Taking TANF off the listt too
. would risk making Lamar Smith even madder than he is, such that he would
  mount a more serious legislative effort to get a.much meaner definition
  into the law. So there seems to be an emerging consensus that we are at t
  he end of the line on this -- HHS, Apfel, NEC, and I guess me too. OMB is
  still checking with Josh Gotbaum, but I think he will agree.  HHS will
  probably officially issue it next week, so let me know if you aren't ready
  to drop this.
