       Subject:         Meeting with Wade Henderson and the Leadership Conference on
       Civil Rights Executive Committee

       Sylvia, several weeks ago Wade Henderson asked for a meeting with John
       Hope Franklin, other members of the Advisory Board and me. After several
       unsuccessful attempts to find a time when a good portion of the executive
       committee and John Hope could be present, we settled on February 9 from
       11:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. The meeting will take place in the Roosevelt Room.

       I would like to invite you to attend the meeting and I urge you to attend
       if at all possible.  I have asked Richard to extend an invitation to Maria
       E., Elena Kagan and Eddie Corriea (Wade asked specifically that he be
       included) .

       Wade has indicated that he would like to pursue the following agenda:

                  1.       What is the Advisory Board's mandate?

                  2.     How will the Board report its work and its findings to the


  President

          3. what are the tangibles that will come out of the Initiative
  and the work of the Board?

  He has also indicated his interest in sharing with us the findings of
  reports recently completed by the Leadership Conference Education
  Foundation -- findings relevant to the work of the Initiative.
