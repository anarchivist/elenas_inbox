TEXT:
fyi-- Diana may have updated you on this, but the product of the
Lott-sponsored bipartisan negotiating process for the IDEA reauthorization
will be marked up at the full committee level tomorrow morning in both the
House and the Senate.    Assuming the mark-ups go smoothly, in the
afternoon, Secretary Riley will have a press conference (tentatively 3 pm)
to praise the "legislation, with probable attendees including Sens Lott,
Jeffords, Coats, and Harkin, and Reps Goodling, Riggs, Castle, L. Graham,
Clay, Martinez, and Miller.    Sen. Kennedy might also participate--see
below. Floor action on the bill is expected next week, on Tuesday in the
House and on Thursday in the Senate.    If all goes without a hitch, we
could be looking at the potential for a bill signing as early as May 22 or
23.

The main question mark for tomorrow is Kennedy; late in the process he
began pushing to give DOJ authority to investigate IDEA matters without
having them referred from Education, as a means of toughening
enforcement.   There has been lots of back and forth between Kennedy and
Lott's staff; as of late today it wasn't clear whether Kennedy would
pursue this tomorrow, and if he does (and fails) what it would mean for
his support for the bill overall, which is getting praise as very balanced
from both education and disability advocacy groups.   Meanwhile, Kennedy
has irritated the Republicans, notably Riggs, for raising the DOJ issue so
late.   Riggs has made noises about pushing harder on an issue of his own
(having to do with services to students in adult prisons)  that had
already been raised and addressed in the negotiating process, but ED
thinks at this point he probably won't.

On one of the biggest sticking point from the last Congress, cessation of
services/discipline, my understanding is that the agreement that has been
worked out would overrule the 4th Circuit decision and explicitly require
states to provide services to special ed students who had been suspended
or expelled from school.
