DRAFT    February 23, 1996 11:45 a.m.


OOption 1   Partial RepealD

Under this approach, the Administration would support repeal of those provision
s of the logging
rider that pertain to oldgrowth sales and the Northwest Forest
 Plan (these are the provisions the
courts have interpreted so broadly). The p
olicy would include buyback and replacement timber
provisions, giving the Admin
istration tools to address environmentally problematic sales already
released.
 The salvage program would not be repealed, but we would announce significantly

intensified management oversight of the program and the establishment of speci
al boards or
other mechanisms to handle citizen complaints about particular sal
es during the rema1n1ng 10
months of the rider.

OPROSD
"White House and agency staff agree that this. is the most logical and reasonabl
e approach
as a matter of policy.
"Proenvironment approach, but not an uncritical embrace of their perspective an
d
allegations. May be seen by general public as balanced
"No patent flipflop from previous support for salvage program
"Previous, possibly outdated, indications of support from Governor Kitzhaber, C
ong.
DeFazio, and thenCongressman Wyden.

OCONSD
"No presently identified support from any Northwest or other political leader.


OOption 2   Full RepealO

Under this approach, the Administration would support repeal of all provisions
of the logging
rider (i.e., oldgrowth, Forest Plan, and salvage). As in Option
 1, the policy would include buyback and replacement timber provisions. We wou
Id commit to propose some form of permanent
 forest health legislation without
sufficiency language in lieu of the salvage provision.

OPROSO
"Patterned after expected legislation from Sen. Murray
"May be supported by Senator Wyden
"Similar to Congo Furse legislation and probable Bradley/Boxer legislation
"Unequivocal proenvironment approach (except, depending on the details, for the
  forest
health legislation)

         "Repeal of salvage provision will deeply anger labor and timber industry
         "May go beyond what Gov. Kitzhaber will support
         DOption 3 Heightened POTUS criticism and generalized call for reformD

         Under this approach, the President would sharply criticize the impacts of the I
         ogging rider. He
         would emphasize the environmental damage and social conflict,
          the risk of renewed gridlock,
         and the erosion of public confidence in the fore
         st management process.  He would emphasize
         problems in the oldgrowth arena, bu
         t also note concern over possible problems with the
         salvage program.

         In order to go beyond what the President said in his October statement, he woul
         d cite
         unsuccessful efforts in court and the Congress to fix the logging rider.
           The President would say
         that something must be done and would speculate that
          the appropriate response could include
         repeal of some or all of the provisions
          of the law. He would announce that he will work with
         Senator Murray, Senator
         Wyden, other members of the delegation, and the governors to define
         exactly the
          correct approach. He would also announce that he is directing the Secretaries
         of the
         Interior and Agriculture to investigate allegations of abuse in the salv
         age program.

         The President would also refer to the example set by the Seventh American Fores
         t Congress
          (now underway in Washington, DC) as representing the type of broad c
         ooperation and
         consensusseeking that should characterize forest policymaking.
