                      RESPONSE TO                                           ~-UilWl~CG"V&ISIOn
  ROTH-NICKLES-GRAMM-DOMENICI-BREAUX-KERREY AMENDMENT


Charge:     President's framework "does not devote 15 percent of the budget
            surpluses to the Medicare program. The federal budget process
            does not provide a mechanism for setting aside current surpluses
            for future obligations."

Response:   Not true. The President's framework would dedicate $686 billion to
            debt reduction and the Medicare trust fund. The independent
            Medicare actuary -- repeatedly cited by Republicans in 1995 --
            confirmed that this proposal would significantly extend the life of the
            Trust Fund: 'This budget proposal would postpone the year of
            exhaustion by an estimated 12 years." (Rick Foster, 1127/99).

Charge:     Transferring IOUs will require raising taxes, benefits cut, and/or
            increased gross debt to pay for Medicare in the future.

Response:   Not true. OMB projects that there will be a surplus well into the
            middle of the next century even after we dedicate part of the surplus to
            Medicare and Social Security. This is because, by paying down the
            publicly held debt, the President's plan reduces net interest costs to the
            Federal government and increase economic growth. Thus, even after
            we start using the surplus to pay for Medicare and Social Security,
            there will be a budget surplus.


Charge:     "No effect on the unified budget surpluses or the on-budget
            surpluses and therefore have no effect on the debt held by the
            public."

Response:   Not true. The President is locking in $686 billion from the surplus
            which, under the Republican plan, would go for tax cuts, not debt
            reduction or Medicare. Merrill Lynch praised the President's overall
            strategy: "Allocating a portion of the budget surpluses to debt
            reduction, as the President proposes, is a conservative strategy that
            makes sense. Reduced debt will result in increased national savings,
            lower interest rates, and stronger long-term economic growth than
            would otherwise be the case." (Merrill Lynch, February 10, 1999).
Charge:     "The President's budget framework does not provide access to, or
             financing for, prescription drugs."                          Hex.Dump ConversIon

Response: The President stated that prescription drug coverage should be
          included in any plan to reform the Medicare program. He called on
          the Congress to work in a bipartisan fashion to develop there reforms
          and indicated that he would wait until after the Medicare Commission
          made its final recommendations before outlining his sptx:ific
          preferences. The President is committed to including a prescription
          drug benefit in the plan that he submits to the Congress.


Charge:      The Comptroller General states that the President's Medicare
             proposal "is likely to create a pubUc misperception that something
             meaningful is being done to reform the Medicare program."

Response: The Comptroller General himself put out a statement saying that "the
          President's proposed transfer of new securities to the Hospital
          Insurance trust fund constitutes a significant financing change .... " and
          praised the President for his remarks on the need for program reforms
          as well as financing. On March 18, the Comptroller General
          acknowledged that the President had "suggested that, although
          substantial new general fund revenues may be needed for the program
          over the long-term, substantive program reforms requiring 'difficult
          political and policy choices' will also be required."


Charge:      Breaux-Thomas plan received majority vote, but "all of the
             President's appointees to that commission opposed the bipartisan
             reform plan."

Response: All of the Democratic appointees, except for Senators Breaux and
          Kerrey, opposed the Breaux-Thomas plan. The President appointees
          voted their conscience. The President felt he should not instruct his
          Commission members to vote for something that they felt represented .
          flawed policy. He believes that it would have been inappropriate for
          him to do otherwise.
                                                                 Automated Records Management System
                                                                         Hex-Dump Conversion
    Charge:     The Breaux-Thomas recommendations "substantially improve the
                solvency of the Medicare program" that will not require "raising
                taxes, cutting benefits, or borrowing more from the public."

    Response:   The Breaux-Thomas plan does not substantially extend the solvency of
                Medicare. At most, it adds 4 or 5 years to the program's life -- which
                by any definition is not a "long-term" solution. In contrast, the
                President's plan, that includes the dedication of the surplus and a much
                more meaningful prescription drug benefit, will extend the life of
                Medicare by a significantly greater period of time.


    Charge:     No transfer from surplus.

    Response:   Senators Breaux and Kerrey voted for this transfer yesterday. Earlier
                this year, Senator Breaux indicated interest in the surplus proposal, but
                argued that he could not endorse it because of his role as Commission
                chair.


    Charge:     Work in bipartisan fashion on reform; examine recommendation
                in the Breaux-Thomas plan; work with the President on his plan.

    Response:   We couldn't agree more and his proposal will be designed to reach
                bipartisan consensus on the type of reforms we need to strengthen and
                improve the program.
