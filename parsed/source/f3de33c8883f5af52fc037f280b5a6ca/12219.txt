TEXT:
Last month a bipartisan group of five house members wrote to the President
to urge him to appoint a "National Commission of Voter Turnout." The
signatories were: Sanders, Boehlert, Bonior, Campbell and Conyers.
Sanders is the moving force.   I'll get the letter to each of you.

The letter points out that u.S. voter turnout is the lowest of nay
industrialized nation and continues to decline.  The members feel that a
commission could identify possible steps to reverse this trend.

This strikes me as an idea in which we might    be interested?              Any
reaction? Thoughts about how to proceed?
