TEXT:
On the budget front, USDA's passback looks decent for the Intiative, but
OMB is reportedly not going to give HHS anything new at the moment.

The agencies would like to hold a Food Safety Council meeting 12/16.  They
would discuss their charter, their budget priorities, and a draft overall
strategy. Unless we have some good budget news, I'd say not really a
POTUS event.
