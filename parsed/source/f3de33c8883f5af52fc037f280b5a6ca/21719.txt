Waldman
PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
REMARKS ON TOBACCO SETTLEMENT
THE WHITE HOUSE
November 16, 199B

        [Insert on iraq]

        Today is an important day in the long struggle to protect our
children from tobacco. The settlement between the Attorneys General and
the tobacco companies is a step in the right direction for our nation.   It
reflects the first time that the tobacco companies will be held
financially accountable for the damage that their product does to our
nationO,s health.    I want to thank Attorney General Gregoire and all her
colleagues for their long and tenacious struggle to bring the tobacco
companies to justice.

        With this settlement, we are moving forward -- but for the sake of
our children, we cannot stand still. The national government, and the
national community, must do its part as well. We must press forward on
all fronts to end the multimillion dollar marketing campaign designed to
hook young people on a product that will kill them.

        We began that effort nearly four years ago, when the Food and Drug
Administration put in place a strong crackdown on tobacco advertising
aimed at teenagers.   This was the broadest and most significant effort
yet to protect our children from tobacco.   But it has been challenged in
court by the tobacco companies from the beginning.   I want to report that
the Solicitor General will urgently ask the Supreme Court to resolve this
matter.

        But letO,s be clear: When it comes to protecting our children from
tobacco, it is up to Congress to finish the job. This past Congress began
with strong momentum toward action, only to see national tobacco
legislation derailed by partisanship and special pleading.  In the new
Congress, I am determined that we will choose progress over partisanship.
Comprehensive national tobacco legislation must be one of the top
priorities for the new Congress, and I will work hard to see that it
becomes law.

        We should always remember the stakes.  Each day that Congress
fails to act, 3300 children start smoking, and 1100 of them will die early
as a result.  Each day that Congress fails to act, our children continue
to be bombarded by massive marketing campaign aimed at recruiting what
tobacco industry documents call D&replacement smokers.DB With strong
legislation, we can save five million lives in the first five years.   Our
duty is clear: to protect our children; to wrap a loving arm around them;
and to give them the future they deserve.
