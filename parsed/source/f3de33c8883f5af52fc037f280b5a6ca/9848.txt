TEXT:
I'm sending around a very good options paper that Chris put together for
the budget and State of the Union.  You should look it over and see
whether you can do the same in your area.  Obviously, some issues are just
up in the air right now. But it would be enormously helpful if this week
we could update our earlier New Ideas memo by putting together a paragraph
on every idea we're considering, along with its budget implications.

Thanks.
