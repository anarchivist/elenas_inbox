                                  Questions and Answers on Food Safety
                                           September 23, 1997


         Q:   Recently, once again, food safety was in the news. Most of us saw reports of Americans
              becoming ill after eating hamburgers produced by Hudson Meat that were contaminated
              with the bacteria E. coli 015 7:H7. There were also recent reports of illnesses caused by
              alfalfa sprouts. Is our food supply becoming less safe?

         A:   I don't think it is. When my administration took office in 1993, one of the first
              challenges we faced was an outbreak of E. coli in hamburger in the northwest. Many
              children became ill and several died. Let me tell you what we did about it. The
              Vice-President has headed up our effort. In 1993, he recommended that we replace our
              old system of responding to problems only after they occur with a new system to prevent
              problems before they occur. That system, which we are putting in place for meat,
              poultry, and seafood, and soon will be expanding to other areas of food production, is
              greatly increasing our ability to make sure food is safe.

              In January, I announced several additional steps to improve the safety of our food. I
              asked Congress to add $43 million to our food safety budget to fund a nationwide
              early-warning system for foodbome illness, increase seafood safety inspections, and
              exparid food-safety research, training, and education. Congress has agreed to provide the
              funds I requested and beginning next month we will be using that money to further reduce
              the incidence of foodbome illness.

              Let me make one last point. One reason it might seem like we are hearing about more
              food-related illnesses is because we are doing a more thorough job looking for problems.
              As a result, we our catching and quickly responding to outbreaks of foodbome illness that
              we often missed in the past. We have made a great deal of progress since 1993, and I am
              confident that the steps we have taken will help us do a better job protecting our citizens
              from foodbome illness than ever before.
