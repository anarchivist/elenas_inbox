TEXT:.
According to Mary Bourdette, Ron Haskins had a very, very strong negative
reaction to the fact that our high performance bonus guidance has only
work measures but no family formation measures.   She quoted him as saying
it borders on illegal, and said Shaw may send a letter to the Secretary
about this.  She said she started to make the point that the illegitimacy
bonus gets at his concern, but he dismissed that by noting that the HPB is
supposed to reward states that achieve the 4 goals of section 401 (assi
stance to needy families, ending dependence through work and marriage,
reducing out-of-wedlock births, and encouraging 2-parent families) .

That's part of why HHS wants to include language in the guidance saying
HHS will continue to study changes or refinements to the measures.  Elena
threw out the notion of dropping it from the guidance and reassuring Ron
privately. But where are we on the basic question -- why wouldn't we
agree to throw a teen birth measure into the NPRM if it satisfies Shaw and
doesn't hold us up?
