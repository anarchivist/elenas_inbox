Subject:         Re: Legal Boundaries on Welfare to Work Outreach

Bill--Elena and I reviewed your legal memo and ha ve a couple more
questions for you.  Better said, here is what we want to do, tell us how
it can be done.

We want to identify individuals with the proper stature in the nonprofit
and in the religous community who could organize their community around
the welfare to work implementation. Such a person might do outreach and
identify other like-minded individuals, provide information and technical
assistance to businesses and state governments as to the capacity and
abilities of the nonprofit and religous communities to aid in the job
creation for welfare recipients.
How we work with such individuals is very critical. We will want to
communicate and provide information regarding creative ideas we discover,
refer innovative programs for replication, etc.
Please tell us how we can accomplish this.  Thank you, Maria and Elena
