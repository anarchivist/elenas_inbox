TEXT:
Gene wanted Ceci Rouse to write up a legislative strategy for getting the
money for the 1000 new Native American teachers.    This initiative is
already authorized under current law so it is only an appropriations
issue.   I talked with Mike Cohen, and it appeared that there were three
main areas to focus on:   (1) making sure that OMB and the Department of
Education continue to push it; (2) reaching out to legislative allies on
this; and (3) making sure the groups highlight it. Let me know if you
have any problems with this.   If not, I will outline this broad strategy
to Ceci.
