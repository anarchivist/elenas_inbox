Q.   What is the relationship between cigarette smoking and illicit drug use? Is tobacco
     a gateway drug?

A.   A 1996 survey released by the Department of Health and Human Services found that teen
     smokers were significantly more likely to use drugs and drink heavily. The 1996
     National Household Survey on Drug Abuse, released by HHS' Substance Abuse and
     Mental Health Services Administration, found that 12-17 year-olds who were current
     smokers were nine times as likely to use illicit drugs and 16 times as likely to drink
     heavily, as nonsmoking youths. An earlier National Household Survey (from
     1994-1995) found that among 12-17 year-oIds who had smoked marijuana in their
     lifetime, 74% had tried cigarettes before marijuana.

     While we cannot definitively state that there is a direct cause and effect relationship
     between youth tobacco and drug use, this data suggests a correlation between the two.
