TEXT:
As you can imagine, Ken is completely backed up with budget negotiations,
flood supplementals, and the like.  Barry is out of the office today.
So, Ken has asked me if I would touch base with you about the next steps
on privatization.

We understand there may be another decision memo in the works on
privatization.   You can appreciate that we continue to have an interest in
this problem and how it may be resolved.   ThUS, if this is correct, would·
you please include us -- Ken and Barry -- on the routing for the memo's
internal review?

Thanks.
