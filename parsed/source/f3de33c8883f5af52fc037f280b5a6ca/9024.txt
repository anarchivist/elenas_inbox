San Diego Action: San Diego County plans to send a letter to all CalWORKS (TANF), Food Stamps,
and General Relief (but not Medicaid) recipients stating that the county plans to provide immigration
status information to the INS for all undocumented adults living in the home except in certain very
limited circumstances (in cases of domestic violence or children are being cared for by a non-parent
relative). San Diego uses an application form which requires parents to specify their immigration
status (with one box labeled "undocumented") even if they are not applying for assistance for
themselves.

Effect of San Diego Policy: Undocumented parents may be deterred from applying for or receiving
Food Stamps for their citizen children. Children cannot apply for their own benefits; application must
be made by a parent or another adult exercising parental control. According to advocates, as many as
428,000 citizen children nationwide could be blocked from obtaining Food Stamps if other
jurisdictions follow San Diego's policy.

Legal Basis of San Diego Policy: Section 404 of the Personal Responsibility Act says that each state
that receives a TANF grant "shall, at least 4 times annually and upon request of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, furnish the Immigration and Naturalization Service with the name and address
of, and other identifying information on, any individual who the State knows is unlawfully in the
United States." Advocates note that if San Diego did not have an application form requiring parents to
check "undocumented" then they would not "know." In addition, section 434 of the welfare law says
"Notwithstanding any other provision of Federal, State, or local law, no State or local government
entity may be prohibited, or in any way restricted, from sending to or receiving from the Immigration
and Naturalization Service information regarding the immigration status, lawful or unlawful, of an
alien in the United States."

Legislative History on Eligibility for Citizen Children: Early versions of Congressional welfare
reform proposals which had made citizen children ineligible for benefits were amended before final
passage to maintain their eligibility. The Agriculture Research bill enacted in June restored Food
Stamps to legal immigrant children irregardless of their parents' immigration status.

Possible Administration Action: USDA could send a letter to the state of California saying "Our
concern is that requiring ineligible parents to go beyond the requirements of the Food Stamp program
and provide more detailed information as to why they are ineligible, many parents will be deterred
from making application for eligible children" and asking that action be delayed until this concern can
be resolved. The letter would focus on the effect of collecting information on the Food Stamp
application on the service received by eligible, U.S. citizen children (and not on the reporting of
information to the INS).

Legal Basis of Possible Administration Action: The Food Stamp Act, as amended by the welfare
reform law, requires states to "establish procedures governing the operation offood stamp offices
that...provide timely, accurate, and fair service to applicants for, and participants in, the food stamp
program [and] develop an application containing the information necessary to comply with this Act."
This requirement has not been defined in regulations. In addition, the Food Stamp Act prohibits states
from imposing additional conditions of eligibility for food stamps not authorized by federal law.

Possible Additional Administration Action: If the San Diego refuses to changes its policy, then
USDA could bring administrative action against the state. In addition, USDA could begin a
rulemaking to define "timely, accurate, and fair service."              ~lItomated Records Management System
