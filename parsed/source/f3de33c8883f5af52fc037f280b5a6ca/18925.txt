                    PRESIDENT WILLIAM J_ CLINTON
        REMARKS AT HOUSATONIC COMMUNITY-TECHNICAL COLLEGE
                      BRIDGEPORT, CONNECTICUT
                           MARCH 10, 1998

        Acknowledgments: Sen. Chris Dodd, Rep. Chris Shays, Rep. Barbara Kennelly, Rep.
Rosa DeLauro -- One of the reasons I came to Connecticut is because this state's leaders and
representatives have been some of America's foremost advocates for better child care; Pamela
Price, parent.

          In last page of the Early Childhood Lab School's parent handbook there's a saying, "A
child is like a butterfly in the wind. Some can fly higher than others, but each one flies the best
it can ... Each one is special. Each one is different. Each one is beautiful."

        After my visit, I could tell that it's a motto every teacher in this school lives by, that
every child here is made to feel special every day. Every child in America deserves the same
kind of high-quality care given to the children here, whether it's at a school like this one, a
church, a neighbor's house, or at home. Today I want to talk about the urgent need to make
child care in America better, safer, and more affordable. I want to talk about what we in the
federal government will do to improve child care. And I want to talk about what Congress must
do over the next 70 days that it is in session to help every working family give their children the
care they need to thrive and grow.

         These are good times for America. Over the past five years, we have successfully
abandoned the false choices of the past and replaced them with a new economic strategy. We
proved that we could indeed balance the budget and invest in our people and the future. As a
result, our economy is booming. We have 15 million new jobs. Unemployment is the lowest in
24 years. Inflation is the lowest in a generation. Our social problems are bending to our efforts.
 Last year's historic balanced budget agreement provided working families with a $500 per child
tax credit, made college affordable for every American, and expanded health coverage to five
million uninsured children. We are helping parents meet their responsibilities at home and at
work through the Family and Medical Leave Act and the Earned Income Tax Credit. The
American Dream is in reach for more and more families.

        Now, we must knock down a stubborn obstacle to the American Dream -- child care that
is often too hard to afford, too hard to find, or too dangerous for our children. With more
families relying on two incomes or working longer hours to make ends meet, millions of children
must spend time in care away from their parents. For them, child care is not just an option, it's a
necessity. No parent should have to choose between the job they need and the child they love.

        Since I took office, we have already helped the parents of one million children pay for
child care. But it's obvious that we must do more. Today, I am releasing a report that confirms
the urgency of our task -- and the overwhelming need that still exists in communities across
America. The report shows that though they are coming up with some of the most innovative
strategies to improve child care in America, states simply do not have the resources to meet the

        States have been forced to tum away thousands of low-income families. Here in
Connecticut, the state child care bureau has to restrict its aid to families on welfare or teen
parents in high school. They've stopped taking applications from working poor families
altogether. At a time of unprecedented prosperity for America, this simply should not be.

        The federal government must do its part to address our child care challenges. I want to
make our federal child care centers, which care for some 215,000 children, a model for the
nation. So today, I am directing my Cabinet to do four things to improve federally-sponsored
child care centers. First, I am requiring that all centers conduct thorough background checks on
workers. Often, we don't even check to see if the people we trust to take care of our children are
trustworthy in the eyes oflaw. Connecticut is one of the few states that actually require criminal
background checks of child care workers. This is unacceptable. We must make sure that people
who have no business taking care of children in the first place never set foot in our child care
centers. We require background checks of the bank tellers who guard our valuables. We must
also require checks of the people who care for our children -- who are priceless.

         Second, I am directing all centers to take steps to become fully-accredited by the year
2000. This way, we can make sure that our centers meet the highest standards of care -- in terms
of training for workers, child-to-staff ratios, quality of facilities. Today, 76 percent of military
and 35 percent of non-military centers are accredited. We'll make that 100 percent in the next
700 days. Third, we must make sure that all federal workers know about all their child care
benefits and options in the first place. And finally, we must work with the private sector to
make federal child care better and more affordable.

        But Congress must do its part. In my balanced budget for 1999, I have proposed a
comprehensive and fiscally-responsible plan to strengthen child care in our country. If Congress
acts, we can double the number of children receiving child care subsidies, give tax cuts to
businesses who provide child care, and expand child care tax credits to three million working
families. These tax credits will mean that a family offour making $35,000 a year and saddled
with high child care bills will no longer pay a penny in federal income tax. If Congress acts, we
can make child care safer with better enforcement oflicensing requirements, tougher criminal
background checks, and scholarships to talented care givers. If Congress acts, we can expand
after school programs to keep 500,000 more children off the streets, off drugs and out of trouble.

        I call upon Congress to pass this plan right away. Child care is an issue that touches
nearly every family in America, one that should rise above politics and partisan interests. With
just 70 working days before Congress adjourns, there is no time to lose. Our working families
cannot wait. Our children cannot wait. As any parent knows, toddlers become teenagers anq
teenagers become adults in the blink of an eye. We cannot afford to waste a second when it
comes to giving our children the care and education they need to become strong students and
good citizens.


                                                 2
comprehensive tobacco legislation -- legislation that would reduce teen smoking by raising the
price of cigarettes up to $1.50 a pack over the next several years, imposing strong penalties on
tobacco companies that keep on advertising to children, and giving the FDA full authority to
regulate children's access to tobacco products. The revenue we raise from the tobacco
companies could also help make my child care plan a reality. For years, the tobacco companies
have tried to harm our children, now they can do something to strengthen them. I call on
Congress to act now.

       1998 could be one of the greatest years for America's children or one of the greatest
missed opportunities to improve the lives of our children and our working families. Over the
next 70 days, let us all work to shape that answer.
