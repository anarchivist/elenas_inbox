    MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

    FROM:          Bruce Reed
                   Elena Kagan

    RE:            DPC Weekly Report




            1. Welfare Reform: Fair Labor Standards Act/Minimum Wage -            House Ways and
    Means Human Resources Subcommittee Chairman Clay Shaw is continuing his efforts to
    get support from Governors for a bill to address state concerns about the cost of workfare
    programs. His first draft bill was quite attractive to Governors Carper and Chiles and
    other Democratic Governors, but was not conservative enough for House Republicans.
    His new draft is a move in the wrong direction from our perspective. It reclassifies people
    in workfare programs as "trainees," thereby depriving them of the protections of the FLSA,
    including the minimum wage, and other labor laws, including full health and safety protections
    and protection against discrimination. We are communicating our view that this is unacceptable
    to Democratic Governors in the hopes that this will deter them from endorsing Shaw's bill.

         Like Shaw's previous draft, the new bill would also significantly weaken the welfare law's
    work requirements. It also includes a definition of community service that is so broad that it
    could include nearly all subsidized work, allowing low benefit states to require less than 20 hours
    of work from nearly all their "working" recipients. Finally, it would also exempt community
    service positions from FICA and unemployment taxes, which we indicated during the balanced
    budget negotiations that we were willing to do.

         2. Welfare: Welfare to Work Transportation -- On Thursday, the Senate Banking and
    Urban Affairs Committee voted 11 to 7 to add the Administration's welfare to work
    transportation proposal to the federal transit legislation. Senator Moseley-Braun offered the
    amendment, which was supported by Senators D' Amato, Bennett, and Enzi as well as all the
    Democratic committee members. The Vice President sent a letter to the committee urging the
    amendment's adoption. The Senate version authorizes $100 million annual appropriation to
    help states and communities finance transportation projects to help welfare recipients get to
    work. In the House, Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chainnan Schuster had a $42
    million program in his budget-busting transportation proposal, which he has now abandoned in
                                                                      Hex.Dump Conversion

favor of a six-month extension of current law. Both these provisions would authorize funds that
would have to be appropriated each year.

     3. Welfare: Federal Welfare Hiring -- We expect to the federal agencies to have hired
more than 1,400 welfare recipients by October 1st, six months after making the commitment to
hire 10,000 in four years. The Vice President is considering highlighting this at a public
appearance next week.

     4. Healthcare: FDA Reform -- The Senate passed the FDA reform bill this week by an
overwhelming majority (98-2). As expected, the Senate bill did not sufficiently address our
outstanding concerns. The Committee of Jurisdiction in the House (Commerce) is currently
debating the legislation. We still are hopeful that we will be able to resolve any outstanding
issues before the bill is sent to you to sign, which will likely be in early November.

     5. Healthcare: New York Provider Tax - We are having been working closely with
HCFA and OMB on how to best proceed with regard to discussing the New York provider tax
issue with the state (and the other fifteen states that have provider taxes that may be inconsistent
with current law and/or regulation). Within the two weeks, we expect that HHS will be able
make an announcement that we will be able to take the following administrative steps to help the
state: (1) issue a regulatory notice that would modify the test for regional provider taxes. This
was the provision that we originally proposed in the balanced budget negotiation, it was rejected
by Senators Moynihan and D' Amato. It would allow NY state to get matching funds for these
taxes, which account for almost two-thirds of its 1993 to 1997 claims); (2) make other limited
changes in the current HHS tests that would make eligible New York and other state provider
taxes; and (3) disapprove waiver requests on other taxes from various states (including some NY
taxes). As there is keen interest among all Members of the New York Congressional delegation
and state politicians, we are having discussions with OMB and HHS as to how to ensure they all
are properly notified about this process.

        6. Healthcare: Genetic ScreeninglMedical Records Privacy -- There has been a great
deal of interest in response to your call in your SEIU speech for Congress to take immediate
action to pass legislation to improve consumers protections and quality health care. Senator
Jeffords has asked us for help in drafting legislative language on medical records privacy and the
Labor Committee plans to schedule another hearing on this issue in late October. The Labor
Committee also asked for a series of briefings on genetic discrimination. The first in a series of
these meetings took place with Senator Jeffords this week and was extremely well received.
Building on this issue, the Vice President is working with us and the Labor Department to
highlight the importance of ending genetic discrimination in the workplace.

        7. Healthcare: Consumer Bill of Rights - This week three leading health plans (Kaiser
Permanente, Group Health Cooperative ofPuget Sound, and HIP Health Insurance Plans) and
two national consumer groups (AARP and Families USA) released their principles for consumer
protections. Their principles included making health care services more accessible, giving


                                                 2
                                                                       Automated Records }.!anagement System
                                                                       Hex-Dump Conversion
    consumers a choice of plans, ensuring confidentiality, requiring full disclosure of benefits and
    other relevant processes, and guaranteeing coverage of emergency care. .While they stated that
    these protections should be national, they did not suggest a mechanism for enforcement. These
    recommendations received a great deal of media attention, thus enhancing Congressional interest
    in this issue. We believe this announcement helps lay the groundwork for the your Quality
    Commission's Consumer Bill of Rights that you requested be released this fall.
