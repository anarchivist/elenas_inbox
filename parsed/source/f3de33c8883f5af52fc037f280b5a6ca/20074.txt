        Weekly Report -- Welfare Reform Team
        5/28/98

        .         Welfare Reform -- State Reinvestment ofTANF Savings: During your meeting with
        Welfare-to-Work Partnership Board members last week you stressed the importance of states
        reinvesting their welfare savings in child care, transportation and training. We will work with
        HHS to analyze state expenditure data for TANF and child care. This data is not as timely as we
        would like. In the meantime, there is some encouraging information in the NGA Fiscal Survey
        of States released on May 27th. The way states are spending their welfare funds is shifting from
        cash to work-related supports. Comparing expenditures in 1996 with planned spending for
        1998, the percent of welfare spending on cash assistance dropped 27 percent (roughly
        comparable with caseload declines), while spending on child care increased by 55 percent and
        spending on work activities increased 34 percent. Total welfare spending declined by 9 percent,
        but given caseload reductions, this actually represents increased spending per person.
