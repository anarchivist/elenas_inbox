MEMORANDUM FOR ERSKINE BOWLES

THROUGH:           Jack Lew

FROM:      Donald R. Arbuckle

SUBJECT:           Increase in User Fees for Immigration Services

        We are about to complete review of a final rule from the
Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) that would raise user fees
for nearly two dozen INS services. Such services include naturalization
applications, work authorization requests, and adoption of overseas
children.  The final rule is based on a 1995 analysis of costs for these
services and is intended to fully fund the costs providing these
services. The overall cost effect of this change could add as much as
$272 million per year to INSO, Immigration Examinations Fee Account.   The
budget effects of this policy are reflected in the FY 99 Budget, and
senior Administration officials have told Congress that we need to publish
this rule to ensure solvency at the INS and to reduce the backlog of n
aturalization applications.

         The proposed rule received over 2,000 comments, most of which
opposed the increase
in fees.   Immigrant advocates are upset that INS continues to provide poor
service and that the naturalization backlog continues to grow -- yet
applicants will have to pay more under the new INS fee schedule. Most
immigrant groups believe that the fee increase should take effect only
after the INS significantly reduces the naturalization backlog. Groups
are seeking a one-time appropriation of funds to increase INSO,s backlog
reduction efforts.   Jack Lew recently spoke with Congressman Becerra,
Chairman of the Hispanic Caucus, who accepts the need for an immediate fee
increase but believes strongly that the higher fee should be used only to
process new applicants, while the backlog should be financed by some other
means.   Congressman Becerra agreed to work with us on an appropriate
strategy to resolve these issues.

        We believe that the benefits from this rule -- including program
solvency and, ultimately,  faster processing of applications -- justify
the increase in fees.  We would like to clear this rule by COB Monday.   If
you have any questions or concerns, please let me know immediately.
