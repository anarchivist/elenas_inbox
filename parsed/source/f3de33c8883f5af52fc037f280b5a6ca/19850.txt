The Honorable Nick J. Rahall II
Subcommittee on Aviation
Committee on Transportation and
US House of Representatives
washington, DC 20515-4803

Dear Congressman Rahall:

The Department of Transportation is aware of and supports your efforts to
address a concern regarding the explicit applicability of the Railway
Labor Act (RLA) to flight crew members of U.S. air carriers who are
stationed outside the United States. Many interests are engaged in this
issue, and we would like to suggest statutory clarification~ in two areas.

First, we would like to emphasize our strong interest in an even-handed
change that benefits all flight crew members stationed abroad. We
understand that some considerations argue for a partial solution as a
first step, but we advocate a uniform approach.

Second, a prime consideration for all parties is whether an adjustment of
U.S. law alone would accomplish the objectives of the proposed
legislation.  Each relevant foreign government has its own valid interest
in regulating labor relations within its borders. The legislation is
intended to apply to the establishment of terms and conditions of
employment of flight crew members working for U.S. air carriers. While
the work of these individuals takes place on board U.S. aircraft engaged
in international air service over U.S. routes, some foreign governments
are concerned that the proposed legislation could apply in an
extraterritorial manner and could conflict with their labor laws. To
address their concerns, we believe that the proposal could be easily mod
ified to relieve carriers from compliance if they demonstrate that
compliance conflicts with a foreign government's labor laws or regulations.

I would like to offer our support for ongoing efforts to advance a
legislati ve sO.lution to the issues faced by U. S. flight crew members in
this situation. This is an opportunity to resolve the issue in a way fair
to all concerned parties.


Sincerely,

Rodney E. Slater
