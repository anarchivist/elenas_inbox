TEXT:
OMB is up on the Hill trying to negotiate as much of our $2.5 billion food
stamp restoration for legal immigrants as possible as part of the Ag
research bill. There is agreement to spend $642 million on this, and OMB
is searching for additional offsets to get the number up to around $820
million.    OMB is trying to figure what part of our restoration package
(families with children, disabled, elderly) can get shoe-horned in to
equal that amount.  Congress is refusing to consider the feature of our
proposal that would help families with children who arrived after the law
was signed.

They are considering funding a bit of this by cutting back a bit in the
first year only on the food stamp employment/ training slots we got added
last year to help the 18-50 year olds. Apparently Greenstein is pushing
this and OMB is a bit reluctant to do it, but this money isn't getting
spent very fast by the states.                     I
