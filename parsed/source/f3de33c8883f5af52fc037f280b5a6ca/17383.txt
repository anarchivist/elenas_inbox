TEXT:
Reminder, we're looking for any comments on the SAP stating the veto
recommendation by Secs. Riley and Rubin by noon today. A copy of the SAP,
which was based on their October 9th letter, follows.


                                                                        October
16, 1997
                                                                           (House
Rules)

H.R. 2646 - Education Savings Act for Public and Private Schools
(Archer (R) Texas and Gingrich (R) Georgia)

If H.R. 2646 is presented to the President, the Secretaries of Education
and the Treasury would recommend that he veto the bill because it is bad
education policy and bad tax policy.

Every American child deserves a high quality elementary and secondary
education. Targeting limited Federal resources to build stronger public
schools will help ensure that all our Nation's children receive the
education they need to become productive citizens. H.R. 2646 would divert
needed resources from these schools.

H.R. 2646 would disproportionately benefit the most affluent families and
provide little benefit to lower- and middle-income families.  Families in
the highest income bracket that saved the maximum amount permitted by H.R.
2646'would receive more than twice the benefit of families in the lowest
tax bracket that saved the same amount.  Moreover, the bill would not
create a significant incentive for families to increase their savings for
educational purposes; it would instead reward families, particularly those
with substantial incomes, for what they already do.
