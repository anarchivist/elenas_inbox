TEXT:
FYI.   Eric Olsen called to say he had some concerns about a draft food
safety bill that OMB evidently sent around Friday for comment by today.
They put Chris Jennings and Jen K. on the distribution list, but not you
or I or Jerry M.

Eric said he, USTR, and Sally Katzen are appealing for more time.   I'm
getting copy of the bill which I'll get to you and Jerry.
