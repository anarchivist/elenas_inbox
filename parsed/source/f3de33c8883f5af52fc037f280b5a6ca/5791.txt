TEXT:
I read Mike's e-mail written after your discussion last night.  I thought
I ought to respond to you rather than to him. A couple of thoughts about
his last point, regarding the administrative feasibility of funding
community groups as a last resort.  Couldn't the Department address this
issue through the following steps:

1. The Department would announce that applications from community-based
groups would be reviewed only if the relevant LEA did not submit an
application, or submitted one that was judged to be of low quality and
therefore unacceptable, OR,

2. Applications from community-based groups must include a letter from
the relevant LEA indicating that the LEA   (1) is not itself applying for
the. funds and, (2) supports the community group's application if the group
proposes to use school facilities or resources for the program.   If the
community group is not going to use school resources, there is no need for
the LEA to indicate its support for the application.

I think either of these approaches gets us out of the business of
announcing a set aside, while adding only a slight bit of complexity to
the review process.
