TEXT:
Maria - I was told today that you have asked Peter & Elena to add some
"Haitian" language to the Treasury/Postal Appropriations conferees letter
that was in clearance today. Chuck Kieffer has asked that we get this
language tonight if possible so that we can finalize and release the
conferees letter tomorrow morning.  Thank you.
