Subject:          VP on sunset of cloning



The VP responded that he supports that the ban continues unless Congress

acts to discontinue the ban and that there should be something written

into the legislation that call for a general review (after 5 years) to

explore the safety and moral issues.      The VP said "a review, not a sunset

or expiration."



Hope that's helpful.    Thanks.
