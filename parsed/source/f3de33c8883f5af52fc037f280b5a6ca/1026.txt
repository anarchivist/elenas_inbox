TEXT:
We should do a short memo by the end of the day on where we stand with
respect to a handful of issues that will come up at the political
meeting. We can give the memo to Sylvia and Mark. We need a few
sentences on each idea and a reasonable deadline for when they could be
ready.  The issues we're on the hook for are:

IDEAS FROM LAST WEEK

AIDS vaccine (Chris/Nancy-Ann/Greg Simon)    -- need proposal within 2
weeks. Where are we right now?

Race Commission -- talk through with Sylvia (she thinks it's her
responsibility)

HMO Bill of Rts/Quality Commission (Chris)

Home health care reg (Chris) -- explain why it fell through.      Do we want
legislation in its place?


NEW IDEAS THEY ASKED ABOUT

Extradition of child pornographers (Dennis/Rahm)

Smoking web sites (Elizabeth) -- there's something about it in TIME or
Newsweek this week.  Mark wanted to talk about it at Friday's event.
