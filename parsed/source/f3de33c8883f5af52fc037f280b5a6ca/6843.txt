ADVISORY BOARD ACTIVITIES

        Denver Advisory Board Meeting. The Advisory Board held its seventh meeting March
        23-25 in Denver, CO. The topic of this meeting was race and stereotypes. It consisted
        of three parts, a community dialogue on March 23, an expert panel discussion on March
        24 and a youth town hall on March 25. Advisory Board members Dr. John Hope
        Franklin, Reverend Suzan Johnson, Governor William Winter, Linda Chavez-Thompson
        and Robert Thomas attended the meeting. Secretary Pena participated in the community
        dialogue and expert panel discussion.

        The community dialogue, which was attended by over 800 people, was interrupted by
        members of the public audience who took issue with the excl),lsion of an American Indian
        on the Advisory Board. Approximately 400 people attended the expert panel discussion
        the next day. At the youth town hall, which was held at Denver East High School and
        attended by 500 students, twenty-six students joined Governor Winter and myself on
        stage for a spirited dialogue on race relations.

        Los Angeles Promising Practices Visit. On March 26 and 27, Governor William
        Winter and I visited three promising practices sites in the Los Angeles area. We met
        with Students Talk About Race, an organization that trains college students to facilitate
        racial dialogues with middle school and high school students; Korean Youth and
        Community Center, which organized a multi-cultural leadership council; and the
        Community Fire Station 68 (of the Los Angeles Fire Department), a community-based
        organization that works to improve race relations among young adults in the Los Angeles
                                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion




     community.

     Children's Defense Fund (CDF) Conference. On March 28, Dr. John Hope Franklin,
     Governor William Winter, and I will participate in the CDF Community Forum in which
     we will hear from Los Angeles area students and discuss youth, race, and poverty.

OFFICE OF THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR

     One America Dialogue Guide. We completed the One America Dialogue Guide,
     which is a manual to assist groups in holding dialogues on race in their community. We
     will initially distribute the guide to campuses participating in the Campus Week of
     Dialogue, Governors, and YWCAs participating in the Statewide Days of Dialogue.

     Higher Education Leaders. On March 25, in conjunction with Maria Echaveste, we
     met with representatives from higher education institutions and higher education
     organizations to discuss their forming a coalition to promote the values of access and
     diversity in higher education. A primary role of the coalition would be to lead a
     coordinated campaign to educate the public about the values of access and divers,ity. We
