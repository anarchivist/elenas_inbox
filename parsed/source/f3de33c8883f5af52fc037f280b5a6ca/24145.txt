Subject:         IMPORTANT -- Heads up on line-item veto

Although this is NOT yet public information, the White House plans to
announce on Tuesday, October 14, that the President has used his line-item
veto authority on the Defense appropriations bill.

To help you explain the President's decision to your constituencies, OMB's
Jack Lew and Gordon Adams will hold a briefing on Tuesday morning, 9 a.m.,
in the Roosevelt Room, to outline the particulars.

We hope you find the briefing useful. We are trying to respond to the
concerns that many of you raised about having a sufficient heads-up and
understanding beforehand, so you can better do your own thing.

Please let me know whether you think we've left anyone off this list.
