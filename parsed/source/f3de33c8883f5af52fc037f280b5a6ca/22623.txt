TEXT:
lam sending the latest draft around to you.    See pp. 18-26 for the
revised (and beefed-up) state action argument.    Reasons HHS and SG (I
talked to Kneedler) think it's important to spell out state action point
are (1) to make sure Sup Ct appreciates importance of this case and grants
cert (rather than denying because it assumes there's state action here
even if it finds there isn't in Sullivan); and (2) to influence Ct's
writing of Sullivan opinion so that it doesn't say things that will
promote arguments for a distinction.
