TEXT:
Elena/Robyn-I have been informed that at present there is no intention to
do a meeting with the President on this.  He has before him the decision
memo prepared by DPC, which includes the views of various interest
groups.  Should we still do a phone call with the groups with Elena and
myself--Robyn what do you think and can we set something up this pm or
early am-- It seems to me in light Sylvia's suggestion that Elena and I do
the call--this probably should be done as soon as we have an answer so
that we can give heads up and get yelled at.  The prior request was for a
phone call to provide input to the decisionmakers--in such case, the phone
call required Sylvia or John's involvement. What do you all think?
