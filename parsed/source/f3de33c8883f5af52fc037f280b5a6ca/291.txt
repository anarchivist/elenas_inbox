TEXT:
I'd like to suggest an arrangement among our four offices
regardi'ng meetings on welfare implementation issues.  There is
almost no issue that any of us is going to hold a meeting on or
deal with that won't involve each of our offices - DPC, OMB,
General Counsel and Intergovernmental.
Can we agree to invite all four offices to any meetings we hold to
resolve implementation issues.   We may decide we don't need to
attend some of them, but then there won't be any question that we
at least know about them.
Meetings I know of this week:
- Ken's means-tested benefit meeting -- 3:00 today
- Elena food stamp meeting - 5:00 today
- Carol/Bruce inte'ragency meeting - 11: 00 tomorrow
- Immigration/legal issues meeting - 5:00 tomorrow
- NEC is having a meeting on the jobs stuff at 5:00 today as well
Bruce/Carol:. we'll let you know about meetings, but assume you
won't want to attend most unless you tell us otherwise.
