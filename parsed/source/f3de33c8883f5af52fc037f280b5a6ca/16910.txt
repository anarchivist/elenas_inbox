TEXT:
Today, Rutgers University released a study of a New Jersey's welfare
program demonstration which was started under a Bush Administration waiver
and superceded in February 1997 by a new time limited TANF plan.

The study found that the drop in birth rate among New Jersey's welfare
recipients could not be directly attributed to the state's family cap
program.  The program was also found to have had no impact on abortion
rate, which declined for both program and control groups during this time
period.  Some researchers have questioned whether the evaluation was able
to isolate the effects of the policy, since publicity of the state's
family cap may have led some in the control group to think they were
subjected to the family cap even though they were not.

The study also found that those in the education-focused Family
Development program were likely to stay on welfare longer.   The state
human services commissioner released a statement saying "What this tells
US is that encouraging people to enter lengthy education and training
programs is no guarantee of employment" noting that the state's new Work
First plan is more job-focused.
