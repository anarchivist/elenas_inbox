Subject:         High Tech support for National Education Standards/Testing

The following op-ed on the importance of national education standards and
testing is in the October issue of the Red Herring   (Red Herring is a
leading magazine/website devoted to high tech companies and investors) .

~   Public Education is our Most Important Business.
~   By John Doerr
~

~   Conventional wisdom says the only thing rarer in Silicon Valley than
~   political activism is political consensus. In this case, conventional
~   wisdom is correct. Which is why what happened last April 2 was
~   nothing short of extraordinary.
~


~   On one coast, at San Jose's Stonesgate Elementary School, Jim
~   Barksdale spoke for a group of high-technology executives that
~   included Gil Amelio, Eric Benhamou, John Chambers, Bernie Gifford,
~   Andy Grove, Brian Halla, Floyd Kvamme, Scott McNealy, John Morgridge,
~   Les Vadasz, and Jerry Yang.
~

~ On the other coast, Marc Andreessen, Steve Case, Esther Dyson,
~ Jonathan Grayer, John Kernan, Gilman Louie, Kim polese, and others
> joined Bill Clinton and Al Gore in the White House. Linked by


> satellite and a shared vision, these entrepreneurial leaders
> (representing more than 300 CEOs) had something to say--and about
> public policy, no less.
>
>  Now, understand: these folks aren't natural allies. Their companies
> are fierce rivals. And politically theY're allover the map--from
> neoconservative to neoliberal and from libertarian to faintly
> left-wing. Yet on one issue these CEOs stood on common ground. It is
> an issue of singular importance to the  new global, networked economy
> that the high-tech industry is helping to build.
>
>   The issue is education.
>
>   Yet another call for more computers in the classroom? For wiring the
>   schools? No. It was a call for something at once simpler and far more
>   ambitious: a call for every governor, education official, and school
>   board to push their states to adopt high, rigorous national education
>   standards. It was a call to transform our K*12 school system so that
>   by 2000 every 8-year-old is being tested in reading and every
>   12-year-old is being tested in math, with the results published each
>   year in a state-by-state, school-by-school, and class-by-class
>   education report.
>
> In business, keeping quantifiable track of outcomes is an understood
> necessity. As Intel's Andy Grove puts it, "If you don't measure it,
> you can't manage it." The case for applying this same logic to
> education is, you would think, equally obvious. "This is common
> sense," .Mr. Barksdale, a veteran of FedEx and McCaw and now of
> Netscape, says. "Can you imagine a $300 billion a year business that
> doesn't measure its results?"
>
>    It is, in fact, an accurate description of the U.S. public school
>   system. So far six states--Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts,
>   Michigan, North Carolina, and West Virginia--have committed to
>   adopting national education standards. California is considering
>   joining them. That's a start, to be sure: those seven states account
>   for 20 percent of America's kids. But it's only a start. And the
>   situation is getting desperate.
>
>   The Crisis
>   Crisis is the right word to use in discussing the state of education.
>   Among America's 8-year-olds, fully 40 percent are reading below grade
>   level. When kids aren't getting it, not learning or making progress,
>   they turn off to education. They fall further and further behind. And
>   then, all too often, we lose them forever.
>
>   Our K*12 public education system is, in the strictest sense, a
>   state-run monopoly rife with "social promotion." Which means: so long
>   as you don't make too much trouble, you ride the conveyor belt from
>   grade to grade regardless of how much you learn or whether, indeed,
>   you learn at all.
>
>   Outcomes don't matter until you get to college. Then, suddenly,
>   outcomes matter--a lot. In California, for example, an astonishing 60
>   percent of incoming college freshmen are forced to take remedial
>   English or bonehead algebra classes just to stay afloat.
>
>    Why does this matter? Because in the new knowledge-based economy,
>   even the jobs on the factory floor require fairly sophisticated
>   symbolic reasoning.  You can't run a wafer stepper at Intel without


>   being able to do statistical process control. And you can't do
>   statistical process control without being able to do algebra.
>
> By failing to teach more than half our kids the most elementary of
> skills, America's K*12 system is leaving them fundamentally ill
> equipped to survive in this new economy. It's hard to imagine a more
> searing indictment--or one with more dangerous consequences for the
> new economy itself.
>
>   The New Economy
>   Let's be clear. The campaign by high-tech leaders for education reform
>   is one that's deeply self-interested. Without it, the new economy will
>   face huge obstacles.
>
> By   no~, everybody has heard about the new economy. Its pillars are the
>   microchip, the PC, the Internet, and genomics. Between 1980 and 1990,
>   PC companies grew from zero to $100 billion in revenues and market
>   value. The industries emerging around the Net are expanding at least
>   three times as fast. For Internet entrepreneurs, "normal" growth is 6
>   percent a month.
>
>   Such growth is unprecedented, and so are the broad economic benefits.
>   In Silicon Valley unemployment is at 3 percent. Wages are at an
>   all-time high. Upward mobility is not just for those at the top of the
>   ladder. Everyone seems to be moving up--and unlike the situation in
>   so many places in the United States, the gap between the richest and
>   poorest in Silicon Valley isn't widening.
>
> This isn't happening only in Santa Clara County. It's also happening
> in Austin, in Denver, in Seattle, in Boston, in Raleigh-Durham, in
> Salt Lake City, and in South Dakota. The new economy, we're
> discovering, isn't a strange phenomenon that flourishes exclusively in
> Silicon Valley. It can happen anywhere and benefit everyone. But if
> that's going to happen, big changes in education are necessary. In the
> new economy, the scarcest and most precious commodities are
> intelligence, resourcefulness, and innovation. The new economy's
> ability to achieve its full potential will be retarded if it doesn't
> have a continuous and voluminous supply of strong minds to feed off
> of.
>
> Right now, the   failure of America's public school system is putting
> that supply in   jeopardy.
>
>   The System is the Problem
>   I can already hear the cynics sneering, "Yes, yes. OK, John. Everyone
>   agrees that improving education would be a Good Thing. That's apple'
>   pie. But what do you techies know about getting there? You haven't the
>   foggiest clue about school boards and teachers unions and education
>   policy. Consider all this talk about wiring the classrooms. We don't
>   need Cat 5 wiring. We need the roofs repaired. And more money. And
>   shorter school days for overworked teachers. Go back to your garage
>   startups. Leave public education alone. You just don't get it."
>
>   To which I reply, "With all due respect, yeah, right." For decades,
>   public education has been the sole province of powerful, entrenched
>   bureaucracies of self-styled experts who supposedly "get it." Look
>   where that's got us. The problem isn't with teachers, many of whom are
>   dedicated and caring and energetic. The problem isn't with parents,
>   who want nothing more than for their children to succeed and are
>   willing to work to see that happen. And the problem certainly isn't


>   with our, kids, who desperately want to learn.
>
>   The problem is the system.
>
>    What are the solutions to reforming the system? The first thing to
> realize is that there is no silver bullet.   There never is. Education
>   is complicated, subtle, and demanding. But it isn't rocket science.
>   Allover the country, experiments have produced affordable, scalable
>   programs with tangible results. We don't know everything. But we do
>   know some things that get kids reading and learning math.
>
> Smaller classes and smaller schools.   Teachers who have the time and
>   the incentives to be better prepared. Intense parental involvement.
>   Excellence and equity. Charter schools.
>
>    Crucially, accountability: holding schools and teachers responsible
>   for their students' performance. Testing. Choice. Competition.
>   Leadership.
>
>   Ultimately, the quest for education reform will fail if it's left to
>   the politicians. They're necessary but not sufficient. This is a
>   movement that needs to be driven from,the outside by those who have
>   the best understanding of the new economy and the greatest stake in
>   it. That means you.
>
>   What You Can Do
>   First, you can join the campaign for national and state education
>   standards in reading and math. To learn more and sign on, see the
>   National Education Standards at www.technetwork.org beginning in
>   September.
>
>   Second, you can invest in the New Schools Fund. A couple of months
>   ago, several of us started a novel venture fund to put money in the
>   hands of education innovators--people who are interested in starting
>   up charter schools or in backing schools that could use a boost or in
>   turning around schools that are really in trouble. For about' $50, 000,
>   you--and some friends or coinvestors or your company--can make a
>   lasting impact on a school. For more data, check out
>   www.newschools.org, which is scheduled to go up this fall.
>
>   Third, if you're a parent, do two things. Read to your kids every
>   night. And honor their teachers with your time, your passion, and your
>   support.
>
>    Finally, you can get smart on these issues and get the word out. You
>   are respected in your community, so put that respect to work. Recruit
>   your friends and your coworkers to join this crusade. Don't give a
>   single speech or a single press briefing or let any public opportunity
>   pass by without talking about the new economy and explaining the
>   critical need for education reform.
>
>   Bottom line? There's lots of work to be done. Lots of elected
>   officials and educators to contact, to wheedle, to cajole, to
>   irritate. Lots of minds to be changed. But time is short. Our kids
>   can't wait. And neither can we.
