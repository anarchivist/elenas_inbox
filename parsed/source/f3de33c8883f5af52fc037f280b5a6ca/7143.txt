Subject:         Weekly Reports

  Mickey asked me to find out if it would be possible to receive a copy of
  your office's weekly report each week after you have submitted it to the
  Staff Secretary. We can send someone to you to come copy it each Monday
. if that would help.  Please let me know what you think.  Thanks!
