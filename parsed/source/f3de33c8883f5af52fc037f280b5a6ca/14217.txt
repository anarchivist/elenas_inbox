     I have done some quick research on the redetermination process for Medicaid,
     once an individual is cut-off of SSI and would otherwise lose their categorical
     Medicaid eligibility. Current Medicaid regulations state that:

     the Agency must promptly redetermine eligibility when it receives information
     about changes in the recipients status that affects eligibility. ( 42 CFR
     435.916)
     for recipients determined ineligible for SSI, FFP is available in Medicaid
     expenditures for services 1} through the end of the month, if the Agency
     receives the SSA notice before the lOth, unless the recipient requests a
     hearing; or 2} through the end of the following month, if the Agency receives
     notice after the 10th, unless the recipient requests a hearing. (42 CFR
     435.1003)

     The rule explicitly states that FFP is only available during these strict
     timeframes. This means that the individual will retain their Medicaid
     eligibility through the redetermination process, but only within the 20-50 day
     time period (depending when the SSA notifies the Medicaid office), unless they
     request a hearing.

     Thus, it would appear that if a Medicaid office could not complete a
     recipient's redetermination in a high workload period, that individual could
i.


     lose Medicaid eligibility, unless they request a hearing.

     To address this, HCFA could issue a direct final rule, extending the time
     frames for redetermination, in certain circumstances. This would provide State
     Medicaid offices with the flexibility to handle the likely surge in
     applications for redetermination from the disabled child and immigrant
     populations.
