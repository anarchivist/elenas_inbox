PRELIMINARY STAFF DRAFT -- NOT FOR RELEASE -- \d

TESTIMONY OF
ALICE M. RIVLIN
DIRECTOR, OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET
BEFORE A JOINT HEARING OF THE
SENATE BUDGET COMMITTEE
and the
HOUSE BUDGET COMMITTEE

September 19,· 1995

[LARRY:   NOTE-
D
-I HAVE RUN THE TESTIMONY BY TREASURY; WE SHOULD
LEAVE THE DEBT LIMIT LANGUAGE PRETTY MUCH INTACT)

        Chairman Domenici and Chairman Kasich, Members of the two
committees, I welcome the opportunity today to answer your
questions on the implications of a hiatus in appropriations
authority and reaching the statutory limit on the public debt.
        There's been a lot of talk in recent days about a government
shutdown in connection with the beginning of the new fiscal year,
as well as the nearing of the debt ceiling.  Let me say, at the
outset, that the President strongly believes that a government
shutdown of any kind would be bad for the country. We need to
arrive at policy decisions on budgetary priorities in an orderly
way -- not in a crisis atmosphere.
        The President has urged Congress to complete action on all
13 appropriations bills by the October 1 start of fiscal 1996.
If this cannot be done, I hope we can agree on a continuing
resolution that does not contain controversial riders or
prejudice the outcome of the debate.
        In addition, I hope the Congress will act responsibly and
send the President an increase in the debt ceiling. Failure to


do so could disrupt Treasury borrowing operations, cause market
uncertainty as to the Government's fiscal operations, and impose
significant additional costs on American taxpayers.

Appropriations hiatus vs. Debt Ceiling
        Before addressing specific shutdown issues, it's worth
taking a moment, to clarify the distinction between a lapse in
appropriations authority and reaching the debt ceiling.

        Lapse in appropriations authority.     If any of the 13

appropriations bills have not been enacted by October 1 -- and a
continuing resolution has also not been enacted -- affected
departments and agencies will experience a lapse in legal
o
authority   to   enter into certain obligations. This includes the
authority   to   provide important services and to employ Federal
workers.    As   I will explain in a moment, any lapse in such
authority   is   bad for the country and should be avoided.

        Lapse in borrowing authority.   By contrast, reaching the
statutory limit on the public debt -- often called the debt
ceiling -- is a very different scenario. If the debt ceiling is
reached, the Treasury will lack the authority to borrow
additional funds.   The Treasury Department currently estimates
the debt ceiling will be reached some time towards the end of
October. When monthly tax receipts are not sufficient to cover
outlays, the inability to borrow would result in a cash
shortfall, leaving the Treasury without adequate cash to pay the
government's bills.
        The United States has never defaulted on its obligations in
the more than 200 year history of the Republic. A defaul~ on the
debt of the United States is unthinkable. The Administration
trusts and expects that the Congress will protect the financial
integrity of the United States, by raising the debt ceiling as
the Secretary of the Treasury has requested.
        The Secretary of the Treasury is happy to answer any
particular questions you or other Members of Congress have about
the debt ceiling.   The one point I want to emphasize today is
that the Administration, in the strongest possible terms,
respectfully urges the Congress to de
o
-couple the issues of the
debt ceiling and balancing the budget. Using the debt ceiling to
force a particular outcome in ongoing budget deliberations -- as
some have suggested -- is irresponsible. It makes no sense to
bring the country to the edge of default and financial chaos, in
order to force the budget debate to a particular result.

Lapse in appropriations authority

        The issue of immediate concern is the possibility of a lapse
in appropriations authority.
        Appropriations laws provide departments and agencies with
legal authority to enter into obligations to provide services,
employ workers, and enter into contracts.  Some appropriations
are annual, whereas others are multiyear, and others are
permanent.
        Where appropriations for government programs, projects and
activities are made annually, A failure to pass appropriations by


October 1 -- the start of the new fiscal year -- would cause a

lapse in legal authority to enter into obligations.
        It is a violation of Federal law for any employee to
obligate the government in advance of appropriations, except as
authorized by law as, for example, in the case of "emergencies
involving the safety of human life or the protection of
property."  (Other exceptions include: authority to enter into
obligations which enable the President to perform constitutional
duties; authority to employ workers involved in implementing a
shutdown; and authority to employ workers to administer programs
which have permanent or multi
o
-year appropriations authority).
        A lapse in appropriations authority on October 1 could have
far
o
-reaching and deleterious consequences.  The particular
implications would, of course, depend on which appropriations
bills are not enacted by October 1. A few examples of the
consequences of permitting appropriations authority for various
agencies to lapse are:
? No food stamps would be issued after October 1;
? WIC would stop within days since no new money would be
disbursed and the small existing balances would be depleted;
? The National Parks would have to close, as there would be no
money to pay the Park Service Rangers and employees"; and
? Veterans compensation, pension, and survivors benefits checks
would not be sent out on November 1.

Furloughing government employees
        In addition to the government activities and services which
would cease during a lapse in appropriations authority, agencies
would lack authority to continue to employ Federal workers,
exc~pt as authorized by law.
        Substantial furloughs could therefore result if a lapse in
appropriations authority occurs on October 1. The Administration
is concerned about the disruptive effects that a government
shutdown would have on federal employees and their families.
These workers do the peoples' business every day and are in the
forefront of our efforts to reinvent government. They should not
be used as pawns as we try to work through the difficult budget
decisions that lie before us.


Costs of a government shutdown
         In addition to the deleterious impact on the users of
Federal services and on Federal employees, a government shutdown
of any size or duration would have a price tag.   These costs
include: the costs of closing and securing Federal buildings and
facilities; and the payment of penalties and other charges
associated with the unanticipated cessation of contractual
liabilities. In addition, the productivity of Federal employees
would undoubtedly be diminished even after a shutdown has ended
as they have to perform the services that were not done during
the shutdown.

A shutdown is unnecessary and should be avoided
        The message here, for all of us, is that a lapse in
appropriations authority is bad for everyone.   It would cause.a


 lapse in many important and vital services, would needlessly
 furlough Federal workers, and would needlessly cost the taxpayers
 money. A government shutdown of any size or duration would
 benefit no one and should be avoided.
         That is why the Administration has been urging the Congress
 to complete action on all 13 appropriations bills by the October
 1 start of fiscal 1996.   If this cannot be done I hope we can
 agree on a continuing resolution --
          (1) is "clean," i.e., does not contain controversial riders
 or extraneous language; and
 (2) does not prejudice the outcome of the appropriations
 debate by attempting to lock new priorities into place or
 terminate existing programs.

 Preparations
         Despite our strong hope that a shutdown can be avoided, we
 must be prepared for all contingencies.  Therefore, on August 22,
 1995 I directed the heads of all executive departments and
 agencies to send to OMB updated contingency plans to deal with a
 funding hiatus.
         At this time, I can tell you that all of the agencies have
 responded to our request that they update their existing shutdown
 plans. Completed plans have been received from all agencies
 except the Department of Defense which has provided us their

 preliminary conclusions pending completion of their plan on
 September 25. As you can imagine, the Defense Department must
 deal with a wide range of activities in developing a final plan.
 OMB has reviewed the shutdown plans to insure that there is a
 consistent approach across the government, although the specific
 decisions are the responsibility of the agency heads. Other than
 the Department of Defense, we will have completed our analysis of
 all plans by the end of this week.


 Conclusion
         The Administration is fully prepared to handle a government
 shutdown on October 1 if that is made necessary by a lapse in
 appropriations for some departments and agencies.   However, a
 government shutdown, of any size or duration, will needlessly
 deprive our citizens of important services, hurt Federal
 employees, and 60st money.   I strongly urge the Congress to
 complete action on all 13 appropriations bills by the October 1
 start of fiscal 1996. If this cannot be done I hope we can agree
 on a continuing resolution that does not contain controversial
 riders or prejudice the outcome of the debate.
