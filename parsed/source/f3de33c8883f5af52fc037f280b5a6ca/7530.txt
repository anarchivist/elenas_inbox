Settlement Talks Break Off as Tobacco Trial Nears End

          Talks for a $5 billion-plus settlement of Minnesota's tobacco
lawsuit have broken off, both sides said
          on Thursday.

          The impasse was reported hours after a judge presented jury
instructions seen as damaging to the
          tobacco companies, and as the companies prepared to deliver
their closing arguments in the closely
          watched case.

          Andy Czajkowski, chief executive of Blue Cross and Blue Shield
of Minnesota, which is suing the
          companies along with the state, said talks had ended and
described as --extremely slim"   the chances


         of a settlement.

         Closing arguments were planned for Thursday and Friday.

          The state and Blue Cross filed the lawsuit in 1994 to recover
the $1.77 billion they say they have
          spent treating smoking-related diseases. They are also seeking
punitive damages.
