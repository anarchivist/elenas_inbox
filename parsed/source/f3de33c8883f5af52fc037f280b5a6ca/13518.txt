        ?X<TPOxI am returning without my approval H.R. 1833, which would
        prohibit docto
        rs from performing a certain kind of abortion.  I
        do so because the bill does n
        ot allow women to protect themselves
        from serious threats to their health. By
        refusing to permit
        women, in reliance on their doctors' best medical judgment,
        to


?@<
 bI
use
 bI
this procedure when their lives are threatened or when their
health is put in s
erious jeopardy, the Congress has fashioned a
bill that is consistent neither w
ith the Constitution nor with
soundK bIsurely unconstitutional, just as it is s
urely contrary to
soundK public policy.

x I have always believed that the decision to have an
abortion generally should
 be between a woman, her doctor, her
?<conscience, and her God.  I support the decision in Roe v. Wade
protecting a
woman's right to choose, and I believe that the
abortions protected by that dec
ision should be safe and rare.
Consistent with that decision, I have long oppo
sed lateterm
?<abortions except where necessary to protect the life or health of
the mother.
  In fact, as Governor of Arkansas, I signed into law
a bill that barred third
trimester abortions, with an appropriate
exception for life or health.

xThe procedure described in H.R. 1833 has troubled me deeply,
as it has many pe
ople.  I cannot support use of that procedure on
an elective basis, where the a
bortion is being performed for nonhealth related reasons and there are equally
safe medical
procedures available.

xThere are, however, rare and tragic situations that can
occur in a woman's pre
gnancy in which, in a doctor's medical
judgment, the use of this procedure may
be necessary to save a
woman's life or to protect her against serious injury to
 her
health. Medical conditions can develop at a stage in the
pregnancy such t
hat the use of this procedure becomes the best or
the only feasible way of pres
erving the life or the serious
health interests of the woma~, including her abi
lity to have
children in the future.  In these situations, in which a woman
                                                           ,
and
 her family must make an awful choice, the Constitution
requires, as it should,
 that the ability to choose this procedure
be protected.

xI cannot sign H.R. 18"33, as drafted, because it fails to


     protect women in such
      dire circumstances because by treating
     doctors who use the procedure in these
      tragic cases as criminals,
     the bill poses a danger of serious harm to women.
     This bill, in
     curtailing the ability of women and their doctors to choose the
     p
     rocedure for sound medical reas.ons, violates the constitutional
     command that an
     y law regulating abortion protect both the life
     and the health of the woman. T
     he bill's overbroad criminal
     prohibition risks that women will suffer serious i
     njury.

     xl earlier proposed to Congress that it pass appropriate"h)O*O*O*l"legislation
     regarding this procedure.  I told Congress that I
     would support H.R. 1833 if it
      were amended to make clear that the
     prohibition did not apply to situations in
      which the selection of
     the procedure, in the medical judgment of the attending

     physician, was necessary to preserve the life of the woman or
     avert serious ad
     verse consequences to
      bI
     her health.
      bI
     A bill amended
     in this way would have struck a proper balance, reserving this
     t
     roubling procedure for those rare circumstances where it is
     necessary.

     xCongress chose not to take this sensible and
     constitutionally appropriate path
     , instead leaving women
     unprotected against bIfrom serious health risks.   As a
      result of this
     Congressional indifference to women's health and safety, I
     cann
     ot, in good conscience and consistent with my responsibility
     ?<to uphold the law, sign this legislation.      ================== END ATTACHMENT
