TEXT:
Shortly, you will receive a faxed copy of the draft OMB letter to the
House Human Resources Subcommittee that expresses the Administration's
views on the Chairman's mark of the "human resources" budget
reconciliation language (see LRM MDH86).  The Subcommittee may mark up
language tomorrow.  For this reason, comments are due to me by 9 am
tomorrow morning (6/5/97).

 If we do not receive comments from you by the deadline, we will assume
 that you have no objection. Thanks for your help.
