Eddie Correia is no longer talking about doing the wage gap as a race
issue but now would like to resolve the 60-2 form issue at Labor.

Subject:         wage Data Collection

        Thanks for the update on the efforts to develop a legislative
position on wage data collection. At one point I suggested to Elena that
we concentrate on collecting wage data regarding race while you
concentrate on wage data regarding gender. Upon reflection, that makes no
sense. Instead, I think we should pursue the issue of collecting wage data
from federal contractors. As we discussed, there are some concerns in DOL
about whether and how this should be done, and there is considerable
interest by outside groups in whatever we do. I have sent a suggestion to
Chuck and Maria that we meet with DOL to hear the arguments. We would work
closely with you and welcome your participation in any discussions.
