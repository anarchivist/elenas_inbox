TEXT:
A general thought re: the weekly -- is there a reason why we can't get a
copy of what goes in every week after it goes in -- maybe at Monday's team
leaders meeting? Whenever I get a copy after the fact (because POTUS has
sent back a comment) I am struck by how it gives me such a good snapshot
of what we're all doing.

The health and welfare folks should provide summaries of Congrssional
action (for health, on medicare, medicaid and children, and for welfare,
on the $3 bilion, privatization, and flsa).  Mike: I think it may make
sense to do a paragraph or two on the c-best issue; let me know if you
disagree. Jose/Leanne: the same for our immigration issues.   Thanks.
