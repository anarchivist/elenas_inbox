Subject: Adhoc: Cloning Legislation

Colleagues:



I am writing   to bring everyone up to speed on the status of the
anti-cloning   legislative proposals, and to ask for help. Please note
that while I   am borrowing the Ad Hoc Group's List Serve capacity, I am
not speaking   for the Ad Hoc Group.

Senators Feinstein and Kennedy have introduced a bill ( S1602) as has
Senator Bond (S 1599). Bonds has been re-introduced with Sen. Lott as
main sponsor ( S. 1601) in order to make it a leadership bill.

The Bond bill prohibits th~ use of somatic cell nuclear transfer
technology. It prohibits the use of this technology to produce an embryo
from the earliest stages, but it does n6t define the term somatic cell
anywhere.

The Kennedy/Feinstein Bill contains clear definitions, has a federal
preemption, has a sunset in 10 years, and it makes illegal any attempt
to implant an embryo produced from cloning into a woman's uterus.

We think the Bond bill is very dangerous for the medical research
community.  It makes the use of a specific technology in medical
research a federal crime, punishable by 10 years in prison.

Its broad prohibition and imprecise wording endanger many areas of
medical research including gene therapy and stem cell research.  It also
poses risks for several promising infertility treatments.

We expect an attempt to bring the Bond (now the Lott) bill to the floor
of the Senate as early as Thursday, and certainly by early next week.

I hope that regardless of where you or your organization stand on
cloning or cloning legislation, you will at least object to the bringing
this measure to the floor in such a hurry.  I would urge you to contact
members of the Senate and ask them to avoid acting on this with such
haste and instead deal with this matter in the serious deliberative
manner it deserves.

Please feel free to contact me with questions or comments.
