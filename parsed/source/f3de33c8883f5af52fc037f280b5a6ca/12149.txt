TEXT:
Kris Balderston mentioned to me that he spoke to you regarding the
National Teacher of the Year event (week of April 19th). I know that
Cabinet Affairs is pushing hard to get this on the schedule (apparently
every President has done this for years). This is the also the week we
talked about doing the ESEA rollout.

I wanted to see if you have any thoughts or reactions to your conversation
with Kris, and just wanted to check on the status in general.

Let me know.   Thanks!
