TEXT:
Cabinet Affairs will invite you to a meeting tomorrow at 3:30 to discuss
how to respond to the letter from Colin Powell suggesting that the
President/VP/FL should attend some of the mini-summits being planned
around the country. Ann Lewis and Jen Palmieri are supposed to be there.

I'm not sure how much it will focus on his schedule vs. throw around the
old question of our involvement with America's Promise.  I'll be there, so
if you don't want to go, let me know if you have anything you'd like me to
convey .
