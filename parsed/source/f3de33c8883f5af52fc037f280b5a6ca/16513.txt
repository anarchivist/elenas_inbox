 TEXT:
 We have been working with NEC, CEA, OMB, HHS, Treasury, and Labor on a
 possible paper for the 8/22 welfare anniversary that would outline how
 many people must leave welfare for work and whether jobs will be available
 for them. Attached is the outline of such a paper by Emil Parker; Cynthia
 asked me to forward it to you to see if you think we are heading in the
 right direction and if you think such a paper would be worth doing.

 We are not entirely confident such a paper can be done well and serve our
 purposes. Two methodology questions have arisen that can probably be
 resolved.  First, HHS has been very slow to agree with us on what should
 be measured, and doesn't want to use the law's requirements as a benchmark
 for success.  (By the way, they now agree that their goal for NPR purposes
 should exactly match the President's goal of moving 1 million people to
 work in the year 2000.)   On the jobs side, while the economist-types thi
 nk the analysis will probably show there will be enough jobs absent a
 recession, they are reluctant to project the number of jobs that will be
 available. They argue instead we can prove our point by pointing to
 analogous past experiences like the 80's immigration wave, where new
 workers were absorbed.

 In addition to the thorny question of who should author this, the final
 concern is perhaps most important:  it seems quite possible that the
 analysis will show that, because of the huge caseload reduction to date,
 not that many people will actually have to go to work in a given year for
 the law to succeed. This was Sawhill's finding.

Number of jobs needed

There are at least two ways to think about this concept:

1)     Number required to participate in work activities under the bill (national estimate)

Possible Assumptions:         a. No case load growth between 1997 and 2000; or a modest
                              decline or increase in the caseload between 1997 and 2000 (e.g.,
                              consistent with prior law CBO or HHS projections).
                              b. Upper bound: all those participating in work activities would
                              be in subsidized or unsubsidized employment; lower bound:
                              percentage of recipients working (i.e., with earnings) equal to
                              double the figure under prior law--e.g., roughly 20 percent of the
                              caseload, as opposed to 10 percent under AFDC.
                              c. Single-parent households with a child under one would be
                              excluded from the denominator; or a percentage of these cases
                              would be excluded, if a substantial number of States have set the
                              exemption level at less than a year.
                              d. Growth in child-only cases as a share of the caseload to be
                              projected by fitting a curve to the historical data (curve fitting to be
                              explored by CEA).
                              e. The percentage of cases with two parents remains constant.


The estimated caseload reduction credit would be based on the reduction from 1995 through
1997 and the caseload growth assumptions for subsequent fiscal years. The percentage of
recipients who would have been employed under prior law (i.e., with earnings) could be deducted
from the participation figures to determine the number actually in need of/entering employment
as a result of welfare reform. This is the approach taken in the Urban Institute paper.

 2)    Number who will reach the five-year time limit
       Number who will reach a two-year time limit (national estimates)

       Estimate the number of recipients who will be on assistance for a cumulative total of 60
       months between the date of enactment and, for example, 2005 (since no one will reach
       the five-year limit in the year 2000; also see "available jobs" discussion below).

       Estimate the number who will accumulate 24 months between date of enactment and
       2000.

The actual figure will lie between these two numbers, since sixteen States, including Florida,
                                                        Automated Records Management System
                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion

    Illinois, Massachusetts, North and South Carolina, have set full-family time limits of two years
    (or less, in Tennessee and Connecticut). Four other States have time limits greater than 24
    months but less than 60. [source: HHS State pages].


    Number of suitable jobs available

           The figure should be based on the number of low-skill jobs that BLS estimates will be
           produced over the relevant period--1997 through 2000 (through 2005 for purposes of the
           five-year time limit number).

    The paper provided by Ed Montgomery of Labor summarizes the BLS job growth projections for
    the period from 1994 to 2005. The economy is, for example, expected to create about 20
    million new jobs requiring only short-term training and experience. At least eight of the 20
    occupations that are predicted to experience the greatest numerical (as opposed to percentage)
    increases over the period are jobs that welfare recipients could realistically obtain, including
    home health aide, cashier, janitor, guard, receptionist and child care worker.

    The paper also includes a brief discussion of labor force growth, suggesting that BLS also
    publishes projections in this area.

           If possible, estimated growth in low-skill jobs would be compared to the projected
           increase, absent welfare reform, in labor force members with no more than a high school
           diploma or OED and little training or experience.

    Possible Assumptions:         a. Job growth spread evenly over the 1994-2005 period--the
                                  1997-2000 figure would be a pro-rated share of the total.
                                  b. Steady labor force growth over the period.


    Conclusion

    The number of jobs needed (under the two frameworks discussed above) would be compared to
    the difference between projected growth in low-skill jobs and estimated growth in labor force
    participants with no postsecondary education and little or no training/experience. Net growth in
    low-skill positions greater than the number of jobs needed would suggest that the economy can,
    even in the short term, absorb the labor supply shock resulting from welfare reform.

    NOTE: In any case, part or all ofthe CEA displacement paper that discusses past labor supply
    shocks (the baby boom, the Mariel boatlift) should be either folded into or released along with
    this "jobs needed/available" paper.
