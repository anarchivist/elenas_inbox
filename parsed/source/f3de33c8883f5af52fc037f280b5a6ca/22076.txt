Welfare: Before the holidays, Shalala submitted a memo to the President on
TANF spending trends.  Sta"ff Secretary would like to submit it this
weekend, which seems reasonable, so we've prepared a cover memo from
Bruce.  The fax will have the Secretary's memo attached.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:          Bruce Reed

SUBJ:          Secretary Shalala's Report on State Welfare Spending

The attached memo from Secretary Shalala provides a useful update on state welfare reform
spending trends. While this is a preliminary snapshot of spending, the analysis shows that
through June 1998 states spent only about three-quarters of available funds, leaving about $3
billion unobligated. There is growing concern among states and some advocates that these
surpluses may make T ANF an attractive target for budget savings. Others worry that states are
not doing enough to invest in welfare reform, although, even with these savings states are
actually spending more per person than before reform while spending less overall due to caseload
declines. On the other hand, these surpluses, which can be carried over from year to year, will
help provide assistance to additional families if needed during an economic downturn.

To identify the reasons for these trends, HHS surveyed the 12 states with the lowest obligation
rates, which together account for 80% of the total unobligated funds (CA, FL, KA, LA, MN, NJ,
NY, OK, P A, W A, WV, WI). Key factors identified by the states include:

        1) Unexpectedly large caseload reductions provided states with unforeseen funds which
        they have not yet spent. For example, Minnesota, anticipating caseload increases due to
        expanded eligibility rules, had actually cut back on some support services. In light of
        unanticipated caseload reductions, the state plans to increase these services.

        2) Early stages ofTANF implementation. Many fiscal and policy decisions made by
        Governors and state legislators had not taken effect as of last June. For example,
        California's new law did not take effect until January 1998, which means counties didn't
        start bringing large numbers of people into the program and spending new funds until
        mid- to late-1998.

        3) Saving for possible economic downturns. States are saving money in rainy day
        fu'nds to ensure they have adequate resources to meet future spending requirements. For
        example, Florida's legislature required a $250 million rainy day fund (which represents
        43 percerit of their FY 1998 block grant). In addition, states are spending state funds
        before federal funds in order to meet the maintenance of effort requirement. This
        requirement, which is a fixed percentage of each state's historic spending levels, must be
        met each year regardless of total spending level while federal money may be carried over
        to future years.
                                                                 Hex~Dump Conversion

       4) Some states have concrete plans in place for investing T ANF resources, while others
       do not. The Secretary recommends that we continue to send a strong message about the
       importance of maintaining investments in low-income working families.

The Secretary's report shows that more states are beginning to use their flexibility to transfer
funds from T ANF to the Social Services Block Grant and the Child Care Block Grant. By the
third quarter of FY 1998, twenty-seven states -- or double the number from the prior quarter --
transferred some funds, although the amount transferred is well below the maximum allowed.
There are indications from states that these transfers will increase, which should increase overall
T ANF spending.

While not specifically referenced in Secretary Shalala's report, it is important to remember that
caseloads have fallen by more than one-third from the base years used to calculate the T ANF
block grant, so even if states spend only 75 percent of their block grant funds this year, they are
actually investing more per person. GAO estimates that, nationwide, states had nearly 40
percent more federal funds per recipient under T ANF in 1997 than they had in the prior year
under AFDC.
                                                                   He.l-Dump Conversion
                President Clinton Continues the Fight Against Youth Smoking
                                          114 Draft

Last fall, President Clinton declared the $206 billion multi-state tobacco settlement a step in the
right direction and said enacting national tobacco legislation to finish the job would be one of his
top priorities in the next Congress. In the coming months, he will push a comprehensive agenda
to reduce youth smoking and hold the tobacco industry accountable for targeting children.

                   Reimburse Taxpayers for the National Costs of Tobacco

The $206 billion multi-state settlement with the tobacco industry will reimburse states for
tobacco-related medical costs. Now it's time for the federal taxpayers to obtain the same relief.

Costs to Our Armed Forces, Veterans, and Federal Employees. Every year, the Department
of Defense, Veterans Affairs, and the Federal Employees Health Benefit Program spend more
than $7 billion in tobacco-related health costs for members of the anned forces, veterans, and
federal employees who smoke or use tobacco products. Federal taxpayers, like those in the
states, deserve reimbursement for these tobacco-related health costs, and this year's budget will
include a $.55 per pack tobacco excise tax to pay for these $7-billion-a-year tobacco-related
costs.

Costs to Medicare. Tobacco-related health problems cost the Medicare program billions of
dollars over the last three decades making it more difficult to preserve and protect Medicare for
the 21 st century. To recover these losses, the U.S. Department of Justice intends to bring suit
against the tobacco industry, and the new FY 2000 budget will contain $20 million to pay for the
necessary legal costs. All recoveries will be used to extend the life of the Medicare program for
future generations.

Costs to Medicaid. The federal government pays 57 percent of all Medicaid costs and is legally
required to collect 57 percent of state Medicaid recoveries, including Medicaid funds recovered
through the state tobacco settlements. However, because the federal government and the states
share the goals ensuring the health of our nation's families, the Administration would be willing
to consider legislation to waive the federal claim for recovery if states agree to spend a portion of
their settlement on a negotiated menu of items. Possible menu options include:

·      McCain Menu (which was negotiated and agreed to by NGA and the Administration):
       1) Maternal and Child Health Bureau's Title V program; 2) Child Care and Development
       Block Grant; 3) Child welfare programs (Title IV-B); 4) SAMHSA; 5) Safe and Drug
       Free Schools program; 6) Professional Development (Eisenhower) grants; 7) CHIP
       matching funds (limited to 6 percent of restricted funds).

·      McCain Plus Tobacco Control and Farmer Assistance: Another alternative would be
       to preserve the McCain list but add tobacco control activities, such as counter-advertising
       campaigns and state and community based education and prevention programs, and
       assistance to tobacco farmers and their communities.
                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion
·      Scaled Back McCain Plus Tobacco Control and Farmer Assistance: A third option
       would be to pair down the McCain list to four or five programs and add tobacco control
       and farmer assistance.

Because adopting a menu will require extensive discussions between the states, the Congress,
and the Administration, the Administration proposes to allow up to a year to enact this provision.
 To pay for this one year delay in recoupment, the President's FY 2000 budget would accelerate a
previously enacted $.15 per-pack cigarette excise tax increase. If a menu cannot be agreed to
within a year, the Administration plans to withhold Medicaid funds from the states in an amount
equal to 57 percent of the state tobacco settlements starting in FY 2000.

                                    Reduce Youth Smoking

Every day, 3,000 children become regular smokers and 1,000 have their lives shortened because
of it. Almost 90 percent of adult smokers began smoking by age 18 and today, 4.5 million
children aged 12 to 17 -- 37 percent of all high school students -- smoke cigarettes. Tobacco is
linked to over 400,000 deaths a year from cancer, respiratory illness, heart disease and other
problems. To end this scourge, we must do everything we can to reduce youth smoking. The
President has set a goal of cutting youth smoking in half within five years. To do so he
proposes:

Reaffirm FDA's Authority to Treat Nicotine Like a Drug. Nicotine is an addictive drug, and
it's time for the Congress to recognize that by affirming the Food and Drug Administration's
authority over tobacco products. In 1996, the FDA approved a regulation designed to keep
young people from smoking before they start by stopping advertising targeted at children and
curbing minors' access to tobacco products. Unfortunately, most of the rule's provisions have
been blocked in court. Now Congress can take this matter out of the courts by confirming
FDA's authority in this area. While the new multi-state tobacco settlement contains many
important provisions restricting tobacco marketing, it does not go far enough to protect children.
Congress should reaffirm FDA's authority by either:

·      Clarifying the definitions of "drug" and "device" to explicitly include tobacco products
       and clarify FDA's statutory authority to place restrictions on medical device products to
       explicitly include tobacco advertising, as proposed by Conrad, Harkin/Chafee, and
       Hansen/Meehan.

·      Create a separate chapter in the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act to address tobacco as
       proposed by McCain/Frist.

In addition, legislation could contain additional restrictions on tobacco advertising that go
beyond those contained in the FDA regulation, such as banning the use of human images or
cartoons in all tobacco advertising, banning the use of all outdoor advertising of tobacco
products, and banning tobacco advertising on the Internet.
                                                             Hex-Dump Conversion

Look-Back Surcharges. Strong look-back surcharges will act as an insurance policy to ensure
youth smoking declines. Because increasing the price of cigarettes is one of the most effective
ways to reduce youth smoking, tobacco legislation should increase per pack tobacco excise taxes
if youth smoking is not cut in half within five years. In addition, individual companies could
pay a surcharge based on how many underage youth smoke their brands, to provide additional
funds to fight youth smoking.

Public Health Funding. The President's FY 2000 budget will include core public health
funding to prevent young people from smoking by curbing youth access to tobacco products,
sponsoring counter-advertising and other public information campaigns, funding prevention
programs in states and local communities, conducting additional research on what works, and
monitoring youth behavior through expanded surveys. To fulfill these goals, the President's
budget will double the funding for the Food and Drug Administration's tobacco budget to $68
million, increase funding for the Centers for Disease Control's tobacco control efforts from $73
to $100 million, and fund $4 million in research at SAMSHA.

Price. As described above, the Administration proposes to reimburse federal taxpayers for the
yearly tobacco-related health costs for the armed forces, veterans, and federal employees. To
reimbursing this $7 billion cost, the President's FY 2000 budget proposes to increase the cigarette.
excise tax by $.55 per-pack. This price increase will have the additional benefit of preventing
youth smoking, since young people are particularly sensitive to higher cigarette prices.

                        Protection for Farmers and Their Communities

As part of a comprehensive plan to reduce youth smoking, the President is committed to
protecting farmers and farm communities. Currently, there are on-going discussions between
the tobacco industry, the tobacco growers, and the states over proposals for purchase guarantees
in which the companies would commit to buy a certain amount of tobacco each year, a possible
industry-established trust fund of up to $5.15 billion to help growers adjust as the demand for
tobacco declines, and the potential set aside of state settlement funds to assist farmers and their
communities.

The President is committed to protecting tobacco farmers and their communities, and he will
monitor these efforts closely to ensure they are successful. If needed, the President will consider
further measures, such as requiring states to set aside state settlement funds for tobacco farmers
and additional surcharges earmarked for farmers if necessary.
