      In addition to the UHP grants that I have asked DOJ to hold for Friday,
      these grants were in our weekly on Friday.

        LLEBG Grants:  DOJ will announce October 7 awards totaling over $400
      million to 2,700 local jurisdictions under the Local Law Enforcement Block
      Grant (LLEBG) Program.  These funds may be used for crime reduction
      activities and public safety enhancements.

       National Sex Offender Registry:  DOJ will announce October 7 awards
      totaling $24.1 million to 48 states, DC, and American Samoa under the
      National Sex Offender Registry program.  Funds will help states to
      establish appropriate interfaces with the FBI~,s national system and help
      them meet the requirements of federal legislation, including the Jacob
      Wetterling Act, MeganO,s Law, and the Pam Lynchner Offender Tracking and
      Identification Act.

       NCHIP Grants:  DOJ will announce October 7 National Criminal History
      Improvement Program (NCHIP) awards totaling approximately $42 million to
      46 states, and Puerto Rico. NCHIP funds will assist states to improve the
      level of their criminal history record automation and better interface
      records with the national criminal record system maintained by the FBI.
      Included in this announcement are awards totaling approximately $2.75
      million under the National Stalker and Domestic Violence Reduction
      Program, a component of NCHIP.  These awards will assist states to improve
      processes for collecting and flagging records of arrests, warrants,
      convictions, and protective orders relating to stalking and domestic
      violence and to make this information available through the national crim
      inal history record network.
