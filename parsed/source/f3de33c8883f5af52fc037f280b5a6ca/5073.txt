TEXT:
Ann Grady/Senator Murray has some revised statutory language -- I think as
a result of our conference call -- which she faxed to Mary Bourdette and
may be offering in the Labor-HHS conference tonight.   It is an attempt to
come closer to us, but it doesn't quite do the trick. Here's how it seems
to work:

1) States can grant as many domestic violence waivers as they want
(current law);

2) Individuals with waivers are not counted in the work participation or
time limit calculation
(same as Murray's prior proposal);

3) If a state would have failed the participation rate or time limits but
for step #2, then the Secretary may review the waivers granted by the
state and may "revoke any waivers" that the "Secretary finds were not
granted in good faith."  presumably this "revocation" puts those
individuals back in the calculation.

        Problems I see:
        a) The Secretary doesn't have the authority to revoke the waivers
granted to individuals .... and thus they wouldn't be put back in the
calculation .... so the mechanism doesn't quite work here.
        b) The burden of proof has shifted somewhat: here, the Secretary
finds "bad faith waivers" in order to increase the participation rate,
rather than lowering the participation rate for waivers grante~ .
appropriately.
        c) Waivers don't have to include services, or be temporary, or be
granted based on an individual assessment, i.e., to people who really need
them.

Anil, I'll fax you a copy.
