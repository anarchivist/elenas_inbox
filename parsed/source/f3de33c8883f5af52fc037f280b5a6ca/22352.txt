      As you'll see, stay-at-home families get assumed expenses of $500,

 As part of his FY 2000 budget, the President will propose a series of initiatives that will help
 families, including benefits for parents who stay at home, subsidies to help families pay for
 child care, and increased funding for after-school programs.

 Providing Tax Relief to Parents Who Stay at Home. The President will propose to extend the
 benefits of the Administration's Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit (CDCTC) to stay-at-home
 parents with children under one by assuming child-care expenses of $500 per child per year.

 Under current law, the CDCTC is equal to a percentage of the taxpayer's employment-related
 expenditures for child or dependent care, with the amount of the credit depending on the
 taxpayer's income. Last year, the Administration proposed to increase the credit from its current
 rate of 30% for those with incomes under $30,000 to 50%, and gradually phase it down to 20% at
 $59,000 of income. This' year's budget reiterates that proposal.

 This year, the Administration will propose a new stay-at-home tax credit that builds on our
 CDCTC proposal by allowing all families, including those where one parent stays at home, with
 a child under the age of one to have assumed expenses of$500 per year per child. The
 maximum benefit for a stay-at-home family with one child under one would be $250 a year. The
 President's budget proposal will provide an average tax credit of $178, at a cost of $1.3 billion
 over five years, which will benefit 1.7 million families. In the last Congress, a number of
 members in both parties put forward child care initiatives which included similar stay-at-home
 tax credits. Such bills were proposed by Senators Chafee and Hatch, Senator Dodd, and
 Representatives Levin and Kennelly.

        An Example:
        A couple with $30,000 in annual income in which one parent stays at horne, would be
        able to claim $500 in assumed child care expenses. At this income level, they would
        now be able to take 50% of those expenses as a credit, thereby enabling them to receive a
        $250 tax credit.

Giving Greater Tax Relief for Child Care to Three Million Working Families. The Child
and Dependent Care Tax Credit provides tax relief to taxpayers who pay for the care of a child
under 13 or a disabled dependent or spouse in order to work. The credit is equal to a percentage
of the taxpayer's employment-related expenditures for child or dependent care, with the amount
of the credit depending on the taxpayer's income. The President will propose to increase the
credit for families earning under $60,000, providing an additional average tax cut of $345 for
these families and eliminating income tax liability for almost all families with incomes below
200% of poverty ($35,000 for a family of four) that claim the maximum allowable child care
expenses. The President's budget will include $5 billion over five years to expand the Child and
Dependent Care Tax Credit for nearly 3.3 million working families paying for child care.

  Expanding the Child Care Block Grant to Create Better, Safer and More Affordable Child
. Care:
  ·     Providing Child Care Subsidies to More than One Million Additional Children: The
        President will propose to expand the Child Care and Development Block Grant to heIp
                                Hex-Dump Conversion

       working families struggling to afford child care. This block grant is the primary federal
       subsidy program to pay for child care, enabling low-income parents to work. Funds are
       distributed by formula to the states to operate direct child care subsidy programs, as well
       as to improve the quality and availability of care. Today, however, millions of families
       who are eligible for assistance with their child care costs do not receive any help. In FY
       1997, states provided child care assistance to only 1.25 million of the 10 million
       low-income children eligible for assistance. The President's budget will increase funding
       for child care subsidies by $7.5 billion over five years, enabling the program to serve an
       additional 1.15 million children by FY 2004.

·      Promoting Early Learning: The President will propose to increase the block grant to
       provide challenge grants to communities (distributed by states) to improve early learning
       and the quality and safety of child care for children ages zero to five. Research shows
       that children's experiences in the earliest years are critical to their development and
       ability to reach school ready to learn. The President's budget will provide $3 billion over
       five years to help get children ready to learn.

·      Improving Child Care Quality: Last year, Congress fully funded the President's request
        to increase investment in improving child care by providing States with additional
       resources for quality enhancement efforts such as performing inspections of child care
       facilities, providing resource and referral services for parents, assisting providers with
       training and scholarships, and creating networks for family day care providers. The
       President's FY 2000 budget will provide $173 million for this initiative.

Creating New Child Care Tax Incentives for Businesses. The President will propose to
create a new tax credit for businesses that provide child care services for their employees, by
building or expanding child care facilities, operating existing facilities, training child care
workers, or providing child care resources and referral services. The credit covers 25% of
qualified costs, but may not exceed $150,000 per year. The President's budget will include
approximately $500 million over five years for these tax credits.

Serving over a Million Children through After-School. The President will propose to triple
funding for the 21 st Century Learning Center Program, which supports the creation and
expansion of after-school and summer school programs'throughout the country. The program
increases the supply of after-school care in a cost-effective manner, primarily by funding
programs that use public school facilities and existing resources. In awarding these new funds,
the Education Department will give priority to school districts that are ending social promotion
by requiring that students meet academic standards in order to move to the next grade. The
President's budget will include $600 million in FY 2000 to help roughly 1.1 million children
each year participate in after-school and summer school programs.
