Update on Fatherhood Initiatives by Governors and Congress

NGA Winter Meeting
On Sunday afternoon, the NGA Human Resources Committee will discuss Strategies for
Encouraging and Promoting Positive Involvement by Fathers in the Lives of Their Children.
Governor Ridge, Committee Chair, will moderate the discussion and show a video highlighting
initiatives in Pennsylvania. Governors Carper, Beasley and Romer will talk about initiatives in
their states, followed by an open discussion among all Governors. Wade Hom of the National
Fatherhood Initiative will wrap up the discussion. In preparation for the meeting, Governors
Ridge and Locke (Committee Vice-Chair) asked Governors to submit examples of activities in
their states to promote positive father involvement. NGA will release a document at the meeting
summarizing these initiatives. Governors were specifically asked not to focus primarily on child
support enforcement or fathers' custody rights--they are trying to keep a focus on more positive
types of involvement.

Governor Ridge is expected to continue the focus on fathers at the Annual Meeting in July,
following up on the June summit (see below).

NGA has a policy on Paternal Involvement in Child Rearing first adopted in 1995 and revised in
1997. This is not up for discussion at the 1998 Winter Meeting.

Governors' Task Force on Fatherhood Promotion and National Summit in June
On February 12th, Governors Ridge and Carper launched a bipartisan national effort to promote
responsible fatherhood (this is not an NGA initiative). They met together with teen fathers at a
Philadelphia high school and sent a letter to all other Governors encouraging them to join this
effort. The objectives of the new Task Force are: 1) find new ways that state governments can
dramatically decrease the incidence of father absence, 2) encourage replication of policies and
initiatives that have proven effective in inspiring men to be committed, responsible and involved
fathers, and 3) fuel public and political commitment to bringing fathers back to their children.

The Task Force will co-host a national summit on fatherhood June 16th to bring together elected
officials from all levels of government, and leaders from the civic, philanthropic, education and
entertainment communities. One of the goals for the summit is to ask ten teams representing ten
sectors of society (public policy, entertainment, mass media, faith based, military, etc) to each
come up with one goal in a ten point plan for which they will be accountable. There is already a
bipartisan Congressional Task Force on Fatherhood Promotion, and a Mayor's Task Force is
expected next. The National Fatherhood Initiative will support these Task Forces and the
summit. NFl states that the Congressional and Governors' Task Forces will be exploring ways
that the federal and state government can help to promote responsible and involved fathering.

Other NFl activities: NFl has worked with the Ad Council to develop a national PSA campaign
on fathers, getting more than $100 million in donated broadcast time. In partnership with Radio
America, NFl has developed a series of radio PSAs featuring a mix of celebrities and experts,
including the Vice President. NFl is organizing a coalition of nation and local community
leaders, including groups such as the United Way of America, and the Boys and Girls Clubs of
America. They are also working directly with individual fathers.   Hex-Dump Conversion

Congressional Action
On January 20th, Congressman Archer announced a billion dollar "Fatherhood Counts" initiative
to create block grants to Governors for programs that promote marriage, work, payment of child
support, and better parenting in order to get fathers more involved with their children. He
proposed paying for the initiative by capping attorney fees in the tobacco settlement.

The Republican Floor Schedule currently shows a Fatherhood Block Grant Initiative by
Congressman Shaw in late April. Shaw's staff indicate they may introduce a bill in the next few
weeks, but have been quite vague.   .
