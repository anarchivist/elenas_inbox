TEXT:
Rob will be contacting each of you shortly to try and schedule a
meeting tommorrow on the following topics associated with the
timber rider issue:
o        how to respond to the Hatfield language on replacement and
buyback;
o        the Murray proposal (I will be getting around the
legislative language to each of you this evening or tommorrow am -
they wanted comments tonight, but we are telling them we can't get
comments to them until Monday am at the earliest);
o        response to sales that may be harvested between now and
passage of possible legislation.
