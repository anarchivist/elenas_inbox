TEXT:
Education thinks they will have the local allocations for class size done
by tomorrow morning (Friday) . Julie Green is strongly recommending that
Sec Riley go ahead and release those at his press conference on Friday.
Also, the groups would like to get them on Friday so that they can get
them to their local offices.  ED wanted to check in with the WH on the
release.   Are you ok with Education releasing those numbers when they are
ready on Friday - or do you want to hold off until Sat's radio address?

In the current radio address draft, we don't specifically reference the
release of the local allocation data -- but focus on the guidelines (which
will tell communities how much money they will receive and how they can
spend it) .
