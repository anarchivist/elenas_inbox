TEXT:
JBA or I usually covered the weekly (but irregular) meetings to decide on POTUS
scheduling requests. We always attend when DPC has a pending request.    Next
meeting is tomorrow, Thursday, 2:00 pm in Roosevelt Room. Evelyn typically runs
them (so they start on time and are short); Baer goes. Should I cover? Elena,
do you want to cover? To my knowledge DPC does not have any pending requests
this week.
