TEXT:
The Chair and Vice Chair of the DGA, Govs O'Bannon and Gov Patton will
sign a letter largely supportive of our ESEA proposal. It will applaud the
leadership and commitment we have shown, and indicate a desire to work out
some of the accountability details.  But the tone is as good as we could
hope for.  Additional Governors will be asked to do individual letters
next week. I'll work on some GOP Govs - but don't hold your breath.
