   Subject: Re: Daily Updates for Senior Staff Mtg,

   please keep in mind the purpose of daily updates, this is not like the
   weekly, one should submit a daily update only if their is "important and
   substantial" information that bruce or elena need to provide to senior
   white house staff at the morning meetings,  this could include a
   congressional vote on a presidential initiative, or a front page story on
   an important issue related to the adminstration, the information provided
   should be no more than three sentences, maximum,

   only page bruce or elena if you are unable to get the info to laura by
   6:30 pm.  if you can, provide the info in the page itself.  remember,
   there are two morning meetings, 7:45 am and 8:15 am.  do not page either
   bruce or elena during those meetings.
