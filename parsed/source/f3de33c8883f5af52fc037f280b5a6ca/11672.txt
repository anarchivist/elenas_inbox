       TEXT:
       I assume you have seen, but the Senate approved (60-39) the Jeffords-Lott
       amendment
       to let school districts use"class size funding for special education, then
       voted to kill the
       Murray-Kennedy class size amendment 55-44.  5 Democrats voted for the
       Jeffords-Lott
       amendment: Byrd, Conrad, Dorgan, Johnson, and Leahy.

       Below are some q's from Tanya and me about what types of documents we
       should prepare.
       I assume we'll talk larger strategy at the 5:15 mtg. Basically, we are
       trying to figure out what kind of
       guidance and statement to draft.

       Subject:         q's for Elena on class size

       Tanya and I have a few q's. While Lockhart is not giving a briefing today,
       it sounds like we should get guidance to the press office here during the
       day to use when they are asked questions. We're also trying to fugire out
       when and what kind of srWe can work on each of the following, but wanted
       to get your guidance.

       1) Should we draft new press guidance on our reaction to the House ed-flex
       vote? I assume our position is that we support the bill but that we need
       to work in the Senate and conference committee to ensure that the class
       size measure is included?

       2) Should we draft a new statement from the President? We could a)
       release a statement earlier in the day calling on the Senate to approve
       the class size measure and making another strong statement against the


 Jeffords amendments, or b) release a statement after the votes. Also,
 should we include any kind of language about a veto threat in a statement?

 3) Should someone call reporters with a new quote from the President or VP?
   This might help our chances of getting into stories written today.    (we
 did try to get the VP to include a statement in his drug labeling event
 this morning, but he questioned this when neither Ron nor I were in the
 briefing.  Pat Ewing tried to persuade the VP to include it, but he was
 concerned that it would disrupt the event and questioned whether it would
 get covered. He did take a written statement with him to the podium but
 then didn't deliver it .)

 4) Should we draft new press guidance on whether the President would veto
 the current House bill -- or the Senate bill without class size and with
 Republican amendments -- if it comes to the president's desk. Again,
 should we include language on a veto threat on this?
