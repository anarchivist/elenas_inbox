DRAFT   SEPTEMBER 16, 1998   10:45 AM

Honorable Newt Gingrich
Speaker of the House of Representatives
Washington, DC 20515


Dear Mr. Speaker:

I am writing to express my strong objections to H.R. 3248, the "Dollars to
the Classroom Act," as recently reported by the House Committee on
Education and the Workforce, and my strong support for a substitute
version of the bill, which I understand Representative Clay will offer, to
help States and communities hire well-qualified teachers and reduce class
size in the early grades, along the lines proposed by the President
earlier this year.

The Clay substitute would provide much-needed assistance to help States
and local school districts recruit, train, and hire 100,000 additional
well-prepared teachers in order to reduce the average class size to 18 in
grades 1 through 3 in our Nation's public schools. As schools across the
Nation struggle to accommodate a surge in enrollments, educators and
parents have become increasingly concerned about the impact of class size
on teaching and learning, particularly in the critically important early
grades. Rigorous research confirms what parents and teachers have long
believed 0) that students in smaller classes, especially in the early
grades, make greater educational gains and maintain those gains over
time.  These gains occur because teachers in small classes can provide
students with more individualized attention, spend more time on
instruction and less time on discipline, and cover more material
effectively.

We can help all of our students learn to read independently and well by
the third grade, get a solid foundation in basic skills, and reach high


educational standards if we start them off with small classes and
well-prepared teachers in the early grades.

Unfortunately, the bill reported by the Committee goes in a completely
different, and misguided, direction. Title I of the bill would convert a
wide array of Federal education programs into a single block grant
program. The President stated last fall that such a step is unacceptable,
and that he would use his veto power to prevent this approach from
becoming law.  If H.R. 3248 were presented to the President in its current
form, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto it.

The issue here is not about who controls public education -- we all agree
that that responsibility rests at the local and State levels. At stake,
rather, is whether the Federal Government will maintain its long-standing,
bipartisan commitment to helping local communities strengthen
accountability, raise standards, and improve student achievement, by
providing assistance that focuses on our neediest children and schools and
on activities in which national leadership can playa critical role.

The American people rightly look to the Federal Government to focus its
efforts not on general aid to school districts, which H.R. 3248 would
provide, but for leadership on national priorities. These include helping
States and school districts raise educational standards and educational
achievement for all students, improving the quality of teaching, bringing
the benefits of technology to our Nation's students, and increasing the
availability of after-school programs.

This Administration has worked diligently to eliminate unnecessary
regulations and take other steps to promote State and local flexibility in
carrying out these targeted efforts. The Department of Education, for
example, has eliminated 2/3 of its regulations relating to elementary and
secondary education and has simplified the remainder. At the same time,
we have supported strong accountability mechanisms, such as the Government
Performance and Results Act of 1993, that focus attention .on program
effectiveness.  Block grants would replace these worthy efforts with
general aid, providing no focus, no meaningful accountability for results,
and no rationale for ongoing support.

I also object to Title II of the Committee bill, which would provide broad
authority to waive Federal requirements, now afforded to 12 States with
comprehensive education reform plans, to all States. This proposal lacks
the critical ingredient of the current "Ed-Flex" program in which those 12
States participate: meaningful accountability, connected to high
standards and high expectations for all children, that must go hand in
hand with such a broad waiver authority.  I support expansion of the
"Ed-Flex" program to additional States, but only when the links to
challenging academic standards, high expectations for all children, and
accountability for results are strong and clear.

The Office of Management and Budget advises that there is no objection to
the submission of this report from the standpoint of the Administration's
program and that enactment of H.R. 3248, as reported by the Committee,
would not be in accord with the President's program.


                                                 Yours sincerely,


                                                   Richard W. Riley
