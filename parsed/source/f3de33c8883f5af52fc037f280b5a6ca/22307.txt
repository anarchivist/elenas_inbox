TEXT:
Attached is the draft memo to POTUS describing the bonus fund proposal we
have developed. While last night I indicated that the memo should also
summarize the rest of our approach to accountability, I realized that the
only way to keep the entire memo to under two pages was to give him so
little on each component that it was hardly worth it.  Instead, in the
opening paragraph I simply reminded him of the overall list of
accountability requirements, without any further detail. Since you and
Bruce have indicated that you have discussed the other stuff with him at
length, I think this approach accomplishes what I thought was needed.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:                  Bruce Reed
                       Mike Cohen

SUBJECT:               Rewarding Success in ESEA

       This memo describes the Education Excellence Fund, the performance incentive program
for ESEA we have developed at your direction.

       The overriding goal of our ESEA proposal is to help all students reach challenging
academic standards and to close the racial, ethnic and socioeconomic gaps in student
achievement at the same time. The accountability provisions we have incorporated in our ESEA
proposal -- requiring states to raise standards, provide public report cards, end social promotion,
intervene in failing schools and end the use of unqualified teachers -- underscore the
responsibility of states for the success of the education system by virtue of the policies they adopt
and practices they permit. Consistent with this approach, we have designed an Education
Excellence Fund that rewards states for their success. Because large urban school districts often
operate with relatively great independence from their state government and have in recent years
been making significant progress as a result of their own efforts, the Excellence Fund is also
designed to reward the largest urban school systems that make significant achievement gains.

Rewarding States and Cities that Raise Student Achievement and Close Achievement Gaps.
 The Education Excellence Fund will provide financial rewards to any state, and any of the 100
largest urban school districts, that make significant gains, sustained over three years, in
increasing student achievement overall, and in reducing disparities in student achievement on the
basis of race, ethnicity and socioeconomic background. In order to determine which states and
cities will receive rewards, the Secretary of Education will set improvement targets each state
and city must meet. These targets will be based on state assessments in reading and math, and
may include other indicators such as improvements in other academic subjects, drop-out rates,
student attendance or other areas of performance as agreed to by the Secretary and each state or
large school district. Each state and each of the eligible school districts will be able to receive an
award if meets its improvement targets.

$1 Billion Over 5 Years. The fund will provide a billion dollars over 5 years in rewards to
states, school districts and schools. Rewards will be provided for the first time in FY2003; three
years after ESEA is expected to pass. This will allow time for each state to adopt new
assessments and for the Secretary of Education to establish improvement targets for each state
and large district. Half of the funds will be reserved for states, and half for the largest urban
school districts. Funds will be allocated to states and school districts on the basis of the Title 1
formula, so that each receives the same share of these funds that it would receive under Title 1.

     the reward will be reallocated to the states and school districts that do.

     Rewarding Schools that Make Outstanding Improvements. States and large urban school
     districts will be required to distribute 90% of the funds to the schools in each jurisdiction that
     have made the greatest gains in student achievement overall, especially with disadvantaged
     students. The Excellence Fund will support awards of$40,000 to $50,000 per school for
     between 3,600 and 4,500 schools, between 4-5% of all public schools. Each school that receives
     the awards will be able to use the funds for any activities it determines can help further its efforts
     to improve student achievement. Similarly, each state and school district will able to retain up
     10% of the funds, for any activities it determines will help improve student achievement in its
     jurisdiction.
