TEXT:
Broderick Johnson/Scott Fleming asked that we make the following change to
the SAP for S. 280, ed-flex b"ill. Barbara Chow is okay with this change.
If all of you approve, I can release the SAP immediately. The bill is on
the Senate floor now.  Thank you.

S. 280 - Education Flexibility Partnership Act of 1999
(Sen. Frist (R) TN and 41 cosponsors)


The Administration has long supported the concept of expanding ed-flex
demonstration authority to permit all States to waive certain statutory
and regulatory requirements of Federal education programs in a manner that
will promote high standards and accountability for results, coupled with
increased flexibility for States and local school districts to achieve
those results. The Administration will support S. 280 as long as the
bill's accountability provisions are strengthened to ensure that State
waivers of Federal requirements enhance children's educational achievement
  supports amendments designed to: 1) ensure that State waivers of Federal
requirements result in improved student achievement; and 2) enhance
parental involvement.

In order to ensure consistency between ed-flex authority and the
Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA), which will be
undergoing reauthorization this year, the Administration urges Congress to
sunset this legislation upon enactment of the ESEA.

The Administration strongly supports an amendment that is expected to be
  ·

offered to S. 280 that would implement the President's proposal for a
long-term extension of the one-year authority to help school districts
reduce class size in the early grades, which the Congress approved last
year on a bipartisan basis.  In order to hire qualified teachers, arrange
for additional classrooms, and take other steps that are necessary to
reduce class size, school districts need to know, as soon as possible,
that the Congress intends to support this initiative for more than one
year.
