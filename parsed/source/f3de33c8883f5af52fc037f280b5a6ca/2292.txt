TEXT:
1. With regard to the civil rights/bilingual issue, I will look for an
opportunity to bring this to the President's attention in the near
future.   There may be several -- upcoming meetings over the test with the
civil rights community, some options/proposals from ED for how to deal
with the issue, or feedback I anticipate receiving from big city school
superintendents to whom we are reaching out regarding participating in the
test.   I expect places such as LA, NYC, and others to raise it with us.

Could I get a copy of what part of my piece on the Goodling amendment did
go to the President.  It would be helpful for me to know what he has been
told.

2.   I will follow up when I can on the CEA HOPE analysis.
