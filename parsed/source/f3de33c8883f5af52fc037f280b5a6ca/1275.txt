TEXT:
The idea of having the departments adopt schools for the service summit is
certainly doable.  In fact. several departments have already adopted
schools. They could potentially get up to 10 schools each. particularly
given that most major agencies have regional offices. and many of them
have already adopted schools.

Activities connected to adopting a school include mentoring. teaching
reading. donating equipment and books. organizing outings. and doing
career days.
