An Action Alert from AIDS Action and NGLTF:

HOUSE VOTE ON PERMANENT BAN OF FEDERAL FUNDING FOR
NEEDLE EXCHANGE

A vote in the House of Representatives to permanently ban federal


funds for needle exchange programs may come as early as tomorrow:
WEDNESDAY, APRIL 29, 1998

This is a purely cynical political effort that must be defeated.
Extremist members of Congress are trying to undermine needle
exchange programs, and they must be stopped!


ACTION:

CONTACT YOUR CONGRESS PERSON AND TELL THEM TO VOTE NO
on the ban of federal funding for needle exchange.

PLEASE CALL:    U.S. House of Representatives  (202) 225-3121
               (Ask for the office of your Congressperson)


PLEASE VISIT: The House Web Site at http://www.house.gov/writerep/
and get the email address of your Representative. Write today!!!

Tell your Representative:

* Legislation banning federal funding for needle exchange programs
is unnecessary and redundant given the clear position prohibiting
funding taken by the Clinton Administration.

* Focus instead on increasing HIV prevention funding and expanding
the options communities have to address their growing infection rates.

* Regardless of the Congressperson's individual beliefs about the
appropriateness of federal funding for needle exchange, they should
RESIST AFFIRMING A VOTE THAT HAS EVERYTHING TO DO WITH POLITICS AND
NOTHING TO DO WITH PUBLIC HEALTH.

  * This legislation should not hastily be considered on the House
. floor without input from the Committee with jurisdiction.
