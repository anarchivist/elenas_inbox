TEXT:
Perhaps I'm missing something we're doing,  but a Rich Wolf piece in
today's USA Today makes it clear that some states are going to take at
least some of this year's welfare windfall and spend it on something other
than welfare-related costs, whether it's education, job-training, child
care, whatever. Doesn't it make sense for us to be urging them to spend
all of this money to help in the transition from welfare to work?
