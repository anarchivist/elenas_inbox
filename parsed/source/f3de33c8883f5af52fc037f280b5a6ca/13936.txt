 TEXT:
 The Secret Service has asked for an updated office access list.

 By way of background, the Secret Service Control Center maintains
 a list of people who have access to each room on the Complex.   If
 someone does not have a key with them to a particular room, a
 Secret Service Officer can open the room for them if that person
 is on the corresponding access list.
 I have updated the list in terms of who is currently working in
 each room, but also realize that you may want other people to have
 access to your office (for example, if you are out of town and you
.want someone else to be able to get into your office) .
 I would appreciate it if you could give me a list by Friday of
 anyone, other than yourself, who should have access to your office
 or any other room over which you have responsibility.
 Please call me if you have any questions.


     Thanks!
     Marna
