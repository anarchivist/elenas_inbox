TEXT:
At the NEC, DPC, OMB meeting yesterday, OMB presented their preliminary
estimates of potential impact of revised poverty measure on key programs,
including Medicaid, food stamps, and some of the grant programs such
asTitle I, Head Start, CHIP.   I'm sending over hard copies of their
paper.   There are lots of caveats on the estimates, but this is as far as
OMB staff feel they can go without involving agencies. The estimates do
show that changes in the poverty measure would have substantial impacts on
eligibility for the entitlement programs, unless there are corresponding
changes in poverty guidelines or eligibility rules.   In the grant programs
there could be a lot of distributional changes among states.     These
estimates have definitely helped focus the discussion on options related
to whether to change the poverty measure and if so, how.
The plan is to revise and· expand the draft memo on whether or not to
benchmark to include some broader options and to schedule another
principals meeting for 1st week of August. There is growing interest in
possibly decoupling an alternative poverty measure used for statistical
purposes from the guidelines used to set program eligibility.    NEC is
aiming to get a draft memo out for review by end of the week.     OMB has
also confirmed that Census' current plan is to highlight 3 alternative
poverty measure series, all benchmarked to the 97 official measure. They
would then publish multiple series, some not benchmarked in the Appendix
of their report.
