TEXT:
Melissa has arranged for the 5:00 pm embargo on the MMWR to NOT apply to
the tobacco article. Thus, it will be available to reporters starting at
7:00 am tomorrow morning.  She gave me a one page fact sheet so long as we
promised we would not leak it ahead of that deadline.  Dailard is looking
at the materials now (and working on possible Q&As) but it looks like info
we could use --

Only 86    ~ercent   of teen daily smokers who try to quit actually do so.

Young people underestimate the addictiveness of nicotine -- 75 percent of
daily smokers who expect to quit are still smoking five years later.
