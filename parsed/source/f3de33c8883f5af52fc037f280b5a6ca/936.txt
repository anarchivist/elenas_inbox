TEXT:
I do not have much in the way of good news.  Justice has concluded that
many of the options that we discussed regarding pursuing campaign reform
through FEC rulemaking are not available under existing law. This
includes limits on foreign contributions as well as changes in FEC
enforcement procedure.

As we discussed, however, it appears that we can attempt to limit some
soft money expenditures by FEC rule change.  Specifically we could
petition the FEC to change its rules regarding the allocation of hard and
soft money in covering shared state and federal expenditures.
Unfortunately, the governing law would not appear to allow the FEC to
completely eliminate the use of soft money for shared state/federal
expenditures but we can seek rule changes to limit the role of soft money
as much as is legally possible.    For example, we might suggest that
upwards of 80% - 90% percent of shared expenditures be covered by federal
dollars.

There is also, of course, no obstacle to our appointing persons to the FEC
who are committed to reform and challenging the Republicans to submit the
names of persons who are equally committed. ,
