TEXT:
Elena,
I just spoke with Julie Anbender at INS.   INS has been working on an
additional document to include in the packet to Congress (along with the
letter, side-by-side and Booz study).  They think that they need more meat
on the bones for presenting the Administration's plan. Though it may be
possible to add some more detailed language to the Rogers letter, INS
thinks that a separate document is needed.   According to Anbender, you
spoke with Doris about this on Friday. Do you want us to work with INS to
create this document? Should it be included in the packet to Congress?
Thanks.

Julie
