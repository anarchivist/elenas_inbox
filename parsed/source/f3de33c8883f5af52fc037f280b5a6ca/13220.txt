TEXT:
I'd like to register a note of concern about the decision to limit
our request for funds in the new timber proposal to $50 million,
which came as a surprise to CEQ.
TJ, I understand your explanation (thanks for such a thorough
reply), and concur fully that we do not need to plan or budget for
buying out all the sales. Targeting is the right way to go.
Nonetheless, let me raise two strong cautions:
1.      There is not a single formula for pricing the value of a
sale or portion thereof. The industry's view is that the sale
price of the wood itself is only one factor, and that numerous
other considerations must enter into a value calculation. In a
nutshell, we view the situation as one of contract termination.
The industry characterizes the situation as a "taking." The last
time I checked, the industry's formula resulted in costs about
three times higher than our figures.  Accordingly, I'd be hesitant
to plan narrowly on the basis you described.
2.      I'm very uneasy about the board-foot number you cited.
Depending on how Hogan rules on several outstanding questions, we
 ,                                                                  Page 20f2


may be required to release Ibbf more than planned, considerably
more than the 200mbf referenced in your note. Also, the cost
limit presumes, I take it, that we will use a considerable amount
of timber from within the forest plan area as offsetting or
compensating volume. Without adequate funds, it's the only thing
we've got. As Katie has so often stressed, we need to be very
careful how we put that prospect on the table so that we're not
accused of reneging on the forest plan timber levels. We want
that dead cat left on Congress' doorstep.
