Subj ect :         Pr.ess Plan on Race Ini tiati ve


Please send me your comments/thoughts by Thursday afternoon.

Race/Reconciliation


         Thus far, coverage of the race/reconciliation issue has been both
accurate and positive.  It has piqued the interest of many reporters --
stories have already appeared in the New York Times, Knight-Ridder,
Newsday, the Chicago Tribune and many others.  CNN, TIME, US News & World
Report and Newsweek are all looking at big packages they would like to run
in the next few weeks. Most of them understand that the President has a
long-term commitment to the issue.  To a person, the reporters see the
Presidento,s initiative as transcendent and historical.

        The problem we face is that there has been such a long buildup to
this speech that when June 14 actually comes, reporters will look for
something tangible (besides the names of the commission members) to come
out of the speech. If they consider this speech mushy, we will face the
headline o&there is no there there.oS It is essential that our
administration talkers stress that the Pr'esident wants to set a tone and
spark a dialogue on race -- that in and of itself is progress.

Goals
1.   Inform reporters about the Presidento,s long-term commitment to and
understanding of the issue of race in America.   (Background as a white
Southerner, significant speeches on race, the affirmative action review,
etc. )
 2. Plan to give out some information regarding the structure of the
commission, its scope, agenda, etc. to White House press corps via tongs
and structured interviews.
 3. Make certain that alternative media are aware of the Presidento,s
initiative on race.


Calendar

May 12 - 16'
Surrogate list - Develop a solid list of "talkers" both within and outside
of the Administration to refer to reporters.  (ie - Slater, Mathews, Nash,
Emanuel, McLarty, Stephanopoulos, Leopoulos)

May 16          Tuskegee Apology
        The Tuskegee story will be the hook for many of our reporters to
write about the race initiative. This event will showcase the
Presidento,s historical interest in the subject of race in America, and
his intimacy with the issue of Southern segregation. East Room Event
                David Satcher, CDC does stakeout, regional interviews

May 18 Morgan State Commencement
The Presidento,s speech will not be targeted to an African-American
audience, but it will address science, technology and ethical dilemmas.
It will reference the Tuskegee apology and will tie it to the role of
ethics in science and technology.

May 25    29    Foreign Travel -- The Hague, Paris, London
June 2          Work with news outlets that are dedicating considerable time to
issue. CNN has expressed interest in a week long series on race leading up
to the 14th. US News, Newsweek and TIME also plan large takeouts.
