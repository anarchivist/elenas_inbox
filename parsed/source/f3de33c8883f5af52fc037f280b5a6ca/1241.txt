TEXT:
I called the phone people to put a priority on this job-- they said it
would be done today.  I authorized this to be done on overtime for Friday
pm but apparently, they never carried out the request.

The phone people will be installing a new line into 218 which will allow
you to forward your calls back and forth to the ww and the OEOB.   Laura
will be able to pick up 65584 for you in the WW; you may want to keep your
new line in 218 as a personal/private line.  If you like, we can remove
the number from the screen so only your name shows up (keeping the line
private).  Let me know if you are interested in doing this.

Thanks.
