TEXT:
thanks for the e-mail.
I'll be working with your shop, OA Counsel, and OMB Counsel (in
between timber and doi appros) over the rest of the week to see if
there's anyway to keep the agency up and running after Friday (we
are about to run out of $, so we may swear in Katie as Chair
Thursday and all leave on Friday!).  If it looks we're truly all
going to falloff the face of the earth, needless to say, I'll
check in with you on the way out! Hopefully, miracles will happen
so I'll send up a prayer for you if you'll put in a good thought
for us!
