TEXT:
The drug PSAs are ready to be unveiled and we could have the President
announce them in the Radio Address -- and distribute them to all the news
organizations to get some free media.   The first one will air in
DC/Balitmore media market on Jan. 5, so we should try to find a time for
the President to launch them before or on the 5th. After that, Members of
Congress will be holding their own press conferences in their districts to
roll them out.   If we want to announce them this weekend, we still need
to check with Media and Leg. Affairs, so we should decide quickly.  If we
don't do it this weekend, does everyone agree we should submit a
scheduling for a Presidential event on or before the 5th? Let me know.
Thanks.
