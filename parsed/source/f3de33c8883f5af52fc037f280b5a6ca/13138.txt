TEXT:
Elena,
The political implications are minor and are not additive to the
political implications or consequences we've already accepted by
our previous actions.
Enviros will be pleased; sport and commercial fishery interests
will be pleased; the timber industry plaintiffs will be
displeased. On balance, I think we come out ahead.
Yesterday's decision was a small step in the overall exercise of
responding to the rescissions bill. We have a VERY big decision
to make next week, namely what position to take in the Kentucky
district court litigation (and anticipated Idaho litigation)
regarding the substantive standards we think we are applying to
salvage timber sales under the bill.  In other words, since the
sale is being challenged as "arbitrary and capricious" we have to
show it wasn't because we made the decision based on ....
something.....   What that something is isn't entirely clear.
It's at least the President's directive and the MOA, but we
probably do not have agreement among the agencies now whether
other subtantive laws apply.  This will be fun.
I hope this is responsive to your question. Let me know if you'd
like more penetrating analysis.  I'm glad you're part of the team.
Tom
