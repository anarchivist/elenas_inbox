TEXT:
Here is a draft response to a letter sent to the President by Paul Newman
on the national organics standard proposal.  You both (Bruce and Elena)
asked for a response for the President to send. We vetted this through
USDA who thought it looked good.  USDA is also going to send a letter, but
will wait until after we have sent ours.  Thanks, Mary ==================== ATTACHME

Dear Mr. Newman,

        Thank you for your note regarding the proposed rule for national organic standards, and
for forwarding me your submission to the u.s. Department of Agriculture (USDA). I agree with
you that the issues are of great importance to the funire of organic foods, and hope you agree
with the recent steps we have taken in this area.

        As you may know, since you sent me your letter, USDA has announced that it would
make fundamental changes to its proposed national organic standards. Specifically, USDA will
issue a revised proposal for public comment that will not allow foods produced with
biotechnology, irradiation, and biosolids to bear the organic label. Before publishing the revised
proposal, USDA will evaluate the comments submitted in response to the December 1997
proposal. This record will guide the drafting of the revised proposal, which USDA will issue
for public comment later this year.

       Thank you again for SUbmitting your comments to USDA and forwarding them to me. I
believe we will substantially improve the revised proposal as a result of comments like yours and
many others.

       Hillary and I send our fondest regards to you and Joanne.

                              Sincerely,
