                                    HEALTH CARE


Question:   Are you going to submit additional Medicare savings so that your         Medic~re
            plan will contain $100 billion in savings over five years?

Answer:     Our actuaries believe that our current Medicare proposal does save $100 billion
            over five years. And, over the last four years, our actuaries have been more
            accurate in their budget estimates than the Congressional Budget Office.
            Moreover, just last week we sent our detailed language over to CBO. We believe
            that these additional details will help eliminate some of the current discrepancies
            between our actuaries' scoring of our Medicare proposal and CBO scoring. If
            any scoring differences still remain after CBO has had a chance to review all of
            our statutory language, we will make a determination as to whether any revisions
            in our proposal are warranted.


Question:   In your February budget release you said the 5-year Medicare savings were
            $100 billion. There are now reports that it is $106 billion over five years,
            according to your actuaries. How do you account for these differences?

Answer:     As the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) was scoring our Medicare proposals,
            they requested that the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) provide
            clarifications on the intent of our savings proposals. After providing them with
            this information, we asked OMB to determine how these clarifications changed
            the scoring of our Medicare package on our baseline. When they did, OMB
            determined that the provisions would score about $ I 06 billion in savings off of
            our baseline. (None of the clarifications involved beneficiary savings.)

            CBO continues to score our proposals to save about $82 billion off of their
            baseline.  We hope that further clarification of our policy will close the gap
            between how CBO ($82 billion) and OMB ($106 billion) score the very same
            policy.


Question:   Do you plan to eliminate any of the new benefit improvements in your
            Medicare plan?

Answer:     While everything will clearly be "on the table" in our budget discussions, we are
            extremely sensitive about making any changes to the important beneficiary
            improvements in our Medicare plan. Over three quarters of Medicare
            beneficiaries earn less than $25,000 per year. Improving benefits and fixing
            flaws in the program which place undue costs on this vulnerable population is a
            high priority for this Administration. We look forward to continuing to work
            with both Republicans and Democrats in Congress on passing a balanced budget
                                                                             Hex-Dump Conversion
            which will strengthen and improve the Medicare program.


Question:   Your proposal to lower out-of-pocket costs for outpatient department (OPD)
            services costs almost 50 billion over ten years. How do you justify the costs
            of this proposal?

Answer:     Our OPD policy simply returns the benefit to the original intent of the
            program. This policy is in no way a new entitlement. Under current law,
            Medicare asks beneficiaries to pay 20 percent copayments for Medicare services.
            An anomaly in outpatient payment methodologies has allowed hospitals to
            indirectly cost shift to beneficiaries. As a result, beneficiary copayments are now
            averaging almost 50 percent. The President's proposal simply restores the
            copayment to 20 percent -- similar to all other Part B services.

            The current 50 percent coinsurance costs are significant for Medicare
            beneficiaries. Over three quarters of Medicare beneficiaries eam less than
            $25,000 per year. Those without Medigap insurance or other secondary
            insurance simply cannot afford the huge unexpected bills they receive for OPD
            services. Those with Medigap coverage have seen their premiums increase as a
            result of this anomaly. It is only fair that this benefit, like all other Part B
            services, have a 20 percent coinsurance.

            Our OPD policies achieve savings. Reducing the coinsurance to 20 percent is
            only one part of our proposal to improve OPDs. The President's budget also
            shifts OPDs to a prospective payment system which will provide financial
            incentives for hospital to reduce costs and simplify payments, achieving at least
            $19 billion in savings over the next ten years.


Question:   Why are the costs in your OPD proposal backended. Aren't you just
            playing political games to balance the budget in 2002?

Answer:     The cost of buying down the OPD copayment is split between hospitals and the
            Federal government. We felt that an immediate move to a 20 percent
            copayment might create difficult transitions for hospitals who will already be
            targeted for reductions in payments from other policies. Having said this, we are
            more than willing to discuss alternative ways to address this problem.
                                                                   Hex-Dump Cortve:sion


Question:   Your Medicare proposal contains mostly cuts on providers and managed
            care. Don't you think we need real structural Medicare reform?

Answer:     Absolutely. My budget takes important steps to modernize Medicare and
            bring it into the 21st century through a number of structural reforms
            including

            ·     Establishing new private plans -- including Preferred Provider
                  Organizati'ons and Provider Sponsored Organizations -- available to
                  seniors and people with disabilities.
            ·     Establishing market-oriented purchasing for Medicare including the new
                  prospective payment systems for home health care, nursing home care, and
                  outpatient hospital services, as well as competitive bidding authority and
                  the use of centers of excellence to improve quality and cut back on costs.

            ·     Adding new Medigap protections to make it possible for beneficiaries to
                                 switch back from a managed care plan to traditional
                                 Medicare without being underwritten by insurers for private
                                 supplemental insurance coverage. This should encourage
                                 more beneficiaries to opt for managed care because it
                                 addresses the fear that such a choice would lock them in
                                 forever.


Question:   Do You support the Medicare Commission proposed by Senators Roth and
            Moynihan?

            ·     First, I want to praise Chairman Roth and Ranking Member
                  Moynihan for working together -- on a bipartisan basis -- to propose
                  the creation of a commission to address the long-term financing issues
                  that face Medicare. Their efforts reflect a bipartisan spirit which we
                  believe is critical to ensure the success of any process designed to
                  address this important issue.

            ·     No one is more committed than I am to seeking a bipartisan process to
                  find long term solutions to Medicare. But my more immediate focus
                  is reaching a bipartisan agreement on a balanced budget that extends
                  the life of the Medicare Trust Fund in the near term. We have an
                  historic opportunity to balance the budget. We should not let it pass.


            ·     As I have repeatedly said, we will need a bipartisan process to address the
                  long-term financing issues facing Medicare, and I look forward to working
                                                                    Hex·Dilmp Con'ie:Slon

                   with both parties to develop the best possible process.



QUALITY COMMISSION

Question:   What will this commission hope to accomplish?

Answer:     The President is calling on the commission to develop a "consumer bill of rights."
             He wants it to particularly focus on consumer appeals and grievance rights. He
            has also asked the Commission to address other issues including assuring:

               First, that health care professionals are free to provide the best medical advice
               possible;

               Second, that their providers are not subject to inappropriate financial
               incentives to limit care;

               Third, that our sickest and most vulnerable patients (frequently the elderly and
               people with disabilities) are receiving the best medical care for their unique
               needs;

               Fourth, that consumers have access to simple and fair procedures for resolving
               health care coverage dispute plans;

               And fifth, and perhaps most important, that consumers have basic information
               about their rights and responsibilities, about the benefits plans offer, about
               how to access the care they need, and about the quality of their providers and
               their health plan.


Question:   Will the patient bill of rights be mandated on states and private health plans?

Answer:     No. The Commission will develop a model Bill of Rights that states, health
            care plans, health care providers, associations, and others can use to guide
            their own efforts. States have already been quite active in this area and the
            model should help them in future efforts. Many health plans and health
            care professionals have adopted a form of a bill of rights and this should
            assist them as well.


Question:   Is this an "anti-managed care" commission?

Answer:     Absolutely not. Quality and consumer rights are issues that transcend all
            models of care. We need to address those issues in a comprehensive manner
                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversioil

            so that no matter what kind of insurance plan Americans join, they will
            know that the care they receive is of the highest quality and their rights as
            consumers are protected.



Question:   Won't the commission serve to delay quality legislative initiatives including
            those that even the President has advocated? Isn't the commission going to
            compete with these initiatives?

Answer:     This commission will complement, not compete with, legislation in the
            Congress that has broad-based support. The President will continue to
            support legislation in this area that has already received bipartisan support
            (e.g., barring gag rules, requiring 48-hour stays for women who have
            mastectomies). But this is just a start, we must go beyond these reforms to
            take a comprehensive look at the quality of care and how we can assure it.
            The Commission will work on building the consensus for more far-reaching
            reforms.


Question:   Doesn't this Commission just serve as a mechanism to implement more
            government regulation in our health care system?

Answer:     Not at all. The Commission has been given the charge of examining whether
            our rapidly changing health care system is still providing high quality care
            for all Americans and to ensure that consumers themselves have adequate
            grievances and appeals processes. Its focus is to help create consensus
            among the private and public sectors in how best to proceed. As such, its
            recommendations mayor may not suggest additional Federal oversight
            activities, and it is just as likely as not that it will recommend no new major
            Federal role.


Question:   Doesn't this commission just a reward for campaign contributors and
            Washington-insiders who know little about what Americans in our health
            care system experience?

Answer:     Absolutely not. By any measure, these commission members are extremely
            well respected experts who have broad and different experiences in the
            health care system. They have expertise on a range of health care issues
            including the unique challenges facing rural and urban communities,
            children, women, older Americans, minorities, people with disabilities,
            mental illness and AIDS, as well as issues regarding privacy rights and
            ethics. They come from all parts of the country and reflect the diverse
            population in this country.
                                                                     Hex-Dump Conilersion


Question:    How much will this cost and who's paying for it?

Answer:      The Commission will cost an estimated $1.8 million over the next year and be
             paid for by the Department of Health and Human Services. The members
             of the Commission will not be paid.




            WELFARE REFORM: FOOD STAMP WORK REQUIREMENT

Question:    Under the new welfare law, states began to cut off food stamps for
             non-disabled adults who aren't working after three months of
             benefits. Why does the Administration want to soften these
             provisions?

Answer:      Enacting the welfare law was an historic accomplishment that represents
             a significant step forward in social policy for this country. However, as I
             said when I signed this bill,

             I strongly support work requirements. But the welfare law's harsh and
             unreasonable time limit of3 months in 36 cuts off people who want to work but
             can't find jobs. In my budget, I proposed an alternative: a real and tough work
             requirement without arbitrary cut-offs.

             Under my proposal, those who refused to work or refused to take advantage of a
             work opportunity would face tough new penalties. We would limit food stamps to
             6 months out of 12. This policy would encourage work while giving those out of
             work the transitory help they need to get back on their feet. We proposed new
             funding and a wage supplementation option to expand the number of work slots
             available to this group by nearly 400,000 over five years. I am looking forward
             to working with Congress to enact this sensible proposal.

Background:

·     As of March 1, states began to cut off food stamp benefits for people who have not met
      the new work requirement in the welfare law.

·     Under the law, able-bodied childless adults between the ages of 18-50 are not permitted
      to get food stamps for more than 3 months in a 3-year period, unless they are working at
      least 20 hours a week.

·     USDA can waive the work requirement in cities or counties with high unemployment.
                                                                    Hex-DiJmp COiiv13:-sion

      To date, USDA has granted waivers to 36 states that exempt specified counties or cities
      with high unemployment.

·     Despite these exemptions, approximately 500,000 individuals will lose their food
      stamp eligibility in FY98 due to this provision. Under the Administration's
      proposal, approximately 35,000 individuals would lose eligibility in FY98. Unlike
      the welfare law, the Administration's proposal targets tough sanctions at those
      individuals who are unwilling to work and to play by the rules.


            WELFARE REFORM:            BENEFITS TO LEGAL IMMIGRANTS

Question:    Immigrants shouldn't be coming to the U.S. to get on welfare. Why
             is the Administration making restoration of these benefits a priority?

Or alternative question:

             Around the country, hundreds of thousands of frightened, elderly
             legal immigrants are scrambling to become citizens and avert a
             cut-off of their SSI and Medicaid benefits. What is the
             Administration doing about this?

Answer:      I believe that legal immigrants should have the same opportunity, and
             bear the same responsibility, as other members of our society. The
             welfare law denies most legal immigrants access to fundamental safety
             net programs unless they become citizens -- even though they are in the
             U.S. legally, are working and paying taxes and are responsible members
             of our communities. My Administration has always supported making
             individuals who encourage their relatives to emigrate to the United States
             responsible for the immigrant's well being. However, as a nation, we
             should not turn our backs on anyone who has lost their ability to earn a
             living due to injury, disease, or illness.

             At the same time, this provision of the welfare law has nothing to do with
             the goal of welfare reform -- putting people to work. It is simply unfair to
             immigrants who have entered this country legally.

             Consequently, my budget proposes to make legal immigrants who
             become disabled after entering the United States eligible for SSI and
             Medicaid.

             My budget would also provide poor immigrant children the same Medicaid
             health care coverage low-income citizen children receive.

             The United States admits refugees and asylees into this country on a
             humanitarian basis. My budget proposes to lengthen the five-year
                                                                      Hex-Dump COliv~::3ioi\

              exemption for refugees from the ban from five to seven years in order to
              give this group adequate time to naturalize.

              Finally, the law denies food stamps to most legal immigrants. My budget
              would delay the cutoffs from April 1, 1997 to August, 1997 in order to give
              immigrants more time to naturalize.


                WELFARE REFORM FIX LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS

Question:     You say you are ready to work with Congress to fix the immigrant and food
              stamp parts of the welfare law, but the Republican leadership says the bill is
              fine as it is. Even some Democrats are saying the law shouldn't be changed
              until we have had a chance to see how it works. Doesn't this mean your
              proposals have no chance of being enacted?

Answer:       I think it is very significant that the nation's Governors are now on record as
              recognizing that the cuts in benefits to legal immigrants are too harsh and need to
              be addressed -- even though their final resolution was softened at the last minute
              at the request of the Congressional leadership.

              As the new welfare law is being implemented, the Governors are gaining a new
              appreciation of some parts of the bill that I have had a problem with from the
              beginning -- those parts that are not related to putting people to work. This is
              particularly true of those Governors in states with large numbers oflegal
              immigrants. They are now looking more carefully at their state budgets and the
              fact that many legal immigrants who are disabled, many in nursing homes, will
              lose their SSI and Medicaid over the summer. In addition to noting that these
              provisions are unfair, they can see the potential costs to their own state budgets if
              they make the decision to ameliorate those cuts.

              I think that, over time, more and more people will come to see the harm that these
              provisions could do to hard-working people who came to this country and,
              through no fault of their own, became disabled and could no longer support their
              families.


I don't think we need the following question anymore:
Question:      Last summer when you said you would sign the welfare bill there were press
               reports that you wanted to restore about $14 billion in cuts. Now we
               understand your budget includes $18 billion in legislative restorations. Are
               you proposing to restore more in food stamps and benefits to immigrants
               that you were last year?

Answer:       No, absolutely not. The budget includes $18 billion in legislative proposals for
                                                                     Hex-D~mp COIIVe.'Sion


            Food Stamps and immigrants that correspond directly to the commitments I made
            at the time I signed the bill. Because of a number of technical reestimates, the
            budget estimate for these legislative proposals is now higher.

            The commitment I made to a $3 billion program to help the private sector, states,
            and cities move welfare recipients to work was always separate from that total,
            and was paid for separately elsewhere in my budget.




                                 WELFARE TO WORK

DISPLACEMENT

Question:   Aren't you concerned that welfare recipients will displace hardworking Americans --
            people who played by the rules and never reJied on welfare? Recent stories in The
            Washington Post and The New York Times have provided anecdotal evidence that
            welfare recipients are taking jobs from the working poor.

Answer:     Let me note that the welfare reform law that I signed prohibits worker
            displacement. Welfare reform programs cannot place welfare recipients injob
            openings created by company firings or layoffs (section 407(t) of the law).
            Welfare recipients can, however, be placed injobs that are vacant for reasons
            other than firings or layoffs.

            I believe that the growing economy will create enough jobs to meet my goal of
            putting one million welfare recipients to work by the year 2000 without displacing
            other workers. Remember, we've created 12 million new jobs over the last four
            years. Unemployment has dropped to 5.2 percent, as was announced on Friday.


            I recognize that we should give some extra help to communities where it will be
            harder for welfare recipients to find jobs. That's why I've proposed in my budget
            a $3 billion Welfare-to-Work Jobs Challenge fund which states and cities could
            use to create job opportunities for welfare recipients.

MINIMUM WAGE

Question:   Some say displacement will happen because welfare recipients are allowed to
            work without being covered by the minimum wage law and the various
            protections of the Fair Labor Standards Act. Is this true?

Answer:     Agency lawyers are in the course of examining to what extent the Fair Labor
                                                     H~x·Dump COiii'il:sioil


Standards Act applies to welfare to work programs.     We expect to have an
answer shortly, but do not have one at this time.

PRIV ATIZING WELFARE

Question:   Are you planning to let Texas privatize welfare? I understand you met
            with         labor leaders 10 days ago to discuss this issue.

Answer:     No decision has been made on the Texas request. It is a complicated issue
            involving both Medicaid and Food Stamps. The agencies are working as hard as
            they can to examine all of the relevant issues, and we hope to get the State of
            Texas their answer soon. I can tell you this: my Administration has fought hard
            to preserve federal guarantees for both Food Stamps and Medicaid and we don't
            intend to undermine them now. Regarding the meeting I had with labor leaders
            on March 28th _. it was a broad discussion of budget and welfare to work issues.

Question:   Governor Bush is, in effect, calling Secretary Shalala a liar for not making a
            decision by April 1, as she had promised.

Answer:     He knows better than that. The Administration gets a lot of waiver requests from
            the states. The agencies conduct a routine review process for each of them.
            Because this is a complicated issue, the review has been lengthy, probably a little
            more than we expected. But the agencies are working to provide Texas with a
            response as soon as possible.

PRIVATE SECTOR JOBS

Question:   What are you doing to encourage private companies to hire welfare
            recipients without displacing current workers?

Answer:     The $3 billion Welfare to Work Jobs Challenge I propose in my budget could be
            used by cities and states to provide subsidies and other incentives for private
            businesses to add welfare recipients to their workforce. Complementing this
            initiative is the enhanced and expanded Work Opportunity Tax Credit that I also
            propose in my budget. First, the WOTC would be enhanced for long-term
            welfare recipients. This credit would allow employers who hire welfare recipients
            to claim a 50 percent tax credit on the first $10,000 of wages paid to that person
            for two years. Wages may include the cost of training, health insurance, and day
            care. Second, the WOTC would be expanded to make a new population --
            18-50 year olds made ineligible for food stamps under the new welfare law --
            eligible for the existing base credit.

                    In addition to my legislative proposals, I am reaching out to employers
            large and small to challenge them to hire welfare recipients. I met in the White
            House with a group of 14 CEOs interested in helping people move from welfare
            to work. Then, during the State of the Union Address, I announced commitments
            from five of these companies -- Sprint, Monsanto, UPS, Burger King, and United
            Airlines. I hope to be announcing commitments from even more companies
                                                                 Hex-Dump COiiV'.::!'Sion

            soon.
Question:   Why wasn't Marriot, which has done so much to put welfare recipients to work, one
            of the companies you praised in the State of the Union?

Answer.     The CEO of Marriot was invited to the initial meeting I had with CEOs of
            14 companies interested in helping people move from welfare to work.
            Unfortunately, he had a conflict and could not attend. However, Marriot has a
            top notch welfare to work program already in place that we are reviewing and will
            encourage other corporations to emulate. I hope Marriot, as well as all of the
            corporations I met with in early January, will work with me and others to make
            the new welfare law a success.

Question:   You have mentioned several times that under the new welfare law, employers
            may turn the welfare and food stamp checks into temporary wage subsidies.
            How does this actually work?

Answer:     As of August 22, 1996 when I signed the welfare law, 11 states had received
            waivers to modify work supplementation rules. Most of those waivers sought to
            combine AFDC and food stamp benefits to subsidize jobs. Oregon pioneered
            this concept. HHS is currently gathering more recent statistics on work
            supplementation since I signed the law.

            In Oregon, both private and public sector jobs are subsidized for up to six months
            per placement. The job is subsidized at minimum wage and gives employers
            cashed out AFDC and food stamps benefits to cover the minimum wage. In
            addition, the employee is entitled to the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). If the
            minimum wage and the EITC do not bring the recipient up to the poverty line, the
            employer must make up the difference by paying up to $1 dollar an hour over the
            reimbursed minimum wage or may put $1 for every hour worked into an
            Individual Development Account (IDA). Once a recipient is hired in a full-time,
            unsubsidized job, she becomes eligible for her wage, the EITC, and food stamps
            coupons previously used to subsidized her wage. Such a system creates an
            escalating financial incentive that always makes full-time, unsubsidized work the
            most attractive option.

FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HIRING

Question:   What has the White House done to encourage federal government hiring of
            welfare recipients?

Answer:     Most of the jobs required to make welfare reform succeed will come from the
            private sector. But I believe that the Federal Government, as the Nation's largest
            employer, should contribute to this critical national effort. That's why on March
            8th, I directed the head of each federal agency and department to use all
            available hiring authorities to hire people off the welfare rolls into available job
            positions in the Government. To underscore the importance of this issue to the
            White House, I appointed Vice President Gore to oversee this effort.

            I have called a Cabinet meeting for this Thursday, April 10th, to meet face to face
            with the members of my Cabinet to discuss how each agency intends to recruit,
            hire, and retain qualified welfare recipients.

Question:   Will the White House hire any welfare recipients?

Answer:     I expect the Executive Office of the President, like any other agency, to produce a
            detailed plan to assist in this effort and I would fully expect them to plan to hire
            welfare recipients.
