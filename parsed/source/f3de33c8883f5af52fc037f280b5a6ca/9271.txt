TEXT:
Did we ever send in that Dean Ornish insert for the weekly? The POTUS
loves Ornish, has been pushing us to be responsive to his request, and I
think would welcome/appreciate an update.  Just a thought if you are
looking for things.  (For all I know, you may have put it in last time
around and Phil dropped it.)
