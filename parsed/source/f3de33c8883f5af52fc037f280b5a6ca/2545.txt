Message Creation Date was at 29-JAN-1998 16:59:00



In his resignation letter to the President, Gene Ludwig offered the

following

statistics on the impact of the Administration's 1993 reform of the

Community

Reinvestment Act (CRA):



"Lending commitments under the CRA have increased 15-fold from the

pre-1993

era, from roughly $3 billion a year to $43 billion a year.    Thes

commitments

represent new credit availability for low- and moderate-income urban and

rural

communities, including loans for housing, small farms and small

businesses.    At

the same time, equity investment by national banks in community

development


corporations and projects were six times greter in the last four years

than

during the previous 28 years combined.   Home mortgages to African

Americans and

Hispanic Americans have increased more than 50% over the last four years



almost three times the rate of increase for the population as a whole.     In

some

chronically underserved communities the change has been even more dr

amatic .... moreover, we have been able to achieve these results while

substantially reducing the supervisory and paperwork burdens that the    eRA
had

previously imposed on the banking industry."



This paragraph highlights what I maintain is still our most successful,

yet

underpublicized community empowerment initiative.   It also, in my mind,

underscores the need for the President to give a major address which ties

what

has been a successful strategy to reinvigorate America's cities with his

sizable package for urban America in his FY99 budget.
