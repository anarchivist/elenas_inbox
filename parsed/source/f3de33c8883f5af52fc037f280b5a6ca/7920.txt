TEXT:
Staff from First Lady's office were interested in doing a column on
welfare to work, following up on the event last week.     Using all the
paper from the event, Carol Beach has written a good draft that's being
reviewed by HRC et al. It emphasizes the individual and business success
stories.   I'm faxing you the draft with my comments in case you want to
weigh in.    I ran it past W2W Partnership (their comments are included with
mine).   I think this is competing with one other topic for this week, but
if it doesn't make it for this week, it may go for next week.
