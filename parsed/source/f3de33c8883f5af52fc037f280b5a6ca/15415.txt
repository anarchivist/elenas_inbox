TEXT:
I got a call earlier today from Ben Freeland in Leg Affairs asking whether
the Leahy changes in the volunteer bill -- which then went on to pass by
99-1 -- "satisfied the Administration's concerns." As I understand it,
Ben is writing this for something to go to a Senate caucus this weekend,
so it's important we get the right answer. Unfortunately (for all of you)
I will be out of the office and unreachable until late in the day
tomorrow. Ben needs an answer before then.   Someone needs to call him on
66650.

I've left copies of the bill on your desks.  Essentially, all Leahy was
able to do -- under, I gather, pressure from the majority to claim
Democrats were hypocrites because they wouldn't support volunteerism --
was limit the bill to volunteers only, eliminating the limitations on
liability of nonprofits and government entities.

In my opinion, the resulting bill would, standing alone, be acceptable in
the context of the push for volunteerism, although there still is the
broader issue whether anyone has demonstrated a need to preempt.
Admittedly, someone volunteering with the Klan who negligently hits
someone else while driving a car to get the food for a Klan picnic would
probably get the benefit of the bill (since I assume the picnic wouldn't
be a hate crime) but I assume we could live with that eventuality.

The real problem, of course, is that this bill does not stand alone, out
of the context of broad tort reform. THEREFORE, the fact that the bill
still contains: (i) one-way preemption; (ii) a total bar of joint and
several liability for non-economic damages; and (iii) a punitives standard
that might be tougher than we want, in addition to the overly broad
definition of non-profit organization, does raise some concern.  The
Porter bill pending in the House with bi-partisan support is, of course,


not really a preemption bill at all, but an incentive.  Even looked at as
a preemption, it has NONE of the problems of the revised Coverdale bill.

I therefore think our message to the Democratic Senators should be: we
think Senator Leahy's initial speech was right on point but understand why
you went along with this, and it's certainly better than the original
Coverdale bill. However, the basic question of why preemption hasn't been
answered, and moreover there are still some real problems with the bill,
in the context of the Republicans' broader push for tort reform, namely
one-way preemption, the total bar on joint and several liability for
non-economic damages and [? an excessively high punitives standard?] .
Moreover, the extremely broad definition of nonprofit organization remains
troubling. We think the right thing to do is for every Democrat, and the
Administration, to get behind the Porter bill, and to work hard to get
that bill, which has none of these problems, through the House and,
eventually, the bill that is adopted by the conference committee.   Failing
that, we think it essential that at least the· joint and several liability
provision be removed.

Ellen
