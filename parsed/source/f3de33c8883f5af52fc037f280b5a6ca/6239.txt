Lott and DeLay both declared this afternoon that Superfund is dead.
According to Lott, "We won't get super·fund reform done this year because
we don't have the support that we need to get it done." DeLay agreed,
admitting "We don't have the votes." Curiously, neither blamed the
Administration for the failiure.
