Q.   How do you know that this proposal will work -    that low performing schools can and
     will be improved?

A.   We know that low performing schools can be improved if they get the help and support
     they need, because it has been done, in places as diverse as North Carolina, New York
     City, Houston and Miami. In every one of these cases, when the staff in a
     low-performing school receives intervention from the top leadership of the system,
     support from experienced educators and experts, the resources to get the job done, a clear
     timeline for improvement coupled with consequences for failure to achieve results,
     schools show improvement. If they don't then state and local leaders must be prepared
     to follow through, by evaluating the staff and making necessary staff changes, or by
     closing the school down and bringing in an entirely new staff is necessary.

     We have seen schools that are effective, even with the most disadvantaged students,
     throughout the nation. They are not created by magic, and they are not accidents. The
     exist because they have high standards and expectations for their students, good teachers
     and principals, and effective programs. There is no reason why we can't create these
     conditions in every school, if state and local education leaders, backed by a strong
     national commitment, accept the challenge.
