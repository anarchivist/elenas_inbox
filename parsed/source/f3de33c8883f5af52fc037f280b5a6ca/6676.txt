TEXT:
Just a quick update on where this group is heading. The group includes
DOL, Ed, and Commerce, along with CEA and OMB.  It ismeeting twice a week,
focusing primarily on how to address the skills shortage issue raised by
the IT industry, but also keeping a broader focus on other critical skills
needs that may emerge. As you know, this is in the context of the HIB
immigration issues and making sure we focus first on doing all we can to
prepare American workers for these jobs. The group has identified a list
of short and long-term strategies, including things industry can do, .
things the public sector can do, and things we can do together.    DOL is
very concerned that whatever happens builds on the 'soon-to-be reformed
workforce development system. The last meeting focused on fine-tuning
something that could be part of a Kennedy legislative
package--particularly the last bullet below.   Let Julie or I know if you
have any questions/concerns.

Highlights of possible initiatives:

expanding industry involvement in school-to-work,
 continuing that national dialogue through 4 Commerce/DOL town hall
meetings,
 building on America's Job Bank/Talent Bank--DOL's on-line labor matching
services,
$6 m DOL Technology Demonstration Project to establish partnerships to
train dislocated workers for high tech jobs,
encourage IT employers to partner with HBCUs and provide training on the
internet,
D.C. Area IT Training Grant--up to $17.5 milion for regional partnership
between DC/VA/MD workforce system, industry, labor,  education and
training providers, to retrain 2,500 dislocated workers,
fundapprox. 120 regional critical skills partnerships (name is up for
grabs), preferably through HBl visa fees.  These would expand on the
Technology Demo Project and D.C. area grant concepts and is similar to
proposals advanced by PPI and Congressman Moran.  Would be competitive
grants of around $400,000.  Primary focus is to bring the industry and
workforce systems together in a region to do coordinated planning, with
actual training services funded through employers or existing
workforce/education system.
