      STATEMENT WITH NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF THEATRE OWNERS

                            DATE:                         June 8, 1999

                            EVENT TIME:                   1:40pm - 2:05pm

I.    PURPOSE

      To join with the National Association of Theatre Owners in announcing a new
      nationwide movie ratings enforcement and educational effort.

II.   BACKGROUND

      The three-part plan you will announce today includes: (1) a new national policy under
      which movie theatre owners will require photo identification for young people seeking
      admission to "R" rated films; (2) an educational outreach program for parents about the
      ratings system and the new ID-check policy; and (3) support by the theatre owners for a
      national study on the causes of violence. The National Association of Theatre Owners is
      a national trade association that represents 65% of the motion picture screens in the
      United States, with over 20,000 screens located in every state. You will also reiterate
      your call on Congress to move quickly and pass common sense gun legislation.

      Requiring Photo Identification for "R" Rated Movies
      The movie rating system, adopted by the Motion Picture Association of America in 1968,
      can be a useful tool for parents, but only ifits main restrictive rating -- "R" (for
      "Restricted: Under 17 Requires Accompanying Parent or Adult Guardian") -- is
      effectively enforced. Under the policy you will announce today, the theatre owners'
      association states that from now on, "all of its members should require photo
      identification at the box office of young patrons not accompanied by a parent or guardian
      seeking admission to "R" rated films." The association also will ask theatre owners to
      post notices reflecting the "R" rated admission policy. Prior to the announcement of
      today's new policy you will meet with the association's president, William Kartozian; its
      chairman, Barrie Lawson Loeks; and theatre executives Greg Dunn of Regal Cinemas and
      J. Wayne Anderson of RIC Theatres Management.

                                                              Automated Records Management !)ystem

       May 15 radio address. Today you will also repeat your challenge to the movie industry to
       reevaluate its entire ratings systems, especially the PG-13 rating, to determine whether it
       is allowing too much gratuitous violence in movies approved for viewing by children.
       You have urged the entertainment industry to take other responsible steps, including
       calling on the videogame, recording and movie industries not to market violence to
       children. Last week, you announced a joint study of entertainment industry marketing by
       the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department.

       Reaching Out to Parents
       The theatre owners will also announce a national community education effort in
       conjunction with parent and religious organizations. The educational outreach will work
       to develop additional programs designed to enhance the ability of parents to make
       informed choices about which movies are appropriate for their children. As part of the
       new policy, the theatre association will also call for a national study of youth violence.
       You announced at the White House Strategy Session on Children, Violence, and
       Responsibility that the Surgeon General would issue a report on youth violence next year.

       Challenging the House to Pass Common Sense Gun Legislation
       You will once again challenge the House of Representatives to pass common sense gun
       legislation without loopholes and without further delay. In May, the Senate passed tough
       new provisions to close the gun show loophole, require child safety locks with every new
       handgun sold, ban the importation of large capacity ammunition clips, and prohibit
       violent juveniles from owning guns as adults. You will call on the House to strengthen --
       not weaken -- the Senate-passed bill, to include provisions to raise the age of handgun
       possession from 18 to 21 and require background checks for explosives purchases. You
       will also reiterate your commitment to expose and fight against any effort by the gun
       lobby to riddle the House bill with dangerous new loopholes and water down critical
       safety measures passed in the Senate.
