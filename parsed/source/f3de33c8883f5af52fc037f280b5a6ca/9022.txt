TEXT:
Based on discussions with OMB and NEC about most effective next steps to
push for housing vouchers in conference, the suggestion was that Bruce
should let Martha Foley know that this is a high priority. While we
should continue to push HUD to spread the word with external groups, we
should not rely on them for direct contact with the Hill -- in fact,
particularly in the Senate, the more distance from HUD the better.   In
early September, we will touch bases with Martha and Chuck Kieffer to
make sure they are up to speed on the issue and see which conferees we
might want to talk to (Bond and Mikulski are key).  For now, we should
continue pushing for our full proposal of 50,000 vouchers.

                               WELFARE TO WORK HOUSING VOUCHERS

            The President's FY99 budget takes further steps to promote work and welfare reform
    through a plan to provide 50,000 new housing vouchers to welfare recipients who need housing
    assistance in order to get or keep a job. Families could use these housing vouchers to move
    closer to a new job, to reduce a long commute, or to secure more stable housing to eliminate
    emergencies that keep them from getting to work every day on time. These targeted vouchers
    will give people on welfare a new tool to make the transition to a job and succeed in the work
    place.

            The $283 million proposal will help address the problem, in many regions, that jobs are
    being created far from where many welfare recipients live. Currently, about two-thirds of new
    jobs are being created in the suburbs, but three of four welfare recipients live in rural areas or
    central cities. The funding for the Administration's Access to Jobs initiative in the Transportation
    Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) will assist states and localities to develop flexible
    transportation alternatives for welfare recipients and other low income workers. But in some cases
    it makes more sense for someone to move closer to work -- and this new proposal will make that
    move from welfare to work possible.

    How It WiD Work
            These vouchers will provide States and communities with a new flexible tool to help
    families who need housing assistance in order to achieve self-sufficiency.
    ·       The additional vouchers will be available on a competitive basis to local housing agencies,
            including Indian housing authorities. Applications must be developed in consultation with
            the state, local, or tribal welfare agency and the local Welfare-to-Work formula funds
            grantee (typically the Private Industry Council), to ensure that services are coordinated.

    ·      The vouchers will be used where they are essential to a successful transition from welfare to
            work--that is, where housing assistance is critical for a family to get or keep a job.

    ·      Families who receive the vouchers must be eligibJe for or currently receiving Temporary
           Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) or have received TANF within the past year.

             The initiative recognizes the direct link between affordable housing and self-sufficiency.
    Along with the Administration's proposal to increase the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit, this
    initiative will make decent, affordable housing available to more Americans.

    Current Status
            Congress has recognized the need for housing vouchers to promote welfare reform, but so
    far has provided insufficient funding for them. The HUD/VA Appropriations bill passed by the
    House provides $100 million for 17,700 Welfare to Work Housing Vouchers. The bill passed by
    the Senate provides only $40 million for 7,000 housing vouchers. The HUD/VA
    Appropriations conference committee is expected to occur after the August recess.
