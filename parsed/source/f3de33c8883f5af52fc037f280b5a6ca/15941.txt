TEXT:
Please read the notes below.  I've asked Bill Marshall to coordinate with
Kent Markus with respect to the Brady decision. The latest rumor is that
decisions will all come down by June 26. That leaves three decision dates
left: tomorrow, June 23 and June 26.

Elena-- Bill asked that you either stop by the "war room" or be available
to clear statements on the days that decisions come down on religious
freedom, Brady, and right to die.

Thanks.

Chuck Ruff and Rahm would like to set up a "war room" for the next few
days in order to organize the statements. -Bill Marshall set up this time
and place- who should be there? I was thinking about you, Jose, Elena,
Barry Toiv and someone in Waldman's office. Who else? Let me know when you
get a chance. Thanks
