TEXT:
How's this? I'm going to look at more historical comparisons, too, but
what do you think of this as a start?

Today the President anounced that heD,s met -- two years ahead of schedule
-- the goal he set in last yearD,s State of the Union to move two million
more Americans off of welfare by the year 2000.   The President released
new figures showing that the number of Americans on welfare has fallen by
30 percent since he took office and is below 10 million people for the
first time since 1970. There are now 4.3 million fewer people on welfare
then when the President took office and began to grant waivers to 43 sta
tes to reform welfare and 2.4 million fewer than when he made welfare
reform the law of the land.   (The welfare rolls fell from 14.1 million in
January 1993 to"12.2 in August 1996 to 9.8 million in September 1997, the
new numbers released today.)
