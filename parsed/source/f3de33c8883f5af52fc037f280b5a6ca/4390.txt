                                CHARTER SCHOOL ISSUES

Q.   Why do charter schools need extra funding?

A.   The Federal start-up grants are not extra funding they provide initial start-up costs and can
     last a maximum of three years. The grants are designed to fill an acknowledged gap.
     Research has documented that the greatest challenges charter schools face are associated with
     initial planning and starting up. For example, charter schools that start from scratch often
     must pay for their facilities out of the portion of funding used in traditional systems to pay for
     operational costs. Federal grants help by paying for things like curriculum design or
     renovations that must occur before the school opens.

Q.   Aren't charter schools eroding the teacher profession by allowing uncertified teachers?

A.   Teacher certification requirements for charter schools are set by each state. Most states
     require that the vast majority of teachers in charter schools be certified. Charter schools
     sometimes hire people to teach who have professional experience that can be translated into
     valuable teaching. For those non-credentialed staff, charter schools must demonstrate that
     they will have the appropriate training and support to effectively provide instruction in the
     classroom.

Q.   Aren't charter schools elitist?

A.   No. Charter schools are public schools and they must be open to all students. Charter
     schools are being established in all types of communities -- including inner cities, suburbs,
     and rural areas. Recent studies show that on average, they serve roughly comparable numbers
     of minority students as neighboring schools, and in some states, they teach a higher
     proportion of minority students than are in that state's traditional public schools.

Q.   Do you think that charter schools might draw students and resources away from public schools?

A.   These are public schools -- exciting, innovative public schools can draw people back into the
     public school system. In some states between 10 and 14 percent of the students in charter
     schools are student that were not previously enrolled public schools. These new students
     include former dropouts, teen mothers, and students coming back from private schools to
     attend charter schools. These students represent families who are also becoming reinvested in
     public education.

Q.   Are   charter schools adequately serving disadvantaged students?

A.   It is critical that charters schools serve a diverse population and provide help to those students
     who need it most.         Several of the schools highlighted today have student populations that

                                                 1
                                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion
     are predominantly poor or limited English proficient -- or have higher than average
     percentages of student with disabilities -- and these schools are successfully educating all of
     their students. And there are encouraging reports that show that charter schools are serving
     the same or slightly higher percentages or poor and minority students than their states overall
     public school systems.

Q.   So, charters are serving poor and minority students, but what about students with disabilities?

A.   As public schools, charter schools are not exempt from requirements to serve special
     education students. This reflects one of our fundamental values in public schools -- that they
     should serve all children. There are wonderful examples of charter schools providing a
     better education to children with disabilities than the schools from which they came. It is
     true that data from the national survey contracted by the U.S. Department of Education
     showed that, except in a few states, charter schools are serving a slightly lower percentage of
     students in special education than their overall public school system. We think this is an
     important issue that the administration is working to address.

Q.   Do charter schools represent a significant reform,   if they only represent 700 of the thousands of
     schools in this country?

A.   Charter schools are just one piece of a larger strategy of promoting high standards and
     accountability, but these schools can help lead the way for refonns and improvement in
     public education. They can provide models for successful public schools, provide new
     choices for parents, and stimulate healthy competition within public education. But they are
     part of a broader strategy. The President has urged states and school districts to adopt
     challenging academic standards in all core subjects, and to adopt high national standards in
     the basics of reading and mathematics. The President has strengthened existing federal
     programs and fought for new resources to improve local schools and help students reach
     those standards.


                        CALIFORNIA CHARTER SCHOOL ISSUES

Q_   How do you respond to charges that charter schools are breeding grounds for religious
     instruction, as in the case of the recent consideration of a charter school application
     based on scientology?

A.    While charter schools are freed from many rules and regulations, they are not exempt from
     health, safety and civil rights requirements under the law. Federal law is clear that public
     schools cannot promote religion. As with all other public school, charter schools must be
     non-sectarian.

     Deciding which schools to charter is solely a state and local matter. The chartering authority
     -- in California, its the local school district -- is responsible for evaluating the charter
     application to detennine, among other things, whether the charter complies with federal and


                                                  2
                                                                                Hex.Dump Conversion
     state definitions of a public, non-sectarian school. If issues arise concerning any public
     school's non-sectarian status, the U.S. Department of Education can investigate those
     concerns.

     Background on scientology charter: A former special education teacher in the Los Angeles
     district submitted a charter application to create a K-8 school. The school would utilize a
     educational methodology set forth in texts written by the founder ofthe Church of
     Scientology. The district delayed a hearing on the charter application pending its review of
     the proposed texts -- which have been used by other area teachers for years -- and the
     school's connection, if any, to the Church of Scientology. According to the district official
     overseeing the charter process, the applicant has temporarily withdrawn the charter
     application.


Q.   California has more than 130 charter schools, but only 34 of them have received Federal
     start-up grants. Why has California received so little Federal charter school funding?

A.   Each state receiving federal grants establishes its own process to award sub grants to the
     charter schools in their state. California's sub grant program focused on newer schools.
     California had many schools operating before it received Federal funds and the state allocated
     most of its funds for start-up costs. Schools that had already been operating for a year or more
     did not apply for, or receive, funds for start-up costs. Other states have shaped their programs
     differently, providing funding to larger proportions of their charter schools and, in some
     cases, funding older charter schools.

     California's newly announced FY 1997 grant will increase its charter school funding by an
     additional $3.4 million. This increase should enable California to raise the proportion of its
     charter schools receiving federal support.


Q.   If the country is to reach the President's goal of 3,000 charter schools, shouldn't
     California revise its charter law to repeal or expand its cap on the number of schools?

A.   Decisions about the number of charter schools in a particular state are clearly decisions for
     state legislatures. The President firmly believes that the number of charter schools nationwide
     should be increased -- and he has included funding of$100 million in the FY 1998 budget to
     support the development of approximately 900-1000 new charter schools. The Department
     of Education's charter school program provides start-up funding, technical assistance and
     research support that we hope will enable states to increase the number of charter schools.
     Ultimately, Californians should look at the success of these schools and make their own
     decisions about how many more they want.



                           NATIONAL TESTS IN CALIFORNIA

Q.    Is California participating in the national testing initiative?

                                                3
                                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion

A.   We do not consider California to be one of the seven states (Alaska, Kentucky, Maryland,
     Massachusetts, Michigan, North Carolina and west Virginia) that has committed to
     participate in the tests.

     Last April, State Superintendent of Public Instruction Delaine Eastin announced her support
     for the President's national testing initiative, and her intention to work to secure support for
     California's participation in it. Gov. Wilson and the State Board of Education (appointed by
     the Gov.) have indicated that they believe that the State Superintendent lacks the authority to
     unilaterally commit the state to participate in the tests. Superintendent Eastin agrees with
     this, which is why she explicitly indicated in April that she would work to secure the support
     of the Governor and the State Board of Education. We hope that the State Superintendent,
     the Governor and the State Board of Education will be able to work together to enable
     parents, teachers and all others involved in education to determine how well students and
     schools in California perform compared to rigorous national standards.

     In addition last July the Los Angeles, Fresno and Long Beach school districts - in each case
     with the full support of the school board, superintendent, and teachers' organization--
     announced their intention to participate in the President's national test, along with 12 other
     large city school districts around the country. We believe there may be other local school
     districts in California and elsewhere that also want to participate, and we would welcome the
     participation of any interested local school district.

Q.   We have heard that Los Angeles and perhaps other city school systems have withdrawn
     from the testing initiative because the reading test will be given in English only, and
     there will not be a Spanish version for Hispanic students with limited English
     proficiency. Is this true?

     We are aware that this has been a controversial issue nationally as well as it has here in
     California. However, neither the White House nor the Education Department has heard from
     Los Angeles or any other city that it will back away from its commitment to participate in
     these tests.

     Note: There is infact a rumor that L.A. will decide not to participate in the 4th grade reading
     test because ofour decision to test in reading only in English, while continuing to participate
     in the 8th grade math test (which will be available in a Spanish-English version). However,
     there has been no public announcement of this, and there is not likely to be a public
     announcement or any notification to the Education Department while we are still fighting in
     Congress for the tests. There have been no signs that Fresno or Long Beach are
     contemplating a similar move.

     In addition, note that just last week California passed legislation establishing a state testing
     program, at Gov. Wilson's insistence, and over the objections ofmany Democrats (including
     Delaine Eastin). He threatened to veto the state budget bill if it did not include his tests.
     Among the contentious issues in this debate was whether limited English proficient students
     would be tested in their native language. The compromise that was reached requires all
     students to be tested in English, and allows local school districts to also test students in their

                                                 4
                                                                             Hex.Dump ConversIOn
     native language if they have been in school for less than a year, and ifan appropriate test is
     available.
Q.   Earlier this week a statewide panel recommended statewide academic standards for
     California. The state budget also contains new legislation proposed by Gov. Wilson,
     requiring norm-referenced testing to begin this school year. How will these steps affect
     either State or local school district participation in your national testing initiative?
     Won't this lead to layer upon layer of standards and tests?

     First, it is good that California is on the way to adopting its own academic standards. This is a
     critical step to raising academic expectations, strengthening the curriculum, and increasing
     accountability for our schools. Other states have already done this, and it is good the
     California is proceeding to do this as well.

     While these standards are developed in California, it is my understanding that the panel that
     developed them looked carefully at national standards, including those that are used to guide
     the development of the National Assessment of Education Progress (NAEP), and therefore
     are also guiding the development of national tests in 4th grade reading and 8th grade math.
     Therefore, I hope that when these standards are finally adopted and the state considers ways
     of measuring student performance, they will take a good look at the national tests I have
     proposed. I believe they will find that these tests can help measure students compared with
     state standards as well as national standards.

     Second, with regard to the new testing requirements in California, I agree that there must be
     testing of every student, and there must be a test score for each student, not just for the school
     as a whole. One of the purposes of these new tests, as I understand it, is to tell how well
     students are doing compared to national norms. The new testing requirements take effect
     this school year, a year before my proposed tests will be available. However, once the new
     national tests are available, I believe state officials should take a careful look at them. In
     addition to helping parents, teachers and taxpayers know how well California students
     measure up against state and national standards, they will also provide information on how
     well students and schools perform compared with others throughout the nation. Further, the
     8th grade math test will provide international comparisons as well, so that parents can tell
     how well their students perform compared to 8th graders in 41 other countries, in addition to
     students here..


     Note: The proposed state standards are supported by Delaine Eastin, and are central to her
     education reform plans for the state. She has worked to make sure they are aligned with
     NAEP and can therefore be the basis for California's participation in the national tests.

     Much of the controversy over Gov. Wilson's recently enacted testing proposal arose from the
     fact that he insisted on beginning testing this school year, with commercially produced tests
      that could not possibly reflect the state standards. Wilson proposed these tests in part
     because California lacked any uniform statewide testing program, and because the plans for
     developing new assessments aligned to California's new standards only called for assessing
     a sample ofstudents instead ofall students. It is widely suspected that he insisted on the fast
     time line for testing in order for the test to be administered at least once before he leaves

                                                 5
                                                                               Hex·Dump Conversion
     office.

     The Governor's insistence on testing all students against national norms, and the deliberate
     attempt to keep the newly developed state standards aligned with NAEP, suggests that, over
     time, the national tests could serve both demands better than any current commercially
     available test.

     The biggest obstacle to accomplishing this is political rather than technical, and depends
     upon California education and political leaders finding a way to work together rather than
     continue to fight over testing issues. You can best help this by simply pointing out the value
     ofthe national tests in the California context, without taking sides in the political battles.


               PROP. 209IDECLINING MINORITY COLLEGE ADMISSIONS

Q.   Are you concerned about declining enrollments of minority students in California
     postsecondary education?

A.   These declines -- not just in California, but in Texas, as well -- are disturbing and completely
     unacceptable. Educational opportunity is the touchstone of the American dream, and these
     trends raise a serious concem that the doors of college education are being closed to minority
     students. In addition, diversity in education helps prepare all our students to be productive
     citizens in the 21 st century, so these developments should concem every American.

Q.   What is your administration doing to address this problem?

A.   First, we will use federal law to the maximum extent we can to promote an integrated
     education environment in postsecondary education, not just in California, but elsewhere. In
     particular, we will continue to support appropriate affirmative action programs and oppose
     efforts like Proposition 209.

     Second, we are pressing state officials and educators to maintain and expand diversity, and
     offering assistance to them to do so. We have called on colleges and universities burdened
     by new legal restrictions to recruit aggressively in secondary schools with high percentages
     of minority students and to form educational partnerships with such schools. Many colleges
     in California are developing plans to this effect. We have also called on these university
     systems to review different kinds of admissions programs, such as Texas' decision to
     guarantee college admission to the top 10% of the graduating class in any high school in the
     state.

     Third, we have fought for resources to improve education and open doors to college. The
     budget agreement contained the biggest increase in education funding in a generation,
     including major increases in Pell Grant funds and college work-study, and the new Hope
     Scholarship and Lifelong Learning tax credit. The Administration is beginning a campaign
     to make sure that the parents of every middle school student, and students themselves, know
     that a college education is attainable if students stay in school, take tough classes, and study
     hard.

                                                 6
                                                                             Hex-Dump Conversion

Q.   Are you planning to petition the Supreme Court to review the Ninth Circuit's decision
     upholding Proposition 209?

A.   I am awaiting advice on that question from my legal counsel and the Solicitor General, and I
     shouldn't address that question until I receive their advice. I can say that I will do everything
     I can to prevent other states or cities from passing ill-considered proposals like Proposition
     209.
