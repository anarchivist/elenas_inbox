                  Jury: Tobacco Company Not Liable

                           By Ron Word
                           Associated Press Writer
                           Friday, October 31, 1997; 11:07 a.m. EST

                           JACKSONVILLE, Fla.    (AP)   -- A jury ruled today
that the
                           R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. wasn't liable for the
cancer
                            suffered by an ex-smoker who had accused it of
failing to warn
                            the public about the dangers of cigarettes.

                           JoAnn Karbiwnyk, 59, who said she began smoking
on a dare
                            in high school, had asked the jury to award her
$200,000 in
                            actual damages,   $200,000 in future damages and
enough
                           punitive damages --to send a clear signal."

                           The jury deliberated about eight hours overall,
beginning
                           Wednesday and wrapping up today after about an
hour's
                           work. The trial began Oct. 6 with jury selection.

                            The loan processor from nearby Orange Park told
the jury that
                            she smoked for almost 30 years before quitting in
1984.


                         In 1995, she developed uterine cancer and lung
cancer, which
                         spread to her brain. All her cancers are in
remission.

                         The jury of four women and two men was asked to
consider
                         two questions: Was negligence by R.J. Reynolds a
legal cause
                         of Ms. Karbiwnyk's cancer? Were the Winston and
Salem
                         Light cigarettes she smoked unreasonably
dangerous and
                         defective.

                         Jurors said to both questions.

                         Reynolds' attorneys had argued that it couldn't
be proven that
                         its products were responsible for Mrs.
Karbiwnyk's cancer.

                         This was the third time that Karbiwnyk's
attorney, Norwood
                         "Woody"      Wilner, has gone to trial against
cigarette makers on
                         behalf of an ex-smoker had developed cancer.

                         Last fall,-he won a $750,000 verdict against
Brown &
                         Williamson Tobacco Co., on behalf of Grady
Carter.

                         Last spring, he lost a lawsuit against Reynolds
on behalf of the
                         family of Jean Connor, a woman who died after
contracting
                         lung cancer.

                         Wilner has four more tobacco trials scheduled for
next year.


Reynolds pleased with Jacksonville verdict

By Brad Liston

JACKSONVILLE, Fla., Oct 31 (Reuters) - R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co officials
said Friday they were pleased that a jury had
cleared the firm in a product liability suit. The suit was filed by a
Florida grandmother who suffered from lung cancer.

Ted Grossman, Reynolds' attorney in the case filed by Jean Karbiwnyk, 59,
told reporters the outcome was "particularly
satisfying because it came after the admission of documents that I think
most courts would not have allowed. ' ,

Grossman was referring to records taken from a law firm working for Brown
& Williamson Tobacco Corp. The documents
had helped Karbiwnyk's attorney, Norwood "Woody" Wilner, secure a
·
    victory against that company last year in a product
    liability suit filed by former smoker Grady Carter.

    That $750,000 jury award is being appealed.

    Wilner told reporters he had not yet decided whether he would appeal. The
    jury of two men and four women deliberated for
    about seven hours over three days before delivering the verdicts Friday
    morning.

    In the unanimous verdicts, the panel cleared Reynolds of negligence and
    found that the company's Winston and Salem Lights
    cigarettes were not unreasonably dangerous and defective and not the legal
    cause of loss, injury or damage to Karbiwnyk.

    Wilner noted that his third product liability lawsuit against a cigarette
    maker would not be his last.

    "If R.J. Reynolds thinks this is the end of it, they have another thing
    coming," he said. wilner said he has hundreds of cigarette
    lawsuits either filed or waiting to be filed in Florida. "We knew this
    was going to be a long and bloody contest and we're ready
    to go on from here," he said.

    Karbiwnyk said she was disappointed. " I was hoping for a different
    verdict. I'm disappointed, but life goes on,"  she told
    reporters.

    R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co is a unit of RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp (RN).
    Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp is a unit of
    B.A.T Industries PIc (BATS.L) (BTl).

    Much of Wilner's case hinged on decades-old records found in Reynolds'
    archives demonstrating the risks of tobacco.

    Dan Donahue, Reynolds' vice president for research, said the company
    effectively turned the tables on that evidence. "The
    world should be alarmed if in fact there was not evidence in the records
    of the tobacco companies of the existence of risk in the
    50s, when that information was being developed. That would be evidence
    that the industry didn't care," he said.
