     Subject:

     Thanks for all your support on Kick Butts Day. As you know from the memo
     I sent over on Friday,  Secretary Herman (video for VA high school and six
     high school press call), Secretary Shalala (Parma, Ohio), Acting HUD
     Deputy Secretary Saul Ramirez (Tuscon), Secretary Riley (Detroit, MI),
     Acting Secretary Togo West (Nashville), Deputy EPA Administrator Fred
     Hansen (Woodbridge, VA), Director Janice LaChance (local), Administrator
     Dave Barram (Philadelphia?) and SSA Commissioner Ken Apfel (Baltimore)
     will participate in Kick Butts events around the country. Secretary
     Albright and Secretary Glickman will refer to Kick Butts Day in remarks
     Wednesday and Thursday.

     As of now, neither a Secretary or Deputy level person will participate
     from Treasury, Defense, Interior, Commerce, DOT, Energy (Moeller is
     trying), CEA, OMB, UN, USTR, ONDCP, SBA, CIA, OPM, USIA, DPC.

     HUD, Commerce, DOT have some participation at lower levels.   SBA and GSA
     have some good regional activity.

     I would be very helpful if you could make several call to cabinet members
     or Chiefs of Staffs to help move this along.   1)  Sec. Rubin or Mike
     Froman (622-1906), 2) Sec. Cohen or Bob Tyrer (703-695-5261), 3) Secretary
     Daley or David Lane (482-4246), 4) Sec. Cuomo or Jon Cowan (708-2713), 5)
     General Mcaffrey or Janet Crist (395-6732).

     As you suggested, we met today with WH outreach offices to make sure we're
     touching all bases to give this national scope. IGA, Congressional, press
     are each engaged on this.

     Barbara Woolley (OPL) and Cynthia Rice (DPC) have been great partners in
     this endeavor. The VP's office (Toby Donenfeld) has been extremely
     helpful. The VP will lead this entire effort with an event Thursday at


Hines Jr. High in D.C. As you know, we are slightly hampered by the
decision to do pay equity on Thursday. Janice LaChance will have to stay
closer to DC and Secretary Herman will not be able to do a live event.

Tomorrow, the WH group will meet at llam. Our next interagency conf. call
will be tomorrow (Tuesday) at 5pm on 2466. We (Cynthia and I) will brief
the Chiefs of Staff tomorrow at our breakfast at 8:30 in the Roosevelt
Room. That would be a great place to drop-by and say how important this
is(and maybe button hole a few chiefs), if you can and are inclined.

Julia Payne (press) will put out a full release with all the agency
participation Wednesday or Thursday and will coordinate a series of
conference calls (like the one Sec. Herman is doing) with Cabinet members
who absolutely, positively, can't do an event.

Thanks for all your support on this. Let me know if you have questions.
Steve
