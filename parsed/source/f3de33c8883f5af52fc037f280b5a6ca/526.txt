TEXT:
Thanks for you help on the radiation issue. Your thoughts helped to stimulate a
productive discussion with DOJ on alternative approaches.
DOJ and I are planning to put a revised proposal into OMS review on Friday. The
new approach quantifies uncertainties in the claims process, and proposes to
give the miners the benefit of the doubt in resolving the uncertainties.   This
approach avoids the precedential issue that DOJ was concerned about, while
expanding the number of miners eligible for compensation.   (Miners who fall
within this approach would still get partial compensation.)
Please let me know if you wish to discuss this.  We are still planning a Tuesday
press conference.
