TEXT:
I shared my concern with George that the SAP could backfire in the
women's community if based solely on the health exception. He
said a reworked version that mentions both the erosion of Roe and
the health exception might be OK.
I don't know if the SAP has gone yet, but here would be my edit.

TEXT:
The Administration strongly opposes HR 1833. This legislation
undermines the constitutional standard established in Roe v. Wade
and specifically fails to provide any exception to protect the
health of the mother.  The President believes that abortion should
be safe, legal and rare.  He has long opposed late-term abortions
except when they are necessary to protect the life or health of
the mother, consistent with the Supreme Court's decision in Roe.
