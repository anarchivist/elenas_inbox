DRAFT -- NOT FOR RELEASE

April 30, 1998

The Honorable Lamar Smith
Chairman
Subcommittee on Immigration
Judiciary Committee
U. S. House of Representatives
Washington, D.C.  20510

Dear Mr. Chairman:

        Today, your Subcommittee will mark-up H.R. 3736, the U&Workforce
Improvement and Protection Act of 1998~J8 which is intended to address the
growing demand for skilled workers in the information technology (IT)
industry by enacting a temporary increase in the annual cap on the number
of temporary visas for foreign D&speoialtyD8 workers under the H-1B
program, while also effecting reforms to the H-1B program that would help
target their usage to industries and employers that are actually
experiencing skill shortages.

        The Administration believes that the first step in increasing the
availability of skilled workers must be raising the skills of U.S. workers
and helping the labor market work better to match employers with U.S.
workers. Therefore, substantial additional efforts by industry to
increase the skill level of U.S. workers and needed improvements in the
H-1B visa program are necessary prerequisites for the Administration to
support any short-term increases in the number of visas for temporary
foreign workers.

        We are pleased that H.R. 3736 is consistent with one of our
primary objectives, insofar as it conditions a temporary increase in the
H-1B cap on the enactment of meaningful reforms to the H-1B visa program.
Your bill would help ensure that no U.S. worker would lose their job to a
similarly qualified temporary foreign worker and that every qualified U.S.
worker would have the opportunity to fill a job before a temporary foreign
worker. Moreover, your bill greatly strengthens program requirements and
enforcement to prevent employer abuses of the H-1B program.

        Unfortunately, H.R. 3736 does not contain any provision for
additional training opportunities for U.S. workers. This training is a
vital component of our strategy to address the long-term demand for highly
skilled U.S. workers and to enhance the international competitiveness of
important U.S. industries. An effective training strategy would also work
to lessen the need for more H-1B visas. We are also concerned that the
increase reflected in this bill is large and is not, in any event,
targeted to skill shortages being used to justify this change in policy
(i.e., advanced degrees or significant practical experience in math,
science, or engineering) .

        For these reasons, the Administration believes that this
legislation would substantially improve the current H-1B program and, with
the addition of meaningful training strategies and a modest reduction in
the level of increase in the annual cap, would garner the
AdministrationD,s strong support. We look forward to working with the
Congress on these and other specific provisions in the bill.


        The Office of Management and Budget advises that there is no
objection to the submission of this report from the standpoint of the
AdministrationD,s program.



Sincerely,




Bruce Reed
Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy




Gene B. Sperling
Assistant to the President for Economic Policy
