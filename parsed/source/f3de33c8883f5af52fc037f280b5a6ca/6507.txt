TEXT:
After a grueling two hour meeting this morning, FDA, USDA, State, and USTR
resolved all of their differences and reworked both the Qs and As and
Talking Points.  I think the meeting was helpful to all parties and we're
now in much better shape to promote the import legislation on the Hill
(without raising trade concerns). Thanks for offering to step in if
needed.
