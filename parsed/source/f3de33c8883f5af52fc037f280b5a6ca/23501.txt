TEXT:
As I said at this morning's staff meeting, the Workforce Investment Act
rule will be published Friday (on public display Thursday). DOL is
planning to brief trade press Thursday morning and distribute a press
release that day.  I believe our options include:

1) At a minimum, get good quotes from the President in the DOL release

2) Issue a written statement from the President Thursday from the WH

3) Have the President discuss the issue at the top of the press conference
Thursday

4) Have the President do an event Thursday

5) Have the President do an event later around the approval of the first
new One Stop (maybe coinciding with the monthly employment statistics or
some other jobs announcement).

I recommend #1 and #5.
