TEXT:
Cynthia heard a rumor from Levin's staff that Treasury is getting close to
a decision on workfare and FICA/FUTA, so I checked with Karl Scholz.   He
said it is probably true.  IRS is now reviewing an interpretation would
treat FICA/FUTA in the same way as the EITC -- i.e., workfare would be
exempt from these taxes.

If the IRS clears it (not a given), it would be ready sometime after
December 15, but perhaps before the New Year. It will go through a normal
OMB clearance process here.

It will include a limited definition of work experience/community service
that is similar to what Wendell was pushing a while back, and that we were
comfortable with. The goal of the definition is to prevent states from
shoe-horning all kinds of work into those 2 categories in order to avoid
FICA taxes.  He couldn't recall all of this, and we have to double-check
that it's OK, but it includes things like stipulating that the check has
to come from the welfare office. Karl said that DOL may not think this is
strong enough and may raise concerns about the whole thing (!).

In the meantime, we have to decide how to respond to Levin's rumor.   I
think we can say that they may be getting close but it's not over till
it's over. But it may be hard to control how this becomes public, given
all the agencies that will know, and the Treasury-Wendell-Levin link.

But it could be good news!
