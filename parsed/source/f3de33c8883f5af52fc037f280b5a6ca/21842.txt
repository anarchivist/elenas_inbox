                        Commission Report on Phthalates in Toys
                                     December 2, 1998


       I congratulate Chairman Ann Brown and the Consumer Product Safety Commission on
the release of a comprehensive and thoughtful report examining the potential exposure and health
risks to children from teethers, pacifiers, rattles and toys containing chemicals called phthalates
that are used to soften plastic. The report makes clear that the best scientific evidence shows
that children are not at risk of harmful exposure to these chemicals. It also provides
information to consumers about the safety of products that may contain phthalates, and outlines
the Commission's plans for further study. I also commend the many manufacturers and retailers
who are taking the additional, precautionary step of discontinuing the sale of products designed
for children to put in their mouths that contain the phthalate DINP. This should allay any
remaining fears that families have about these products.

       The CPSC report and supporting measures by manufacturers and retailers will go a long
way toward calming concerns about the safety of products used everyday by our nation's
youngest children. This report also commits the Consumer Product Safety Commission to
pursue additional rigorous work in this area. The Administration will support both the
Commission's continued efforts to investigate any risks to children from phthalates, as well as
government and private efforts both here and abroa~ to take appropriate precautionary measures.
