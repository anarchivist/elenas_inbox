TEXT:
Maria had a few good suggestions for the outreach section.  She wanted to
change the sentence "We will encourage others to share their views etc."
to read "Working with OPL, we will encourage other interest groups
(children's advocates, women's organizations, farmers) to share their
views etc." At the end of that sentence, we should say "meetings with
agency and White House staff".

Thanks.
