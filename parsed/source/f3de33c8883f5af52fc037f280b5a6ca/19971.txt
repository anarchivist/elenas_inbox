                    Question & Answer on Immigration: H-1B visas
                                   May 20,1998

Q:   According to the INS, the annual cap on H-1B visas has been reached. What is your
     position regarding the call by industry to increase the number of temporary visas
     available"for highly skilled foreign workers?

A:   The Administration believes that the first step in increasing the availability of skilled
     workers for industry must be increasing the skills of U.S. workers and helping the labor
     market work better to match employers with U.S. workers. That is why the
     Administration has tried to encourage the private and the public sector to undertake new
     efforts to train our workers.

     However, we also need to improve the temporary visa program to ensure that U.S.
     workers do not lose their jobs to temporary foreign workers and that qualified U.S.
     workers have the opportunity to fill a job before a temporary foreign worker is hired.
     These reforms would target the visa program's use to employers experiencing genuine
     skills shortages.

     With commitments to increased training and reforms to the H-IB visa program, we would
     support a short-term increase in the number of visas available for temporary foreign
     workers.

Q:   The House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration has approved legislation that
     increases the number of H-1B visas for temporary foreign workers. What is your
     position regarding this legislation?

A:   We are pleased that Representative Smith's bill is consistent with one of the
     Administration's primary objectives, insofar as it links a short-term increase in the H-IB
     cap to the enactment of meaningful reforms to the H-IB visa program. These reforms
     would help ensure that U.S. workers would not lose their jobs to temporary foreign
     workers and that employers have made serious efforts to recruit U.S. workers for open
     positions so that qualified U.S. workers have the opportunity to fill ajob before a
     temporary foreign worker is hired. These reforms will effectively target H-l B visas to
     industries experiencing genuine skill shortages.

     Unfortunately, the bill does not contain any provision for additional training opportunities
     for U.S. workers. Training is a vital component of the Administration's strategy to
     address the long-term demand for highly skilled U.S. workers and to enhance the
     international competitiveness of important U.S. industries.

     The Administration would be pleased to support this bill if it included a meaningful
     training provision and a more modest increase in the annual cap.
                                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion

        Q:     What is your position regarding Senator Abraham's bill that was passed by the
               Senate on Monday?

        A:     The Administration strongly opposes Senator Abraham's bill. The bill includes a large
               increase in the annual number of visas for temporary foreign workers (up to 115,000) and
               provides no meaningful reform to the H-IB program.


        Background

        On April 2, 1998, the Administration (Secretaries Daley and Herman and Attorney General
        Reno) sent a letter to' Congress that opposed Senator Abraham's bill and endorsed the approach
        advocated by Senator Kennedy (that would effect a temporary increase in the cap, but also
        included reform to the H-IB program and increased training for U.S. workers). On May 11,
        1998, we sent a Statement of Administration Policy to the Senate that strongly opposed Senator
        Abraham's bill and stated that the Secretary of Labor would recommend a veto.

        On April 30, 1998, the Administration sent a letter to the House Judiciary Subcommittee on
        Immigration supporting Representative Lamar Smith's bill ifit is modified to include a
        meaningful training provision and a more modest increase in the cap. This bill is scheduled to
        be marked-up by the full Judiciary Committee on May 20th.
