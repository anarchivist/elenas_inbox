TEXT:
Here's a quick rundown:
        Option of total administrative fix off the table, unless
OLC sees something new.
        Budget's welfare legislative fix package includes partial
fix for the bucket: exempt disabled legal immigrants from SSI
cuts. This leaves out the elderly.
        HHS's best admin fix thinking had 2 parts:
                 -across the board 1 year delay; and
                 -"medically needy" reg that will help some states.
        Neither of these last 2 are in the budget so, if we want to
go ahead with them, we can't talk about them till the budget's
been out for a while.   But we could theoretically tell the groups
when the budget is released that we continue to ponder the
question of admin fixes.
