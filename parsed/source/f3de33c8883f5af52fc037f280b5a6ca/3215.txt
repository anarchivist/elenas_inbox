     TEXT:
     As many of you know, today is the effective date of the Kennedy-Kassebaum
     law.

     Mr. Lockhart has had the brilliant idea of issuing a statement by the
     President so that we can get in the stories.  I've taken the liberty of
     calling Chris Jennings, who is going to work on something for us to put
     out today.  If anybody objects, please speak your mind.
