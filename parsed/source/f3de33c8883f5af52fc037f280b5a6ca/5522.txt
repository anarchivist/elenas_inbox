 TEXT:
 Here is final AIDS memo.  The Medicare Clinical Cancer Trials memo has
 been folded into the larger Medicare memo that should come shortly (or
 maybe already came).  So now I just owe you increasing biomedical research.

     MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

     FROM:         BRUCE REED
                   GENE SPERLING
                   CHRIS JENNINGS

     SUBJECT:      New AIDS Initiative

     Overview

            We have developed an $115 million initiative for your FY 1999 budget to improve AIDS
     treatment and prevention programs. This increase would go to expand programs that are critical
     to preventing and treating this epidemic, including the AIDS Assistance Drugs Programs
     (ADAP) which extends life-saving new treatment therapies to low-income and underserved
     populations.                                                                .

     Background on AIDS Funding

              Since you came into office, funding for AIDS programs that focus on treatment and
     prevention have improved dramatically. Medicaid, which provides coverage for half of all
     people with AIDS, now covers protease inhibitors. Funding for the Ryan White Program has
     increased by 200 percent since FYl993, funding for research at NIH has increased by 50 percent
     since that year, and funding for the ADAP program has increased 450 percent since 1996.

              The AIDS community, however, has expressed disappointment with the Administration's
     recent efforts in this area. AIDS groups criticized the Administration for failing to propose
     major increases in discretionary spending in FY1998, which allowed the Congress to far
     outspend us in this area. And in just the last few weeks, the AIDS community reacted
     negatively to HCFA's conclusion, in response to the Vice President's inquiry, that budget
     neutrality requirements prohibit establishing a Medicaid demonstration to provide early treatment
     to relatively healthy HIV-infected individuals. There is no doubt that the AIDS community will
     be examining the Administration's FY 1999 budget submission closely.

     Proposal

             The AIDS office is recommending, and we agree, that you propose an $115 million
     increase in your FY 1999 budget for AIDS treatment and prevention. (OMB is currently
     recommending $100 million). We could allocate all of this spending to existing discretionary
     programs that emphasize prevention and treatment. We would recommend that the majority of
     this increase be allocated to the ADAP program on the grounds that new and effective treatments
     of this disease are not reaching many who need them. We also would recommend modest
     increases to a range of programs providing funds to states, cities, and community health centers,
     as well as the CDC prevention education programs.
                                                                       Hex-Dump Conversion


        Although the $115 million that we are suggesting falls far short of the unrealistic $400
 million the AIDS advocates are pushing, it is a significant investment that will improve AIDS
 treatment and prevention and should be sufficient to help quiet any major criticism from the
.community.

        Finally, in the wake ofHCFA's decision on the Medicaid demonstration program
discussed above, Nancy-Ann Min DeParle is looking into the possibility of a legislative proposal
(which need not be budget neutral) for a model pilot project to expand eligibility to Medicaid for
people with HIV earlier in the progression of their disease. As of this writing, we are dubious if
such a proposal is feasible and whether it can be done in time for the budget process. However,
the Vice President has requested that we review options in this regard.
