TEXT:
Elena: Can you tell me who in DPC would want to be included in EOP
discussions concerning a congessionally mandated (rider in the Omnibus
approps bill)  OMB revision to Circular A-lID.  The proposed revision
would bring under FOIA all research data obtained through federal support.
 The proposed revision is supported by the NRA, Tobacco and the business
community in general.  The research community opposes it. OMB's comment
period closed yesterday and they received about 10,000 comments. Lots of
form letters supporting the revision. My guess is that overall the split
will be something like 40% against/60% for.  OMB hasn't completed their
analysis yet. The research community (and OSTP) believes that bringing
data under FOIA will have a chilling effect on clinical trails and researc
h in general. Lots of issues associated with confidentiality, IPR, cost,
harassment, etc. Most agencies have adequate data release policies and
science, for the most part, promotes data sharing. Some agencies have a
better track record than others (e.g., EPA)--therefore we ended up with
the rider that uses a sledge hammer to fix a problem that only required a
minor tap. Rep. George Brown (D-CA) has submitted a bill (with 28
bipartisan co-sponsors so far) that would repeal the rider. Thanks, Cliff
