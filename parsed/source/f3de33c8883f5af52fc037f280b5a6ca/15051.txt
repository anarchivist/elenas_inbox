TEXT:
I got calls from Toni Cook Bush, representing Anheuser-Busch and Carolyn
Panzer representing Guiness.  I'm pretty sure that these two, who had
visited me on the issue, were on the list of notification calls that I
drew up. But both said that they had had no call from the White House.

Am I mistaken about their being on the list?

If I'm not, are there any other calls on the list that haven't been made.

Sorry to bother you about this, particularly if it's my mistake about
their being on the list, but they were surprised and unhappy that they
were surprised.
