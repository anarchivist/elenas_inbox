from thinking the President will exploit tobacco as a political issue.
Tomorrow might be a good day to put in a courtesy call to him to explain
the President's bipartisan message in the SOTU.   I know you are talking
to some members in our caucus, are you planning to talk tobacco in
addition to other topics?

2.  Internal meetings to do soon
Farmers-- scheduling for this week
International-- sent you e-mail of results
Smuggling/blackmarket-- waiting for Gruber to get back from vacation

The others on our list are: state penalties, legal fees, documents,
Medicare/VA/DOD, drugs/alcohol, asbestos, state spending, Liggett, excess
profits tax, antitrust, class action, minorities/cessation, FDA bill. Any
