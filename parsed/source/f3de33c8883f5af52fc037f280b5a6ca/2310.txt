FROM:      OMB LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS

DATE:      MAY 19, 1997

SUBJECT:           LEGISLATIVE REPORT


SUPPLEMENTAL
The Disaster/Bosnia Supplemental Conference will take place tomorrow at
11:00 am. After the weekly policy luncheons, the Conferees intend to meet
again at 5:00 pm and continue until they are finished. The House Rules


Committee announced that they plan to take up both the Supplemental and
the Budget Resolution Conference Reports on Wednesday, though that
schedule may get pushed back.

BUDGET RESOLUTION --SENATE BUDGET COMMITTEE
Early Monday evening, the Senate Budget Committee voted to report the
budget resolution to the Senate by a vote of 17-4 (no votes were: Gramm,
Grams, Hollings, Sarbanes).   Floor action will begin Tuesday afternoon.
The Committee took the following action on amendments during the mark-up:

o       Conrad Sense of Senate amendment urging efforts on structural
entitlement     reforms and     making CPI more accurate:
Approved 17-4
o       Wyden amendment to remove the 0+98 and 0+99 firewalls;   and
reduce defense spending to      last yearO,s budget resolution
level: Defeated 6-15
o       Bond/Durbin/Conrad/Hollings sense of Senate to increase
self-employed health    deduction        to 100 percent: Approved by
voice vote
o       Murray sense of Senate that function 500 includes adequate
resources for           teacher training         in technology:
Defeated 10-11
o       Murray sense of Senate on adequate resources for early childhood
development     and education: Defeated 10-11

BUDGET RESOLUTION -- HOUSE RULES COMMITTEE
The House Rules Committee today adopted the rule to consider H.R. 84, the
Budget Resolution, which will go to the House floor on Tuesday.   The rule
is a modified closed rule, and provides for 5 hours of debate.

The Rule makes in order the following five amendments:

1       Congressional Black Caucus (Waters/Thompson) substitute amendment, which
does not provide for any new tax cuts until the budget balances in 2002.
The amendment fully funds a child health initiative to cbver all 10
million uninsured children, includes $25.5 billion in Medicare savings,
and includes the PresidentO,s $20.6 billions in welfare addbacks. (60
minutes debate)

2       Doolittle substitute amendment, which balances the budget by 2002,
increases tax cuts by $109.3 billion, reduces NDD spending, and allows a
point of order to be raised against any concurrent resolution on the
budget or on any bill that would cause total outlays to exceed total
receipts in 2002 or thereafter. (20 minutes debate)

3       BrownO,s 0&investment08 substitute amendment, which balances the budget
by 2002, and provides for tax cuts only after the budget is actually
balanced. The amendment provides increases in investments including R&D,
transportation, and education and training.  It offsets the increases by
limiting defense spending, incorporating the Medicare reform proposals
from the Budget Agreement, and including the reductions in unwarranted
benefits proposed by the President. (20 minutes debate)

4       Kennedy substitute amendment, which spends $100 billion more than the
Budget Agreement in priority areas of health, education, transportation,
R&D, and economic development.

5       Shuster substitute amendment, which increases outlays from the
Transportation Trust fund over 5 years to equal revenues over that period.
(20 minutes debate)



If the House adopts a substitute amendment, its adoption concludes
consideration of the concurrent resolution, and precludes consideration of
the other amendments. The Minge amendment -- which included Sense of the
Congress enforcement language to include a mechanism to trigger cuts in
entitlement programs and to sunset tax cuts if projections prove to be
inaccurate -- was not made in order. Chairman Kasich, however, will give
Minge 20 minutes of floor time to talk about his amendment.  In addition,
the rule waives the so-called Gephardt Rule, which means that they will
address the debt ceiling as a part of the reconciliation, rather than
automatically altering the debt limit upon adoption of the resolution.
(Please contact our office at 5-4790 if you need a copy of the Rule.)


Also on Tuesday, the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee will mark-up S.
261, DomeniciO,s Biennial budget bill, and S. 207, a bill to establish a
Corporate Subsidy Reform Commission.
