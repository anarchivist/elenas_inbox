TEXT:
Elena,
I got a draft of the Kennedy bill    l~st    night.   This is what it does:

1.      Increase of cap to 90K for FY98, FY99 and FY2000, then reducing
to 80K in FY2001 and back to 65K in FY2002. This increase is completely
off-set by lowering the cap for H2B visas. H2B·visas are general
temporary workers (not necessarily "skilled") that require a labor
certification for use.

2.      Requires the Comptroller General to conduct a study (by Oct. 1,
2000) that assesses labor market needs for high tech workers.  Study would
project needs in 2001 to 2006.

3.       Creates a Labor Dpt. loan program for training high tech
workers.   Secy of Labor to set criteria for which programs would qualify.
Secy of Labor to set a fee for application for H1B visa (not to exceed
$500). Money would go toward endowing the loan program.

4.      Provides for stiffer enforcement of misrepresentations on the
labor application.  Up the penalty to $10K (from $lK): Also, provides for
regular, random audits by the Dept. of Labor (to determine whether what
was attested to in the labor application is true) .

5.         Recruitment and no lay-off requirements prior to issuance of H1B
visa.
