 TEXT:
 Below for your review is a draft response from Bruce to 10 Senators who
 wrote the President to complain that SSA's regulation to implement the
 children's SSI cuts is too strict and does not reflect what Congress
 intended. The Senators are Conrad, Chafee, Kennedy, Harkin, Rockefeller,
 Jeffords, Baucus, Leahy, Dodd, and Daschle.

 I took advantage of the opportunity to note that the Senate has failed to
 include our budget agreement proposal to grandfather Medicaid for these
 children.

 please let Cynthia know of any changes in my absence.


 July 14, 1997

 Dear Senator --:

 Thank you for your letter to the President regarding the children's SSI
 provisions of the welfare reform law.

 The Administration is working to implement the new law fairly and
 effectively, including the children's SSI provisions.  The President has
 asked the Social Security Administration to ensure that the eligibility
 review process now underway allows eligible children to demonstrate that
 they meet the new definition of childhood disability, and that all
 appropriate appeal rights are provided to affected families.  The
 Administration believes that SSAO,s regulation is entirely consistent with
 the CongressD,s intent in the welfare reform law.

 As you know, as part of the balanced budget agreement, the President
 fought for and won inclusion of his proposal to proposal to grandfather
 Medicaid coverage for all children now on the rolls who do not meet SSID,s
 new definition of childhood disability.  The House reconciliation bill
 allows, but does not require, states to provide Medicaid benefits for
 these children, while the Senate bill does not include this proposal at
 all.  The Administration urges the conferees to conform to the budget
 agreement in this critical area and guarantee continued Medicaid benefits
 for these 30,000 children.


 Thank you for your letter on this critical issue.

 Sincerely,



 Bruce Reed
 Assistant to the President
    for Domestic Policy
