TEXT:
Ellen was the only one who got back to me on this, and she recommended one
change:
instead of "particularly the impact of its "safe harbor" provisions," it
should say, "including the Act's impact on litigation, investor protection
and information made available to investors." And for style reasons, we
would add a comma after "investor protection." Otherwise, we think the
statement is OK with Ellen's edit. Thanks.
