TEXT:
Here's another bilinugal education meeting to add to your calandars if you
can make it.   On short notice, we arranged for Kenji Hikuta of Standford
University (A renound expert who has just decided to come to town on some
additional business), Adaline Becker of Brown University Education
Alliance, and Donna Cristian of. the Center for Applied Linguisitics (They
run two way programs on bilingual education) -- TOMORROW AT 9 AM IN THE
WARD ROOM.     It would be great if you can make it. Sorry for the short
notice but because of Kenji's tight schedule and recent decision to come
to town, this time is what was avalible-- and we kind of just threw this
together.    I really hope you can make it!!! We will be discussing best
practices, and new approaches to bilinugal education among a few other
topics.
