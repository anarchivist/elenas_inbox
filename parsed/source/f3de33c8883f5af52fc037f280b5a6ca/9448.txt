WOMEN LEADERS TAKE ACTION TO STOP IMPEACHMENT,
WARN WHAT'S AT STAKE FOR WOMEN
AND WHO'S ON THIRD TO SUCCEED

        A wide array of leaders of the women's movement have joined
together today to make a united statement about the possible impeachment of
President Clinton by the Congress and about what is at stake for women in
this country.

        We are appalled by the extremely partisan cast that this process
has already taken.  The rush to publish the Starr Report and to broadcast
secret grand jury testimony -- before even a decision is made to proceed
with impeachment hearings -- is a failure of fairness and has violated the
fundamental value of due process ..

        We are witnessing a relentless campaign    both inside and outside
the government
-- to hound President Clinton out of office.  This is destabilizing for our
country and our democracy.  And some of those who are leading the charge
against Mr. Clinton are among the worst foes of women's rights.  The
opponents of the President have a political agenda that will harm women
long after the scandal has faded from the front pages.

        We are here today to sound the alarm that if disgust with the
current crisis depresses women's votes in November, we will see an
anti-women's rights majority in Congress roll back the gains for women of
the past 30 years.

        While women are angry and do not condone his conduct, women want
President Clinton to remain in office. We believe, and the women of the
nation concur, that Mr. Clinton's actions are not impeachable. His misdeeds
are not of the nature of high crimes and misdemeanors required by our
Constitution for impeachment of the president ..

        Gender gaps in public opinion poll results persist, with more women
than men opposing Mr. Clinton's impeachment, supporting his policies, and
approving of his presidency and leadership.

        As feminist leaders, we will not stand idly by while a Congress
made up of nearly
90 percent men attempts to remove the first president elected by women
voters.   While President Clinton's record for women's rights is less than
perfect, on balance women have had an ally in the White House.  If this
reactionary campaign succeeds, the unfinished agenda of women on equality
in Social Security, pay equity, childcare, anti-poverty remedies, minimum
wage, Medicare, real campaign finance reform which opens the system to
women and people of color, and laws against violence against women will
continue to languish in Congress.

        Not only are we standing united, we are urging action.   we are


urging the women and men of this nation to call their members of. the House
of Representatives to urge them not to proceed with impeachment hearings
and to call their Senators to oppose the removal of the President from
office.

        Most importantly, it is more crucial now than ever that women vote
in the November elections.  We must not let women's rights opponents sail
to victory because women do not vote.

        Women have much at stake in this election. If women's rights
advocates lose three seats in the Senate, we could lose the ability to
prevent the override of a presidential veto.  President Clinton's veto is
all that stands between Congress and women's right to abortion.  If the
presidential veto cannot be sustained after the election, it could mean
open season not only on women's rights but also on affirmative action,
Social Security, gun control, civil rights, and equal education
opportunities.

        Little has been said about the process of succession to the
presidency. Many people ask us: "What does it matter if President Clinton
leaves office? Wouldn't Vice President Gore simply assume the presidency?"
We firmly believe that the ultra-conservatives will not stop at removing
Mr. Clinton from office. Already Mr. Gore is under attack.   Women should
be asking the question, "Who's on 3rd?," -- who is next in the line of
succession? Next in line is Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich.

        The Gingrich Congress has been an unmitigated disaster for women.
The Gingrich Congress has voted 97 times this session to restrict abortion
rights and is now trying to prevent approval of RU 486, the early abortion
pill. The Gingrich Congress is trying to de fund family planning programs,
has ignored the Violence Against Women Act II, and has buried the patients'
bill of rights. Pay equity and childcare have not been allowed to see the
light of day.  The specter of a Gingrich presidency is even more horrif
ying.

        We call upon women to raise their voices to protest this assault on
fairness and the democratic process and to let the Congress know how
strongly women oppose impeachment. Women must demand that candidates tell
us where they stand on our issues and vote in November to turn out of
office the anti-women's rights majority in Congress.  We call upon Congress
to end this hypocritical voyeurism and get back to work on the real issues
that face this country.
