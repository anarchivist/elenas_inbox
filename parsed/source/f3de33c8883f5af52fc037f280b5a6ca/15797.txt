TEXT:
I had the same reaction as you to the lists that Joan prepared -- that
they're too big to be useful to the outside groups or to us.  Joan thinks
that more than a few from each list won't be able to participate, but she
agrees that creating another meeting and thereby making each meeting
smaller is optimal. She is re-faxing a list that does just that, making
each group, I believe, a total of 15 invited (which is still big, but
better than it was). Joan stresses the importance of giving everyone on
her lists at least the option of joining a meeting. We should have the
reformulated lists today.
