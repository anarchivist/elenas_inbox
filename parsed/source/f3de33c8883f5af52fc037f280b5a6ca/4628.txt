     Honorable Richard A. Gephart
     House of Representatives
     Washington, DC 20515-2503

     Dear Congressman Gephart :

             Thank you for your letter to the President asking him to consider establishing a national
     recognition program for students who remain fight-free throughout their schooling. Please
     forgive the delay in response.

            White House and Department of Education staff have studied your proposal carefully
     and agree that if our nation's schools are to be free of violence and drugs and offer a disciplined
     environment for learning, students must be encouraged to conduct themselves in a fight-free
     and drug-free manner .

               Unfortunately, at the present time neither the staff nor the resources exist that would be
     necessary to effectively develop a new national-level program recognizing individual students.
     However, the Department of Education is in the process of developing criteria to recognize
     schools and school districts demonstrating that their efforts have led to the creation of safe and
     drug-free learning environments. The Department Education is planning on announcing this
     recognition program this fall. The Department would be delighted to work with you or your
     staff in the development of this important program.

             Thank you for your continued interest in education and in creating safe environments for
     learning. If you or your staff have interest in learning more about the Department's Safe and
     Drug-Free Schools Recognition Prograrn, please contact Mr. William Modzeleski, Director, Safe
     and Drug-Free Schools Program. Mr. Modzeleski can be reached at (202) 260-1856.


                                                           Sincerely,


                                           Bruce Reed

Charlie Norwood
Member of Congress
1707 Longworth Office Building
U.S. House of Representatives
Washington, D.C. 20515

Dear Congressman Norwood:

Thank you for writing to the President on race relations. Please forgive the delay in response.
As you know, on June 14th, the President announced that he was initiating a year-long dialogue
on race with the American people. To this end, he appointed a seven-member commission to
help educate Americans about the facts surrounding issues of race, to encourage leadership at all
levels to help breach racial divides, and to recommend concrete solutions to our problems. I
have shared your recommendation on the work of the Society of the Heritage Crest with the
White House staff members working with the race initiative.

Again, thank you for contacting the President on this very important matter.


                                     ~incerely,




                                     Bruce N. Reed
                                     Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy
