TEXT:
I do not know exactly where we are positioned on the Gramm amendment, but
my sense is that we will have to be a little bit more forthcoming in the
next couple of days.

The Journal reports today that Lott has decided to work the Gramm
amendments on marriage penalty into the legislation.  The Journal also
says that we oppoe that measure and quotes Barry a saying it would crowd
out our initiatives on research and programs to curb smoking. Are we
comfortable with that formulation or should we have an answer that gives
us more wiggle room?

At the very least, I think we should try to get consensus on some press
guidance for the short term.  Do you have something Elena or would you
like Chuck to draft some options? Any initial thoughts on general
direction? please advise.
