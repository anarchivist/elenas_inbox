Q.     Can you say any more about the tobacco settlement now that your staff have had
       more time to review it?

A.    The task force reviewing the settlement -- led by Secretary Shalala and Bruce Reed -- has
      not yet finished its work or made recommendations to me. I've reached a final
      conclusion on only one part of the settlement: the requirement that the FDA make a
      finding about black markets before mandating any product change. That is an
      unreasonable requirement, which will too greatly limit the FDA's ability to make tobacco
      products safer or less addictive. The task force is making good progress in reviewing the
      rest ofthe proposed settlement and seeing how we can move forward to protect the health
      of our children.

Q.    So when do you expect to have something to say?

 A.    I expect to have more to say in the next month or so.


Q.    The industry has been winning recent battles in Congress. Efforts to fully fund
      FDA's tobacco program have failed in both the House and Senate, and a provision
      in the tax bill allowing industry to count the new tobacco tax as a credit against its
      settlement payments. Doesn't this show that the industry will get its way in
      Congress on any legislation and, if so, why pursue a settlement?

A.    First, I urge Congress to fully fund FDA's tobacco appropriation -- those funds will be
      used to reduce youth access to cigarettes and smokeless tobacco. Congress should stand
      with our children and provide the funds necessary to enforce the new federal law
      prohibiting sales to minors. As to the tobacco tax offset provision, the tobacco
      companies should not have asked for it and will not profit from it. If the tax is an offset,
      then any settlement payments will be that much higher.
