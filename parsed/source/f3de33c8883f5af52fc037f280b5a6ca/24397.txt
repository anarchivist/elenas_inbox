DRAFT TREASURY LETTER TO BANKRUPTCY CONFEREES ON BUSINESS BANKRUPTCY
PROVISIONS


Dear


        I am writing to share the AdministrationO,s views on certain
business bankruptcy provisions in S. 1301, the bankruptcy reform bill
before the conference committee, and related provisions in H.R. 4393, the
D&Financial Contract Netting Improvement Act of 1998.08

        The Administration supports the financial contract netting
provisions in S. 1301. These provisions are based on a proposal from the
PresidentO,s Working Group on Financial Markets, which was the result of
an intensive, multi-year interagency effort to improve the regime
governing the recognition of netting of certain financial contracts in
insolvency situations. As I noted when we transmitted our recommendations
to Congress, the proposed legislation would reduce systemic risk in our
financial markets, reducing the risk that a failure of a single firm would
cause significant disruption and danger to our financial markets.  In
particular, this proposal will help to reduce systemic risk arising out of
activities in the derivatives market.

        The Administration also encourages the conferees to include
similar provisions amending the bank insolvency laws, which are contained
in H.R. 4393 as approved by the House Banking Committee. One of the goals
of the working Group effort was to harmonize, where appropriate,
provisions under the Bankruptcy Code and the bank insolvency laws.  The
bank insolvency provisions in H.R. 4393 would accomplish that
harmonization and would also clarify the power of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation to transfer qualified financial contracts to another
financial institution. This clarification will help ensure that the
resolution of a failed depository institution can be accomplished at the
lowest possible cost to the deposit insurance funds administered by the
FDIC.

        We look forward to working with the conferees to enact these
desirable reforms, in conjunction with moderate and balanced consumer
bankruptcy reform legislation.

                                               Sincerely,


                    Robert E. Rubin
