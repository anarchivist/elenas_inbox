TEXT:
SSA would like to give an AP reporter the story that we are including work
incentives for people with disabilities on Wednesday, the day before the
budget is released.  The theory is that, while these are small, they are
important to the disability community and are at least a start toward
"making work pay"for people with disabilities, and they are likely to be
swallowed up if they are announced on Thursday, between the general budget
story and the 2 other stories of interest to the disability community (S
SI children and Medicaid per capita cap) .

Nancy-Ann Min, Chris Jennings, and Bill White of public liaison all
advocate drawing some kind of notice or doing some kind of event with
these proposals, particularly given the disability groups' negative
reaction on Medicaid and SSI.  I think it's a wise idea, as long as there
are no other budget release strategies it would screw up.

What do you think? Obviously we can roll it out of here if we prefer, but
I am assuming you don't think this merits much White House attention.
