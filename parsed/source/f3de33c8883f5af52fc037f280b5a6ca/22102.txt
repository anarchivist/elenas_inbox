TEXT:
Can you tell me where are we regarding the FMLA expansion and abortion in
the SOTU?
An idea I had re: abortion was to talk about how the President pledged to
make it "safe. legal and rare;" our approach of focusing on the prevention
of unintended pregnancies has worked: the rate of abortion has decreased.
so has the rate of teen pregnancy.
Thanks
