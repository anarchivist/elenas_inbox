TEXT:
Nicole is traveling with the First Lady and asked me to pass the following
information on:

This morning there were some stories that reported that Kasich and
Domenici had decided to drop the Dodd Amendment from the Conference Report
for more general language that some consideration needs to be given to the
child care needs of working families.  Jeannie Ireland from Dodd's office
called this morning to say that contrary to these reports, Kasich and
Domenici had not made any such decision and that Dodd may offer a motion
to instruct when the conferees are appointed this afternoon.
