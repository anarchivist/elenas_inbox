TEXT:
SSA feels that we have been a bit slow in giving them comments on
their public· documents related to welfare reform.  This is partly
my fault since I have sent stuff around without a clear deadline.
Since SSA is being pretty cooperative on this stuff, I don't want
to treat them unfairly.   So for future items, I will write on the
document a deadline of a day or two, fax it to you, and then
assume if I haven't heard from you that it's oK.
Let me know if you have any thoughts.   On the plus side, we have
made what I think are helpful comments on some or all of what we
have gotten from them.
