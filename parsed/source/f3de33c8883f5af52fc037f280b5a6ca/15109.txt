TEXT:
There are requests penqing for the President and First Lady to participate
in events in June for the Presidential Math and Science Teacher awards
(one event for elementary awards and one event for secondary awards) .  As
we have discussed previously, these events offer an opportunity to
highlight the President's education initiatives, especially since these
awards go to teachers in all fifty states.

I would like to invite you or the appropriate representative from your
office to a meeting early next week to discuss what to do with these
events. Rebecca Dittmar (6-6020) will be in touch with your office to
coordinate schedules.
