TEXT:
Hilley has asked us to prepare options for conference on FLSA,
displacement, privatization, and other welfare issues.  We need to do some
serious policy work on what we can live with, and we'll have to figure out
the right way to involve DOL, HHS et al.

Let's talk about how we're going to do this.
