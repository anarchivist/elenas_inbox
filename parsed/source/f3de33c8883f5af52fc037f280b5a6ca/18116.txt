ADVISORY BOARD ACTIVITIES

     K-12 School Visits. This week, five Advisory Board Member visited an elementary or
     secondary school in their community that implements programs or policies to encourage
     diversity and that face issues related to a diverse student body. These visits were
     arranged to give Advisory Board members some preparation for the December 17
     Advisory Board meeting at Annandale High School in Fairfax County, Virginia.

     Advisory Board Recommendations. As follow up to the November 19 Advisory
     Board meeting at which members discussed the continuing problem of discrimination,
     Dr. Franklin sent you a letter recommending the enhancement of enforcing civil rights
     laws, collection of additional data on discrimination, and implementation of initiatives to
     address and prevent hate crimes. (A copy of the letter is attached.)

      Council of Negro Women. On December 9, Dr. John Hope Franklin participated in
      a Town Hall meeting sponsored by the Council of Negro Women. Dr. Franklin
    . spoke to an audience of approximately 600 people. He spoke about the importance
      of the organization's efforts to address institutional racism and how the Initiative
      can assist those efforts.

     Congress of National Black Churches. Dr. Franklin, on December 10, was the
     keynote speaker at the Annual Leadership Award Dinner in Shreveport, Louisiana.
      He addressed 500 of the nation's leading clergy and public officials about the role
     of churches in strengthening communities and the need for them to take strong

    leadership roles in improving race relations.

    Minority Business Opportunity Steering Committee. On December 10, Angela Oh
    met with the Los Angeles Minority Business Opportunity Steering Committee. She
    discussed issues of race with them and urged them to consider how they could be
    involved in the Initiative.

    Organization of Chinese Americans. On December 10, Angela Oh spoke to the San
    Francisco chapter of the Organization of Chinese Americans. She reassured the
    audience that the Initiative will be inclusive of aU races and encouraged them to
    become leaders in bridging racial divides.

    Rockefeller Institute of Government. On December 11, Governor William Winter
    spoke at a brown bag forum at the Nelson A. Rockefeller Institute of Government at
    RockefeUer College in Albany, New York. Governor Winter urged the faculty and
    students to promote the goals of the Initiative and to share their research on the
    finances and management of state government and the conditions of urban
    neighborhoods.

OFFICE OF THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR

    Team Harmony. I accompanied the First Lady to the Team Harmony event where
    10,000 young people pledged to try to stop prejudice and to speak out against anyone who
    seeks to mock or hurt someone of a different race, religion, ethnic group or sexual
    orientation. The Team Harmony program is one ofthe original Promising Practices
    identified on our Website. It is also referenced in the First Lady's book, It Takes a
    Village. (Attached is an article from the Washington Post on the event.)

OUTREACH

    Urban League of Greater Chattanooga. On December 10, I participated in several
    events coordinated by the Urban League of Greater Chattanooga: a breakfast meeting
    with business leaders hosted by Chattanooga Mayor Jon Kinsey; a luncheon meeting with
    members of the Chattanooga Race Relations Committee; a "One America Conversations
    that Bring Us Together" meeting at which I facilitated a conversation among 16 people,
    including pastors, students, business people, and educators representing a number of races
    who expressed their experiences with people of other races and ideas for you and the
    Initiative; and, finally, the day culminated with the Equal Opportunity Day Dinner at
    which I gave the keynote address to approximately 1,000 people. I encouraged the
    participants to think of themselves as part of the Initiative, work toward achieving the
    goals of the Initiative, and recognize that America's diversity is its strength.

    At each event, I urged business and community leaders to take active part in the Initiative


                                              2

and find solutions to issues related to race. Chattanooga-leaders were extremely
supportive of the Initiative and offered to host an event in their city.

YWCA. I met with 30 women leaders of national organizations, including the League of
Women Voters, Coalition of Labor Union Women, National Council of Jewish Women,
and National Organization for Women, that are working with the YWCA to encourage
women to be leaders in promoting the goals of the Initiative.

Corporate Leaders. Working with the Office of Public Liaison, we have scheduled the
next two corporate executives forums, entitled One America: The Business Community
Responds. We will hold the next forum on January 13 in Phoenix, prior to the Advisory
Board meeting there on January 14. The January 13 forum will encompass corporations
located in the South West region of the country. For corporations located in the Far
West region, we plan to hold a forum on January 30 in Los Angeles. We also will hold a
forum in New York and one in Chicago or Cincinnati during the late winter.

Religious Leaders. On December 11, we held a conference call with the religious
leaders who met with Reverend Johnson Cook last month in conjunction with your Prayer
Breakfast. We will schedule four or five forums for religious leaders in different regions
of the country. The first one is scheduled to take place on February lOin Northern
California in conjunction with an Advisory Board meeting that will be held in San
Francisco or Oakland.

Leaders in Education. In partnership with the Association of American Colleges and
Universities and the National Urban League, we will hold a national week of
campus/community dialogue in April.

Public Officials. We are working with the Office of Intergovernmental Affairs to
organize "One America Conversations that Bring Us Together" with city and county
officials on the day following our Advisory Board meetings in Phoenix, San
Francisco/Oakland, and Denver.

RESEARCH AND POLICY PLANNING

Data. We are producing a binder of data for the Advisory Board Members to use in
informing the American people about the facts surrounding race. We will include K-12,
higher education and labor data for the Board members as background for the December
17 and January 13 Advisory Board meetings.

Fairfax County Schools. The case study on Bailey's Elementary School in Fairfax
County identifies some of the challenges, successes and lessons learned in a magnet
school that serves an increasingly diverse student body. Linda Chavez-Thompson will
release the study on December 15.

    COMMUNICATION

    Press Coverage. This week there were eleven articles that covered the Initiative in
    major newspapers. (Attached is a column from the Wall Street Journal, "The Race
    Initiative: Tough but Worth the Effort.")

WORK TEAMS

    ADVISORY BOARD

    Advisory Board Meetings. The December 17 Advisory Board meeting will focus on
    issues of race in public primary and secondary education. The participants will include
    William Bennett, Professor James Comer, author Jonathan Kozol, and Principal Deborah
    Meier. We are working with DPC and NEC on potential policy action items such as
    school construction, the Hispanic Education Action Plan and 21 st Century Scholars
    programs.

    The January 14 Advisory Board meeting will focus on employment issues and will be
    held in Phoenix.

    TOWN HALL MEETINGS

    Presidential Town Hall Meeting. The team met to discuss possible dates and formats
    for the next Presidential Town Hall Meeting. We will try to schedule a meeting with you
    next week to propose some dates and a format for your approval.

    Advisory Board Town Hall Meeting. We are working on an Advisory Board Town
    Hall meeting in Atlanta in late January.

    YOUTH

    Call to Action Letter. We have been receiving approximately 100 letters a day in
    response to your "call to action" letter to youth. The response has been overwhelming
    and very positive. The majority of the letters are coming from white youth. Even
    though many of them are in the middle of final exams, they have taken the time to
    respond quickly and enthusiastically to your call to action. Weare in the process of
    setting up a call-to-action column on the website and will post a letter each week. We
    plan to respond to each student by thanking them for their support and offering them
    further guidance on steps to take to further the goals of the Initiative. We also plan to
    inform them about upcoming events in their area.
