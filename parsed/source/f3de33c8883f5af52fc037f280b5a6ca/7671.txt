TEXT:
Kevin reports that Erskine has been in a great mood since the ENACT
meeting and that DPC may want to share this with the President with a
bullet for today's daily report. We just need to e-mail a short paragraph
to Kevin and Jason.  Kevin just called and said that they would like to
show our paragraph to Erskine before he leaves, but he is leaving at 5:00
(20 minutes from now and Elena is still on the Hill).  I told him we would
get it to him as soon as we can, but not likely by 5:00.
