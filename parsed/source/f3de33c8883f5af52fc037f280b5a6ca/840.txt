TEXT:
This morning, HHS will send us a redraft of the Olivia Golden testimony
for tomorrow's House Human Resources Subcommittee hearing on the
President's welfare and adoption proposals.  This redraft should
incorporate most of the edits made in the OMB passback. Note, however,
that HHS has rewritten "Insert A" (the "welfare to work" insert) of the
OMB passback.  I will fax you a copy for comment as soon as I receive the
new draft.
