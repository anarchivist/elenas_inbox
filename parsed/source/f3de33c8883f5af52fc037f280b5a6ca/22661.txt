TEXT:
Waxman will shortly fax new draft to me, which I will circulate to you.
He feels strongly we should file, and that option of not filing is bad for
Govt generally and HHS (he says Donna feels strongly we should file).
Seth wants to be heard before decision is made not to file. He also thinks
complete bare-bones approach won't work, because Opposition will say this
case different from Sullivan, and we'll have to sayin reply what we don't
want to say now in any event.
