Subject:         Murray amendment at markup at L/HHS/ED

You asked for a report on markup.

Today's 90 minute markup session was not for decision making, but rather
for positions to be stated on selected issues. According to our bill
tracker who was present, Senator Murray asked that the conferees not
eliminate her amendment "protecting domestic violence victims from the
welfare work requirements". Rep. Lowey supported her.   There was no
further discussion.

I am a little startled by the notion of "protecting" people from the work
requirement, but if that's the way this issue is being thought of, it is
more understandable why our variation on her theme is portrayed negatively
by some groups. What we wanted to do was ensure that victims get real
help, through temporary services and the work requirements, to get off of
welfare and into jobs and independence. Seems to me a better way of
protecting them in the long run than keeping them on welfare. But what do
1. know.

Conferees still hope to finish work by Thursday.
