TEXT:
Gov. Chiles' office just alerted me that the state will sue us sometime in
the next few weeks over the legal immigrant parts of welfare reform.
There is a group of state legislators that is pushing the state to do
things like enact a state general assistance program for legal
immigrants. The Governor thinks this lawsuit is a better alternative.
His attorney general has just determined that the state has standing to do
this.

We will discuss this more at the meeting that DPC and OMB are holding on
legal immigration strategy next wed with the agencies.
