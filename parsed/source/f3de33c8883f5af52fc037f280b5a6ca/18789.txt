    MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF TRANSPORTATION

    SUBJECT:        Standards to Prevent Drinking and Driving

    We have made progress in improving highway safety during our Administration. Our
    progress has been accomplished through a variety of innovative and aggressive initiatives,
    including our "Buckle Up America" Campaign to vastly increase safety belt usage and
    improve child passenger safety, and the formation of a ground-breaking pUblic-private
    partnership on airbags. We have also taken important steps to reduce the deaths and
    injuries brought about by alcohol use and driving by signing a law to require states to
    adopt "Zero Alcohol Tolerance" laws for young people who operate motor vehicles by
    October 1998. To date, 46 states and the District of Columbia have enacted "zero tolerance"
    laws for youth.

    However, drunk driving remains a serious highway safety problem. Over 40 percent of all
    motor vehicle deaths in 1996 -- 17,126-- were alcohol-related. More than 2,300 of these
    fatalities were youths. Moreover, alcohol-related crashes cost society $45 billion every year, not
    including the pain and suffering endured by its victims.

    We can do more to prevent the many tragic and unnecessary alcohol-related deaths and
    injuries which occur on the Nation's roads. That is why my Administration has called on
    Congress to set .08 blood alcohol content (BAC) as the illegal per se limit nationwide. Research
    shows that, at a BAC level of .08, drivers are impaired with regard to critical driving tasks, such
    as braking, steering, lane changing, and judgment. The risk of being involved in a crash
    increases substantially when drivers are at a BAC level of .08 or above. In fact, the relative risk
    of a driver being killed in a single vehicle crash at .08 BAC has been shown to be 11 times higher
    than it is with drivers who have no alcohol in their system.

    Despite this elevated risk, in 33 states and the District of Columbia, their illegal impaired driving
    limit is still at the higher level of .10 BAC. It is estimated that, if all states were to lower their
    limits to .08 BAC, there could be 600 fewer alcohol-related traffic deaths every year.

    I hope the Congress will enact this legislation as soon as possible to encourage state passage of
    .08 BAC laws. Even before the Congress acts, however, we can take action to promote .08 BAC
    as the appropriate standard across the country, including on federal property.

    I therefore direct you, working with appropriate Federal agencies, Congress, the States,
    safety groups and other concerned Americans, to report back to me in 45 days with a plan
    to promote the adoption of a .08 BAC illegal per se limit. Among other things, the plan
    should consider:
                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion

(1)   setting a.08 BAC standard on federal property, including on national parks and
      Department of Defense installations, and working with local law enforcement in the
      enforcement of this standard;

(2)   encouraging tribal governments to adopt and enforce a .08 BAC standard on
      highways in Indian Country that are subject to their jurisdiction; and

(3)   developing an education campaign to help the public understand the risks
      associated with alcohol consumption and driving.
