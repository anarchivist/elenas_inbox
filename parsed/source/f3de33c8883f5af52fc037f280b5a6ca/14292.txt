Subject: Line Item Veto Act challenge; court hearing this morning

This morning, the D.C. Circuit heard oral argument in the NTEU union's
constitutional challenge to the Line Item Veto Act. The high points are
summarized below. As always, any press inquiries about the hearing and the
litigation generally should be referred to the Justice Department's press
office.

The oral argument did not reach the merits of the union's constitutional
challenge, and did not address any issues of how the Act would actually work
(i.e., no discussion of what is a "line item").  Instead, the oral argument
centered on whether the union has "standing" at this point to challenge the Act
-- i.e., has the union suffered any harm so far from the Act's passage?

The arguments by the union and Justice Department covered familiar ground.
The union argued that passage of the Act required the union to add to its
lobbying staff, for the purpose of lobbying the Executive Branch. The
government argued that the Act is not even in effect yet, that the Act is not
directed at labor-management matters, and that the union's decision to add to
its lobbying staff was a unilateral choice by the union and not the kind of
injury that is needed to establish standing.

The questions by the judges (Sentelle, Henderson, and Rogers) did not indicate
how they might rule -- which is not unusual.    There was some skeptical
questions to the union's lawyer about the union's contention that -- due to
the Line Item Veto Act -- the union has to devote more resources here-and-now
to lobbying the Executive Branch about the development of the President's FY98
Budget than the union devoted in the past to the Executive Branch's development
of prior Budgets. The union's reply was that, due to the Line Item Veto Act,
the union needs the Executive Branch's support more now than in the past, so
that -- the argument seemed to run -- the union needs to lobby the Executive
Branch earlier in the budget process, to ensure that the Executive Branch will
<.


be "on board" to support the union's priorities.  In their questions, one or
two of the judges stated, in effect, that they would have expected that, in the
past, the union's lobbying efforts would typically begin with the Executive
Branch's development of the President's Budget, and that the Line Item Veto Act
won't change the dynamics much at this stage of the budget process.

The judges asked the Justice attorney to offer the governments' views on when,
if not now,
a party would have standing to challenge the Act.  Beyond stating that standing
would likely exist if and when the President in the future actually exercises
his authority to veto a line item, the Justice attorney declined (properly) to
speculate about when standing would exist. One judge raised, hypothetically,
the possibility that standing might exist when the President submits his Budget
to Congress, while another judge pursued a line of inquiry that seemed to lead
to the notion that a person might have standing to sue at the time when an
Appropriations Act has been enacted into law (without a line item having been
vetoed) if the person could show that the Appropriations Act did not include a
line item that the person desired and that the existence of the Line Item Veto
Act somehow caused that desired provision to be absent from the Appropriations
Act.  I don't think too much should be read into these judicial musings.

For whatever it is worth, my guess is that the D.C. Circuit will affirm the
district court's dismissal of the case -- either because the union lacks
standing or because the challenge is not yet "ripe for review" (i.e., the
plaintiff may have standing, but the court should wait to address the challenge
until a more concrete set of facts has developed).  Since the Act goes into
effect in January, and since that would alter somewhat the standing and
ripeness analysis, my guess is that the D.C. Circuit will issue its ruling
before the end of the year, to avoid making the case more complicated. Of
course, I could be wrong, on either or both counts.

Finally, we have heard from the Justice Department that we should expect at
least one new challenge to the Act to be filed in January, when the Act goes
into effect.  It seems to be common knowledge around town that January suits
are being prepared. The plaintiffs in the suit(s) will likely involve at least
some Members of Congress, who will argue that the Act diminishes their
legislative power.
