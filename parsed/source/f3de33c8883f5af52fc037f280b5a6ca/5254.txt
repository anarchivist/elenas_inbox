  PREY STORY

  NEXT STORY
                               he American Cancer Society's board unanimously
 passed a
                               resolution in Los Angeles on Tuesday making
 passage of a
                          tough, comprehensive tobacco control law its No. 1
 priority for
                          1998, society officials said.
                               The organization plans an extensive media,
 lobbying and grass
                          roots effort as part ·of a $l-million campaign,
 according to Jennie R.
                          Cook of Larkspur, the society's new chairwoman.
                               "We have had a terrific funding year, so we
 feel very
                          comfortable in putting the money aside" for the
 campaign, said
                          Cook, who also chairs Gov. Pete Wilson's commission
 on tobacco
                       education research.
                            The cancer society also has hired a
 high-powered Washington
                       law firm, Hogan & Hartson (), to draft legislative
 language
                       relating to the authority of the FDA over tobacco
 products "that can
                       be used by our congressiona'l allies at the
 appropriate time,"
                       according to a copy of the cancer society's action
 plan.
                            Earlier this year, the society utilized the
 services of Hogan &
                       Hartson () partner Stephan E. Lawton to analyze the
 FDA


                         provisions in the deal. Lawton is the former chief
 counsel to a
                         congressional committee that will have a key role in
 enacting any
                         legislation flowing out of the proposed tobacco
 settlement.
                              To further shore up its efforts, the cancer
 society has assembled
                         a team of lobbyists who will assist on a pro bono
 basis, said Linda
                         Crawford, the group's senior vice president for
 federal and state
                         governmental relations.
                              In recent weeks, several bills related to the
 settlement have been
                         introduced in Congress and several more are expected
 later this
                         year or early next year after Congress reconvenes.
                              Society officials said that. their efforts were
 motivated by the
                         belief that good tobacco control legislation offered
 the best
                         possibility of having a major impact on cancer in
 the U.S.
