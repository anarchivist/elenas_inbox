TEXT:
Howard Rolston called to report on how the call with Olivia and Barbara
Chow went.   It sounds like it really would be useful for us to weigh in.
In fact, Bruce or Elena may be getting a call from Olivia or,possibly
Kevin Thurm.   HHS is extremely concerned about further delaying the
release of the RFP while the data collection issue gets resolved.    There
is no substantive reason to delay the RFP further--it simply provides
leverage to resolve the data issue.

On the data collection itself, Howard says OMB (particularly Barry)
continues to be adamant about treating formula and competitive grantees as
a single program with identical data collection.  Everyone agrees that we
are stuck imposing the 17 TANF data collection on the formula grantees,
even though this is not necessarily desirable or necessary.  Howard thinks
states will be surprised and upset (thinking they only had to report on
the 4 WtW items), but we can clearly make the case that we have no choice
given the statute as it is. The question is, do we then also impose this
burden on competitive grantees if we don't absolutely have to? HHS says
no, OMB (and presumably DOL) say yes.  Cynthia and I both think that if,
there's a way to justify treating them differently, it's worth pursuing.

One argument I hadn't thought of til this morning, and apparently HHS
hadn't thought of either relates to penalties. HHS could penalize a state
who fails to comply with the WtW reporting (because it's under the TANF
data reporting section and therefore the TANF penalty would apply).   It
seems unfair to hold the state accountable for reporting on competitive
grantees when it has no legal arrangement with them.  By contrast, formula
grantees (PICs) currently report data to the state for JTPA so this would
not be breaking new ground.
