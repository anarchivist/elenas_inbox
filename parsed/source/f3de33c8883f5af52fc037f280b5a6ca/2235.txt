                         NATIONAL PEACE OFFICERS MEMORIAL EVENT

                                     DATE:          May 15,1997
                                     LOCATION:      West Grounds of the Capitol
                                     BRIEFING TIME: 12:30 am - 12:00 pm
                                     EVENT TIME:    12:00 pm - 12:30 pm
                                     FROM:          Bruce Reed/Rahm Emanuel


        I.    PURPOSE

              To honor the lives of officers who were killed in the line of duty in 1996 and their
              survivors.

        II.   BACKGROUND

              You will be attending for your fourth consecutive year the National Peace Officers
              Memorial Event sponsored by the Fraternal Order of Police (FOP). This year 116
              officers who were killed in the line of duty are being honored at this event, the fewest
              officers killed since 1959. The names of those fallen officers are being enshrined on the
              National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial in Washington, DC and were officially
              dedicated on Monday, May 12 in a candlelight vigil. In 1993 you attended the
              candlelight vigil. The National Law Enforcement officers Memorial was built in 1991
              and bears the names of more than 14,000 federal, state and local law enforcement officers
              who have died in the line of duty.

              In addition to honoring those that lost their lives, you will be making the following
              announcements:

              ·      NEW "BRADY" FORMS-- You will announce that by today (May 15, 1997) the
                     ATF will have sent out revised "Brady" forms (Form 4473) to all Federal
                     Firearms Licensees. In response to the Empire State Building shooting by a
                     foreign visitor, you asked Secretary Rubin to change the federal regulations and
                     existing Brady form to better restrict gun access to foreign visitors and to tighten
                     up residency requirements. The revised Brady form requires a prospective gun
                     purchaser to make an affirmative statement that they reside in the State of the gun
                     dealer, and-- in the case of noncitizens-- show secondary forms of identification to
                     prove State residency, such as a utility bill or lease.



                                                                Automated Records Management Systel"
                                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion

              ·      CHILD SAFETY LOCKS
                     You will announce that consistent with your March 5, 1997 directive, all FBI and
                     ATF agents-- nearly 13,000, or 20% of all federal law enforcement officers-- have
                     now been provided child safety locks to prevent accidental or unauthorized use of
                     their firearms. The remaining federal law enforcement officers will be provided
                     with child safety locks no later than October 15, 1997.
