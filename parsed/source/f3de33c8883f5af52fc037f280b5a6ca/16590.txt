Attached is an edited statement. The gist is the same but I wanted to
make clear that we were not challenging the S. Ct.

       I am writing to commend the City Council of Cincinnati for its continuing efforts on behalf
of campaign finance reform. I support the Council's efforts to place controls on campaign
expenditures because I believe that true reform requires real limits on both campaign fundraising
and spending.

          As you know, I have directed the Justice Department to identify a case through which to
urge the Supreme Court to clarify or reconsider its decision in Buckley v. Valeo which struck down
the campaign expenditure limitations of the Federal Elections Campaign Act.          The Department is
still in the process of reviewing potential test cases, including Kruse, et. al. v. The City of
Cincinnati. Because of the dramatic changes in the financing of political campaigns that could
not have been foreseen when the Court first addressed spending limits, I believe the time has
come for the Court to revisit, and uphold, the constituionality of mandatory spending lim,itations.

       Through the efforts of the City Council of Cincinnati, I believe we have a historic
opportunity to make our campaign finance system work for the American people.

       Again, thank you for your efforts in support of campaign finance reform.

                               Sincerely,




                               William Jefferson Clinton
