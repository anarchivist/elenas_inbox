TEXT:
What' he showed me was a report that Schumer put out on ATF stats showing
how guns bought in states w/ weak gun laws were showing-up in states with
strong gun control.    It is a good report.  Schumer also introduced
legislation creating a separate federal offense for gun trafficking from
state-to-state - - Schumer calls his bill, the "Gun King-pin" bill.

Tom is right, this is a great issue. And we thought the best way to get
some traction on this issue was to have Treasury give the President a
one-year report on our Gun Trafficking Initiative from last summer.   Since
that time, in 17 cities, Treasury has been tracing every gun used in a
crime to pinpoint sources of crime guns and find crime gun trafficking
patterns.  Then, we can also state we are going to expand it to more
cities, push for the Schumer Bill, etc.

At the last couple of crime meetings, Rahm has asked Treasury to get us a
draft.  I think they are supposed to give us a draft this week.
