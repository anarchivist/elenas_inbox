TEXT:
I just heard about a meeting that Jack Lew is chairing tomorrow at 10 a.m.
in room 248 on the Labor-H bill.   Kathy Stack says they will be looking at
"hard choices for education", figuring out where $ would come from in the
bill to fund the President's priorities.    In previous iterations of these
meetings I'm not sure whether DPC was represented, but she said Sperling
has been there, along with Bob Shireman and Andy Blocker.    She thought it
was important for somebody from DPC to go (she cited the example of Obey's
whole school ref rom $, which others may not think is that important).   Do
either of you want to attend this? If not, do you want me to go? If I
end up going, it would be nice to strategize with you a little bit first.

Thanks.
