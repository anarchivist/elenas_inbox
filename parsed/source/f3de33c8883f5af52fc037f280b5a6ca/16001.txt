TEXT:
O.K.  It's all coming back to me now (with the help of a few folks) . This
is the event that we discussed in the last meeting.  Sylvia asked the
working group to send me names if you were going to attend.

So far, Ben is attending the Wed press conference and his assistant is
attending the workshops. Also, Chris Edley is addressing the conference
at lunch on Wednesday.

If you haven't responded, please let me know if you will be attending or
have suggestions/recommendations/opinions on further WH involvement.

 (Sorry for any confusion.)    Thanks.
