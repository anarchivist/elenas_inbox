Elena,

Steve Mertens has sent me another version of OMB's draft statement.   It is
not much different from his last one, but there are some changes.   I am
sending you both that document and my suggested edits (budget. red)
Mertens has told me that Deich wants us to get the statement to INS and
DOJ today if possible. They are looking for a Monday 9am deadline for WH
sign-off. Thanks.

Julie

implements its immigration policy. In particular, it urged a separation of the enforcement and

benefit functions thta INS now performs.



The Administration has studied these and other reform proposals, and has developed a plan to

enhance immigration law enforcement while improving the delivery of immigration services and

benefits. The plan is designed to separate INS' enforcement and service operations, ffiH.-

lreepwhilc keeping the agency intact. The division of functions will improve efficiency and

effectiveness, while strengthening accountability, lines of authority, and leadership. To support

these structural changes, INS will also implement management and administrative

improvements. In addition, the Administration's plan will enhance coordination among Federal

agencies involved in immigration and establish greater accountability within each agency.

Together, these reforms within INS and across the Government will support and sustain the

Administration's progress over the last five years in enforcing our immigration laws and

fulfilling the Nation's commitment to its immigratieHimmigrant heritage.
