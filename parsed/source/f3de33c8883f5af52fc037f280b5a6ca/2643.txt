TEXT:
I guess I picked a' good day to skip out of town.    Hope it wasn't too crazy.

In the wake of today's decision, we'll probably have to come up with more
actions and bigger ideas than ever -- but maybe the frenzy will settle
down before the traveling party comes home. One thing I hope you will do
is put in a call to Bruce L. (I assume he's in Europe) or to Jerry
Mande/David Kessler on the tobacco talks.  The papers make it sound
imminent, and even if it's not, I suppose we need to be in a position to
analyze what they come up with quickly enough to advise the President
before others do.  Maybe a mtg early next week with Thurm et al? I defer
to your experience in Bruce management (both kinds) .
