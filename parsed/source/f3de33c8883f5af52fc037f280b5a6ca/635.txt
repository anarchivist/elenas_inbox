TEXT:

Got your message.  My understanding is that NSC is not submitting
any responses of their own, so it looks like the refugee responses
need to be incorporated into our submission.   (A number of-these
responses go to refugee resettlement and migration issues that
certainly fall within the joint jurisdiction of DPC and NSC.)
This, of course, is a plot by NSC to force you to do more work.
