TEXT:
There is a bit of a tug of war going on regarding who will lead the
process for the next few months on coming up with the detail on American
Heritage Rivers.

If you get a call, I would suggest that you postpone the decision until
Monday.   I know that Katie would like to speak to you about it before you
weigh in.

I will get you a note a bit later on the pros and cons of the choice.
