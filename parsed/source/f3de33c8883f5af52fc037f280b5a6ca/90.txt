 TEXT:
 PRINTER FONT 12 POINT COURIER
 3/28/96
 From: Chuck Konigsberg


 Following is a REVUSED draft" response to Sen. Byrd for a 3/21
 item veto letter to POTUS. Byrd's letter to POTUS states that he
 is "unalterably opposed to giving any President" enhanced
 rescission authority;   he also states that the delegation would
 do "great harm to the constitutional balance." Much of the
 letter pertains to Byrd's concern that the 1997 effective date is
 "blatantly partisan".    The revision, in bold, is a point
 suggested by DOJ.   (I've also updated the letter to reflect
 Senate and likely House action.)   Let me know by COB Thursday if
 you have any revisions to the attached draft.    Otherwise, I will
 pass along to WH/LA at end of the day.   Thanks.

 DRAFT-
 o
 -NOT FOR RELEASE
 Dear Senator Byrd:
         I appreciated receiving your letter of March 21, 1996
 expressing concerns about the conference agreement on the
 line
 o
 -item veto.
         I am mindful of your strong, and deeply held convictions on
 this issue. However, as you know, the line
 o
 -item veto is
 something I have consistently supported over the years.  I had
 the authority as a Governor and found it to be a useful tool for
 controlling the budget.  I am pleased that the House and Senate
 have approved the conference report on S. 4 which delegates
 authority to cancel certain discretionary and direct spending, as
 well as limited tax benefits.  [fyi-
 o
 -the House will be voting
 early Thursday afternoon)
          I must respectfully disagree with your concerns about the
 effect of this legislation on the constitutional balance of
 powers. While the conference agreement delegates to the
 President a useful measure of cancellation authority, that
 delegation has been carefully limited by the very specific
 definitions of spending and tax benefits, as well as expedited
 procedures for consideration of disapproval legislation.
 Moreover, the carefully defined cancellation authority is a
 practical and principled means of serving the constitutional
 balance of powers, by redressing the modern practice of
 presenting the President with omnibus legislation.
         Regarding the effective date of the new authority, I would,
 of course, have preferred that the new authority be effective
 upon enactment. Nevertheless, I am pleased that the House and
 Senate have overcome their differences and produced a conference

 agreement which delegates effective cancellation authority.
         Thank you again for expressing your concerns to me about
 this important legislation.
                                                 Sincerely,
                                                 BC
