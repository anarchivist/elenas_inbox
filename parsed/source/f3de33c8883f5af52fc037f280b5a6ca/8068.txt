                                 Question and Answer
                                      June 9,1998

Q:   Mr. President, this weekend the NRA elected Charlton Heston as its new president,
     and he made some very critical remarks about you and 'your Administration. What
     is your reaction to his criticisms?

     There are some good men and women in the NRA: people who enjoy hunting and sport
     shooting; gun dealers who play by the rules and are trying to make a living; and gun
     owners and collectors of all sorts who are law abiding citizens.

     But since I came to office, the NRA's leadership has fought ever sensible thing we have
     done to fight crime. They opposed the Brady Bill and ban on assault weapons that were
     supported by every major law enforcement organization in the country. They opposed
     our efforts to put 100,000 more police on America's streets. They oppose our efforts to
     pass juvenile crime legislation and ban cop-killer bullets. And they have consistently
     attacked and criticized the work of our federal law enforcement officers.

     So frankly, I am not sure the NRA's leadership represents America's vital center
     anymore. And I am not sure we will come to terms anytime soon.


Q.   Mr. President, this weekend the National Rifle Association said that instead of
     passing new gun laws, the Administration and Congress should focus on enforcing
     those laws already on the books. Furthermore, they challenged the federal
     government to focus its efforts on a single city -- with tough enforcement of the laws
     -- to see what a difference that can make. What is your reaction this challenge?

A:   Frankly, focusing on one city for a single year is not a realistic option. This
     Administration has worked hand-in-hand with local law enforcement in thousands of
     cities for almost six years now -- and our efforts are making a difference. Murders are
     down more than 25%, violent crime is down more than 15%, and overall crime is at its
     lowest level in a generation. If Mr. Heston and the NRA want to help, I suggest they
     support tougher punishments, more police and better prevention in all of our
     communities.

     But I will agree that tough enforcement and more prosecutions are part of the answer. So
     I Hope the NRA will consider supporting our proposals to hire more prosecutors and law
     enforcement officers at all levels of government -- especially local prosecutors and police
     officers. The NRA likes to say it is for more law enforcement and tough punishments,
     but they led the fight against the 1994· Crime Act that has provided billions of dollars for
     law enforcement and included some of the toughest penalties ever.
