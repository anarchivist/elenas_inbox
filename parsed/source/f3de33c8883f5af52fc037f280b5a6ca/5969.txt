TEXT:
I think this is an easy call, but let me know asap if the following raises
any red flags.

Harris sent a Dec. 31 memo to the President in which he says the
Corporation will relaunch the President's Youth Service Awards. These
awards are essentially a certificate similar to the President's Physical
Fitness Award, and would go to any youngster who could demonstrate that
they completed 100 hours or more of service in a year (part of the
summit's goal 5).  There is no cost. The program has bipartisan support.
But it was suspended in March 1994 after a negative IG report on how it
was being administered.     "

Apparently Gomperts told Me1anne about the idea, and my second-hand
information is that she liked it very much and the First Lady is seriously
considering mentioning it in this week's column, which has a deadline of
Thursday.  So if there are any problems, we should surface them now.

(The other obvious question is whether we should hold this for him to
announce at the service event on MLK Day, but this doesn't seem so
appealing, and it's not clear we want an announcement.)
