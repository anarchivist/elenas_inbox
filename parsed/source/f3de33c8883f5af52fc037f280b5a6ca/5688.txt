TEXT:
On Technology: The NEChad been carrying $150 m as late as last Saturday,
a figure related to our mark of $500 m for the Technology LIteracy
Challenge, the largest of the many current technology programs.   The $142
m is a new calculation based on the TLC being smaller, at $475 m, but we
have no decision to reduce TLC that way.   Once we work out with Education
and the NEC what the TLC and other technology programs numbers are, and
what the actual. program content of the'Teachers in technology thing may
be, this one will settle down. For now, use: "About $150 million".
 [there are other items in the memo with ranges or estimates for the
numbers, so this won't stick out.]

On Pell grants: We understand from an e-mail from Bob Shireman (NEC) that
he wants to change policies, and this is what changes the amount available
from the Pell re-estimate from $220 m to $184 m.  We need to discuss the
reasons for his desired policy change, and we will, but they ought not be
assumed in the memo to the President at this time. I suggest language
like:

"Re-estimates to the cost of Pell grants may make as much as $220 million
available for other purposes within our current totals, while still
providing for the $100 increase in the Pell maximum award. The additional
funds could be used to modify other Pell grant policies, to augment the
After School initiative, to increase Head Start, or for other education
and training programs. We are working on options."
