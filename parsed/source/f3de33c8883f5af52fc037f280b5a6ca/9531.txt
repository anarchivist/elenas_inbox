TEXT:
Tom Mahr called to check on the WH view on enacting language to enable
states to keep the federal MCD share from state tobacco suits.   As you may
know, there are rumors about members adding such language to the omnibus
budget bill.   Conrad has several concerns:   1) what would be the offset;
2) any provision should be limited to the 4 states that have settled -- to
hold down the cost, and to keep this issue ·alive as an engine for tobacco
legislation next year; 3)  a majority of what would have been the federal
share should go for state tobacco control.   Conrad is considering speaking
out on this subject and is considering generating a Congressional letter.
He would like to know the WH position before he makes his next move.   How
should we respond? Thanks.
