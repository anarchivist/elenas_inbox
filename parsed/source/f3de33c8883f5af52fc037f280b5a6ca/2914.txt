TEXT:
I think we should force closure with Katzen tomorrow on what signals WH
should send on Senator Dodd's pediatric labeling incentive (patent
extension) proposal.  Last night HHS sent a 2 1/2 pager over for clearance
that gently pointed out the drawbacks of Dodd's approach, and stated our
intention to do regulation (you have HHS's version of this document; this
is the piece FDA wants to get to Ped AIDS Foundation and Amer. Academey of
Pediatrics as backgrounder and proof we're planning to do reg).    Katzen
modified p. 2 to state that "other approaches are needed to supplement any
financial incentive," implicitly embracing Dodd's piece.

I see no reason to send any signal now that we want to do the incentive as
well as regulation.   It's a poorly-targeted windfall for companies at the
expense of consumers and gov't health care payors and will do little to
promote pediatric studies. Sally should reject it on efficiency grounds
alone, given her idealogical bent, so I assume she wants to embrace it as
a gesture to Dodd. Not sure that has any benefit at this point (Dodd
reportedly said today he is supporting Jeffords bill), and HHS doesn't se
em to think it's necesarry given the cleared draft they sent over.

Bottom line,   we shouldn't casually send a signal that we want to do both
an incentive   and reg approach.   I suggest we (you?) talk to her, ask her
why she made   the change, push her on substance, and ask her to withdraw
her edits of   HHS's backgrounder.

Schultz thinks we need to get the 2 /12-pager out tomorrow.  Is there any
way you can take up this narrow issue with Sally and get closure
tomorrow? If you'd like me to talk to her directly with your backing I'd
be happy to.  FYI Toby shares my concern and will talk to Gips about it.
