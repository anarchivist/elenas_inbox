Hi Elena,
Following is this draft for your approval/edits.          Thanks!

                                *****
Thank you for writing to me about the Teamwork for Employees and
Managers Act.
My Administration supports workplace flexibility and high-
performance workplace practices that promote cooperative labor-
management relations.  I firmly believe that in order for America
to remain globally competitive into the next century, employers
and employees must work in partnership with each other to
encourage innovation, improve productivity, and enhance
efficiency and performance in the workplace.
I cannot approve legislation that, instead of promoting genuine
teamwork, undermines the system of collective bargaining that has
served this country so well for many decades. By allowing
employers to establish company unions where no union currently
exists and permitting company-dominated unions where employees
are in the process of determining whether to be represented by a
union, this bill would abolish protections that ensure
independent and democratic representation in the workplace.
As we continue our efforts to encourage true workplace
cooperation, I look forward to your continued involvement.
