Refonn (CIR) called for major changes in how the Federal Government sets and implements

immigration policy. In particular, it urged a separation ofthe enforcement and benefit functions

thta INS now perfonns.



The Administration has studied these and other refonn proposals, and has developed a plan to

enhance immigration law enforcement while improving the delivery of immigration services and

benefits. The plan is designed to separate INS' enforcement and service operations, both in

headquarters and the field, but keep the agency intact. The division of functions will improve

efficiency and effectiveness, while strengthening accountability, lines of authority, and

leadership. To support these structural changes, INS will also implement management and

administrative improvements. In addition, the Administration's plan will enhance coordination

among Federal agencies involved in immigration and establish greater accountability within each

agency. Together, these refonns within INS and across the Government will support and sustain

the Administration's progress over the last five years in enforcing our immigration laws and

fulfilling the Nation's commitment to its immigration heritage.
