VICE PRESIDENT AL GORE AND LABOR SECRETARY ALEXIS M. HERMAN
ANNOUNCE PENNSYLVANIA TO RECEIVE $44.2 MILLION WELFARE-TO-WORK
GRANT

        Vice President Al Gore and Secretary of Labor Alexis M. Herman today announced that
Pennsylvania will receive a $44.2 million welfare-to-work grant to help the hardest-to-employ
welfare recipients acquire the skills, work experience and resources they need to find and keep
good jobs. The Pennsylvania grant is part of $2.2 billion being awarded to states over a two-year
period to fund local programs to help long-term welfare recipients enter the world of work.

        "We've seen a 27 percent decline in welfare rolls since the enactment ofthe 1996 welfare
reform law," Vice President Gore said. "But our work is far from done. We cannot rest as
long as there are people struggling to participate in the growth and prosperity of the nation. That
is why this grant is so important to help long-term welfare recipients move from dependency to
economic self-sufficiency."

        "It takes a lot of responsibility and determination to get a job," Secretary Herman said.
"But we also want to make sure that when long-term welfare recipients get jobs, they can keep
them. These grants will help Pennsylvania's newest workers to get the support services that
will move them into good paying jobs. For workers just starting out, the services can mean the
difference between success and failure."

       Eighty-five percent ofthe Pennsylvania grant will go directly to local programs that
provide a wide range of support services including: assessments, job readiness, skills training,
work activities, job development and placement, job retention, post employment services, and
support services, such as parenting and family responsibility classes and family financial
  planning.

        Under the 1997 Budget Reconciliation Act, $2.2 billion is being allocated by formula
over two years to states based on their population of poor people and the number of adult
recipients of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. Another $711.5 million is being
awarded directly by the secretary of labor on a competitive basis to local communities for
projects that are innovative in their approach to helping adults move from welfare to work.

       Most states and the Territory of Guam havea now received formula grants. Pennsylvania

     joins Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware,
     Florida, Georgia, Guam, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine,

     Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina,
     Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia and Wisconsin.
