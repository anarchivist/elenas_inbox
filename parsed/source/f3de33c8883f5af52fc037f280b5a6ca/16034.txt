  TEXT:
  At yesterday's race working group meeting, we agreed that the advisory
  board members need to be better informed of what we are doing at the White
  House that relates to their initiative.

  I am willing to prepare a memo or have a conversation with them to bring
  them up to speed, but I need your thoughts on what information to share
  with them.

  I strongly believe that we need to communication with them as soon as
  possible.  Please forward your ideas and any paper to me by close of
  business today.  I will start contacting them tomorrow morning.

  Rob/Dawn:   Please advise whether this is best done by phone or by paper.

 Bob: If your office prepares a memo on the meeting specifics (who to call
 to make travel arrangements, where exactly the meeting will be held,
 whether they should make their own dinner and breakfast plans, etc.), I
 can forward this at the same time.   Yesterday'S calls confirming a 7/14
 meeting universally generated requests for specifics by the end of the
 week.

 Thanks for everyone's help.   bb
