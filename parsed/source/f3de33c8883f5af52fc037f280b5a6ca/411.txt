TEXT:
I am sending you a preliminary outline of the White House Welfare Reform Web
Page.   Please review the documents listed and let me know if there are any
documents you know of that should be added. And, any hints on tracking down the
document would be greatly appreciated.
The documents listed in bold are already on-line. The documents in plain type
are not on-line and mayor may not be approved for clearance by the appropriate
agency.
This outline will be updated and distributed at Tuesday's meeting.
I can be reached at 6-5228. Thanks!
