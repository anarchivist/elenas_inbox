Subject: Best and final offer on cancer.

"Today, we can cure 80% of the cases of some cancers.  If Congress
provides us with the historic 65% increase in cancer funding that I have
proposed, will you join me in committing to the American people that
within one generation we will be able to cure 80% of all cancers."
