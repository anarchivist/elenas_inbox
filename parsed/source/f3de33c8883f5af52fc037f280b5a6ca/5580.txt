  Here's a quick update on some of our issues, sorry it runs a little long.
  I think we will have some good things happen.

   DOJ debt collection bill: we got an informal estimate of saving $270
  million from DOJ, David Huan at OMB is looking to see if they can confirm
  that kind of saving. He says obviously now would be good time to move it
  if we can. There will be legal/political vetting issues even if we get a
  good est~mate for the bill-- the law moves the presumptions on debt
  collection in the government's favor.

  Pagers for battered woman: DOJ says the cell phone industry is agreeable,
  they've offered phones for each shelter (1,400) so women could leave the
  facility and still have access to the police. We need ot look for other
  places that make sense to have phones. DOJ is meeting with courts people
  to see about making phones available to women getting restraining
  orders.   We're hoping to have this for the SOTU.

  Religious Freedom in the Workplace-- we've had several meetings with DOJ,
  DOL, SBA, EEOC, Commerce, OPL, and counsel (Bill Marshall). The group
  felt the original bill was teribly drafted and unworkable. A working
  group led by DOJ has finished their version of the bill.   That bill is
  now waiting for sign off by David Ogden etc. We'll then need to do more
  vetting. Each agency has already been talking to the groups to see where
  they stood on the Coats/Kerry bill, but we will need to do this in a
  thorough way and we'll get back to you with a plan this week when we hope
  to get the draft bill.

  Lifetime supervision for child sex offenders:  In June, DOJ said they
  would have a study done in six months.   Rahm likes this issue and he
  brought the issue up today at the crime meeting, DOJ is looking for
  hooks. Nick Guess said the idea would be to condition prison funds,      I
  think this will be hard to find a manageable option but we will find
  something more narrow than a wholesale plan.

  Single Food Agency-- We've talked to OMB and I'm sending Elena their
  memo. The proposal will experience bureaucratic attacks-- the agencies
  haven't been told about the project according to Wendy Taylor at OMB. It
  seems like a good substantive idea, it will be a politically good one only
  if we don't cut the budget. Wendy says OMB doesn't think this involves a
  savings, in fact there are slightly higher admin. costs.

  Accomplishments list-- Rahm came to the COS breakfast meeting Tuesday and


 explained how the President wanted this list. Mary is coordinating the
 answers which we should be getting this week with the goal of having
 something before X-mas.

 Rural disaster recovery-- Mary has talked to Carl   w.   and is sending you a
 memo on what's going on.

 Skinhead violence in Denver: Ogden at DOJ has had a meeting looking for
 what to do. He agrees that it fits nicely with many of the President's
 inititiatives, He says the local folks are wary of looking like the
 federal government is trying to step into a local prosecution. But says
 he is following up and promsies to get back to us.

 Sexual orientation exec order: Dawn Chirwa is looking at this in relation
 to the military (DOD had no problems) otherwise it is ready to go.

 Regards, Tom

    I talked to Carl Whillock. Here are his answers:

    1. Crop revenue coverage: Currently, crop revenue coverage is only
    available for very limited types of crops such corn, wheat, etc. USDA is
    currently discussing internally expanding this to all types of
    revenue-producing crops, including cattle, tomatoes, etc. The discussions
    at USDA have focused on this expansion being implemented primarily through
    private insurance coverage. One scenario would have the farmer
    responsible for the first 10% of loss, the private insurance company
    covering the next 65%, and perhaps the Federal government subsidizing the
    last 25% of the farmer's loss.

    Carl believes that this crop insurance would not be very expensive to the
    individual farmer as long as the risk pool was very large and spread over
    different types of farmers.  Carl thought that this type of private
    insurance arrangement with partial government subsidies might even.be less
    expensive than the current price support and loan programs, because of the
    private insurers' substantial participation. Carl also didn't think that
    this type of scenario would require legislation, but might require an ap
    propriation for the subsidy portion.

    Even though USDA is doing research on this, they do not have a deadline or
    even a time frame to try to implement this. This seems like a good idea
    to pursue. Should we follow up with ~his by setting up some meetings with
    USDA and OMB, etc?

    2. Export Enhancement: Carl agrees with Bruce that this program is being
    used as extensively as possible already.   Under this program, the
    Secretary of Agriculture has substantial discretion to subsidize the
    advertising and sales of exports of U.S. food.   This subsidy primarily
    goes to food processing companies, and critics argue that we are simply
    supporting companies such as Tysons, etc. However, these programs
    indirectly benefit farmers because their products are exported in greater
    quantities. Also, U.S. food is able to be exported at a lower cost
    because U.S. food processing companies spend less on advertising and
    marketing because of the federal subsidy.   Further, the Secretary can
    direct the subsidies toward whatever crop needs the assistance in a
    particular year.  For instance, this year greater portions of federal
    funds have been directed toward ,the dairy industry.

    We can look into expanding the program if 'you want,


     Regards, Mary

     I talked with Kent Conrad this weekend. He pointed out that farmers in his
     state are suffering from serious crop losses due to disease.     (Nothing
     brand new or exotic but much more widespread --perhaps up to 30% some
     crops.) When ND had $1 B + in flood damages, FEMA came and and were
     "terrific" but when people suffer equally devastating ($1B) crop damages,
     there is no similar response available. I asked about crop insurance.
     There is "crop revenue coverage" but he felt it could/should be
     strengthened / expanded .Since the "Freedom to Farm" bill does open
     farmers more to market forces, is there an argument for increasing or
     expanding insurance?
         His second recommendation is for "ag'g'ressive export enhancement" --my
     own sense is that we are pretty aggressive at this and it would be hard to
     demonstrate more but what do I know ...
