From:      EWLLDEF@AOL.COM

(Evan Wolfson, Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund)

Hi, all --

I wanted to thank many of you for your help in getting a huge surge of
prominent individuals to endorse the Marriage Resolution in the past few
months. And I hope to jog you into one more push to get more signatures
(and discussion) in the next ten days or so, before the holidays shut
everything down for the rest of the year.

A select list of Marriage Resolution signatories so far is attached.       Hard
copies are available for circulation to others, as many as you can!

The National Freedom to Marry Coalition has designated this coming
February 12 National Freedom to Marry Day, tapping into Valentine's Day
and Lincoln's Birthday to send a message to the non-gay public about our
fight for love and equality, the freedom to marry.

The plan is to use the weeks between now and then to collect as many
signatories, engender as much public discussion, and shape public opinion
as much as possible, building to that day (and D-Day, when we get the
decision from the Hawaii Supreme Court). We hope to see activity on
National Freedom to Marry Day in many communities across the country ...
and the outreach and organizing work building to that day in all fifty
states.

Hope we can count on your help each week between now and then.       If you are
not sure just how to help, give me a buzz!

Thanks!
