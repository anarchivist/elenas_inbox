CDC Director Jeffrey Koplan would like to interview tomorrow with CNN
about the importance of smoking and health worldwide, and CDC efforts to
help other nations with tobacco education and prevention programs. This
would be part of a story CNN is preparing on research results on smoking
in CHina. The study will be released on Thursday in London.   It predicts.
8,000 smoking-related deaths per day in China by the year 2050, if
smoking rates continue increasing at the current rates.
