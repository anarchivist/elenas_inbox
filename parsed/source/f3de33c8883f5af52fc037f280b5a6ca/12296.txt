Q:   What is your response to the Medicare prescription drug benefit initiative (the
     Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage Act of 1999) being unveiled today by
     Senator Kennedy (RockefeUerlDingeIIlStarklWaxman)?


A:   We welcome any proposal that thoughtfully addresses one of Medicare's major
     shortcomings -- the lack of lifesaving prescription drug coverage_ The Medicare
     Prescription Drug Act includes several important elements designed to address short and
     long-term cost burdens faced by elderly, disabled and low income beneficiaries_ We are
     reviewing it to determine coverage adequacy, administrative feasibility, and affordability
     -- both to beneficiaries and to the Medicare program.

     Senators Kennedy and Rockefeller and Congressmen Dingell, Stark and Waxman deserve
     praise for their constructive contribution to this debate. Their leadership in improving
     and strengthening Medicare has been longstanding and consistent. The President looks
     forward to working with them and others as we develop an affordable prescription drug
     benefit that will be included and financed in the context the broader reform package he
     intends to release in the near future.

     BACKGROUND: The President has long advocated for adding a meaningful
     prescription drug benefit to the Medicare program. He discussed it in the 1992
     Campaign, included in the Health Security Act, and referenced it in his State of the Union
     Address -- in the context of broader Medicare reform. Not only are prescription drugs an
     essential part of modem medicine, but providing coverage through Medicare is more
     efficient and equitable than today's inadequate, unstable, expensive patchwork payment
     system. Over 15 million Medicare beneficiaries have no coverage whatsoever and those
     with coverage are experiencing declines in benefits and increases in costs.


Q:   When will the President introduce his plan and will his drug benefit resemble that
     being unveiled by Senator Kennedy today?

     The President is reviewing options on every element of Medicare reform. He has made
     no decisions at this time, but plans to release his proposal in time for the Congress to
     consider it this year. (If pushed, you can say weeks not months -- with an emphasis on
     the plural). The Medicare Prescription Drug Act includes several important elements
     designed to address short and long-term cost burdens faced by elderly, disabled and low
     income beneficiaries. We are reviewing it to determine coverage adequacy,
     administrative feasibility, and affordability -- both to beneficiaries and to the Medicare
     program.
