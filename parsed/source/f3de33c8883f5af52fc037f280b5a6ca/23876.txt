TEXT:
He challenged them to reevaluate their rating system "to determine whether
it is allowing too much gratuitous violence in movies approved for viewing
by children."   I think it is a separate issue whether the ratings they
give supply any content - and thereby some notice -- which could tell
parents that a movie has bad language, sexual content or violence, . and for
violence, the kind of violence -- gore vs. sci-fi violence (which is
available on the Internet) .  However, I do see the point that it might be
weird to revisit this issue.
