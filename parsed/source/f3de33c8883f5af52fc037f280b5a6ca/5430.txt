TEXT:
I'm not sure how this misunderstanding happened, but here's the correction
to the housing vouchers cost. Sorry to have misled you. The description
we sent into the President on State of the Union ideas did not include a
dollar amount, so we did not mislead him.

Subject:         One correction to Housing Vouchers piece

 OMB has clarified that $300 million is for one year, not five.  Five year
 cost is $1.3 billion.  I'll double check to make sure Paul corrects this
. in the memo.
