TEXT:
FYI, I sat in on HHS's meeting with state groups, chaired by Howard
Rolston, to unveil the high performance bonus guidance.  It went pretty
well.  Howard stuck pretty closely to what we would have wanted him to
say. The states had no strong reaction, but definitely seemed to view it
as being credible and reasonable.  Howard made it clear that we've made up
our minds on the specific measures and the distribution of the pot, so we
don't want them to re-litigate that.

One problem was that we asked them to give us their comments quickly (next
Tuesday) and they balked at that. They complained that we've taken months
on this, that comments on the big TANF reg are due next Wednesday, and
that NGA has its big meeting coming up.  They said maybe they'd have a
read by Thursday. We pushed them, but it wasn't too easy since we have no
firm deadline (and I couldn't say we want it in our hip pocket for a
possible presidential announcement) .
