                                   ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IDEAS

Unbanked

1. Make Electronic Funds Transfer Regulation into a major announcement on the unbanked. The
proposed regulation was issued in September. In January the 90-day comment period is over. By
March the proposal will be finalized. Under the new regulation, up t010 million may be brought into the
banking system.

2. Public education campaign on financial literacy and services. Treasury received $2 million in 1997 for
the campaign. The Department is planning to start the campaign in late fall or early winter. The
campaigns goal is to improve people's (particularly the unbanked) understanding of financial products and
services. Treasury will circulate pamphlets through banks and credit unions, labor unions, through federal
agencies such as Veterans and Social Security, the American Bankers Association, consumer groups,
etc. Treasury will also do Public Service Announcements.

Empowerment Zones

The Domestic Policy Council (DPC) recommends a "fast track" announcement of the Second Round
Empowerment Zone (EZ) designees. We believe that the financial benefits available to the Second
Round EZs do not warrant a long, extended application process. With only tax incentives and small
sums of targeted, categorical grant funding available, we believe it would be a mistake to ask applicants to
put together an extensive, comprehensive strategic plan. Instead, the DPC recommends a streamlined
application process which would allow the designations to be awarded no later than the end of March.
We propose that applicants respond to two questions: 1) how they will encourage the private and
non-profit sectors to utilize the various tax incentives to promote economic opportunity, job creation, and
sustainable development (brownfields); 2) how do they plan to utilize the categorical grants (in
accordance with the program regulations) and how will the applicants work with community groups and
the private sector to leverage these dollars?

Because of the lack of a large pool of flexible funds, we understand certain individuals are proposing that
we not refer to the designees as EZs. We want to make clear our opposition to such a position. While
the second round incentives are not as generous as the first round (and we need to make that clear up
front in the application), in no way should we place the President or the Vice President in a position where
they are not able to claim they victory in fulfilling their promise of a second round. The second round EZs
are just that, EZs. To not claim victory makes no political sense.

PROPOSED TIMELlNE:

December 20 - Applications are sent out to prospective applicants.

February 20 - Applications are due to HUD and USDA.

March 15 - HUD and USDA advise the CEB and Vice President of their proposed designees.

March 30 - The designees are announced.


ADVANTAGES

*     Insures earliest possible use of tax incentives which are already available to designated
communities.
                                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion
*        Allows communities to put into effect their plans at a much earlier date.   Thus, we will have
positive results to hopefully talk about prior to the 2000 general election.

*        Allows the Administration to move through the difficult process of choosing twenty winners out of
very large pool of applicants at a much quicker pace.

.*      Eliminates uneccessary paperwork .

*       Reduces uneccessary waiting period for making awards.

*       Insures the announcing of the designees before the 1998 election while not violating the
"gentleman's agreement" between the Congress and the Administration on the timing of the
announcement.

DISADVANTAGES

*       May negatively impact on rural applicants, who require more time to complete applications.

*       EZ interest groups have asked for longer application periods, not shorter ones.

*         Extensive outreach to community groups will be limited. However, since there are not the same
kind of flexible funds available, there is no longer reason for extensive discussions with those groups.
However, we recommend leaving the option open of working an additional plans with the designees and
community groups should the Congress provide HUD and USDA with flexible funds in later years.

Two New Rounds Of CDFI Awards

The House-Senate Appropriations Conference Report includes $80 million, a 62.5 % increase from last
year. This will allow Treasury to make two more rounds of awards over the next fiscal year. In addition,
Treasury is going to launch this year a Secondary Market Initiative, to encourage the securitization of
community development loans, thus making them cheaper and more availalbe. Treasury has the funds to
do this in FY98 ($4 million). Finally, the CDFllegislation is up for reauthorization in 1998. This is going to
be a major fight for the Administration and should be designated as one of the President's chief urban
economic development goals for the next year.

Housing Portability

1) Expand the Regional Opportunity Counselling Program (ROC). Include an additional $20 million in
FY99 budget to increase number of ROC sites. This agencies help Section 8 families identify housing
opportunities outside of adjacent high poverty, segregated areas.

2) Encourage the use of exception rents as a tool for opening up suburban housing markets.

3) Eliminate obstacles to portability of Section 8 vouchers.

4) Reduce mortgage denial rates for minorites by working with mortgage and real estate industry.

5) Expand number of Homeownership Zones from six to 20 sites. HUD will provide $10 million in FY97
and has requested an additional $50 million in FY98 and FY99. This program enable cities to undertake
large, single family developments in inner city neighborhoods. These developments can reatin and attract
stable, middle-income families into the inner cities.                   Hex-Dump Conversion

6) Implement Homeownership Empowerment Vouchers. These would allow Section 8 certificate holders
to apply their certificates to mortgage payments.


Fair Lending/Fair Housing Initiative

Purpose: To ensure equitable access to credit markets. This initiative could include 1) an examination of
the impact of credit scoring loan systems and risk based pricing on lower-income and minority individuals;
2) a presidential initiative urging the banking regulators to obtain more data on reasons for home mortgage
denials; 3) a presidential request to Government Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs) to retain loan denial data
for further analysis of lending pattems; 4) increased funding for DOJ/HUD testing of how applicants are
treated; 5) Public education around the 30 year anniversary of the Fair Housing Act.


OMB Budget Process

The DPC and the NEC are holding a series of meetings with OMS to review and set priorities for HUD's
Transportation's, and Treasury's FY99 urban/economic development budget. The first meeting was last
week. A meeting with key people at the three agencies will be held this week. Additional meetings with
OMS will follow.
                        Proposed Race Imtlatlves: Crime Hex-Dump Conversion

Community Policing

      One of the cornerstones of the 1994 Crime Bill -- and the President's
signature anti-crime program -- is the COPS initiative. The two main goals of the
COPS initiative are to reduce and prevent crime by (1) dramatically increasing
police presence (100,000 more police on the street), and (2) expanding the
community policing philosophy to law enforcement agencies throughout the
country. While the Administration has already done much to highlight the hiring
of more "cops on the beat," the Race Initiative provides us with an opportunity
to emphasize community policing.

       Community policing is best defined by its two main components -
community engagement and problem solving. While many police
departments engage in community relations, they do not necessarily work with
members of the community - particularly minority communities -- to better
understand and address their specific crime problems. Community policing is
also more than a series of programs (block watches). It is a philosophy that
requires law enforcement agencies to transform how they deliver police service,
manage police resources, interact with the community and work with other
components of the criminal justice system. We believe that targeting resources
from the President's COPS initiative to high-crime minority neighborhoods will
have the dual impact of prevent and reducing crime while also promoting
improve police interaction with minorities residents.

      We would propose the following four-part initiative:

      1.    Launch a targeted initiative to improve policing in historically under
            protected neighborhoods. Funds from the COPS program have
            been used to target gang/youth violence, drugs and other specific
            crime concerns. We could work with the COPS office and Justice
            to develop criteria that target high-crime, minority neighborhoods
            that often receive less police service (i.e., public housing
            communities) than other neighborhoods. Funds could be used to
            help hire new officers for to patrol these areas and, to a lesser
            degree, support community organizations to work hand-in-hand
            with police.

      2.    Promote diversity training throughout the country. As part of the
            COPS initiative, Justice has funded 35 Regional Community Policing
            Institutes throughout the country to provide training in specialty
            areas such as, problem-solving, community partnerships,
            community policing in rural and suburban areas, and police
                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion
             integrity and ethics.   Diversity training could be an added area of
             emphasis.

      3.     Establish Citizen Academies.     To help community residents
             understand police procedures, such as the use of deadly force and
             arrest policies, some departments sponsor Citizen Academies -- or
             police academy training sessions for citizens. While no COPS funds
             currently have been used for this purpose, these academies are
             specifically authorized in the Crime Bill.

      4.     Promote minority recruitment and hiring. The authorizing statute for
             the COPS initiative generally requires applicants to make best efforts
             to promote the hiring of minorities. .Justice has not generally
             enforced this provision, and we could ask them to try and make this
             requirement more meaningful.        However, this would not without
             controversy. Tougher minority hiring requirements were defeated
             during the crime bill's consideration, and would be opposed by
             Members and applicants alike. Alternatively, we could seek to
             fund a little noticed grant program in the crime bill that aims to
             promote minority recruitment in law enforcement ..

         All of these initiatives are authorized in the 1994 crime bill and could be
funded within the $1.4 billion COPS appropriation for FY 1998. We would need
about 4 to 6 weeks to work with Justice on developing program criteria. And
we would need to make sure that the amount of non-hiring funds proposed for
this initiative would not compromise the President's commitment to hire 100,000
more police by FY 2000.

Law Enforcement in Indian Country

       Contrary to nationwide trends, violent crime is rising on American Indian
reservations. The homicide rate for Indians has increased by 80% in Indian
Country since 1992, and is the highest of any ethnic group. Moreover, law
enforcement resources in Indian Country are inadequate and have been
dwindling -- there are only half as many officers per capita in Indian Country as
in the rest of the United States.

        To address this problem, on August 25th, the President directed the
Attorney General and Secretary of the Interior to make recommendations to him
by December 31st on how to improve law enforcement in Indian Country. To
link these recommendations with the Race Initiative -- as well as to be
considered as part of the FY 1999 budget process -- we have asked Justice and
Interior to submit their recommendations to DPC and OMB by October 31 st.
Expected outcomes from this policy review include the transfer of law
                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion

enforcement authority from Interior's Bureau of Indian Affairs to the Justice
Department, as well as increased law enforcement resources specifically
designated for Indian Country.

At-Risk youth Prevention

       Few crime initiatives are as important to the Black and Hispanic Caucuses
than preventative efforts targeted at minority youth. That is why these members
fought to include billions of dollar for prevention in the 1994 crime bill and to try
and defeat the House Republicans juvenile crime bill. Unfortunately, despite
our efforts and the efforts of the caucus, few of the crime bill's prevention
programs have received any funding -- and few Republicans support including
prevention programs in the pending juvenile crime legislation.

        Despite the limited support in Congress for prevention, a $75 million
initiative for at-risk youth - proposed by the President as part of his juvenile crime
strategy -- stands a good chance of being funded. To date, Senate
appropriators have included this initiative in their versions of the
Commerce-Justice-State (CJS) appropriations. If passed, this initiative would
give us the rare opportunity (and flexibility) to target truly at-risk and minority
youth. We would, however, have to persuade Justice to abandon its current
plan to distribute these funds to states on a formula basis.

        If this initiative drops out of the final CJS appropriations bill, we will have to
look for other, more limited or longer term opportunities to discuss prevention
initiative as part of the Race Initiative. The Department of Educations's 21 st
Century Learning Centers would probably be the next best thing to consider.
