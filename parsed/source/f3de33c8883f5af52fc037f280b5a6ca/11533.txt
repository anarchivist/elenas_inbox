Here's the scoop: There's a great graph in today's Unity event speech
that summarizes the situation. As part of the ed-flex debate, the Senate
is set to vote next week on a Murray-Kennedy amendment to authorize the
next 6 years of our class size proposal, to finish the job of reaching
100,000. We want to force Republicans, who supported the downpayment on
100,000 teachers that we got in last fall's budget agreement, to vote to
finish the job.  The news of the radio address is two things:  1) repeat
the challenge the President made today, that this class size vote is the
first big test of whether we can put progress ahead of partisanship and
get things done for the American people; and 2) announce that the Dept of
Educ is issuing guidelines for states and communities on how to use the $
from last year's bipartisan agreement to reduce class size in the early
grades. The guidelines are a chance for us to make the argument that
communities are making decisions right now about whether to hire new
teachers for next year.  We shouldn't leave them in doubt about whether
Congress will keep its commitments -- let's make sure that they won't have
to increase class size next year because Washington didn't do its part.

Tanya Martin (6-5228) can fill you in on the details of the guidelines.
She or Jon Schnur can get you a copy of a letter the President sent the
Congressional leadership this past weekend on class size that makes all
these arguments quite well.

The tone should be bipartisan. We want to make the point that we reached
across party lines last fall to get this started -- and if we're serious
about putting progress over party, we need to reach across those lines
again to finish the job.
