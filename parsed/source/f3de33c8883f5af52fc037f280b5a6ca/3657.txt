TEXT:
Mary Bourdette faxed Elena paper on draft domestic violence.
She says their GC says we cannot give this actual paper to anyone.
To give anyone paper, we should summarize the idea on a separate
piece of paper.

Since the Secretary has not yet signed the proposed reg we can describe
it to people verbally.  Once the Secretary signs it and it is sent to OMB,
there is
supposed to have no further discussions about it.

For more clarification, call Anna Durand 690-6318.
