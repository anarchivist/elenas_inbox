TEXT:
The abortion clinic safety proposal for the FY 2000 budget had two main
provisions -- funding for security assessment and funding for direct
provision of security measures to clinics;  funding for both has been
estimated at $4 million.

The Justice Department has asked that we pull the abortion clinic safety
proposal from the budget process because 1) they feel that they can and
will do security assessments under current FY 99 funding and 2) because
funding for direct provision of security measures will require
authorization.  They believe that they will be able to provide direct
grants (and a possible grant announcement) for security assessments some
time in the near future, but have not provided us with a date.  While to
some degree we are persuaded by this new analysis, we wanted to seek your
guidance before we agreed to remove this from our set of priorities.
