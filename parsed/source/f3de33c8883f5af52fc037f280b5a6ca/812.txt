MEMORANDUM FOR THE HEADS OF EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES

SUBJECT:               Federal Policies Targeted to Children in Their Earliest Years



Over the past few years, scientific research has demonstrated that the earliest years of life --
before children reach school-age -- are critical to cognitive and emotional development. We
know that emotional nourishment, good nutrition, proper health care, intellectual stimulation and
parental and community support during the first years of life form the foundation for a child's
ability to learn, thrive in school, work productively and contribute fully to society.

Across the federal government, we are making great strides to enhance development during the
earliest years of life, before a child reaches school, by investing in research, educating parents
and caregivers, and supporting programs that provide early intervention to disadvantaged
families. I am committed to accelerating our efforts to target the earliest years oflife. We all
have a stake in ensuring that every child is given the opportunity to fulfill his or her God-given
potential.

Today, I am directing the heads of executive departments and agencies to report to me in thirty
days with:

1.      a comprehensive list and assessment of existing projects and programs that target the
earliest years of life -- including any qualitative or quanitative evidence of success, as well as
current funding level and number of clients served -- and a description of proposed
improvements, if any are needed, to such projects and programs;

2.       a comprehensive list and assessment of planned projects and programs that target the
earliest years of life, including projected funding levels and number of clients to be served; and

3.      specific proposals of additional projects and programs that could be undertaken to target
the earliest years of life.
