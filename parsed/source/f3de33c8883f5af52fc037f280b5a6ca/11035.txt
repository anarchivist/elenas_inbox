SUBJECT:                   Proposal to Expand Flexibility and Reward Perfonnance


        Now that we have clearly staked out a position to strengthen accountability in ESEA, I
think we also must advance a related proposal to expand flexibility as well. Toward this end,
I've sketched out a proposal that would provide new and significant flexibility in the use of
federal funds to high poverty school districts, in exchange for increased perfonnance. The core
of the proposal is a perfonnance partnership between the federal government and somewhere in
the neighborhood of 100 high poverty urban and rural school districts. In this partnership,
school districts that first demonstrate significant and sustained improvements in student
achievement would be able to combine funds from a number of federal education programs and
use them to support a local improvement strategy. The perfonnance partnership would be a
three-year agreement between the district and the Education Department, though the districts
would continue to enjoy this high level of flexibility as long as they continue to make satisfactory
gains in student achievement. More specifically, here is how I envision this program working:

Eligible School Districts. The perfonnance partnership program would be open to high poverty
urban and rural school districts nationwide. I would use the same definition of "high poverty" as
we used in the Education Opportunity Zones legislation -- more than 20%, or 10,000, students in
poverty. This is not very highly targeted, but it includes a broad enough cross section of school
districts to have some Congressional appeal. In order to be eligible, school districts must have a
track record of improving student achievement, on a districtwide basis, for at least two years.
This is a more stringent requirement than we had proposed in the Zones proposal; in our bill we
would have accepted gains in a few targeted schools as evidence that the district was capable of
intentional improvements.

        Interested school districts would compete on the basis of their track record in improving
student achievement--the ones showing the greatest gains would be the most competitive. They
would also compete on the basis of how ambitious they are--those committed to making the
greatest gains in the future should get a leg up in the competition.

        We would want the districts to describe their education improvement strategy, in order to
help pick the most promising approaches, or perhaps to help us ensure that we pick a set of


                                                 1
                                                                    IIex-Dump Conversion


partnerships school districts with a range of different approaches, so that we can learn more from
this effort. However, I think we want to keep the primary focus on results rather than plans, and
we would not necessarily get too deeply involved in reviewing and approving these plans.

Measuring Performance and Success. The key performance indicators for each district would
be student performance on measures of achievement, using state and/or local testing programs.
We would require tests in reading and math, and a few other core indicators such as the high
school graduation rate. Districts would be free to add additional measures that reflect local
priorities. As part of the final selection process, the Secretary would negotiate with each district
the performance gains that would be required over a three year period, in order to continue in the
partnership. In order to make adequate progress, the district would have to demonstrate
increases in achievement overall as well as reductions in the gaps between racial, ethnic and
income groups, or between the highest and lowest achievers. And we must insist on
disaggregated data, at the district and student level, in order for us to provide the kind of
flexibility I am envisioning here. This is consistent with the approach we have discussed in the
design of a reward-for-performance program for states and local districts.

        Districts would be required to comply with our package of accountability measures --
school report cards, ending social promotion, intervening in failing schools and phasing out the
use of unqualified teachers. We would also continue to monitor other performance indicators
for each district, related to the underlying purposes of specific funding programs.

Rewarding Performance. We would reward improved performance in three ways. First,
entering the performance partnership and gaining added flexibility is largely a reward for prior
success. Second, continued flexibility is dependent upon continuing success. District's would
be given added flexibility for three years, and would lose it ifit failed to make adequate progress
during that period. And if a district's performance actually dropped during that period, the
Secretary could discontinue the partnership sooner if circumstances warranted.

         Third, we ought to provide discretionary money as an additional reward for performance.
We can link this to the basic plan we already have already developed for rewarding performance,
so that after 2-3 years of additional flexibility, those school districts with the greatest gains would
be eligible for bonus funds. Under our current proposal for rewarding performance, we would
have $200 million per year, starting in 2003, for rewards to urban districts and states. The
districts would get half of the funds. We could use this pot of funds as the pool for rewarding
partnership districts making outstanding gains.

        Altematively--and preferably, in my view--ifwe can figure out a way to make the
necessary budget accommodations, we could provide some additional funds immediately--once
the districts enters the partnership. In this option, the performance partnership would involve a
three year grant of funds as well as a three year "grant" of flexibility. Districts that fail to make
adequate progress would lose funds and flexibility after three years. Those that succeed could
continue to receive both. This approach would be more compelling to local school districts, but


                                                  2
                                                                       !lex-Dump Conversion


wouldn't be cheap. I have not costed this out in any detail yet, but it is worth noting that our
Zones proposal started at $200 million for the first year, and would initially fund some 15-20
school districts. Our bonus fund would make $100 million available to about 50 districts.

Expanded Flexibility: Combining Funds from Different Programs. Districts participating in
this partnership would be permitted to combine funds from different programs into a
"responsible block grant." That is, they could take funds they receive under any ESEA
program,-- including Title 1, Safe and Drug Free Schools, Class Size Reduction, the new
Reading Excellence Act, the Obey-Porter Comprehensive School Reform program, Eisenhower
(or whatever teacher quality grant program we develop), Technology Literacy Challenge, 21 5t
Century Community Learning Centers, and Bilingual Education,-- and use them to support the
local improvement strategy that they described in their initial application and that is responsible
for the success they have already achieved. Districts would not be required to track dollars to
specific programs. We might want to give them additional flexibility with regard to the
allocation of funds to specific schools, though there are also down sides to this.

        In effect, the deal we strike with the district recognizes that if they have already shown
they can make significant achievement gains, we are going to let them use our funds to support
their own approach and priorities, even if they are different from ours. In their initial
application, the district would tell us what approach works for them, and how they would use
federal funds to help them carry it out more effectively. They would still have to address the
purposes of the underlying program, but with greater ability to make tradeoffs among them than
at present, in order to boost student achievement. Thus, if the district's plan called for a greater
emphasis on after-school programs and less on computers, this would effectively allow them to
spend more federal funds on after-school programs and less on computers. Or if the district
believed it was more important to reduce class size in grades four, eight and ten in order to
support an end to social promotion the right way, they could do that--as long as it yields the
student achievement results they have agreed to.

        Since we would normally require states to monitor indicators reflecting underlying
program purposes (e.g., ratio of multimedia computers to kids, class size in grades 1-3) we would
need to figure out some way to take local priorities into account in this process with respect to
the level of progress we would expect to see on some indicators.

Concluding Thoughts

       I see a number of advantages to this approach. It balances our strong accountability
message, and underscores that we are for accountability and flexibility, sensibly linked. The
focus on high poverty local districts helps underscore our commitment to closing performance
gaps. The overall focus on local school districts helps in a number of additional ways. It blunts
the Republican argument that they are for local control and we aren't. By creating a large-scale
demonstration program, it gives us a way to more effectively respond to the push for block grants
and preserve the basic structure offederal education programs. Yet it will help us with mayors


                                                 3
                                                                         Hex-Dump Conversion


such as Daley and Menino, who like our agenda but really do want block grants. It should also
help keep the local school boards and administrators closer to us, when they are otherwise
tempted by block grant proposals.

        This proposal may cause concern in the education community or among our allies in
Congress, who may feel this goes too far down the road to block grants. While I don't share that
assessinent, there are ways this proposal could be modified to address those concerns, while
retaining the overall approach. For example, existing programs could be combined into
categories (e.g., kid and equity oriented programs such as Title 1 and Bilingual Education in one
category, capacity-building programs such as professional development and technology in
another, with district's able to combine funds within but not across categories).

         Finally, this emphasis on local school districts leaves out the states, for now. The states
will be less important in the reauthorization battles than the local districts will, in light ofthe
Republican interest in bypass states and getting money right to the classroom. Further, we could
still address the states in a number of ways. Since they are almost certain to get the Ed-Flex bill
the governors are working so hard for, we could argue that their flexibility needs are already
addressed. We could still work on a state-level approach to rewarding performance with bonus
funds, as we have previously discussed. Or, if necessary we could develop a companion
state-level performance partnership proposal, though if we went in this direction we would want
to be sure that we don't let states undermine our own efforts to allocate funds to high poverty
communities.
