    TEXT:
    At the request of the Department of Justice, we have scheduled a
    meeting tomorrow, Thursday, October 19th at 5:00 p.m. to discuss
    an issue arising under the logging provisions of the rescissions
    act. NOTE: THE MEETING WILL BE HELD AT THE MAIN DEPARTMENT OF
    JUSTICE BUILDING, ROOM 2143.
    The issue is one referenced briefly at yesterday's EOP/agency
    timber meeting, namely, the federal government's response to the
    Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund's motion to clarify and enforce
    judgment with respect to section 318 sales that had been
    previously enjoined. Our response is due in court on Friday.
    Justice needs to know the government's position.  In releasing 318
    sales, the government determined that we could not release sales
    that had been previously enjoined.  Now we need to decide whether
    to support or oppose releasing those sales.
    If you require additional information on the meeting or the issue
    to be discussed, please contact Peter Coppelman at 514-2701.
    Thank you for your cooperation.
