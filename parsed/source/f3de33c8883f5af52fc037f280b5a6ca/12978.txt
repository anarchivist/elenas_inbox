(Senate Floor)




S. 1186 -- ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT
APPROPRIATIONS BILL, FY 2000
(Sponsors:  Stevens (R), Alaska; Domenici (R), New Mexico)


        This Statement of Administration Policy provides the
Administration's views on S. 1186, the Energy and Water Development
Appropriations Bill, FY 2000, as reported by the Senate Appropriations
Committee.   Your consideration of the Administration's views would be
appreciated.

        The allocation of discretionary resources available to the Senate
under the Congressional Budget Resolution is simply inadequate to make the
necessary investments that our citizens need and expect.  The President~,s
FY 2000 Budget proposes levels of discretionary spending that meet such
needs while conforming to the Bipartisan Budget Agreement by making
savings proposals in mandatory and other programs available to help
finance this spending.  Congress has approved and the President has signed
into law nearly $29 billion of such offsets in appropriations legislation
since 1995. The Administration urges the Congress to consider such


proposals.

        The Administration appreciates efforts by the Senate
Appropriations Committee to accommodate certain of the President's
priorities within the 302(b) allocation. However, the Senate bill is
nearly $200 million below the program level requested by the President and
includes significant reductions in a number of high priority programs.
These concerns are discussed below.

Department of Energy

        The Administration is concerned with the large shift in the
Committee bill from key domestic priorities of the Department of Energy
(DOE) to fund Atomic Energy Defense Activities. The bill provides $267
million less than the President's request for DOE's domestic programs and
adds $261 million to the President's request for defense activities ($619
million more than the FY 1999 enacted level, excluding a one-time
emergency supplemental appropriation). The bill would significantly
reduce vital programs in energy research and other activities to fund
unrequested enhancements to nuclear weapons and other defense activities
and are also not related to counterintelligence and security concerns.




Specific cuts include:

DO      ab      Solar and Renewable Energy. The Administration
strongly opposes the $98 million reduction from the President's request
for research and development (R&D) in solar and renewable resources
technologies (including the use of $6 million of carryover balances, thus
reducing the total appropriation). The Committee mark would severely
cripple both Administration efforts to accelerate the introduction of
critical renewable energy technologies as well as important R&D efforts to
make these clean energy sources more affordable.

DO      abEnvironmental Management. The Administration opposes the $40
million reduction to the Uranium Enrichment Decontamination and
Decommissioning Fund. At the Committee-recommended funding levels, the
Department would be unable to meet requirements for activities at Oak
Ridge, as well as ongoing cleanup activities at Portsmouth, Ohio, and
Paducah, Kentucky, uranium enrichment facilities.

DO      abScience. The Administration opposes the $27 million reduction
to the request for construction of the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS).
We continue to believe that the FY 2000 request represents the optimum
funding level. As the funding level decreases, the risk of project cost
increases and delays rises.  Construction of the SNS must be completed in
a timely manner to enable our best scientists to explore critical problems
in fundamental science and applications for our materials and
biotechnology industries.

Further, the Administration opposes the lack of funding in the bill for
the Information Technology Initiative for the 21st Century and for the
Next Generation Internet Initiative. Both of these initiatives would
propel revolutionary breakthroughs in information technology and
scientific computing in the United States.

In addition, the Administration regrets that the Committee has not


restored the funding required to complete the final phase of activities at
the Bates Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

00      abDepartmental Administration. The Administration opposes the
reductions in Departmental Administration programs.  The redu~tions would
impair implementation of Secretarial management initiatives now underway
to restructure field management, reorganize security functions, enforce
reductions in contractor travel and other overhead costs, and improve
construction management.




00      abYucca Mountain. The Administration opposes the reduction of
$54 million from the request for the civilian radioactive waste program.
This reduction would threaten planned scientific, engineering, and design
work essential to finalizing the Yucca Mountain repository design.  This
work is necessary to guide DOE's FY 2001 site suitability determination
for Yucca Mountain.  Reductions in funding for this work would jeopardize
DOE's ability to meet its FY 2002 license application milestone if the
site is found to be suitable. The proposed reduction would also reduce
the Departmento,s ability to provide a remedy for its 1998 waste acceptance
obligations, which are currently in litigation.

Power Marketing Administration

        The Administration is disappointed that the Committee has not
accepted the Administration's proposal to revise the financing of the
Power Marketing Administration's Purchase Power and Wheeling programs.
The Administration would like to continue to work with the Senate to
restructure the funding mechanism for these programs.

Stockpile Stewardship

        The Administration believes it is premature for the bill to
include provisions for a realignment of the facilities and missions of the
Departmento,s National Laboratories and facilities in support of the
Stockpile Stewardship program. The Department has begun initial studies
of possible realignments and will work with Congress as soon as the
Administration has completed its analysis. No major action can be taken
to implement such a plan until appropriate studies are completed,
including revisions to the Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement on
Stockpile Stewardship and Management.

Army Corps of Engineers

        The Administration strongly objects to a provision in the
Regulatory Program appropriation that would short-circuit the review
process for wetlands jurisdictional determinations by making the review of
these initial decisions appealable to the Federal courts prior to a final
permit decision. Although the Administration supports the creation of an
administrative review process for these determinations, the bill would
generate unnecessary and premature litigation, set back efforts to ensure
a fair and amicable resolution of potential disputes, and undermine the
ability of citizens and communities to participate on an equal footing in
the permit process.
.   ,




                The Administration is concerned that the $145 million reduction to
        the President's request (not including rescissions) for the Army Corps of
        Engineers would result in significant delays for certain critical
        construction projects. Of particular concern are reductions from the
        request to the Columbia River Fish Mitigation project, from $100 million
        to $70 million; the Everglades (FL) project, from $110 million to $92
        million; and, the Kill Van Kull and Newark Bay Channel (NY, NJ) project,
        from $60 million to $40 million.  In addition, the Administration opposes
        the bill's prohibitions against studying drawdown of John Day and McNary
        dams.  These prohibitions could hamper the objective analysis necessary to
        formulate Columbia and Snake River salmon recovery plans.

                We also urge Congress to enact the AdministrationD,s Harbor
        Services Fund proposal, which would provide a stable source of funding for
        port and harbor activities and free up funds for priority projects and
        programs.  If the Administration's Harbor Services Fund proposal is not
        adopted, then we urge Congress to fund port and harbor operation and
        maintenance activities from the existing Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund
        with the user revenues collected specifically for that purpose, rather
        than from the general fund as proposed by the Committee.

        Bureau of Reclamation

                The Committee proposal to reduce the Bureau of Reclamation budget
        by $95 million, or 11 percent, would significantly affect the BureauD,s
        ability to continue to operate its water supply projects throughout the
        West while complying with relevant Federal laws. The Administration urges
        the Senate to restore these funds.

                In particular, we urge the Senate to fully fund the $95 million
        request for the CALFED Bay-Delta program.   The Committee's $45 million
        reduction and accompanying funding restrictions would delay Federal and
        State efforts to restore this important ecosystem.

            In addition, we urge the Senate to enact the Administration's
    proposal to convert the Central Valley Project Restoration Fund from a
    current discretionary to a permanent account. This will allow the Bureau
    of Reclamation to operate the program efficiently and ensure that all the
    authorized collections from project beneficiaries are used to mitigate
    project impacts, as intended by the Central Valley Project Improvement
    Act.
