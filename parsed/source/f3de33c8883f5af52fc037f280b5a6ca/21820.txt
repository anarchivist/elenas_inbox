TEXT:
Here are the issues DOJ raised regarding tobacco and the Internet:

The 1970 law banning cigarette ads on t.v. and radio was upheld before the
commercial speech doctrine was developed.  They believe if the court were
to consider the ban today, that it would be struck down.
Thus, they fear that we would risk losing the t.v. and radio ban if we
applied it to the internet and were challenged in court.
If the FDA authority to regulate tobacco advertising is upheld by the
courts or by Congress, the FDA could develop a properly tailored rule
banning ads on the Internet that appeal to kids.

FYI: the 1970    law bans cigarette ads on "any medium of electronic
communication    subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Communications
Commission. II   Thus, DOJ says, the FCC would need to make the formal
determination    of jurisdiction before DOJ could act.

I was asked if we knew why the Internet ban was not included in the state
settlement (it was as          you recall in the June 20th agreement) .
