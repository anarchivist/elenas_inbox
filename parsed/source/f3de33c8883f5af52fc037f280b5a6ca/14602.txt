TEXT:
please call into the 1pm Conference CalIon the adoption legislative
language by dialing 456-6766, code 8726.  This call should be very brief,
as Matthew McKearn advises that the issue of the structure of the bonus
payments may be resolved between OMB/HHS on a staff level. The only
outstanding issues are the use of the bonus money and an issue raised by
the Department of the Interior appealing that the bonus be available for
tribes.

Jill, Matthew advises that Ken does not need to be on the call unless the
issue he is working on does not get resolved.  Thanks.
