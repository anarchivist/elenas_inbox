               TEXT:
               Senator Robb is taking flack about tobacco and his guy called to say Robb
               was sticking
                with us but there might be problems down the road.  I've excerpted the
               Richmond paper
                description of Robb's defense of the Adminstration which they wanted us
               to note.
                 As you know, Robb has a campaign coming up
               and the union workers in particular will be crucial for him.
                                 U.S. now to go after tobacco
                                 companies / Amount may
                                 exceed states' settlement

                                   Wednesday, January 20, 1999

                               Ya da yada ...
                                  U.S. Sen. John Warner, R-Va., also said he was taken
               aback by Clinton's
                                  announcement.

                                 "There is only so much burden that this industry can
               absorb and the people
                                 who raise tobacco, the workers, the farmers," he said.

                                  Sen. Charles S. Robb was less quick to criticize the
               federal government's
                                  intention to sue tobacco companies. "This might be a
               vehicle to provide some
                                  certainty for not only the tobacco farmers but for the
               companies and everyone
                                  else involved," said Robb, D-Va. He thought Clinton's
               announcement might
                                  lead to valuable negotiations.

                                 Rep. Virgil H. Goode Jr., a Democrat whose 5th District
               is home for hundreds
                                 of tobacco farmers, called Clinton's announcement of a


lawsuit against
                  tobacco companies "just piling on after the states have
already worked out a
                  settlement with them."

                  Tobacco accounts for 27,400 manufacturing, agriculture
and retailing jobs in
                  Virginia and is the state's biggest crop in terms of
revenue.
