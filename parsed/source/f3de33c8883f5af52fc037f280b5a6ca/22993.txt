ICongressman alleges administration set to violate immigration law

    WASHINGTON (AP)   A Texas congressman accused the Clinton
administration of planning to grant amnesty to thousands of illegal
immigrants without congressional approval.
    "Stop before you break the law,"    Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas,
said Tuesday. "Do not throw out 30 years of legal precedent for
political gain.' ,
    Smith expressed objections to a plan that would grant illegal
immigrants from Central America eligibility for amnesty under a
blanket "presumption of hardship,"    instead of requiring each
immigrant to prove hardship.
    In 1997, Congress passed a law granting amnesty to some
Nicaraguans and Cubans who had been in the United States since Dec.
1, 1995, and allowing them to apply for status as legal permanent
residents.
    under the law, Guatemalans and Salvadorans who had been in the


country for seven year would be considered for a suspension of
deportation under less-stringent rules that existed before 1996
immigration legislation. It was to be on a case-by-case basis
requiring them to prove "extreme hardship"    if they were returned
to their home countries.
    Smith said the proposal for a blanket presumption of hardship
goes against the intent of the 1997 law.
     "We knew full well how to give amnesty,"   Smith said. "We gave
it to certain Nicaraguans and Cubans who were our allies in the
Cold War against communism. If we wanted to give it to other
groups, we would have."
    The Immigration and Naturalization Service has not yet made a
final decision on presumption of hardship, agency spokeswoman Maria
Cardona said.
    Immigrant advocacy groups have lobbied in support of a rule
presuming hardship, and a Clinton administration official said
members of Congress also have submitted written comments that
mostly favor the idea.
    But Smith said a blanket presumption would give as many as
240,OOO-plus illegal aliens a benefit that Congress declined to
give them in 1997. He and 28 other House members signed a letter to
President Clinton asking him to reject the idea.
     "The white House is shamelessly bowing to special interests and
thumbing its nose at Congress, the American people and every legal
alien who played by the rules and waited his or her turn to come to
America, " Smith said.
     "Obviously, when someone received an unexpected benefit,
amnesty in this case, they feel indebted to those who provided the
benefit. The White House is looking at long-term political
support. ' ,
