TEXT:
         I have just met with my foreign policy team.   But before I speak
about the situation in Kosovo, I want to say a few words about school
violence. As you know, in a few moments I am leaving for Littleton,
Colorado to meet with the students and families of Columbine High School.
The news this morning of a school shooting, this one in Rockdale County,
in suburban Atlanta, is deeply troubling to me and to all Americans.     We
thank God that the injuries to the four students do not appear to be
life-threatening.    This incident should underscore how important it is
that all Americans come together in the face of these events to protect
our young .people from violence.
