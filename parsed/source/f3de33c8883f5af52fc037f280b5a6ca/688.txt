Subject: Local Flex

Elaine is out but I talked with Leanne Brackett, her most knowledgeable
staffer on local flex issues, who agreed with me and will advise Elaine
that the most the Vice President should say on Monday, if he has to say
anything, is that the Federal government wants to continue to improve its
partnership with state and local government.  We are interested in working
with the Governers to see how we can build greater flexibility into our
relationships so as to be able to tailor our programs to local situations a
nd needs.

I'm going to send this same message bye-mail to Elaine.   Leanne agrees
that any more detail will simply bring all of the interest groups back
down upon the VP's head in a reprise of last year's fun.
