                            DATE:       Thursday, May 2, 1996
                            LOCATION:   Oval Office
                            TIME:       2:10pm to 2:25pm
                            FROM:       John Hilley
                                        Peter Jacoby

 I.      PURPOSE
         This veto ceremony will provide an opportunity for you to
         reiterate your opposition to H.R. 956, the Common Sense
         Product Liability Legal Reform Act of 1995.
 II.     BACKGROUND
         On March 13, 1996, a House-Senate conference committee
         completed its work on H.R. 956, the "Common Sense Product
         Liability Legal Reform Act of 1996." On March 21 the Senate
         passed the conference committee bill by a vote of 59-40. On
         March 29th the House approved the conference report by a
         vote of 259-158. On April 30th, Majority Leader Dole and
         Speaker Gingrich convened a press conference to finalize
         Congressional action on the bill and send it to the
         President's desk.
         The conference report limits punitive damages in product
         liability cases to two times compensatory damages or
         $250,000, whichever is greater, with lower limits for small
         businesses. The measure also allows a plaintiff to bring a
         lawsuit up to two years after discovering both the cause and
         the injury itself. The bill limits the time to file a suit


      to 15 years after the delivery of a product. but the limit
      would only apply to certain products.  Finally, the
      conference report would also abolish joint and several
      liability for non-economic damages.
      You have supported products liability reform at the federal
      level but only if that reform: 1) respects the important
      role of the states in our federal system and; 2) fairly
      balances the interests of consumers with those of
      manufacturers and sellers. You have promised to veto H.R.
      956 because it fails to adequately meet these two tests.

      As a general matter, tort law, including product liability
      law, is the responsibility and prerogative of the States,
      rather than of Congress. This is an area in which States
      have served as laboratories, testing and developing new
      ideas and making needed reforms.   Proponents of new and
      sweeping Federal restrictions on State authority should bear
      the burden of persuasion. The Conference Report fails to
      show why the Federal Government should wrest this
      responsibility from the States.   Certainly, this bill's
      findings -- which fail to recognize, for example, that the
      current increase in litigation is attributable to commercial
      suits between corporations rather than consumer-initiated
      product liability actions against the manufacturers and
      sellers -- do not justify such broad scale Federal
      intrusion.
      Moreover, the Conference Report unfairly tilts the legal
      playing field to the disadvantage of consumers. Many
      provisions of H.R. 956, such as those dealing with punitive
      damages and the statute of repose, displace State law only
      when that law is more favorable to the consumer; when State
      law is more favorable to manufacturers and sellers, it
      remains in operation. This "one-way pre-emption" approach
      unfairly disadvantages consumers.
      Additionally, several specific provisions of H.R. 956 would
      impede the ability of injured persons to gain fair and
      adequate recovery:
           An artificial ceiling on the amount of punitive damages
           that may be awarded in a product liability action.
           Statutory caps ignore the fundamental purpose of
           punitive awards: to punish and deter.
           The abolition of joint-and-several liability for
           noneconomic damages, most notably, pain and suffering.
           This provision would severely and unfairly discriminate
           against those innocent victims whose injuries involve
           mostly noneconomic damages, rather than the sort of
           damages that can be measured by lost income.
      Finally, H.R. 956 is the product of a bruising legislative
      battle which has seen the intensity of political rhetoric
      rise to new levels on both sides of the issue. Generally,
      with certain notable exceptions, Democrats on both sides of
      the Capitol have worked hard to defeat this legislation in
      the face of powerful business interests.
