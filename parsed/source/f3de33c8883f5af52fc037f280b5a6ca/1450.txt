See the attached from Bill White.   I have referred him to someone at DOJ
who I think knows this history.   It's from before my time. But some have
charged we never really became fully accessible.

Do either of you know what specifications the White House had to meet in
order to conform with the ADA? Scripps-Howard is looking at doing a story
on how handicapped equipped the white House is, whether we meet the
standards set by law and how the President gets around with his injury.
Let me know if you have any info or if there is someone else with whom I
should talk.   Thanks. AM
