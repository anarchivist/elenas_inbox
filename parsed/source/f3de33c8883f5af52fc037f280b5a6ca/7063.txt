TEXT:
I suggest the take up the following at 5:15 today:


1. Coverdell vote week of 4/20.
Key issue here is to make sure we are all aware of the amendments that
will come up, and clear on a strategy for dealing with them.  Probably the
most important issue from your point of view--there are a few issues, such
as IDEA discipline and single-sex schools, that we will be more favorably
disposed to than ED.  However, the Coverdell strategy POTUS signed on to
in February was to not help anyone put amendments we liked on to
Coverdell, since we were going to veto anyway.

2. Higher Education Act
From our point of view, we want to remind everyone that we are planning a
veto announcement over the National Board for Professional Teaching
Standards. We've got this scheduled for April 24; the vote might occur
before then and in any event we will need to send up a SAP before then.
How do we want to handle timing, and do we want to push for a floor vote
to remove the provision.

Other important issues in this bill:  (1) There is an effort at a
bipartisan compromise to strengthen the teacher preparation provisions
when the bill comes to the floor; (2) there is still a big fight over
student interest rates

3. Unz
Mike will want to know where the memo stands.  I also think Riley is ready
to announce our position next week--maybe a good idea, but a little bit
ahead of where we all are.

4. Class Size/Tobacco
Last week the National School Boards Association endorsed our class size
proposal. A big selling point for them was the tobacco funding
sources--they like long-term, mandatory funding streams. Are we at a
point where it pays to talk about how we can get the education community
behind tobacco legislation? Will this still hurt with the public health
groups?
