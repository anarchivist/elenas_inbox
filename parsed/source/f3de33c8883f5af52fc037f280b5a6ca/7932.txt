TEXT:
POSSIBLE INSERT FOR LAST PARAGRAPH OF JUSTICE LETTER:


         Finally, notwithstanding our interpretation of the Controlled
Substance Act as it applies to the Oregon Act, it is important to
underscore that the President continues to maintain his longstanding
position of abhorring assisted suicides and any Federal support for them.
Thi's position is well known and was recently codified as he enacted into
law the Assisted Suicide Funding Restriction Act just last year.   For this
reason, although recognizing the legitimate concerns surrounding the issue
of Federal rather than state regulation of medical practice, he is open to
working with you and other interested members on the Hill on this complex
but extremely important issue.
