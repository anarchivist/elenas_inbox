     Questions/Answers for National Association of Black Journalists Meeting
                                 July 16. 1997

Q:    Mr. President. in addition to crack sentencing. your Administration has
      supported a "get tough" crime policy that continues to arrest and
      incarcerate young black men at alarming rates. In fact. a 1989 survey by
      the Sentencing Project estimated that. on an average day in the U.S .· one
      out of every four African American men age 20 to 29 was either in prison
      or jail -- or on probation or parole. Do you support these results?

A:    Yes. in some respects. my Administration has supported a tough crime
      policy_ We've supported the death penalty and life without parole for
      the very worst offenders_ We've also been tough on sex offenders and
      criminals that target our children. But these aren't the policies that are
      resulting in so many young black men ending up in prison or on probation
      or parole.

      I think my Administration is the first in a long time to pursue an overall
      criminal justice policy that is both tough and smart. and that is fairer and
      more responsive to the public safety needs of African Americans. For
      instance. I believe our policy of putting 100,000 more community police
      on the street and working to get guns off the street is helping to drive
      down the crime rates and improve the lives of all Americans. New
      community police officers -- in thousands of communities -- are working
      with neighborhood residents to solve specific crime problems and to
      prevent crimes from happening in the first place. They're focusing on
      youth and domestic violence. gun trafficking -- even hate crimes in some
      jurisdictions. As a result, serious crimes -- particularly violent crimes and
      murder -- have been dropping for five years.

      Also, my Administration has fought for more funds for drug treatment,
      testing and alternatives to incarceration that can help the large number
      of drug offenders in our prisons to kick their drug habit and become
      productive, drug-free members of their communities. Equally important,
      we've promoted and fought for funds to establish drug courts throughout
      the country. With drug courts, as you may know, we use drug testing and
      treatment -- and graduated sanctions -- to address the drug problems of
      the large number of offenders on probation. parole and pre-trial. At the
      start of my Administration. there were only a handful of drug courts; now
      some 200 or so are in the works around the country.

      Ultimately, though. too many young black men are under the supervision
      of the criminal justice system because of a sheer lack of opportunity.
      They either have no jobs to go to help center their lives, or no where to go
                                                              Hex.Dump Conversion


    to after school when they're unsupervised. That's why I fought for a
    crime bill that included prevention programs and a jobs program for
    high-crime neighborhoods. And that's why I'm fighting now to make sure
    that juvenile crime legislation passed by Congress includes monies to
    keep schools open late and on weekends. Clearly, though, we need to
    do more to make sure that young black men get the same opportunities
    as others to stay out of trouble, to get a job and to succeed. This must be
    a central focus of what we do this year with the race initiative.
