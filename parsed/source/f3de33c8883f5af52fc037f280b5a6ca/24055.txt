TEXT:
You will shortly receive via fax Justice's proposed letter for tomorrow
morning's markup of HR 1218, the Child Custody Protection Act.  This
legislation would make it illegal to transport minors across state lines
to obtain an abortion in order to circumvent parental consent laws.

The Justice letter opposes the legislation and attaches its letter from
last year on HR 3682, an almost identical bill from 105th Congress.

Comments are due at 5:30 p.m.
