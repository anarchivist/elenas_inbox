TEXT:
If we get a decision drawing the "Medicaid line"

Secretary Glickman would like to put in the Dept. of Ag's letter to the
state of Texas that this will be a one-time experiment -- just because the
Dept. of Ag. will grant an administrative waiver to the state of Texas
does not mean it will do so for other states.  He would have prefered such
language in the memo to the President but knows it was taken out at HHS'
request.
