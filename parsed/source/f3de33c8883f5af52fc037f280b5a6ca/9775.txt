TEXT:
I know we are planning to do an after-school event, to announce grants to
cities from last year's list with this year's $.  Scott Fleming tells me
that ED is concerned that there is appropriations language to better
target these funds, that may make it impossible to award any of the funds
without a new competition.

Do you know anything about this?
