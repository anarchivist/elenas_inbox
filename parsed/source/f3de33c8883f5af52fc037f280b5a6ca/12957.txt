                 Attached is an e-mail that INS forwarded to me on questions they have
                 received from the press (NY Times, WA Post) on race profiling and how they
                 have responded to the questions.

                 FYI,

                 I've spoken to the New York Times and the Washington Post regarding the
                 Presidential Directive on racial profiling. Their questions were what kind
                 of
                 data to we currently collect and on what to we base stops or in depth
                 questioning.  I made the following points:



 The kind of data INS currently collects is information on ethnicity
 (especially
 relevant for asylum seekers), and country of origin (apprehensions and
 removals) .

 Racial profiling is not a legitimate law enforcement tool and INS does not
 engage in or condone its use.   INS enforcement officials make stops based
 on

 reasonable suspicion that someone is here or is engaged in illegal
 activity.

 Reasonable suspicion is based on a number of factors including appearance.
 But
 reasonable suspicion may not be based solely on appearance, it must be
 accompanied by other ariculable factors that may include suspicious
 behavior,

 nervous demeanor, physical evidence, unusual reaction to the uniformed
 agents.

 Sensitivity training is an important part of the Border Patrol agent's
 rigorous
 training program at INS Border Patrol Academy.

 We will be working with the Department of Justice and the White House to
 work
 out the details of how we collect additional data according to the
 directive.



 I worked with Gus and DOJ on this.  You all should have draft Qs and As
 that
 can
 be used in the days to come -- we also may want to add some given that we
 did
 these in 30 minutes ... You also should have the President's remarks and
 the

 fact sheed the White House put out.

 I've told Becraft and the Commissioner about the Post and the Times.

 Thanks.

 Maria
