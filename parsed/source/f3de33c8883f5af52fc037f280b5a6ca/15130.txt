This memorandum is intended only to improve the management of, and the relationship between,

                 RESPONSIBILITY AND MANAGEMENT ASSISTANCE ACT OF
                       1995"

The parties recognize the effectiveness of PL 104·8 and dedicate themselves to the cooperative
implementation of its provisions. Among these provisions:

Finance.

·      For each Fiscal Year for which the District is in a control period, the Mayor shall develop
       and submit to the Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Authority (the
       "Authority") and District Council a Budget and Financial Plan for the applicable Fiscal
       Year and the next three Fiscal Years.

·      Expenditures for the District government for each Fiscal Year, beginning in FY1999, may
       not exceed revenues for that Fiscal Year.

·      During Fiscal Years 1996, 1997, and 1998, the District government shall make
       continuous, substantial progress toward equalizing its expenditures and revenues.

·      The District may not borrow money during a control year unless the Authority provides
       prior certification that the borrowing is consistent with the financial plan and budget for
       the year.

·      For the Secretary of the Treasury to make a short-term advance to the District, an
       Authority-approved Budget and Financial Plan must be in place, the Mayor must submit a
       requisition for an advance including a schedule for timing and amounts for advances, the
       Inspector General must certify the accuracy of the information provided to the Secretary,
       and the Secretary determines -- and the Authority certifies -- that the District lacks market
       access on reasonable terms, and that the Treasury has reasonable assurance of being
       reimbursed.

·    The Authority may submit recommendations to the Mayor, the Council, the President,
                                                                               and

SECTION III.          GENERAL PROVISIONS

1.     Balanced Budget. PL 104-8 requires that the District balance its budget by FY1999.
       By this agreement, the District agrees to present and/or approve a balanced budget for the
       Fiscal Year beginning October 1, 1997.

2.     Agreement to be Bound. The District agrees to be bound by and to use its offices and
       best efforts to implement this agreement.


SECTION IV. SUBMISSION OF LEGISLATION &                             FEDERALLY ASSUMED
FUNCTIONS

        On behalf of the Executive Office of the President, the Director of the Office
Management and Budget intends to recommend the submission of legislation to the Congress
that is consistent with the National Capital Revitalization and Self Government Improvement
Plan (the "Plan") announced by the President on January 14, 1997.

        Once implemented, the Plan will provide the District substantial relief from its operating
expenditures, relief which will grow over time. It will also invest considerable resources to
improve the District's criminal justice systems and capital infrastructure. If this legislation is
enacted, the Federal government will undertake the functions described below. The Federal
government will not undertake a function until the District government meets the conditions for
that function, described in Section V.

1.     Medicaid. The Federal government will increase its share of the District's Medicaid
       payments to 70 percent, thereby reducing the District's share to 30 percent. The
       Department of Health and Human Services will continue to provide more intensive
       technical assistance to help the District improve the management of its Medicaid
       program.

2.     Pensions. The Federal government will take fmancial and administrative
       responsibility for virtually all pension benefits accrued under the plans for all active

                                                 5
                                   Hex-Dump Conversion

     and retired police and fIrefIghters, and teachers, and will take full responsibility for
     the pensions of judges. The bulk of the assets of the retirement plans will be
     transferred to the Federal government. The Federal government will pledge its full faith
     and credit to meet its responsibilities to pay these benefits. Benefits payable to current
     employees will be "frozen" based on service earned as of the date the legislation is
     introduced, and the Federal government will pay future retirement, death and some of
     their disability benefits to the extent they are earned based on the frozen service. While
     the Federal government will not be responsible for benefits earned during future years of
     service by members of the current retirement programs (other than judges), these
     members will get the benefit of pay increases on the frozen benefits. Frozen benefits will
     continue to be subject to cost-of-living adjustments under the terms of the existing
     programs. All future employee contributions (except for judges) will be paid into the
     new plans. The Secretary of the Treasury will appoint a third-party Trustee to administer
     the existing plans and manage pension assets.

3.   Intermediate-Term and Short-Term Lending. The United States Treasury will provide
     an intermediate-term loan (IS-year term) to assist the District to eliminate its accumulated
     fund balance deficit. The Treasury may also provide inter-year loans for liquidity
     purposes. The combined amount of the intermediate-term and inter-year liquidity loans
     may not exceed $500 million. Both of these loans will have an interest rate of Treasuries
     of comparable maturity plus 1I8th of one percent. The Treasury may also provide
     intra-year loans for the purposes ofliquidity.

4.   Criminal Justice.      The Federal and District governments will develop and
     implement a transition plan which transfers responsibility over a three-to-fIve-year
     period for incarcerating felons. The Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) will house
     adult felons convicted of D.C. Code violations and designated in the same manner as
                                                                                   I
     Federal inmates in correctional institutions operated or contracted by the BOP.
     This will occur after BOP's capacity has been increased through new construction
     at Lorton and other locations selected by BOP, and through renovation of existing
     facilities at Lorton, Virginia. After October 1, 2001, the BOP will also designate to
     Federal correctional institutions sentenced D.C. felons in the custody of the D.C.
     Department of Corrections, as the Director of BOP deems appropriate, in
     accordance with available capacity, until they have all been designated to Federal
     institutions. The BOP will accept employment applications from persons currently
     employed by the D.C. Department of Corrections for existing BOP vacancies, and
     will process such applications in accordance with existing Federal procedures and
     standards.

     The Attorney General will select, after consultation with the Mayor, the D.C. City
     Council, and the Chair of the D.C. Financial Responsibility and Management
     Assistance Authority, a Trustee to oversee operations of the D.C. Department of
     Corrections until the BOP assumes responsibility for all incarcerated District felons.

     The Federal and District governments will develop and implement a framework for
     changes to the D.C. sentencing system, including the abolition of parole, institution of

                                               6

     detenninate guideline sentencing and the enactment of the new mandatory minimum drug
     sentences, which are a prerequisite for the Federal Government accepting responsibility
     for the incarceration of felons convicted of D.C. Code violations. The sentencing system
     will be enacted within 24 months, or the Federal Government will not be required to
     obligate any funds appropriated for the purpose of incarcerating D.C. Code felons and
     will have no responsibility for housing such persons.

     Consulting with representatives of the Federal and District judiciary, the Federal
     and District governments will also develop and implement a transition plan
     transferring responsibility for D.C. Code violation offender pretrial, public defender,
     parole, probation, and post-adjudicationlpost-conviction adult offender supervision
     from the District government to the Federal government over a three-to-five-year
     period.    The United States Parole Commission will continue to assume
     responsibility for all D.C. felons housed in Federal Correctional Institutions who
     have sentences subject to provisions of parole.

     The Federal government will take direct responsibility (in consultation with the
     D.C. judiciary) for funding the D.C. court system and related services (including
     plans relating to retirement benefits and other personnel matters), and establishing
     an independent budgetary, financial oversight, and administrative support system for the
     D.C. courts. The Courts will remain self-managed.

5.   Economic Development. The Federal government will make tax benefits available to the
     District both to encourage hiring by finns in the District of residents of distressed areas in
     D.C., and to encourage economic revitalization throughout the District.

     An economic development corporation (EDC) will be established as a non-Federal public
     authority in the District of Columbia, with the mission of revitalizing the nation's capital
     city and benefitting the District's residents and businesses. The Federal government
     intends (a) to capitalize the EDC with a $50 million grant; (b) provide $250 million in tax
     incentives to encourage business investment both downtown and in distressed
     communities, and to help businesses increase employment of residents of the District of
     Columbia; and (c) improve the District government's borrowing authority by removing
     impediments in its borrowing statutes so that the District government will have the same
     ability to finance projects as other cities have.

6.   Infrastructure. The National Capital Infrastructure Commission (NCIC) will be
     established to assume certain State-like responsibilities for selection, funding, and
     oversight of National Highway System capital projects (including roads, bridges, and
     transit) and NHS operations and maintenance projects (excluding police authority,
     National Park Service roads, and transit) within the District. The NCIC will be governed
     by a five-member board to be composed of three representatives from the District and one
     representative from the Department of Transportation and one representative from the
     Economic Development Corporation. Contract administration will be perfonned by the
     Federal Highway Administration. In addition, eligibility for Surface Transportation
     Program (STP) funds will be expanded to include local public roads. To support NCIC

                                        Hex-Dump Conversion

        projects, the National Capital Infrastructure Fund (NCIF) will be established in FYI998
        with $108 million for road, bridge, and transit capital projects. An additional $17
        million will be provided in FY1998-03 for NHS operations and maintenance.
        Federal-aid funds for the District's NHS, Interstate Maintenance, and Bridge programs
        will be transferred to the NCIC in FYI998-03. The Administration also proposes that
        the NCIC be authorized to accepted contributions from other sources.

7.      Personal Income Tax Collection. At the request of the District, the Internal Revenue
        Service will assume responsibility from the District of Columbia for administering and
        enforcing D.C. individual income and payroll taxes. This would include the processing
        of those taxes paid by individuals, as well as the payment of related employment and
        payroll taxes. The District government will maintain processing and collection
        responsibility for all other taxes collected for the District.

        Upon enactment of the legislation to implement the Plan, the parties to the MOU will
review the legislation and confer on whether any revisions to the MOU are necessary to ensure
its consistency with the legislation.

              "housing" include subsistence, transportation of persons to and from court
              appearances, revocation hearings, and medical facilities, and the
              maintenance of necessary prisoner records.

4.1.2.5. The Trustee will be an independent officer of the D.C. Government and can be
               removed by the Mayor only with the concurrence of the Attorney General.
                The Attorney General has authority to remove the Trustee only for
               misfeasance or malfeasance in office.

4.1.2.6. The Trustee will propose funding requests for offender supervision and services
               for inclusion in the President's budget for each fiscal year of the transition.

                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion

        4.1.2.7. The Trustee will allocate funds for offender supervision (including adult felon
                       parole and probation) in D.C., including funds for short term
                       improvements, equipment contracts, and salary increases necessary to retain
                       key personnel, maintain and enhance current levels of service, including
                       offender drug testing, and provide for the safety and security of the
                       community.

        4.1.2.8. Upon receipt of funds identified by Congress or other entities for Pretrial Services,
                       the Trustee will immediately transfer such funds to the Pretrial Services
                       Agency.

        4.1.2.9. Upon receipt of funds identified by Congress or other entities for the D.C. Public
                       Defender Service, the Trustee will immediately transfer such funds to the
                       Public Defender Service.

        4.1.2.10.      Effectively immediately and in view of the responsibility to be undertaken
                       by the U.S. Parole Commission to carry out the functions of the D.C.
                       Board of Parole pursuant to the parole laws and regulations of D.C., the
                       D.C. Council will not enact legislation that changes or modifies parole
                       laws and regulations as applicable to felony offenders without the
                       concurrence of the Attorney General. D.C. will immediately take steps to
                       modify parole as applicable to misdemeanants to provide for D.C. court
                       supervision of D.C. misdemeanant parolees and the elimination of the
                       D.C. Board of Parole. Following the assumption by the U.S. Parole
                       Commission of the functions of the D.C. Board of Parole, the D.C.
                       Council will cede to Congress the sole authority to legislate changes to the
                       D.C. Code pertaining to the parole of D.C. felony offenders.

        4.1.2.11.      It is expected that the transition period for these offender, defender and
                       court services will end no sooner than one year but not later than three
                       years after the enactment of the related legislation.

        4.1.2.12.      The D.C. Corporation Counsel will provide representation for the Trustee
                       and Trustee supervised agencies. (see litigation and liability section)

4.2.   Administration of District of Columbia and Federal Prisons

4.2.1. Federal Government Responsibilities

        4.2.1.1. The Federal Government will take administrative control of the nine parcels of
                       land, collectively located at or in the vicinity of Lorton, Virginia (lithe
                       Lorton property"), and other appropriate sites. Mter the BOP's capacity
                       has been increased through renovation of existing facilities and new

                                                 16

             construction at the corrections complex in Lorton and other locations
             selected by BOP, BOP will house felons who were convicted of D.C.
             Code violations and sentenced to terms of imprisonment. (A recently
             completed Congressionally mandated study of the D.C. Department of
             Corrections revealed that most of the institutions at Lorton have exceeded
             their useful lifespan and need major renovations or demolition.)

4.2.1.2. BOP will conduct a thorough preliminary assessment of the Lorton property
              to determine its environmental condition, including a study of the
              contamination on the property and an estimation of the costs
              associated with bringing the property into compliance with
              environmental and other applicable regulations.           Based on
              preliminary information gathered pursuant to a review of the
              environmental conditions of a portion of the Lorton property, BOP
              could begin planning for renovation and construction immediately;
              actual physical renovations would not begin until Fiscal Year 1998.
              The estimated date for the completion of the preliminary
              environmental assessment process is March 21, 1998.

4.2.1.3.     BOP will oversee the operation of community corrections centers in
             D.C. as necessary to provide an appropriate transition for inmates
             who are nearing release from Federal prisons, including those
             convicted of D.C. Code violations. BOP intends to use existing
             community corrections centers in D.C. to the extent practicable and
             will work with D.C. officials to identify prospective sites, as needed to
             establish new community corrections facilities.

4.2.1.4.     D.C. Code offenders will be housed together with Federal offenders in
             facilities operated by BOP in Lorton, Virginia and elsewhere. Every
             effort will be made to house D.C. felons at facilities as close to D.C. as
             permitted by inmate program and security needs and BOP population
             management requirements. D.C. felons will be designated in the
             same manner as Federal inmates, and ordinarily initially assigned to
             institutions located within a 500-mile radius of their release residence.
              BOP anticipates that many of the initial designations for D.C.
             offenders will be within a significantly closer radius. BOP also will
             work with D.C. officials to identify sites for possible Federal
             correctional facility construction within D.C.

4.2.1.5.     During the transition period, based upon assurances from D.C. that
             felons convicted of violating the D.C. Code will, in the future, receive
             sentences similar to those received by comparable offenders convicted
             of comparable Federal offenses, BOP will house those sentenced D.C.
             felons in the custody of the D.C. Department of Corrections as the
             Director of the BOP deems appropriate in accordance with available


                                      17
                                              Hex-Dump Conversion

                     capacity. If such a new structure for sentencing under the D.C. Code
                     is in place as of October 1, 2001, BOP will accept D.C. felons
                     sentenced under the new sentencing structure in accordance with the
                     capacity of BOP. By October 1, 2002, and assuming fulfillment of all
                     requisite conditions, BOP will have assumed responsibility for
                     incarcerating all sentenced D.C. felons.

       4.2.1.6.      BOP will accept employment applications from persons currently
                     employed by the D.C. Department of Corrections for BOP vacancies
                     and will make hiring selections in accordance with existing Federal
                     procedures and standards. Positions for new BOP facilities will be
                     advertised prior to hiring.

       4.2.1.7.      After consultation with the Mayor, representatives of the D.C.
                     Council, the Chair of the Financial Authority, members of the
                     judiciary and others, the Attorney General will select a Corrections
                     Trustee to oversee expenditures of the D.C. Department of
                     Corrections relating to sentenced, incarcerated felons, until BOP
                     assumes responsibility for all incarcerated sentenced D.C. felons.

       4.2.1.8.      The Federal Government will provide funds for the incarceration of
                     sentenced D.C. felons through the Trustee to the D.C. Department of
                     Corrections. The head of any Federal department or agency may
                     provide the services of any personnel to the Trustee to assist in
                     carrying out the Trustee's duties.

       4.2.1.9.      Of the Federal funds received by the Trustee, the Trustee will
                     reimburse BOP for those funds identified by Congress to be used for
                     the construction of new facilities and the major renovation of existing
                     facilities. BOP will be responsible and accountable for determining
                     how these funds will be used, including the type, security level, and
                     location of new facilities.

       4.2.1.10.     During the transition period, the employees of and appropriations
                     allocated to the Trustee and the agencies for which the Trustee is
                     responsible shall not be scored or counted against the personnel and
                     budget ceilings imposed on D.C. by the Financial Authority or
                     Congress.

4.2.2. District of Columbia Responsibilities

       4.2.2.1.      Offenders convicted of D.C. Code violations will be sentenced
                     pursuant to a new D.C. sentencing system, described below. BOP
                     shall not be required to obligate any funds appropriated for the
                     absorption of D.C. Code felons into the Federal prison system and will
                     have no responsibility to house any persons convicted of felony

                                               18
                                   Hex-Dump Conversion

           offenses, if the new sentencing system is not enacted within 24 months
           of the authorizing legislation's enactment.

4.2.2.2.   D.C. will continue to house felons sentenced to terms of imprisonment
           by the Superior Court for the District of Columbia until such persons
           have been designated by BOP. To the extent beds are available, D.C.
           will continue to house felons sentenced to terms of imprisonment by
           the U.S. District Court until such persons have been designated by
           BOP and will continue to receive reimbursement by the Federal
           Government, at a mutually negotiated rate, for costs of housing
           persons sentenced by the U.S. District Court.

4.2.2.3.   The Trustee will be an independent officer of the D.C. government
           and can be removed by the Mayor only with the concurrence of the
           Attorney General. The Attorney General has authority to remove
           the Trustee only for misfeasance or malfeasance in office.

4.2.2.4.   The Trustee will propose funding requests for the incarceration of
           sentenced D.C. felons, for inclusion in the budget submitted by the
           President to Congress for each fiscal year of the transition.

4.2.2.5.   The Trustee will allocate funds to the D.C. Department of
           Corrections, including such sums as may be appropriated for short
           term improvements that are necessary for the safety and security of
           staff, inmates, and the community.

4.2.2.6.   The D.C. Department of Corrections will implement the short term
           improvements in physical security identified in the "District of
           Columbia Department of Corrections Short-Term Improvements Plan
           (September, 1996)."

4.2.2.7.   Upon receipt of Federal funds identified by Congress for constructing
           new prisons and making major renovations to existing facilities for
           the incarceration of D.C. felons, the Trustee will immediately
           reimburse BOP for such funds.

4.2.2.8.   The D.C. Corporation Counsel will provide representation for the
           Trustee and Trustee supervised agencies. (see litigation and liability
           section)

4.2.2.9.   During the transition, D.C. will transfer control of the property at
           Lorton, Virginia to the Federal Government, though the D.C.
           Department of Corrections may continue to house D.C. felons at
           facilities located at Lorton until such time as BOP absorbs such
           offenders into the Federal prison system.

4.3.     Sentencing. The District of Columbia understands and agrees that the D.C. sentencing
         system will be changed pursuant to proposed legislation in the following manner:

4.3.1.         Congress will amend the D.C. Code to abolish parole for all persons convicted of
               D.C. felony offenses committed on or after 3 years from the enactment of the
               Federal authorizing legislation.

4.3.2.         Congress will amend the D.C. Code so that good time calculations for all persons
               convicted of D.C. felony offenses committed on or after 3 years from the
               enactment of the Federal authorizing legislation will be made according to the
               Federal requirements.

4.3.3.         Congress will establish a new D.C. Board of Criminal Sentences (the Board) as an
               independent body within the D.C. Government. All persons convicted of D.C.
               felonies committed on or after 3 years from the enactment of the Act will be
               sentenced according to a determinate sentencing system promulgated by the Board
               and transmitted by the Board to the D.C. Council no later than 18 months after
               enactment of the Federal authorizing legislation.

4.3.4.         The Board will develop a sentencing system which shall include binding
               guidelines and may include such amendments or repeals of provisions in the D.C.
               Code relating to the maximum and minimum prison terms as are necessary to
               accomplish the purposes of the Act. Ninety days after the Board promulgates
               and transmits the sentencing system to the D.C. Council, the sentencing system, its
               guidelines, amendments and repeals will become effective unless disapproved in its
               entirety by a majority of the Council. If disapproved by the Council, the system
               may be enacted by Congress.

4.3.5.         The promulgated sentencing system will supersede any inconsistent provision of
               the D.C. Code.

4.3.6.         Congress will repeal certain other provisions of the D.C. Code to conform with
               the new sentencing system (D.C. Code Title 24, Chapters 2 and 8), including the
               Youth Rehabilitation Act.

4.3.7.         Congress will amend D.C. Code Title 33, Section 541 to adopt certain mandatory
               penalties necessary to further the Superior Court of the District of Columbia's
               Drug Intervention Program and effective local law enforcement. The new
               sentencing system will incorporate these mandatory penalties, thereby excluding
               local narcotics offenses from the mandate that sentences be similar to those that
               would be imposed upon comparable offenders in the Federal system.

                                                Hex-Dump Conversion

4.3.8.           The Board will not have the authority to provide for capital punishment under any
                 law applicable exclusively in D.C.

4.3.9.           The Board will have seven voting members. All the members of the Board shall
                 have knowledge and responsibilities with respect to criminal justice matters. The
                 Attorney General (or her designee) will chair the Board. The other members
                 will include two judges of the Superior Court for the District of Columbia and
                 one representative each of the following entities: the D.C. Council, the Executive
                 Branch of the D.C. Government, the D.C. Public Defender Service, and the U.S.
                 Attorney for the District of Columbia. One representative each of the D.C.
                 Corporation Counsel and BOP will serve as non-voting, ex officio members.

4.3.10. An affirmative vote of at least six Board members will be necessary to promulgate the
               sentencing system.

4.3.11. In developing the sentencing system, the Board will hold two or more public hearings,
               review other sentencing guideline system models, consult with sentencing reform
               experts, and solicit written comments from the public.

4.3.12. If the Board fails to promulgate a sentencing system within 18 months, the Board will
               terminate, and the Attorney General will develop a sentencing system to be
               transmitted to the D.C. Council for approval. Ninety days after the Attorney
               General transmits the sentencing system to the D.C. Council, the sentencing
               system, its guidelines, amendments, and repeals will become effective, unless the
               Council disapproves the system in its entirety and Congress, in turn, does not
               approve it.

4.3.13. The Board will have the mandate to ensure that the sentencing system it establishes,
              among other things:

         4.3.13.1.      will result in sentences for those convicted of D.C. felony offenses similar
                        to those that would be imposed upon comparable offenders convicted of
                        comparable offenses in the Federal system;

         4.3.13.2.      will result in sentences that reflect the seriousness of the offense and
                        provide for just punishment, afford adequate deterrence to potential future
                        criminal conduct of the offender and others, and provide the defendant
                        with needed educational or vocational training, medical care, and other
                        correctional treatment;

         4.3.13.3.      will provide certainty and fairness in meeting the purposes of sentencing,
                        avoiding unwarranted sentencing disparities among similar defendants,
                        while maintaining sufficient flexibility to permit individualized sentences;

                                                 21
                                         Hex..()ump Conversion


       4.3.13.4.      will take into account the high volume of sentencing proceedings in the
                      D.C. Superior Court as bearing upon the degree of complexity of the
                      sentencing system; and

       4.3.13.5.     will ensure that the system is neutral as to the race, sex, marital status,
                     ethnic origin, religious affiliation, national origin, creed, socioeconomic
                     status, and sexual orientation of offenders, if not related to the commission
                     of the offense.

4.3.14. As part of the sentencing system, the Board will develop binding guidelines for use in
               determining the sentence to be imposed upon convicted felons.      The guidelines
               will specify:

       4.3.14.1.     when to impose a sentence of probation, a fine, or a term of imprisonment
                     and the appropriate amount or length, thereof, as well as intermediate
                     sanctions;

       4.3.14.2.     when to impose a term of supervised release following imprisonment, and
                     the appropriate length, thereof; and

       4.3.14.3.     whether multiple sentences to terms of imprisonment should run
                     concurrently or consecutively.

4.3.15. Ninety days after promulgation of the sentencing system, the Board will be terminated.
               There will be established a successor, Federally funded agency to amend the
               guidelines as necessary to achieve the purposes of the Act. The D.C. Council
               may recommend to Congress whether or not these amendments should be
               approved. However, the amendments will take effect as prescribed by the
               successor agency, unless they are modified or disapproved by Congress. The
               successor agency will have no powers to revise the D.C. Code but will
               recommend changes to the Code as may be necessary to further the purposes of
               the Act.

              any other agency will submit information about convicted felons as required by
              the Board and the u.s. Department of Justice. This would permit an assessment
              of the extent to which sentences imposed by the Superior Court of the District of
              Columbia are similar to those imposed for comparable offenders in the Federal
              system. The results of this assessment would be used by the Board in developing
              the new sentencing system for D.C.

       basis of the activities of the District of Columbia, its agencies, or personnel as a result of

       Secretary of the Treasury.

7.2.3. To avoid the possibility of any inconsistent interpretations of similar provisions, the
       District will have to amend its definitional provisions to conform them to the Internal
       Revenue Code to the satisfaction of the Secretary of the Treasury.

7.2.4. The District must notify the Secretary of the Treasury of any future changes to its
       individual income and employment tax laws_ The Secretary may object if, in his
       judgement, the prospective change would prove overly burdensome to the IRS, in which
       case such change shall not be administered or enforced by the IRS. If the Secretary does

that function, described in Section V.

1.     Medicaid. The Federal government will increase its share of the District's Medicaid
       payments to 70 percent, thereby reducing the District's share to 30 percent. The
       Department of Health and Human Services will continue to provide more intensive
       technical assistance to help the District improve the management of its Medicaid
       program.

2.     Pensions. The Federal government will take fmancial and administrative
       responsibility for virtually all pension benefits accrued under the plans for all active

                                                 5
     the pensions of judges. The bulk of the assets of the retirement plans will be
     transferred to the Federal government. The Federal government will pledge its full faith
     and credit to meet its responsibilities to pay these benefits. Benefits payable to current
     employees will be "frozen" based on service earned as of the date the legislation is
     introduced, and the Federal government will pay future retirement, death and some of
     their disability benefits to the extent they are earned based on the frozen service. While
     the Federal government will not be responsible for benefits earned during future years of
     service by members of the current retirement programs (other than judges), these
     members will get the benefit of pay increases on the frozen benefits. Frozen benefits will
     continue to be subject to cost-of-living adjustments under the terms of the existing
     programs. All future employee contributions (except for judges) will be paid into the
     new plans. The Secretary of the Treasury will appoint a third-party Trustee to administer
     the existing plans and manage pension assets.

3.   Intermediate-Term and Short-Term Lending. The United States Treasury will provide
     an intermediate-term loan (I5-year term) to assist the District to eliminate its accumulated
     fund balance deficit. The Treasury may also provide inter-year loans for liquidity
     purposes. The combined amount of the intermediate-term and inter-year liquidity loans
     may not exceed $500 million. Both of these loans will have an interest rate of Treasuries
     of comparable maturity plus 1I8th of one percent. The Treasury may also provide
     intra-year loans for the purposes ofliquidity.

4.   Criminal Justice.      The Federal and District government~ will develop and
     implement a transition plan which transfers responsibility over a three-to-five-year
     period for incarcerating felons. The Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) will house
     adult felons convicted of D.C. Code violations and designated in the same manner as
     Federal inmates in correctional institutions operated or contracted by the BOP.
     This will occur after BOP's capacity has been increased through new construction
     at Lorton and other locations selected by BOP, and through renovation of existing'
     facilities at Lorton, Virginia. After October 1, 2001, the BOP will also.designate to
     Federal correctional institutions sentenced D.C. felons in the custody of the D.C.
     Department of Corrections, as the Director of BOP deems appropriate, in
     accordance with available capacity, until they have all been designated to Federal
     institutions. The BOP will accept employment applications from persons currently
     employed by the D.C. Department of Corrections for existing BOP vacancies, and
     will process such applications in accordance with existing Federal procedures and
     standards.

     The Attorney General will select, after consultation with the Mayor, the D.C. City
     Council, and the Chair of the D.C. Financial Responsibility and Management
     Assistance Authority, a Trustee to oversee operations of the D.C. Department of
     Corrections until the BOP assumes responsibility for all incarcerated District felons.

     The Federal and District governments will develop and implement a framework for
     changes to the D.C. sentencing system, including the abolition of parole, institution of

                                              6
                                      Hex-Dump ConversIon

     detenninate guideline sentencing and the enactment of the new mandatory minimum drug
     sentences, which are a prerequisite for the Federal Government accepting responsibility
     for the incarceration of felons convicted of D.C. Code violations. The sentencing system
     will be enacted within 24 months, or the Federal Government will not be required to
     obligate any funds appropriated for the purpose of incarcerating D.C. Code felons and
     will have no responsibility for housing such persons.

     Consulting with representatives of the Federal and District judiciary, the Federal
     and District governments will also develop and implement a transition plan
     transferring responsibility for D.C. Code violation offender pretrial, public defender,
     parole, probation, and post-adjudicationlpost-conviction adult offender supervision
     from the District government to the Federal government over a three-to-five-year
     period.    The United States Parole Commission will continue to assume
     responsibility for all D.C. felons housed in Federal Correctional Institutions who
     have sentences subject to provisions of parole.

     The Federal government will take direct responsibility (in consultation with the
     D.C. judiciary) for funding the D.C. court system and related services (including
     plans relating to retirement benefits and other personnel matters), and establishing
     an independent budgetary, financial oversight, and administrative support system for the
     D.C. courts. The Courts will remain self-managed.

5.   Economic Development. The Federal government will make tax benefits available to the
     District both to encourage hiring by finns in the District of residents of distressed areas in
     D.C., and to encourage economic revitalization throughout the District.

     An economic development corporation (EDC) will be established as a non-Federal public
     authority in the District of Columbia, with the mission of revitalizing the nation's capital
     city and benefitting the District's residents and businesses. The Federal government
     intends (a) to capitalize the EDC with a $50 million grant; (b) provide $250 million in tax
     incentives to encourage business investment both downtown and in distressed
     communities, and to help businesses increase employment of residents of the District of
     Columbia; and (c) improve the District government's borrowing authority by removing
     impediments in its borrowing statutes so that the District government will have the same
     ability to finance projects as other cities have.

6.   Infrastructure. The National Capital Infrastructure Commission (NCIC) will be
     established to assume certain State-like responsibilities for selection, funding, and
     oversight of National Highway System capital projects (including roads, bridges, and
     transit) and NHS operations and maintenance projects (excluding police authority,
     National Park Service roads, and transit) within the District. The NCIC will be governed
     by a five-member board to be composed of three representatives from the District and one
     representative from the Department of Transportation and one representative from the
     Economic Development Corporation. Contract administration will be perfonned by the
     Federal Highway Administration. In addition, eligibility for Surface Transportation
     Program (STP) funds will be expanded to include local public roads. To support NCIC

                                               7
                                           Hex-Dump Conversion

        projects, the National Capital Infrastructure Fund (NCIF) will be established in FY1998
        with $108 million for road, bridge, and transit capital projects. An additional $17
        million will be provided in FY1998-03 for NHS operations and maintenance.
        Federal-aid funds for the District's NHS, Interstate Maintenance, and Bridge programs
        will be transferred to the NCIC in FYI998-03. The Administration also proposes that
        the NCIC be authorized to accepted contributions from other sources.

7.      Personal Income Tax Collection. At the request of the District, the Internal Revenue
        Service will assume responsibility from the District of Columbia for administering and
        enforcing D.C. individual income and payroll taxes. This would include the processing
        of those taxes paid by individuals, as well as the payment of related employment and
        payroll taxes. The District government will maintain processing and collection
        responsibility for all other taxes collected for the District.

        Upon enactment of the legislation to implement the Plan, the parties to the MOU will
review the legislation and confer on whether any revisions to the MOU are necessary to ensure
its consistency with the legislation.

               functions.

4.1.1.2. During the transition period, under the general auspices of the Trustee, the D.C.
               Pretrial Services Agency will continue uninterrupted to provide services
               and support for both juvenile and adult D.C. Code and Federal defendants

               U.S. Parole Commission is capable of carrying out parole functions for
               D.C. Code felony offenders. Subject to appropriations, the D.C. Board
              of Parole's functions and jurisdiction vis a vis felon parolees will be
              assumed by the U.S. Parole Commission. Similarly, its functions and
              jurisdiction vis a vis misdemeanant parolees will be assumed by the D.C.
              court system. Substantive D.C. law will continue to apply to parole

                     standards established by the Trustee to facilitate transition to subsequent
                     Federal law enforcement employment in the successor Offender
                     Supervision, Defender and Courts Services Agency. Positions will be

                      Code defendants and the D.C. court system. The Director of the Public
                      Defender Service may employ such personnel as shall be necessary
                      pursuant to procedures and standards established by the Trustee to facilitate

                      Financial Authority or Congress.

       4.1.1.9. The U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) will contract with D.C., at a mutually
                     agreeable rate, to obtain space not needed by D.C. at D.C.'s Correctional
                     Treatment Facility (CTF), to house persons in the custody of the USMS
                     for whom the USMS requires bed space in the D.C. area.

       4.1.1.10.      Subject to appropriations, the Federal Government will provide funds to
                      support the D.C. Board of Parole functions during the one to three year

                       key personnel, maintain and enhance current levels of service, including
                       offender drug testing, and provide for the safety and security of the

                       modify parole as applicable to misdemeanants to provide for D.C. court
                       supervision of D.C. misdemeanant parolees and the elimination of the
                       D.C. Board of Parole. Following the assumption by the U.S. Parole

4.2.   Administration of District of Columbia and Federal Prisons

4.2.1. Federal Government Responsibilities

        4.2.1.1. The Federal Government will take administrative control of the nine parcels of
                       land, collectively located at or in the vicinity of Lorton, Virginia ("the
                       Lorton property"), and other appropriate sites. Mter the BOP's capacity
                       has been increased through renovation of existing facilities and new

                                                  16
                                    Hex-Dump Conversion

             construction at the corrections complex in Lorton and other locations
             selected by BOP, BOP will house felons who were convicted of D.C.
             Code violations and sentenced to terms of imprisonment. (A recently
             completed Congressionally mandated study of the D.C. Department of
             Corrections revealed that most of the institutions at Lorton have exceeded
             their useful lifespan and need major renovations or demolition.)

4.2.1.2. BOP will conduct a thorough preliminary assessment of the Lorton property
              to determine its environmental condition, including a study of the
              contamination on the property and an estimation of the costs
              associated with bringing the property into compliance with
              environmental and other applicable regulations.           Based on
              preliminary information gathered pursuant to a review of the
              environmental conditions of a portion of the Lorton property, BOP
              could begin planning for renovation and construction immediately;
              actual physical renovations would not begin until Fiscal Year 1998.
              The estimated date for the completion of the preliminary
              environmental assessment process is March 21, 1998.

4.2.1.3.     BOP will oversee the operation of community corrections centers in
             D.C. as necessary to provide an appropriate transition for inmates
             who are nearing release from Federal prisons, including those
             convicted of D.C. Code violations. BOP intends to use existing
             community corrections centers in D.C. to the extent practicable and
             will work with D.C. officials to identify prospective sites, as needed ·to
             establish new community corrections facilities.

4.2.1.4.     D.C. Code offenders will be housed together with Federal offenders in
             facilities operated by BOP in Lorton, Virginia and elsewhere. Every
             effort will be made to house D.C. felons at facilities as close to D.C. as
             permitted by inmate program and security needs and BOP popUlation
             management requirements. D.C. felons will be designated in the
             same manner as Federal inmates, and ordinarily initially assigned to
             institutions located within a SOO-mile radius of their release residence.
              BOP anticipates that many of the initial designations for D.C.
             offenders will be within a significantly closer radius. BOP also will
             work with D.C. officials to identify sites for possible Federal
             correctional facility construction within D.C.

4.2.1.5.     During the transition period, based upon assurances from D.C. that
             felons convicted of violating the D.C. Code will, in the future, receive
             sentences similar to those received by comparable offenders convicted
             of comparable Federal offenses, BOP will house those sentenced D.C.
             felons in the custody of the D.C. Department of Corrections as the
             Director of the BOP deems appropriate in accordance with available


                                      17
                                            Hex-Dump Conversion

                     capacity. If such a new structure for sentencing under the D.C. Code
                     is in place as of October 1, 2001, BOP will accept D.C. felons
                     sentenced under the new sentencing structure in accordance with the
                     capacity of BOP. By October 1, 2002, and assuming fulmlment of all
                     requisite conditions, BOP will have assumed responsibility for
                     incarcerating all sentenced D.C. felons.

       4.2.1.6.      BOP will accept employment applications from persons currently
                     employed by the D.C. Department of Corrections for BOP vacancies
                     and will make hiring selections in accordance with existing Federal
                     procedures and standards. Positions for new BOP facilities will be
                     advertised prior to hiring.

       4.2.1.7.      After consultation with the Mayor, representatives of the D.C.
                     Council, the Chair of the Financial Authority, members of the
                     judiciary and others, the Attorney General will select a Corrections
                     Trustee to oversee expenditures of the D.C. Department of
                     Corrections relating to sentenced, incarcerated felons, until BOP
                     assumes responsibility for all incarcerated sentenced D.C. felons.

       4.2.1.8.      The Federal Government will provide funds for the incarceration of
                     sentenced D.C. felons through the Trustee to the D.C. Department of
                     Corrections. The head of any Federal department or agency may
                     provide the services of any personnel to the Trustee to assist in
                     carrying out the Trustee's duties.

       4.2.1.9.      Of the Federal funds received by the Trustee, the Trustee will
                     reimburse BOP for those funds identified by Congress to be used for
                     the construction of new facilities and the major renovation of existing
                     facilities. BOP will be responsible and accountable for determining
                     how these funds will be used, including the type, security level, and
                     location of new facilities.

       4.2.1.10.     During the transition period, the employees of and appropriations
                     allocated to the Trustee and the agencies for which the Trustee is
                     responsible shall not be scored or counted against the personnel and
                     budget ceilings imposed on D.C. by the Financial Authority or
                     Congress.

4.2.2. District of Columbia Responsibilities

       4.2.2.1.      Offenders convicted of D.C. Code violations will be sentenced
                     pursuant to a new D.C. sentencing system, described below. BOP
                     shall not be required to obligate any funds appropriated for the
                     absorption of D.C. Code felons into the Federal prison system and will
                     have no responsibility to house any persons convicted of felony

           offenses, if the new sentencing system is not enacted within 24 months
           ofthe authorizing legislation's enactment.

4.2.2.2.   D.C. will continue to house felons sentenced to terms of imprisonment
           by the Superior Court for the District of Columbia until such persons
           have been designated by BOP. To the extent beds are available, D.C.
           will continue to house felons sentenced to terms of imprisonment by
           the U.S. District Court until such persons have been designated by
           BOP and will continue to receive reimbursement by the Federal
           Government, at a mutually negotiated rate, for costs of housing
           persons sentenced by the U.S. District Court.

4.2.2.3.   The Trustee will be an independent officer of the D.C. government
           and can be removed by the Mayor only with the concurrence of the
           AttQrney General. The Attorney General has authority to remove
           the Trustee only for misfeasance or malfeasance in office.

4.2.2.4.   The Trustee will propose funding requests for the incarceration of
           sentenced D.C. felons, for inclusion in the budget submitted by the
           President to Congress for each fiscal year of the transition.

4.2.2.5.   The Trustee will allocate funds to the D.C. Department of
           Corrections, including such sums as may be appropriated for short
           term improvements that are necessary for the safety and security of
           staff, inmates, and the community.

4.2.2.6.   The D.C. Department of Corrections will implement the short term
           improvements in physical security identified in the "District of
           Columbia Department of Corrections Short-Term Improvements Plan
           (September, 1996)."

4.2.2.7.   Upon receipt of Federal funds identified by Congress for constructing
           new prisons and making major renovations to existing facilities for
           the incarceration of D.C. felons, the Trustee will immediately
           reimburse BOP for such funds.

4.2.2.8.   The D.C. Corporation Counsel will provide representation for the
           Trustee and Trustee supervised agencies. (see litigation and liability
           section)

4.2.2.9.   During the transition, D.C. will transfer control of the property at
           Lorton, Virginia to the Federal Government, though the D.C.

           facilities located at Lorton until such time as BOP absorbs such
           offenders into the Federal prison system.

4.3.     Sentencing. The District of Columbia understands and agrees that the D.C. sentencing
         system will be changed pursuant to proposed legislation in the following manner:

4.3.1.          Congress will amend the D.C. Code to abolish parole for all persons convicted of
                D.C. felony offenses committed on or after 3 years from the enactment of the
                Federal authorizing legislation.

4.3.2.         Congress will amend the D.C. Code so that good time calculations for all persons
               convicted of D.C. felony offenses committed on or after 3 years from the
               enactment of the Federal authorizing legislation will be made according to the
               Federal requirements.

4.3.3.         Congress will establish a new D.C. Board of Criminal Sentences (the Board) as an
               independent body within the D.C. Government. All persons convicted of D.C.
               felonies committed on or after 3 years from the enactment of the Act will be
               sentenced according to a determinate sentencing system promulgated by the Board
               and transmitted by the Board to the D.C. Council no later than 18 months after
               enactment of the Federal authorizing legislation.

4.3.4.         The Board will develop a sentencing system which shall include binding
               guidelines and may include such amendments or repeals of provisions in the D.C.
               Code relating to the maximum and minimum prison terms as are necessary to
               accomplish the purposes of the Act. Ninety days after the Board promulgates
               and transmits the sentencing system to the D.C. Council, the sentencing system, its
               guidelines, amendments and repeals will become effective unless disapproved in its
               entirety by a majority of the Council. If disapproved by the Council, the system
               may be enacted by Congress.

4.3.5.         The promulgated sentencing system will supersede any inconsistent provision of
               the D.C. Code.

4.3.6.         Congress will repeal certain other provisions of the D.C. Code to conform with
               the new sentencing system (D.C. Code Title 24, Chapters 2 and 8), including the
               Youth Rehabilitation Act.

4.3.7.         Congress will amend D.C. Code Title 33, Section 541 to adopt certain mandatory
               penalties necessary to further the Superior Court of the District of Columbia's
               Drug Intervention Program and effective local law enforcement. The new
               sentencing system will incorporate these mandatory penalties, thereby excluding
               local narcotics offenses from the mandate that sentences be similar to those that
               would be imposed upon comparable offenders in the Federal system.

4.3.8.               The Board will not have the authority to provide for capital punishment under any
                     law applicable exclusively in D.C.

4.3.9.               The Board will have seven voting members. All the members of the Board shall
                     have knowledge and responsibilities with respect to criminal justice matters. The
                     Attorney General (or her designee) will chair the Board. The other members
                     will include two judges of the Superior Court for. the District of Columbia and
                     one representative each of the following entities: the D.C. Council, the Executive
                     Branch of the D.C. Government, the D.C. Public Defender Service, and the U.S.
                     Attorney for the District of Columbia. One representative each of the D.C.
                     Corporation Counsel and BOP will serve as non-voting, ex officio members.

4.3.10. An affirmative vote of at least six Board members will be necessary to promulgate the
               sentencing system.

4.3.11. In developing the sentencing system, the Board will hold two or more public hearings,
               review other sentencing guideline system models, consult with sentencing reform
               experts, and solicit written comments from the public.

4.3.12. If the Board fails to promulgate a sentencing system within 18 months, the Board will
               terminate, and the Attorney General will develop a sentencing system to be
               transmitted to the D.C. Council for approval. Ninety days after the Attorney
               General transmits the sentencing system to the D.C. Council, the sentencing
               system, its guidelines, amendments, and repeals will become effective, unless the
               Council disapproves the system in its entirety and Congress, in tum, does not
               approve it.

4.3.13. The Board will have the mandate to ensure that the sentencing system it establishes,
             among other things:

         4.3.13.1.          will result in sentences for those convicted of D.C. felony offenses similar
                            to those that would be imposed upon comparable offenders convicted of
                            comparable offenses in the Federal system;

         4.3.13.2.          will result in sentences that reflect the seriousness of the offense and
                            provide for just punishment, afford adequate deterrence to potential future
                            criminal conduct of the offender and others, and provide the defendant
                            with needed educational or vocational training, medical care, and other
                            correctional treatment;

         4.3.13.3.          will provide certainty ·and fairness in meeting the purposes of sentencing,
                            avoiding unwarranted sentencing disparities among similar defendants,
                            while maintaining sufficient flexibility to permit individualized sentences;

                                                      21
                                             Hex·O!Imp Conversion


       4.3.13.4.      will take into account the high volume of sentencing proceedings in the
                      D.C. Superior Court as bearing upon the degree of complexity of the
                      sentencing system; and

       4.3.13.5.     will ensure that the system is neutral as to the race, sex, marital status,
                     ethnic origin, religious affiliation, national origin, creed, socioeconomic
                     status, and sexual orientation of offenders, if not related to the commission
                     of the offense.

4.3.14. As part of the sentencing system, the Board will develop binding guidelines for use in
               determining the sentence to be imposed upon convicted felons. The guidelines
               will specify:

       4.3.14.1.     when to impose a sentence of probation, a fine, or a term of imprisonment
                     and the appropriate amount or length, thereof, as well as intermediate
                     sanctions;

       4.3.14.2.     when to impose a term of supervised release following imprisonment, and
                     the appropriate length, thereof; and

       4.3.14.3.     whether multiple sentences to terms of imprisonment should run
                     concurrently or consecutively.

4.3.15. Ninety days after promulgation of the sentencing system, the Board will be terminated.
               There will be established a successor, Federally funded agency to amend the
               guidelines as necessary to achieve the purposes of the Act. The D.C. Council
               may recommend to Congress whether or not these amendments should be
               approved. However, the amendments will take effect as prescribed by the
               successor agency, unless they are modified or disapproved by Congress. The
               successor agency will have no powers to revise the D.C. Code but will
               recommend changes to the Code as may be necessary to further the purposes of
               the Act.

4.3.16. The Superior Court for the District of Columbia, D.C. Department of Corrections, and
              any other agency will submit information about convicted felons as required by
              the Board and the U.S. Department of Justice. This would permit an assessment
              of the extent to which sentences imposed by the Superior Court of the District of
              Columbia are similar to those imposed for comparable offenders in the Federal
              system. The results of this assessment would be used by the Board in developing
              the new sentencing system for D.C.

4.3.17. Four years after the enactment of the new sentencing system, there will be an evaluation
               to determine the extent to which the sentencing system has succeeded in
               accomplishing the goals set forth in the Act.

S.i.   Outline of Legislation

The Federal government intends to support legislation that will (A) provide the District
government with a new vehicle to spur economic development in the District of Columbia, and
capitalize the new vehicle with a $50 million grant; (B) provide $250 million in tax incentives to
encourage business investment both downtown and in distressed communities, and to help
businesses increase employment of residents of the District of Columbia; and (C) improve the
District government's borrowing authority by removing impediments in its borrowing statutes so
that the District government will have the same ability to finance projects as other cities have.

       5.i.a.   The Economic Development Corporation

                Overview. The legislation will include congressional findings recognizing the
                need for economic development in the District of Columbia, the unique
                disadvantages that the District government faces, when compared to other cities,
                in its efforts to finance economic development from local tax revenues because
                Federal law limits the tax base and taxing authority of the District government,
                and the national interest in having the Federal government assist the District of
                Columbia in becoming a safe, clean, and beautiful city worthy of the seat of the
                Federal government, which is a goal that will be realized only through the
                development of a strong local economy.

                The legislation will state the purposes for the part of the legislation pertaining to
                economic development, which focus on expanding employment and business
                opportunities in the District of Columbia, increasing the rate of private sector
                investment in the District of Columbia, developing comprehensive strategies for
                the economic development of the District of Columbia, assisting the
                implementation of projects throughout the District of Columbia, and enhancing
                the institutional capacity of the District government to accomplish and realize
                economic development.

                The legislation will establish the District of Columbia Economic Development
                Corporation (the Corporation) under Article I, section 8, clause 17 of the
                Constitution of the United States. The Corporation will be established as a
                corporate body and instrumentality of the District government, and will not be
                part of the Federal government.

                Board of Directors. Officers and Employees. Reports. The powers of the
                Corporation will be vested in a board of directors (the Board) consisting of nine
                voting members. Six of the Board members will be appointed by the President in
                consultation with the Congress. Of those six, four will be selected from the
                for-profit business community, such .as persons involved in real estate
                development, retailing, manufacturing, construction, or financial services, and two
                will be selected from community-based organizations.               The eligibility
                requirements for being appointed as one of the six appointed Board members will
                be that the person maintains a primary residence or has a primary place of

                                                 25

business in the District of Columbia and that the person not be an officer or
employee of the Federal government or the District government. The remaining
three Board members will be ex officio members. Of those three, one will be
chosen by the President from a Federal agency, a second will be senior officer of
the District government chosen by the Mayor, and a third will be senior officer of
the District government chosen by the Council. The appointed Board members
will have six-year terms, with four of the first six appointed Board members
having shorter, staggered terms. The President will have the authority to remove
any appointed Board member for cause. Each ex officio member will serve at the
pleasure of the official who designated that member. The President will choose
one of the appointed Board members to serve as the Chair ofthe Board.

The Board will appoint a Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation who will
direct and supervise the general management and administrative affairs of the
Corporation as prescribed by the Board. The Chief Executive Officer will
appoint a Chief Financial Officer and a General Counsel with the approval of the
Board, and may appoint additional officers and employees as appropriate. The
Board will fix the pay for the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer,
and the General Counsel; the Chief Executive Officer will fix the pay for all other
officers and employees of the Corporation. No officer or employee of the
Corporation will be paid more than the Executive Schedule level III annual pay
rate under 5 U.S.C. 5312. Neither the Civil Service laws governing competitive
appointments, position classifications, and pay rates, nor the District of Columbia
employment laws governing appointments and salaries, will apply to the
appointment of the officers and employees of the Corporation. The Corporation
will be authorized to establish its own employment benefit plans; however, an
employee of the Federal government or the rest of the District government who
leaves the Federal government or the rest of the District government to work for
the Corporation may remain enrolled in the retirement, life insurance, and health
insurance programs of the Federal government or the rest of the District
government, as the case may be, and the Corporation will make the required
employer contributions to those programs. No political test or qualification may
be used with regard to hiring or taking any other personnel action regarding the
officers and employees ofthe Corporation

The Corporation will be prohibited from spending any funds to influence
legislation or in connection with any political campaign on behalf of or in opposi-
tion to any candidate for public office.

 The Corporation will submit a report by April 1 of each year to the Mayor, the
 Council, the Authority, the President, the Congress, and the public concerning its -
'operations for the prior fiscal year. This annual report will include a financial
 statement audited by an independent auditor.

The Corporation will prepare an annual performance plan for the operations of the
Corporation. The elements of the performance plan will include performance

                                  26

goals, perfonnance benchmarks to measure the Corporation's perfonnance results,
and a methodology for comparing perfonnance results with perfonnance goals.
The annual report of the Corporation will also include infonnation regarding the
perfonnance results achieved by the Corporation in the fiscal year being reported
compared with the perfonnance goals established in the perfonnance plan for that
year.

The Corporation will engage an independent consultant to perfonn in fiscal years
2001 and 2005 an evaluation of the efficacy of the authorities granted and the
changes in law made in the tax provisions of the legislation as aids to the
Corporation in carrying out the purposes of the legislation. The Corporation will
submit a report to the Mayor, the Council, the Authority, the President, and the
Congress on the conclusions of these evaluations 30 days after the close of the
fiscal years in which the evaluation is perfonned.

The Corporation will establish written rules and procedures to ensure that the
solicitation, acceptance, use, and disposition of gifts, grants, and subsidies will not
reflect unfavorably upon the ability of the Corporation, or of any its officers or
employees, to carry out the responsibilities of the Corporation in a fair and objec-
tive manner. The Corporation will establish written rules and procedures to
ensure that the procurement of goods and services by the Corporation and the
acquisition and disposition of property by the Corporation will produce the best
value for the Corporation, in the judgment of the Corporation, and will not reflect
unfavorably upon the ability of the Corporation, or of any its officers or
employees, to carry out the functions of the Corporation in a fair and objective
manner. The procedures governing dispositions of property by the Corporation
will include public notice.

General Powers. The Corporation will have numerous general powers, including
the power to sue and be sued; to adopt, amend, and repeal bylaws and procedures
for its governance; to make and perfonn. contracts; to solicit, accept, use, and
dispose of gifts of money, services, and property from any source; and to lease,
purchase, use, improve, and dispose of any property. Some of the powers of the
Corporation will be limited by other provisions of the legislation, such as the
power to employ officers and employees and to fix their salaries and the power to
enter into financial assistance agreements. The Corporation will also be granted
the power to exercise any other power usually possessed by public enterprises or
private corporations perfonning similar functions that is not inconsistent with
applicable Federal of District law.

Economic Development Plans. The Corporation will be directed initially to give
priority to reviewing and evaluating existing economic development plans for the
District of Columbia, followed by the development of a comprehensive strategic
plan for carrying out the purposes of the part of the legislation pertaining to
economic development. The Corporation will be required to consult with the rest
of the District government in strategic planning.

Financial Assistance. The Corporation will be authorized to provide financial
assistance for economic development projects directly or in participation with any
other source of financing, private or public, including any agency or
instrumentality of the rest of the District government. Financial assistance may
take the form of a loan, extension of credit, equity investment, grant, fixed
contribution to a loan loss or debt service reserve fund, or any other similar form
of financing or refinancing, but may not be a guarantee, insurance of payment of
principal and interest, or any other similar form of credit support that provides
recourse to the Corporation, and may include an exchange, lease, or sale ofland.

The total amount of financial assistance that will be permitted to be provided or
committed under the legislation will be limited to the total amount of the capital
and land of the Corporation, and financial assistance to anyone person or project
will be limited to 15 percent of the total capital and land of the Corporation.
There also will be a procedure for waiving the limits on the amount of financial
assistance to one person or project.
The Corporation will be authorized to establish one or more for-profit or
not-for-profit corporate subsidiaries. No subsidiary of the Corporation will have
any power that the Corporation does not have. The Corporation will also be
authorized to establish one or more revolving funds for providing different types
of financial assistance. Funds from any source, including returns on financial
assistance, will be permitted to be deposited into any revolving fund and
transferred between revolving funds, and will be available for providing additional
financial assistance and for paying the expenses of the Corporation.

The Corporation will establish criteria for selecting the type of financial assistance
that is most appropriate for different types of economic development projects,
including criteria that include a preference for the type of financial assistance that
represents the least commitment of the capital of the Corporation.

The Corporation will also establish procedures to provide the rest of the District
government with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on economic
development projects to which the Corporation is considering providing financial
assistance.

The Corporation will consider certain factors when reviewing applications for
financial assistance, such as the likelihood the project can be expected to create or
retain private sector jobs in the District of Columbia, the contribution of the
project to the economy of the District, whether the project will serve the interests
of the community where it will be located, whether the project is consistent with
the comprehensive strategic plan developed by the Corporation, and whether the
project will improve links between the economy of the District of Columbia and
the economy of the region.

The legislation will establish conditions precedent to the Corporation's approval
of any application for financial assistance for any economic development project,
such as the Corporation determining that there is a strong probability that the
project would not be undertaken without financial assistance from the Corpora-
tion, that financial assistance from the Corporation will not compete with or
supplant funds from sources other than the Corporation, including the rest of the
District government, that are otherwise available for the project, and that the rest
of the District government has been provided a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on the project. A project's compliance with applicable Federal and
District of Columbia law will also be a condition precedent to the Corporation's
approval of the project's application for financial assistance.

Eminent Domain. The Corporation will be authorized to exercise, in the name of
the District of Columbia, the power of eminent domain to aid in carrying out the
purposes of the part of the legislation relating to economic development. The.
provisions of the District of Columbia Code that govern condemnation
proceedings for the acquisition of property by the Mayor shall apply to the
Corporation.
Regulatory Relief The Corporation will be authorized to request that the
Authority use its powers under section 103 of the District of Columbia Financial
Responsibility and Management Assistance Act of 1995 to order appropriate
officers or employees of appropriate regulatory authorities of the District
government to give expedited consideration to applications for District of
Columbia regulatory licenses, permits, and approvals of economic development
projects provided financial assistance by the Corporation. The Corporation will
be authorized to request the Mayor to cause any delayed or denied permit, license,
or approval to be issued or to demonstrate good cause for the delay or denial. If
the Mayor does not cause the necessary license, permit, or approval to be issued or
demonstrate in writing good cause for the delay or denial within 30 days of the
Corporation's request, the Corporation will be authorized to request that the
Authority use its powers to order appropriate officers or employees of appropriate
regulatory authorities of the D.C. government to take the action necessary to cause
the license, permit, or approval to be issued.

AI!Propriations. The legislation will authorize appropriations of $50,000,000 in
no-year funds to carry out the purposes of the economic provisions of the
legislation in fiscal year 1998. The Corporation will be required to provide at
least $20,000,000 or 40 percent of the amount appropriated, whichever is less,
either directly to non-profit organizations for job training, placement, and related
activities in those organizations for targeted residents of the District of Columbia,
or to non-profit third-party intermediaries to promote and finance such job
training, placement, and related activities in for-profit and not-for-profit
organizations. There will be a procedure for the Corporation to waive the
minimum amount requirement for financial assistance to non-profit organizations
for job training and placement.

Project Revenue Obligations. The Corporation will be given authority to issue
project revenue obligations, including refunding obligations, and to use the
proceeds to provide financial assistance for economic development projects. The
Corporation will have the duty to consult with the rest of the District government
so that the Corporation and the rest of the District government together make the
most effective use of available resources and authorities, avoid to the extent
practicable competition and duplication of efforts, and maximize the benefit to the
District of Columbia.

The project revenue obligations issued by the Corporation will be special obliga-
tions of the Corporation payable solely from the revenues, assets, and property of
the economic development project for which financial assistance is provided, to
the extent such revenues, assets, and property are pledged therefor. The
resolution of the Board authorizing the issuance of any project revenue obligations
will be permitted to prescribe such matters as the form and terms of the
obligations, the method of issuance, the rights and remedies of the holders, and
the security for the obligations. The Board will be permitted to authorize the Chief
Executive Officer to enter into agreements providing security for the repayment of
the project revenue obligations that the Corporation issues. The Corporation will
be permitted to establish reserve funds for the project revenue obligations and to
manage those reserve funds.

The amount of any project revenue obligations that the Corporation issues will be
excluded from the limitations on the amount of general obligation bonds that the
District of Columbia is authorized to issue. The resolution of the Corporation
authorizing the issuance of project revenue bonds will not be considered to be an
act of the Council subject to the 30-day congressional review period provided in
section 602(c) of the District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental
Reorganization Act. The issuance by the Corporation of project revenue bonds
shall not be considered to be a borrowing of money by the District government for
purposes of the prior certification requirement of section 204 of the District of
Columbia Project Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Act of
1995. Project revenue obligations issued by the Corporation will not be obliga-
tions of the District of Columbia or the United States, and neither the faith and
credit nor the taxing power of the District of Columbia nor the full faith and credit
of the United States will be pledged for the payment of any project revenue
obligation issued by the Corporation. Each project revenue obligation issued by
the Corporation will be required to contain on its face a statement that effect.

Other Matters. All funds and revenues of the Corporation that are not required to
be otherwise disposed will be held and invested by the Corporation or deposited
with and invested by a custodian selected by the Corporation.

The Corporation will not have any power to impose or collect taxes or to pledge
or create any lien on taxes imposed or collected by the rest of the District
government.

  Any action against the Corporation or any action otherwise arising out of or
. pertaining to the part of the legislation relating to the Corporation must be brought
  in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, with appeals
  heard in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.

 Any petition for review of a regulation or procedure adopted by the Corporation
 under the legislation with respect to providing financial assistance must be filed
 within 90 days after the date of publication of notice of adoption of the regulation
 or, if the permitted petition for review is based solely on grounds arising after
 such ninetieth day, within 90 days of the date on which the grounds arise. No
 judicial review of a regulation with respect to providing financial assistance will
 be permitted in a proceeding reviewing any determination by the Corporation to
 make, deny, or take no action with respect to an application for financial
 assistance.

 The provisions of the District of Columbia Code governing procurement,
 disposition of property, and open meetings will not apply to the Corporation.

 The Corporation will be exclusively administered by its Board and not the Mayor
 nor the Council.

 In any action brought by or on behalf of the Corporation, or against the Corpo-
 ration, the Corporation will be permitted to be represented by the counsel that it
 selects.

 Dissolution. The Corporation will not be permitted to award or commit to award
 any new financial assistance or to issue any new revenue obligations after
 September 30, 2007. The Corporation will be permitted to meet existing
 financial assistance commitments to provide financial assistance under
 commitments entered into on or before September 30,2007.

 Beginning on October 1, 2007, the Board will be required to diligently pursue an
 orderly termination of the affairs of the Corporation on or before September 30,
 2010. The corporation will liquidate the assets of the Corporation unless the
 Council elects to have some or all of the Corporation's assets transferred to an
 agency or instrumentality of the rest of the District government. The Corporation
 will be required to transfer the proceeds of all liquidations to the Mayor for
 deposit into such account of the District government as the Mayor determines
 appropriate. The Council will be permitted to direct the Corporation to transfer
 some or all of the assets of the Corporation to an agency or instrumentality of the
 rest of the District government and to direct to Corporation to deposit some or all
 of the moneys of the Corporation (other than moneys reserved to fulfill financial
 assistance commitments) to one or more accounts of the District government.

          If the Board completes the tennination of the affairs of the Corporation on or
          before September 30, 2010, the Board will transfer to the Mayor the moneys of
          the Corporation reserved to fulfill financial assistance commitments, will transfer
          assets and deposit moneys of the Corporation as directed by Council, will transfer
          to the Mayor the balance of the moneys of the Corporation for deposit into such
          account of the District government as the Mayor detennines appropriate, and will
          submit a final report on the Corporation to the Council, the Authority (if it is still
          in operation), the President, and the Congress.

          If the Board has not completed the tennination of the affairs of the Corporation on
          or before September 30, 2010, the Mayor will succeed to all of the powers, assets,
          duties, and liabilities of the Corporation and the Board on October 1, 2010,
          including the duties to complete the termination of the affairs of the Corporation,
          to liquidate or transfer assets of the Corporation and deposit moneys of the
          Corporation, and to submit a final report on the Corporation to the Council, the
          Authority (if it is still in operation), the President, and the Congress.

          For purposes of any outstanding project revenue obligation issued by the
          Corporation on or before October 1, 2070, the District government will be deemed
          to be the issuer after the dissolution of the Corporation.

S.ii.b.          Tax Provisions of the Legislation

          Overview. The legislation will add six new provisions to the Internal Revenue
          Code of 1986 (the Code). These provisions are described below. The new tax
          provisions will take effect on the date the legislation is enacted.

          The District of Columbia Employment Credit. New section 1400A of the Code
          will provide for a tax credit to employers in the District of Columbia that hire
          certain residents of the District of Columbia. The credit will be equal to 40
          percent of up to $10,000 in wages paid to a qualified employee during the
          employee's first year of employment with the employer. Thus, the maximum
          credit per employee will be $4,000. Generally, qualified employees will include
          any individual that meets a residence test, a work-location test, and an income
          test. For purposes of the $10,000 ceiling, certain non-cash benefits such as health
          insurance, educational assistance, and dependant care assistance will be permitted
          to be taken into account.

          To meet the residence test, the employee must reside in the District of Columbia
          and either be a member of one of the Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC)
          targeted groups (including the new food stamp recipient group proposed in the
          President's fiscal year 1998 budget) or live in a population census tract that has a
          poverty rate of 15 percent or more. The work-location test will be satisfied if
          either substantially all of the services provided by the employee for the employer
          during the year are in District of Columbia or the employer's principal place of
          business is in District of Columbia. Thus, for example, an employee of a

                                            32
                           Hex-Dump Conversion

construction company that has its principal place of business in District of
Columbia will qualify even if the employee works on projects in Maryland or
Virginia during the year. The income test, which only will apply if the employee
is not a member of a WOTC targeted group, will be satisfied if the employer does
not expect to pay the employee more than $28,500 during the employee's first year
of employment.

This employment credit will be available with respect to qualified employees
hired after the date of enactment and before October 1, 2002. In addition, the
WOTC and the welfare-to-work tax credit proposed in the President's fiscal year
1998 budget will be extended an additional two years, through September 30,
2002, with respect to individuals who reside in the District of Columbia, satisfy
the work-location test, and are either members of a WOTC targeted group or
long-term family assistance recipients.

Additional Section 179 Expensing. Under current section 179 of the Code,
businesses with less than $200,000 of investments in business equipment and
machinery during a year are eligible to take a current deduction, or "expense," up
to $18,000 of the cost of such property each year, rather than capitalizing that cost
and taking depreciation deductions over several years (the $18,000 annual cap
increases gradually to $25,000 between 1998 and 2003). The $18,000 is reduced
for each dollar of investment over $200,000, so that no expensing is available for
businesses with annual investments of$218,000 or more.

Under new section 1400B of the Code, businesses that have a significant portion
of their activities in higher poverty areas in the District of Columbia and that have
a work force at least 35 percent of which is made up of District of Columbia
residents, will be eligible for expensing for an additional $20,000 of business
equipment and machinery acquired each year. In addition, to the extent the
equipment and machinery is to be used in the District of Columbia, an expanded
ceiling will be available to businesses acquiring up to $400,000 in such property
during the year (the $38,000 amount available in 1997 phases out for businesses
with between $400,000 and $476,000 in investment). For purposes of this
incentive (as well as the Tax-exempt Economic Development Bonds discussed
below), higher poverty areas of the District of Columbia will mean any population
census tract with a poverty rate of 15 percent or more.

This additional expensing will be available for business equipment and machinery
place~ in service between January 1,1998, and December 31, 2002.

Tax-exempt Economic Development Bonds. New section 1400C·ofthe Code will
make a new category of tax-exempt, private activity bonds available in District of
Columbia. Under these rules, the bond proceeds will be permitted to be used to
finance a broader range of business property --including commercial and retail
facilities, as well as the underlying land --than under the laws currently applicable
to the District of Columbia. The businesses eligible to borrow the proceeds of

                                  33
                                      Hex-Dump Conversion

         these bonds will be limited to those that have a significant portion of their
         activities in higher poverty areas of the District of Columbia and that have a work
         force at least 35 percent of which is made up of District of Columbia residents
         (i.e., the businesses eligible for additional section 179 expensing except that there
         is no cap on the annual investment in business equipment and machinery). The
         aggregate amount of these bonds per eligible District of Columbia business will
         not be allowed to exceed $15 million, and these bonds will be subject to the
         District of Columbia's annual $150 million private activity bond volume cap.

         These special tax-exempt bond provisions will apply to bonds issued after the date
         of enactment and before January 1,2003. During that period, the legislation will
         allocate to the Corporation 50 percent of applicable State ceiling on the authority
         of the District government to issue private activity bonds in each calendar year
         under section 141 of the Code.

         Allocable Tax Credits for Equity Investments in and Loans to District of
         Columbia Businesses.          The Economic Development Corporation (The
         Corporation) will be authorized by new section 1400D of the Code to allocate $95
         million in nonrefundable credits to taxpayers that make equity investments in and
         loans to District of Columbia businesses. The equity credit, which will not be
         permitted to exceed 25 percent of the amount invested, will be available with
         respect to investments in corporations or partnerships. This credit will be subject
         to recapture if the equity interest is disposed of within 5 years. The lender credit
         will be available with respect to loans made to District of Columbia businesses for
         purchasing depreciable tangible property and any functionally related and
         subordinate land. The maximum amount of the credit that the Corporation will
         be authorized to allocate with respect to a loan is 25 percent of the principal
         amount of the loan (measured by the cost of the property purchased). The
         Corporation will allocate the credits pursuant to criteria it establishes, including
         the degree to which the business borrowing the funds or receiving the equity will
         provide job opportunities for low-and moderate-income residents, and whether the
         business receiving the loan or equity infusion is located in a high-poverty area of
         the District of Columbia.

             These credits may be allocated and claimed between January 1, 1998, and
         December 31,2002.

              Status of The Corporation for Federal Income Tax Purposes. New section
         l400F of the Code will clarify the status of the Corporation for federal income tax
         purposes so that, for example, charitable contributions to the Corporation will be
         deductible and the Corporation will have the ability to issue tax-exempt bonds.

5.i.c.   Improvements to the District goveinment's borrowing authority.

              The Federal government will support legislation that will remove impediments in
              the District government's borrowing statutes so that the District government will
              have the same ability to finance projects as other cities have.

       plan.

5.3.   The District government will support a legislative allocation to the Corporation of 50
       percent of the applicable State ceiling on the authority of the District government to issue
       private activity bonds in each calendar year under section 141 of the Internal Revenue
       Code.

5.6.   The District government will support legislation that provides that all powers, rights,
       assets, duties, obligations, and liabilities of the Corporation will transfer to the District
       government upon the Corporation's dissolution

       funding the District of Columbia share of operating expenses for any transit activities.

6.1.10. The Secretary shall continue to provide oversight and technical assistance to the District

6.2.    District of Columbia Responsibilities. The District of Columbia agrees that:

6.2.1. The District of Columbia shall continue to be responsible for providing police services on

       funds on local streets, highways, and roadways (except alleys) does not relieve the
       District of Columbia of the responsibility for the non-federal matching share. The use of
       other Federal-aid highway apportioned funds by the District of Columbia, other than as
       provided herein, also requires a non-Federal matching share.

6.2.4. Beginning on October 1, 1997, the District of Columbia is relieved of the responsibility to
       provide the non-Federal match for NHS projects that are funded by the Secretary with
       monies made available for NHS projects under this Act. The relief from providing the
       non-federal match shall not include those projects that were approved by FHWA prior to
       October 1, 1997 for which Federal-aid highway funds have been obligated. The District

       and any obligation authority for any such projects transferred to the Secretary for project
       administration, oversight, or contracting.

6.2.5. The District of Columbia shall continue to be responsible for any liability incurred on the
       basis of the activities of the District of Columbia, its agencies, or personnel as a result of

6.2.6. The District of Columbia shall cooperate with the Federal Highway Administration in its
       technical assistance efforts in order to assure that the District of Columbia can reassume
       its NHS responsibilities by September 30,2003. The goal of the effort shall be to satisfy
       the April 1996 findings of FHWA's review of the organizational capacity of the District

7.1.1. The IRS shall administer and enforce the District's individual income and employment
       taxes.

7.1.2. The District shall continue to administer its unemployment benefits program.

7.2.   Tax Codes

7.2.1. The IRS will administer the District's existing individual income and employment tax
       laws. The only provision the IRS cannot administer is the District's refundable property
       tax credit. If the District wishes to retain this provision, it must be transferred to its real
       estate tax administration.

7.2.2. All of the administrative, procedural, and enforcement provisions of the Internal Revenue
       Code of 1986 and related statutes will govern IRS administration of District taxes. The
       District will have to amend its own tax code to achieve this to the satisfaction of the
       Secretary of the Treasury.

7.2.3. To avoid the possibility of any inconsistent interpretations of similar provisions, the
       District will have to amend its definitional provisions to conform them to the Internal
       Revenue Code to the satisfaction of the Secretary of the Treasury.

7.2.4. The District must notify the Secretary of the Treasury of any future changes to its
       individual income and employment tax laws. The Secretary may object if, in his
       judgement, the prospective change would prove overly burdensome to the IRS, in which
       case such change shall not be administered or enforced by the IRS. If the Secretary does
       not object within 60 days after notification, the IRS will administer the provision within a
       reasonable time after enactment.

7.3.   Transfers to the District

7.3 .1. The IRS will set up separate accounting and deposit systems for its collections of District
        taxes. The District must, in turn, identify the person and/or office authorized to receive
        transfers of collected amounts and set up related deposit accounts.




7.4.   Effective Date
7.4.1. The IRS administration of District taxes shall be prospective, starting on January 1 of the
       calendar year that is at least 18 months after the Secretary certifies that the District of
       Columbia has met the conditions set forth in the Memorandum of Understanding between
       the United States and the District of Columbia.
