TEXT:
AS previously noted, we hope to meet on Monday afternoon with
representatives of Justice and the Department of Transportation, and the
White House Counsel's Office to resolve Justice's constitutional concerns
regarding Amtrak's board.   This now stands as the sole remaining
impediment to clearance of the Administration's Amtrak reform proposal for
submission to Congress.

This meeting is now scheduled for 4:00 p.m. in room 9001.   Thanks.
