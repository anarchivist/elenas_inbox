                                      Q&A for 117 Education Event
                                       INTERNAL USE ONLY

     Q. You have proposed increasing this fund from $40 million to $600 million in a
     two-year period. Is this huge increase warranted?

     A. Today, there is an overwhelming demand for after-school programs. Over 28 million
     school-age children have both parents or their only parent in the workforce. At least 5 million
     children --and possibly as many as 15 million --are left alone at home each week.      Experts
     agree that school-age children who are unsupervised during the hours after school are far more
     likely to use alcohol, drugs, and tobacco, commit crimes, receive poor grades, and drop out of
     school than those who are involved in supervised, constructive activities. Statistics also show
     that most juvenile crime takes place between the hours of 2 and 8 pm, and that children are also
     at much greater risk of being the victim of crime during the hours after school. The nationwide
     demand for expanded after-school programs has made the 21st Century Community
     Learning Center program one of the most highly competitive programs ever managed by
     the U.S. Department of Education. In the Education Department's last completed grant
     competition for this program, the Department received nearly 2,000 applications,
     requesting more than $550 million to fund programs in over 6,000 schools in every state in
     the nation.

     Q.     Are these after-school programs effective?

     A. Last year the U.S. Departments of Education and Justice released a report, "Safe and
     Smart: Making the After-School Hours Count, " that documented the effectiveness of quality
     after-school and summer programs. The report shows that quality after-school and summer
     programming can make a difference in student safety and achievement, students' test scores,
     their attendance, and their behavior. They can also keep kids from experimenting with risky
     behaviors, such as alcohol, drug, and tobacco use. After-school programs are not only good
     for education, they make sense to the American public.

       Q.   What is social promotion?

      A. "Social promotion" means allowing students to continue to pass through school with their
     peers regardless of whether or not the students meet academic standards.

     Q.     How much of the funds for this program are going to go to districts that end social
            promotion?                                     .

     A. The 21 st Century Community Learning Center program distributes funds through a grants
     process. As part of that process, school districts that end social promotion will receive a priority
     in the grant awards. Because we do not know how many applicants end social promotion or
     who will receive funds, we will not know until the grants are awarded how much money will go
                                                                           Hex-Dump ConversIon

to schools that end social promotion.

Q;     If the President believes ending social promotion is so important, why not make this
       a condition of funds for school districts that receive 21st Century Community
       Learning Center grants?
A. The policy the President announced today can be implemented without new authorization
from Congress; however, to condition all funds on ending social promotion require new
authorization from Congress. Nevertheless, the President is exploring other proposals to end
social promotion as part of the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.

 Q.    Is the solution to hold back failing students?

No. Students who are held back often fall further behind. And students who are promoted
when they aren't ready are harmed as well. The right solution is to give students the help they
need to meet the standard the first time. That's what the President's proposal does.

 Q.    Won't efforts to raise standards and end social promotion end up hurting
       disadvantaged students?

A. On the contrary, it is the current policies of social promotion and retention that are hurting
disadvantaged students. The results of both policies are unacceptably high dropout rates,
especially for poor and minority students, and inadequate knowledge and skills for students.
Neither practice closes the learning gap for low-achieving stud'ents, and neither practice is an
appropriate response to the academic needs of students unable to master required coursework.
We can best assist disadvantaged children if schools provide adequate opportunities for students
to meet expectations on time and pursue effective strategies to assist those students who need
extra assistance, including ensuring that all students have access to good teachers, using data to
identify at-risk students before they fall too far behind and providing extended learning time for
children who need extra help.
