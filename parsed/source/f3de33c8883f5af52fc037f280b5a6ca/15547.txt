TEXT:
House Judiciary staff (R's and D's) expect the Volunteer Liability bill to
be considered by the House on the suspension calendar next Tuesday, 5/20.
Currently, the House is scheduled to ,consider the Judiciary Committee bill
and not the Senate-passed version of the bill. In preparation for the
House floor, I would suggest a SAP that is drafted to clearly distinguish
this legislation from anything that we might face in a products bill.
Peter
