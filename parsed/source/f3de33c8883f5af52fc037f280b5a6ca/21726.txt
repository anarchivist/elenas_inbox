TEXT:
The Department of Labor and INS have finished work on the 1-9 MOU.   The
significant part of this agreement is that the DOL will only inspect
employer compliance with verification requirements in "directed"
investigations (i.e., cases that do not arise from a complaint alleging
violations of labor standards). The goal of this agreement is to avoid
chilling the reporting of worksite wage/hour violations by workers who
fear the INS.

Maria has pressed the DOL and INS to complete this by C.O.B. tomorrow.
According to INS, they and DOL have not decided whether they want to
invite press to witness the signing or whether they would prefer to
execute the agreement privately and issue a press release.

I am faxing you a copy of the MOU (very close to final, except for minor
editing).  Please let me know if you have a view reo the roll-out.
