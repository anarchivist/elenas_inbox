TEXT:
Here are 2 items.  If you want to hold the second item until we are futher
along in the process, and have had a chance to discuss in more detail with
you and Bruce, that will be ok with me.

We are preparing for a major endorsement of your national testing
initiative on Wednesday April 2. At a roundtable discussion, Delaine
Eastin, California Superintendent of Schools, will announce that
California will participate in the national testing initiative. Together
with the committments already received from Maryland, Michigan and North
Carolina, this means that states serving approximately 20% of the nation's
students will participate in this initiative.  In addition, John Dorr,
managing partner of the venture capital firm Kleiner, Perkins, Caulfield
and Byers, will announce that more than 100 high-tech CEO's are endorsing
your testing initiative and will urge every governor and state education
official to' have their state participate.



DPC and Education Department staff (Mike Cohen and Mike Smith) will begin
consulting with governors, key Members of Congress and staff, and others,
to determine how best to establish an advisory process for the testing
initiative that will provide public credibility and political support for
the testing initiative, without delaying the very tight deadline for
developing the tests.
