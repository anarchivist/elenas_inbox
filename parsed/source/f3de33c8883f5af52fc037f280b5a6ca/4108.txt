TEXT:
This is what I'm g1v1ng to Gene for him to review (along with your
document).  I prepared it in a way such that if you guys went ahead with
yours, this would complement it (or contradict it, depending on how you
look at it). My view is that it would be best to be late and have
something that is joint NEC-DPC, but I can't say yet when Gene will be
ready for that.
