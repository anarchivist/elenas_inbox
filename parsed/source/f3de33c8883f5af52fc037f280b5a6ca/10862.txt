                            LOCATION: Presidential Hall
                                             Room 450, Old Executive Office Building
                            BRIEFING TIME: 9:45am - 10: 1Oam
                            EVENT TIME:      10:15am - 11:15am
                            FROM:            Bruce Reed


I.    PURPOSE

      To highlight the successes of welfare reform and call upon Congress to pass a new set of
      welfare-to-work initiatives in your budget.

II.   BACKGROUND

      You will announce today a new package of budget initiatives to ensure that those
      remaining on welfare make a successful transition to work. This package includes: a $1
      billion extension ofthe Welfare-to-Work Program, with a new focus on increasing
      employment oflow-income fathers; a 50 percent increase in welfare-to-work housing
      vouchers; and a 100 percent increase in welfare-to-work transportation funding. You
      will also announce that welfare rolls have declined by 44 percent since you took office
      and that the Welfare to Work Partnership now has 10,000 members.

      Welfare-to-Work Funds with a Focus on Fathers
      Your $1 billion Welfare-to-Work initiative will help 200,000 long-term welfare recipients
      in high-poverty areas move into lasting unsubsidized employment. It is an extension of
      the two-year $3 billion Welfare-to-Work program you secured in the Balanced Budget
      Act. The initiative, as reauthorized, will provide at least $150 million to ensure that
      every state helps fathers fulfill their responsibilities by working, paying child
      support, and playing a responsible part in their children's lives. Under this
      proposal, states and communities will use a minimum of20 percent of their formula
      funds to provide job placement and job retention assistance to low-income fathers who
      sign personal responsibility contracts committing them to work and pay child support.
      This effort will further increase child support collections, which have risen 80 percent
      since you took office, from $8 billion in 1992 to $14.4 billion in 1998. Remaining funds
      will go toward assisting long-term welfare recipients with the greatest barriers to
      employment to move into lasting jobs. The reauthorized program also will double the
                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion
welfare-to-work funding available for tribes.

The Department of Labor will announce today the availability of $240 million in
competitive grants from the current $3 billion Welfare-to-Work program. These funds
will support innovative local welfare-to-work strategies for individuals with limited
English proficiency, disabilities, substance abuse problems, or a history of domestic
violence.

Transportation and Housing for Families Moving From Welfare to Work
You also will announce today that your budget will contain $580 million for welfare
to work housing vouchers and transportation assistance to help those on welfare get
to work and stay employed. Your budget will provide $430 million for 75,000
welfare-to-work housing vouchers, including $144 million in new funds for 25,000
additional vouchers. This is a 50 percent increase over the 50,000 vouchers you secured '
last year. The vouchers will help families move closer to a new job, reduce a long
commute, or secure more stable housing so they can perfonn better on the job. Your
budget will also increase Access to Jobs transportation funding from $75 million to
$150 million, doubling the number of individuals and communities that can receive
transportation assistance. This competitive grant program supports innovative state and
local transportation solutions such as shuttles, van pools, new bus routes, and connector
services to mass transit to help welfare recipients and other low income workers get to
work.

Private Sector Hiring from the Welfare Rolls
You will announce that your budget will include $530 million to extend for one year the
Welfare to Work and Work Opportunity Tax Credits to encourage more employers to hire
welfare recipients and other disadvantaged individuals. Already, in response to your
challenge two years ago in the State ofthe Union, 10,000 companies have joined the
Welfare to Work Partnership and hired, retained, and promoted hundreds ofthousands of
fonner welfare recipients. Forty-two percent of these companies are very small
businesses (25 or fewer employees), while four percent are very large businesses (3,000
or more employees).

  Welfare Rolls Decline as More Recipients go to Work
  You will release state-by-state data showing that welfare caseloads are at their lowest
  level in 30 years and that the welfare rolls have fallen by nearly half since you took office.
    Since January 1993, 36 states have had caseload declines of more than 40 percent and
, nationwide the rolls have fallen by 44 percent, from 14.1 million to just below 8 million.
  Recent information released by the Department of Health and Human Services also
  shows that the percentage of welfare recipients working has tripled since 1992, that an
  estimated 1.5 million people who were on welfare in 1997 were working in 1998, and
  that all states met the first overall work participation rates required under the welfare
  refonn law.
