TEXT:
FYI. Bennie Thompson's office says CBC is withholding support from the
Fazio bill because its non-profit foundation was not included in the
bill.  The CBC couldn't work out a deal with the Hispanic caucus in time
on the issue.  CBC thinks they will have a deal within a couple of days,
however, so to the extent we think this is a .bad idea we should propose an
alternative.

(You may know this already as well, but according to Thompson, Fazio
accepted the idea of a lookback penalty gauged to improvements in each
minority group) .
