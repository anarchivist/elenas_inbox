                   NEW CIVIL RIGHTS ENFORCEMENT INITIATIVE
                                 January 19, 1998

The Vice President today announced a package of civil rights enforcement initiatives that places
new emphasis on prevention and non-litigation remedies for discrimination and strengthens civil
rights agencies' ability to enforce anti-discrimination law. The plan promotes prevention by
providing increased resources for compliance reviews and technical assistance, and offers an
alternative to expensive litigation by funding a dramatic expansion of alternative dispute
resolution (ADR) mechanisms. The plan also sets specific performance goals for the EEOC to
speed processing of complaints and reduce case backlog, and provides for greater coordination
across federal agencies and offices. The Clinton Administration's Fiscal Year 1999 balanced
budget contains $602 million for civil rights enforcement agencies and offices -- an increase of
$86 million, or more than 16 percent, over last year's funding.

Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)
The Administration's budget proposal expands the EEOC's ADR program over three years to
allow as many as 70 percent of all complainants to choose mediation, rather than the lengthy
process of investigation and litigation. In the first year of this expansion, the EEOC will provide
ADR in a projected 16,000 cases -- 20 percent of all incoming cases and double the number
currently sent to mediation. The Administration's budget also sets specific performance goals
for the EEOC to reduce its backlog. Through a combination of the increased use of mediation,
improved information technology, and an expanded investigative staff, the EEOC will reduce the
average time it takes to resolve private sector complaints from over 9.4 months to 6 months, and
reduce the backlog of cases from 64,000 to 28,000, by the year 2000.

In total, the budget requests $279 million for the EEOC for FY 1999 -- $37 million or 15 percent
more than the enacted 1998 budget. More than one-third of the proposed increase ($13 million)
goes to expansion of the agency's ADR program.

Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)
The Administration's budget proposes an increased emphasis on reducing discrimination and
ensuring equal opportunity in housing. The highlight of the HUD budget proposal is a targeted
enforcement initiative that will use paired testing -- in which otherwise identical applicants of
different races approach realtors or landlords -- to detect and eliminate housing discrimination.
This systematic, focused testing strategy will allow more accurate measurement and increased
public awareness of housing discrimination, while facilitating enforcement actions against
violators of the fair housing law.

The Administration's budget proposes $52 million for FY 1999 -- $22 million, or about 70
percent, more than last year's funding -- to enable HUD to meet its goals of ensuring equal
opportunity in housing. The new paired testing program is funded at $10 million.

                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion




    Key Aspects of the Budget

    * Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR)
    The plan increases the use of ADR in the Federal government as a voluntary option available to
    parties that seek a non-litigation solution to their cases. The Administration's budget expands
    mediation programs in almost every agency, most notably in the EEOC.

    * Prevention Activities
    The plan emphasizes efforts throughout the government's civil rights agencies and offices to
    prevent discrimination from occurring -- for example, through technical assistance, outreach, and
    compliance reviews. Offices in which such consultative activities will assume added
    importance include the Civil Rights Center of the Department of Labor and the Offices of Civil
    Rights of the Departments of Health and Human Services and Education. The Office of Federal
    Contract Compliance Programs of the Department of Labor will increase compliance reviews by
    10 percent, while reducing burdens on contractors (paperwork, etc.) by at least 30 percent.

     * Improved Coordination
    The plan recognizes the need for enhanced coordination of federal civil rights enforcement policy
    among agencies by highlighting the lead role of the Department of Justice's Civil Rights
    Division, under the direction of Bill Lann Lee, and providing additional resources for
    coordination activities. This emphasis will lead to more consistent enforcement of civil rights
    laws, broader dissemination of best practices, and improved data collection.

                                   January 19, 1998


Q:   What did the Clinton Administration announce with regard to civil rights
     enforcement?

A:   The Clinton Administration announced its Fiscal Year 1999 budget proposal of $602
     million for civil rights enforcement agencies -- this is $86 million or more than 16 percent
     greater than the FY 1998 budget. The President's proposal places new emphasis on
     preventive measures and non-litigation strategies while also strengthening the ability of
     federal agencies to enforce existing civil rights laws. The Administration's budget
     provides for increased use of voluntary Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR), especially
     in the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, so parties can have their cases
     resolved more easily, cheaply, and promptly. The combination of additional resources
     and reforms will enable the EEOC to reduce the average time it takes to resolve a
     complaint from over 9 months to 6 months, and reduce the current backlog from 64,000
     to 28,000, by the year 2000.

Q:   Why is the President proposing these actions?

A:   This budget keeps the President's commitment to ensure equal opportunity for all
     Americans: that no one should be denied such essentials as ajob, a home or a chance at
     an education because of the color of their skin, a disability, their gender or their religion.
      One of the key observations John Hope Franklin, Chairman of the President's Initiative
     on Race, made in his November 30, 1997 letter to the President was that the budgets of
     civil rights agencies have not kept pace with their increased responsibilities. This budget
     seeks to provide sufficient resources and promote management reforms to allow civil
     rights agencies to do their jobs.

Q.   How does this budget relate to the President's Initiative on Race?

A.   John Hope Franklin and the rest of the Race Initiative's Advisory Board urged the
     President to focus on this issue and recommend some specific reforms. Of course, the
     Administration has a consistently strong record in this area, but the Initiative on Race
     made this an especially appropriate year in which to propose systemic reforms to, and
     strengthening of, the nation's civil rights agencies and offices.

Q.   What other agencies are part of the Civil Rights Enforcement Initiative?

A.   The President's budget encourages the use of ADR, prevention activities such as
     education and technical assistance, and improved enforcement across the major civil

Q:     What does the President's budget propose with respect to the Civil Rights Division
       at the Department of Justice?

A:     The Administration's 1999 budget proposes more than a 10 percent increase for the
       Department of Justice -- from $65 million in FY 1998 to $71.6 million in FY 1999. This
       funding will permit the Department to continue its efforts in enforcing the laws that
       provide civil and criminal protections from discrimination, including the Civil Rights Act
       of 1964, the Fair Housing Act, and the Americans with Disabilities Act. The budget also
       includes funds specifically to enhance the Civil Rights Division's role in coordinating

     will be undertaken by Bill Lann Lee, will lead to more consistent enforcement of civil
     rights laws, broader dissemination of best practices, and improved data collection.

Q:   The Congressional Research Service has recently stated that the appointment of Bill
     Lann Lee as Acting Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights is illegal under the
     Vacancies Act. How can you appoint Lee to this position?

A:   The Department of Justice has reviewed this question closely and has determined that the
     Attorney General has the authority to make this appointment.

Q:   What actions is the President taking with respect to appointing a new Chairman of
     the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission?

A:   After the departure of Chairman Gilbert Casellas at the end of last year, the President
     reappointed Paul M. Igasaki to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and
     named him Acting Chairman. Currently, three of the five positions on the Commission
     are filled, which is enough for a quorum. The fourth member to be appointed is for a
     Republican slot, and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) has already indicated
     his choice for the position. The President is working as expeditiously as possible to
     nominate a fifth member of the Commission.

Q:   What does the President's plan do to improve performance at the EEOC?

A:   This plan creates specific goals and invests in new technology and procedures that will
     significantly improve EEOC performance. The initiative's reforms will reduce the
     average time it takes to process a complaint from over 9 months to 6 months, and the
     current backlog from 64,000 to 28,000 cases, by the end of2000. This reduction will be
     achieved in part through technology improvements and in part through a dramatic
     expansion of the Agency's Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) program. The
     Administration's budget proposal expands the EEOC's ADR program over three years to
     allow as many as 70 percent of all complainants to choose mediation, rather than the
     lengthy process of investigation and litigation. In the first year the EEOC will provide
     ADR in a projected 16,000 cases -- 20 percent of all incoming cases and double the
     number currently sent to mediation.

Q:   Is the President's budget simply a way to increase funding for affirmative action
     programs?

A:   No. The President's budget is aimed at preventing and eliminating discrimination through
     emphasizing compliance with and enforcement of the various existing civil rights laws,
     such as the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Fair Housing Act, and the Americans with



                                             3




         Disabilities Act. Affinnative action programs are only one tool (and not the most widely
         used tool) of civil rights enforcement.
    Q.   What does this budget do to improve USDA programs for minority farmers?

    A.   The President's budget proposal increases funding for USDA's civil rights programs from
         $15 million to $19 million to increase human resources management, outreach to
         under-represented customers, involvement of small and disadvantaged businesses in
         USDA programs, conflict resolution activities, and processing complaints brought by
         employees and customers.
