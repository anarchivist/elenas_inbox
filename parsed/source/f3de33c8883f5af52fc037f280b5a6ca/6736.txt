TEXT:
After you left, Sally was very strong in saying we would keep working on
the data collection/EEO -1 issue.  She went so far as to imply that on
April 3rd we would make some kind of public, (though vague and
conservative), announcement that we are doing a working group on the
issue.  Is that further than you would go?

We made clear to EEOC that we will work with them on the issue.
