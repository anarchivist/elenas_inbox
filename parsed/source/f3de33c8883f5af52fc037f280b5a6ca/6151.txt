TEXT:
FYI-- Shirley Watkins at USDA called to urge that the President mention
reauthorization of the child nuitrition programs in the SOTU. OMB has
been opposing their lobbying.  I think that USDA would be satisfied if the
President at least mentioned child nuitrition generally. Just thought you
would want to know . .

Tom and I are going to sit down with OMB later this week to go over USDA's
revised proposal. In addition, we are trying to get some proposals that
would target those child who are hungry or at-risk for hunger. Mary
