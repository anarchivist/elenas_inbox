THE WHITE HOUSE

Office of the Press Secretary

For Immediate Release                                            October 28, 1995

STATEMENT BY THE PRESIDENT
ON THE NINTH CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS DECISION TO FORCE
ADDITIONAL SALES OF OLD GROWTH TIMBER

        I am deeply disappointed in the court's decision to force
the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management to release
these sales of healthy ancient timber.
        My Administration's agreement with the Congress on this
issue was significantly different from the interpretation upheld
this week by the courts. We agreed that the Administration would
not have to violate our standards and guidelines for our Forest
Plan and for forest management in general, but only speed up
sales that met those standards. We do not believe that this
extreme expansion of ancient timber sales was authorized by the
1995 Rescission Act.
        My Administration will actively pursue a legislative remedy
to correct this extreme result.
        At this time, however, there is no choice but to comply with
the court's decision. The decision forces the release of timber
that may lead to grave environmental injury to chinook salmon and
other wildlife, and damage our rivers and streams. This could
jeopardize the livelihoods of thousands of people who depend on
the Pacific Northwest's vibrant commercial and sport fisheries.
        I have directed the Secretaries of Agriculture and the
Interior to work with the companies awarded contracts to seek
changes to mitigate any harm to salmon and other species and
water quality.
        In signing the rescission legislation and in subsequent
directives to my cabinet, I pledged to uphold existing
environmental laws and standards.  I will continue to fight for


those laws and standards.
