      fyi    not sure who is following direct lending post-Bob Shireman, but I
      saw this on the wire.

      WASHINGTON (AP)    It is no cheaper for the government to offer
                             direct student loans than it is to subsidize mostly
      private lenders,
                             according to the Education Department's internal
      watchdog.

                          The Department's inspector general, in a report
      released earlier this
                          month, concludes that when interest rates are high,
      the government pays
                          more to make the loans in its direct-lending program t
      han it gets back
                          from borrowers repaying loans. The report says
      outdated computer
                          equipment is at least one source of the extra costs.

                             However, the report also said it is difficult to fully
      compare the costs of
                             the two loan programs because they vary each year,
      depending on
                             interest rates.

                             Nonetheless, Education Department officials disputed
      the findings,
                             saying, for example, that the report's 1996 and 1997
      figures are outdated
                             and that it makes unfair comparisons between the govern
      ment's actions
                             and how the best private lenders would manage the loan
      program.

                            "Don't believe for a second that the numbers in the
      study are right,"   said
                            Greg Woods, who is in charge of improving management
      of student
                             financial aid programs.



                       Finance officials continue to fight over the two major
types of loans
                       offered to student borrowers . For many years, the
government paid
                       subsidies to private lenders so they would make the
loans. In 1994, the
                       government saying it could save borrowers money by
taking out the
                       middle man started a lending program of its own.

                    President Clinton recently angered Republican
lawmakers and private
                    lenders with his budget plan to give the program more
funding and cut the
                    private lenders' federal subsidy.

                    And this fall the Education Department will offer
rebates to direct-loan
                    borrowers who allow their payments to be deducted
automatically from
                    their bank accounts, Education Secretary Richard W. Ri
ley announced
                    Monday.

                       Direct-loan critics insist the program is ill-managed
and dispute claims
                    that the program will eventually cost less to run and
pass those savings to
                    students. Currently, the rates for borrowers vary in
both programs.

                       These critics focused on the recent report by Steven
A. McNamara,
                       acting Education Department Inspector General. But
McNamara insists
                       the report is not questioning the department's
management of either
                       program.

                       Mark Cannon, the Coalition for Student Loan Reform,
which lobbies for
                       private lenders, begs to differ.

                       "It paints a bleak picture of the Education Department
as efficient
                    managers," he said. "It shows that there is $100
million annually that is
                    going to bureaucrats and not to students."
