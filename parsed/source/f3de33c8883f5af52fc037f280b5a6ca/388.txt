TEXT:
Re: One of the issues Elaine Ryan raised in our Wed. meeting:
California just filed its state plan.   It asks that the state
be permitted to enter the TANF program now so as to get the extra
money but that, because they propose to spend only state dollars
for a period, they not be subject to the work requirements, etc.,
until the first Federal dollar is drawn down.   Logically, this
could be 6 months.
HHS is examining this from a legal and policy standpoint.   I don't
think OMB cares.   I have a feeling HHS may lean toward allowing
this, because it would give Calif. more time to compile a
"thoughtful" plan.
Hope I'm not micro-managing again, but what do you think?
