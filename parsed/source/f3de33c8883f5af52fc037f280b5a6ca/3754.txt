TEXT:
Well, at least on today's issue, I think we found a painless solution.
Sorry if I caused any confusion.  I was merely trying, as tactfully as I
could, to communicate what I know are the strong feelings from the top on
this issue.

As for the future, I talked to Frank. He says that -- while he
understands what Elena was suggesting about earlier suggestions of veto in
earlier contexts -- each situation has to stand on its own. Veto threats
are often determined by the context (can we sustain a veto on a particular
bill? is this the only objectionable item in the bill? etc.). So,
unfortunately, I think we have to run these up the flagpole each time.

On the other hand, we can do what we did today -- get the message
basically across without using the "v" word -- or touch the bases rather
quickly.  Please let me help as best as I can. Nobody here, certainly not
me, is trying to throw any unnecessary roadblock in your or anyone else's
way.

Hope this helps.    Call me if we need to talk further.   Thanks.
