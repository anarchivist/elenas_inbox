Hardly.

Leslie just called; they've been in touch with the networks as well as
with whoever in our Press office they are supposed to deal with when they
talk to the networks.

ABC will be running a story; they know of Riley's interest/availability
and will get back to ED shortly about whether they want to talk to him.
Leslie will get back to me as soon as they know more.
