TEXT:
The HHS IG has found that despite the President's executive
order making the federal government a model employer regarding child
support,
that HHS paid Medicare payments to doctors owing $21.5 million in child
support payments.  I'm getting the executive summary.

One recommendation -- something we could tie to Medicare fraud package??
-- is for
doctors to sign statements swearing they aren't delinquent in child
support before
they can receive Medicare payments or grants. That may require new
legislation
punishing doctors if they lied.  Three out of every thousand doctors in
the sample
were in arrears in paying child support.

CFederal agencies not checking up on doctors' child support

   WASHINGTON (AP)    The federal department responsible for


 enforcing child support laws continues to write checks to nearly
 1,200 Medicare doctors and medical researchers who owe $21.5
 million in unpaid child support, an internal report finds.
      Officials say it may be more trouble than it's worth to go after
 so few delinquents. But the report argues that the Department of
 Health and Human Services should try harder to set a good example.
      " I t is untenable for this department to pay what amounts to
 income to individuals who it knows are out of compliance with child
 support obligations, " wrote HHS Inspector General June Gibbs
 Brown.
      In 1995, President Clinton made the same argument as he ordered
 a crackdown designed to make the federal government "a model
 employer"    regarding child support.
      "We will find you. We will catch you. We will make you pay, ' ,
 Clinton warned then, as he signed an executive order requiring
 agencies to withhold past-due child support from payments to
 federal employees and contractors.
  But that order, signed in February 1995, has not been uniformly
 enforced, said Michael Kharfen, spokesman for the HHS agency that
 handles child support. Some agencies have been more willing than
 others to garnishee wages and payments, he said.
      HHS Secretary Donna Shalala, who supervises all of the agencies
 involved, could not be reached for comment Tuesday.
      Nationwide, parents owe $34.5 billion in overdue child support.
 Just 20 percent of families who are owed child support receive
 payments.
      The inspector general's report focused on a set of doctors and
 found 1,184 deadbeats who owed $21.5 million. That was less than 1
 percent of the 422,643 cases examined.
      Using databases, the report matched child support delinquents
 with doctors who treat Medicare patients, researchers with grants
 from the National Institutes of Health and health care
 professionals who received loans or grants for school through the
 National Health Service Corps.
     Most of the delinquent parents     1,105 of them   were doctors
'serving in the Medicare program for the nation's elderly.
      But the inspector general was only able to examine the records
 of 55 percent of Medicare doctors, so the actual number who owe
 child support could be much higher.
      The report recommends that HHS start enforcing Clinton's
 executive order, saying it can start by doing the same computer
 matches that investigators did.
     Beyond that, it suggests that agencies require doctors to sign
 statements swearing they aren't delinquent in child support before
 they can receive Medicare payments or grants. That would require
 new legislation punishing doctors if they lied.
      Finally, it recommends that HHS cross-check applicants for
 federal money with a new database of all delinquents that is being
 created. The department should then deny payments to those not
 paying child support, it said.
     A spokesman for the HHS agency that administers Medicare, Chris
 Peacock, said the agency "absolutely believes that doctors who are
 delinquent in child support payments shouldn't be getting Medicare
money. '   I

     Peacock said Medicare is working to find a solution. But in
written comments, the agency objected to every suggestion by the
inspector general.
     It argued that a doctor caught through a computer match could
simply reapply as a corporation and that even if a new computer
system worked it would "disrupt patient service"    if doctors were


kicked out of the program.
     The agency also complained that requiring doctors to sign a
statement would be an "administrative burden"    for doctors when
very few are in violation. Plus, it said, doctors might easily lie,
and investigations would be expensive.
     The National Institutes of Health also argued it is not worth
denying grants to a few researchers when 99.72 percent owe no child
support.
     "This is an extremely high compliance rate, one which we would
be pleased to achieve in other areas, " said Anthony L. Itteilag,
NIH deputy director for management.
     But $21.5 million means a lot to the families who have it
coming, said Debbie Kline of the Association for the Enforcement of
Child Support.
     "There isn't really an amount that is too small to overlook, ' ,
she said. "The federal government should not be paying money to
criminals who are neglecting their children. ' ,
