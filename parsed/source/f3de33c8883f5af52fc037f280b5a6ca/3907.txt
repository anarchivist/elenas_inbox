Thanks.    What makes it confusing is not the Waxman plug, as such.

The first problem is that the insert as written buries the lead -- i.e.,
it introduces the topic of the radio address -- what the President is
doing to protect Americans from second hand smoke -- by applauding someone
else's efforts to fight that problem.

The second problem is more complicated.   I understand that the purpose of
this insert is to give the state AG's credit for the settlement -- without
giving the impression that the President is guided by their proposal, or
giving away our position on the settlement before we are prepared to do
so. The result, however, is kind of oblique . . .

I would truly appreciate your input on how to make the insert a little
clearer.  I am far from up to speed on this issue, both conceptually and
in its particulars.   I'm going downstairs for a second to grab a
sandwich, but it would be great if we could talk soon.
