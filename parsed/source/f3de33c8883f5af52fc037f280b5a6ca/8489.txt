TEXT:
Mike Cohen pointed me to a section of the 1994 Goals 2000 legislation
which prohibits smoking "within any indoor facility owend or leased or
contracted for and utilized by such person for provision of routine or
regular kindergarten, elementary, or secondary education or library
services to children."

Children's services are defined in part as:

"the provision of routine or regular basis of health, day care, education,
or library services that are funded ... directly by the Federal government
or through State or local governments, by Federal grant, loan, loan
guarantee, or contract programs ... administered by either the Secretary of
Health and Human Services or the Secretary of Education."

The law provides for civil monetary penalties of up to $1,000 per day.
