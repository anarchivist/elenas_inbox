TEXT:
On Sunday, Robert Pear and the NY Times ran a front page story on the
Administration's children's labeling regulation.   Since we released this
regulation in August and it received so much attention, the idea that this
story is news seems -- to say the least -- questionable.   FDA informs me
that there is nothing new on this front.   Having said this, since it
received such prominent play, attached you will find a couple of Q&As on
this subject.   (Needless to say, we believe we are on very strong ground
on this one and it is my impression that many drug companies wanted this
type of coverage.)

Also attached, you will find my first cut answer to the question    why we
are NOT announcing our appointments to the Medicare Commission.     I think
this is the answer John Hilley and Gene Sperling would generally    approve,
but I want to make certain.   I will follow-up with a note should   my
guidance differ from the attached draft.

     manufacturers regarding the unintended consequences of the Administration's
     regulation requiring companies to test their products in children before marketing
     them?

A.   Absolutely not. It borders on the unethical not to ensure that physicians and other health
     care professionals have the information they need to most appropriately prescribe needed
     medications to our nation's children. Today, countless thousands of children are
     prescribed medications in the absence of this information. This fact helps explain why
     national representatives of pediatricians and children's hospitals are so supportive of this
     regulation.

     Follow-up question: Granted their does seem to be a disagreement between the
     industry and health providers on this issue; however, aren't you concerned even if
     just one child is needlessly exposed to clinical trials that might be harmful?

     A.     What the New York Times article did not mention is that the Food and Drug
            Administration (FDA) Commissioner will have the authority to waive testing
            requirements ifhe or she determines they are ethically or medically unsound.


                               MEDICARE COMMISSION

Q.   Why are you not announcing your appointments to the Medicare Commission today
     -- the date the Balanced Budget Agreement law explicitly calls on the Congress and
     the Administration to make its selections?*

A.   After consulting with the Congress, we have decided that it would be preferable to
     announce the Commission appointees along with the Chair. We have not finalized our
     discussions on the Chair and, by mutual agreement, have decided to delay the final
     announcement of appointees until that time.

     Follow-up question: When do you anticipate this process concluding? Why is this
     taking so long?

     It is our hope and expectation that we will reach closure on the chair in the very near
     future. Weare committed to getting the work of the Commission underway as soon as
     possible.


*    This Q&A needs to be cleared by John Hilley and Gene Sperling.
