TEXT:
I am forwarding some small items that were raised by OMB folks,
regarding items for the President's press conference. They may be useful
in preparation for the final Q and A.


Hi-B visas

1st paragraph, last sentence. It is the "G.I. Bill for America's Workers"
- not the GI Bill of Rightsfor America's worrkers.

2nd paragraph. Reference to: "reducing the maximum stay for HI-B workers
from 6 to 3 years".
Strictly speaking, this is not part of Kennedy's bill, which was the
premise of the question.
(which may be too nitpicky ).


-Linda
I
