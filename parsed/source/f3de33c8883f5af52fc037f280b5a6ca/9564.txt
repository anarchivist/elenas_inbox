TEXT:
Drugs-- Medical Marijuana:   Five states (AK, WA, OR, NV, CO) and the
District of Columbia have medical marijuana initiatives on their ballots
for November 3.   We are working with ONDCP and other federal agencies on
a targeted media strategy to inform the public about the Administration's
medical marijuana policy position.   The strategy will place special
emphasis on D.C.'s medical marijuana initiative and will include efforts
to provide editorial support to the local papers, and outreach to key
local opinion leaders, elected officials, and Police Chief Ramsey, and
local churches on our position.  There are currently 8 states with active
medical marijuana statutes: CA, AZ, LA, GA, VI, CN, VT, and NH.

COPS -- Note to EK: The COPS Office isn't comfortable with an estimate on
when we'll get to 100,000 officers. They did say that we are currently
ahead of schedule, and that we will likely reach 100,000 midway through FY
99 -- not at the end of FY 2000, as originally proposed in the 1994 Crime
Act. Remember, however, that there is, on average, an lag of about 18
months before police officers actually hit the street.

Juvenile Crime -- Note to EK: I don't think there is anything new to
report here. Despite the vote by the House to appoint conferees nothing
has changed since the House voted to attach their juvenile justice bills
to the Senate bill authorizing the Center for Missing and Exploited Chi
ldren .... On Thursday, the House voted to overwhelmingly (376-36) to go to
conference with the Senate on the S. 2073 -- a bill authorizing the Center
for Missing and Exploited Children, and to which the House juvenile crime
bills were attached (H.R. 3 and H.R. 1818). As you know, the
Administration strongly opposes H.R. 3, which requires states to pass
draconian measures to qualify for block grant funds, but supports H.R.
1818, which reauthorizes the Justice Department's Office of Juvenile
Justice and Delinquency Prevention. Despite this vote, Senate Democrats
have not reached agreement with Republicans on terms for considering
juvenile crime legislation -- and, thus, will continue to oppose any
motion to go to conference with the House on these bills.
