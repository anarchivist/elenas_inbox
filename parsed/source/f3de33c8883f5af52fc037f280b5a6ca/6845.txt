Per your request.  Below is our recommendation for the funding provision
in the Daschle bill.  In addition, when the legislation was circulated
through the OMB legislative process, DOJ stated that the Publicity section
of the Award appears to be unconstitutional. Melissa Benton (57887) has
information on this issue. Call if you have any questions (5-7751).

Sec. 8 Increase Resources for Enforcement and Education.

Suggest striking (a),    (b), and (c) and inserting:

"There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary for
EEOC and DOL to carry out the provisions of this Act."

Rationale:  Providing specific funding amounts has unintended
consequences.  From the Administration's view, the President's budget
provides sufficient funds to carry out the agencies' statutory and EO
responsibiiities.  Including the President's increase in the Daschle bill
suggests that the increase to EEOC ,for example~ is tied to the substance


of this bill, which is not the case.  In addition, providing the increase
in a separate bill implies that the Administration needs a legislative
action from Congress in order to propose increases to agency funding.
Title XI of the CRA of 1964 provides permanent authorization for
appropriation for EEOC.  Lastly, even though funds are authorized, it does
not guarantee that it will be appropriated.

The increases required to implement the provisions in this bill are
already covered by the President's 1999 budget.  For example, EEOC's
responsibilities under the Equal Pay Act are not changing as a result of
this bill. Therefore its 99 budget should cover the amount needed to
enforce the equal pay act.  In addition, the funding for the award is
unnecessary givenOFCCP/DOL has been doing this for years.   The funding
needed for the award is therefore built into its base funding.

So we recommend using broad language that provides the Administration
flexibility in agency funding decisions and does not give the Congress an.
incentive to lower the amount. We want to have the budget battle in the
appropriations bills.
