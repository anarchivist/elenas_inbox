TEXT:
The lead appears to be limits on liability. Mack, McCain, Breaux, and
Ford all made statements that were interpreted as demonstrating the need
for and the willingness to consider some limits on liability. Mack was
the opening witness and focused on funding for basic science, although he
didn't provide a specific number.  McCain said nice things about the White
House, he said we were getting better (good work Cynthia). McCain and FTC
argued over the effect of smoking in films.  McCain thought films have a
big impact on kids, FTC thought advertising was a bigger problem.  Snowe
questioned the value of an agreement with the tobacco companies, when
advertisers, retailers, and others would likely still be opposed to many
of the access and advertising restrictions.
