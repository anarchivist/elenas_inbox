 H.R. 1428 - Voter Eligibility verification Act
 (Horn (R) California and 27 cosponsors)

 The Administration strongly supports protecting the integrity of elections
 and agrees that voter eligibility determinations must be conducted in a
 non-discriminatory, uniform fashion.  For the following principal reasons,
 however, H.R. 1428 fails to achieve those goals.   Thus, the Administration
 strongly opposes enactment of H.R. 1428.   If this bill were presented to
 the President,                  would recommend that he veto it.

 First, H.R. 1428 depends upon data systems not suited for voter
 verification purposes. Second, it would be so cumbersome as to likely
 raise discriminatory barriers to the right to vote for many qualified u.S.
 citizens, particularly minority and elderly citizens.  Third, the
 Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) already routinely cooperates
·with State and local officials in the execution of their duties,
 including, in appropriate cases, duties relating to elections.

 The system mandated by the bill will not result in accurate and timely
 information. The Social Security Administration (SSA) cannot confirm
 citizenship based on its records.  269 million of its records created
 before 1981 reflect only unverified information on citizenship status, and
 newer records are not routinely updated for changes in citizenship
 status. Only about 10 percent of INS records contain social Security
 numbers, and SSA cannot supply Alien Registration numbers. A forced
 linking of two databases not designed for this purpose will result in the
 denial of the right to vote for u.S. citizens.

 The bill poses important civil rights problems.  In 1986, Congress sought
 to guard against employment discrimination by requiring that the identity
 and immigration status of all employees be verified. H.R. 1428 lacks this
 safeguard. Some, but not all, voters may be subject to citizenship
 verification under H.R. 1428 without regard to any underlying information
 indicating that a person is not a citizen. The potential for discri
 minatory abuse, particularly against minorities, is clear.

 In addition to accuracy and civil rights concerns, verification for
 citizenship, as opposed to immigration status, is highly burdensome on
 local and State election officials, as well as Federal agencies. Even if
 the system envisioned by the bill were workable, voter registration would
 be greatly impeded because of the administrative burden in verifying .
 everyone's citizenship. H.R. 1428 would render meaningless existing voter
 registration deadlines under State laws and thwart the protections of the
 National Voter Registration Act and Voting Rights Act.

 In addition, there is a already a citizenship question on the voter
 application forms of all States, in most (if not all) cases carrying a
 perjury penalty for false statements. Existing cooperation and assistance
 furnished to State and local election officials are far more effective
 than the system mandated by H.R. 1428.
