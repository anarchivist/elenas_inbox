Sorry, so late (2 out of 3 ain't bad, though), but here are 3 fundamental
issues that Mike and/or Barry may be asked at the Noon brief before the
event. They include: vouchers, overall school crime rates, and the need
for a new report.  I think it is safe to assume anything else can be
punted to the specialty briefers after the event -- including any Q's on
the DARE program, which was feature on NBC last night.

                                   Questions and Answers
                                      March 19, 1998


Overall Findings of Survey

Q:    Doesn't the Study being released by the President today really show that we have a
      serious crime problem in our schools that we haven't been able to impact? What's
      so encouraging about a majority of our public schools -- or 57% -- reporting crimes
      to law enforcement?

A:    Sure today's report shows that we have a serious crime problem in our schools -- frankly,
      even one serious crime in our schools is one too many. But the report also shows that:

             - 90% of our public schools are free from serious violent crimes;

             - 80% of schools reported 5 or fewer crimes; and

             - 43% of schools reported no murders, rapes, sexual assaults, fights with or
             without weapons, robberies, thefts, or vandalism to law enforcement.

      That means that a large majority of public schools are finding ways to keep their schools
      safe, and that's significant.


Vouchers

Q:    If these findings show that many of our schools are unsafe, why shouldn't vouchers
      given to be children in these unsafe schools to go to the private school of their
      choice?

A:    We must continue to invest and strengthen our nation's public schools. This means
      reducing class size, raising academic standards, modernizing our schools, expanding
      after-school programs, and connecting schools to the Internet so that all of our children
      can get the education they need and deserve. Vouchers would drain resources from our
      nation's public schools -- schools that are attended by 90% of our children -- to subsidize
      private schools.

      The right way to help children in failing or unsafe schools isn't to drain those schools of
      resources -- it is to take drastic actions to fix and tum around the entire school for the
      benefit of all of the children in the school. We owe it to our children to preserve this
      nation's time-honored commitment to public education and our commitment to provide a
      good education to all of our children.




    New Annual Report on School Safety

    Q:    How is the report being recommended by the Attorney General and Secretary Riley
          today any different from existing Departments of Education and Justice studies?

    A:    While there currently exists a patchwork of useful reports on school safety, they cannot be
          easily compared. They are sponsored by a different agencies. They measure different
          aspects of school safety (i.e., incidence of crime, student victimization, possession of
          weapons, disciplinary actions) and at different levels (i.e., school, state, student). And
          none have been released on an annual basis.

          The new Annual Report on School Safety represents the first time this information will be
          pulled together in a single, comprehensive document for use at the school level. It will
          be designed to help parents and principals, lawmakers and law enforcement better
          understand and combat their local school crime problems. It will include a local safety
          checklist and recommend actions that communities can take to improve school safety.
