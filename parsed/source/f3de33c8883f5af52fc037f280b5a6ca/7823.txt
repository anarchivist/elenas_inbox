TEXT:
There's a very good quote in one of the Philip Morris documents Mary found
on teen smoking and price.  It's from Sept 17, 1981 (p.3):  "It is clear
that price has a pronounced effect on the smoking prevalence of
teenagers." The document also suggests a price elasticity of -1.2 for
teens, considerably higher than we assume.  We should try to use the quote
in our defensive talking points (and find out what the author of the memo
did for PM).      .
