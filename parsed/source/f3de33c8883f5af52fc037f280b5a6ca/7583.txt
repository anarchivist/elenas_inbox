                                           May 10, 1998


Dear Majority Leader Lott and Speaker Gingrich,

        The report to be released today by the General Accounting Office calls on Congress to
give the Food and Drug Administration the authority to ensure that food eligible for import to the
United States is produced under food safety systems that will provide the same level of
protection as the safety systems in place in the United States. This report is further confinnation
of the need for Congress to pass the Safety ofImported Food Act, which I called for in October
1997, and Senators Mikulski and Kennedy, and Representatives Eshoo and Pallone have
introduced.

         This important legislation will do what the GAO says is necessary: it will ensure that the
FDA denies the entry of imports of fruits, vegetables, or other food from a foreign country or
facility that does not meet U.S. food safety requirements or otherwise achieve the level of
protection required in the United States. It will give FDA the authority it urgently needs,
comparable to USDA's existing authority to prevent the importation of unsafe meat and poultry,
to protect the safety of the food Americans eat.

         I have taken several further steps to begin implementing standards to ensure the safety of
imported food. My FY '99 budget committed approximately $25 million to enabling the FDA
to dramatically expand its international food inspection force in order to implement the pending
legislation. In March of this year I released a report on how the Secretary of Health and Human
Services, in partnership with the Secretary of Agriculture, and in cooperation with the
agricultural community, will develop guidance on good agricultural and manufacturing practices
that will apply to both domestic and foreign producers.

        There is no more important task our government faces than ensuring the safety of the
American food supply. That is why last year I announced my comprehensive new initiative,
"Food Safety from Farm to Table" -- which detailed a comprehensive program including
surveillance, outbreak response, education and research. The Safety of Imported Food Act is
another vital step in working to protect the safety of all the food Americans eat, and I urge you to
pass it promptly.


                                      Sincerely,
