TEXT:
FYI -- especially BR before you see the AG at your 5:30 meeting:

After our sex offenders meeting, I had a borderline shouting match with
Kent on the Indian COPS issue.  He's pretty steamed, and I wouldn't be
surprised if he gets to the AG before the 5:30pm w/Erskine.  I stuck by
the fact that this is an issue better resolved in the COPS working group
-- not in the budget/approps language -- and that it didn't mean the issue
was dead. Also, I pointed out that proposing approps language in the
budget didn't guarantee any results whatsoever.

Kent argued that   this was a no brainer; that this showed we weren't
committed to the   Indian Initiative; that he resented the WH not showing
deference to DOJ   on this "technical" issue; that this would send the wrong
signal to Indian   Country; the lists goes on ...

I offered to hold a joint DOJ/WH meeting w/lndian Country to demonstrate
our commitment; reminded him that the initial push to do something in
Indian Country was focused first on improved federal coordination, second
on targeting current resources, third on looking for new funds, and that
these priorities had now been reversed; and that -- whether or not the
budget proposed new language on equipment -- we still needed to work withe
appropriators and others to make this happen.

I'm sure I've missed a few things, but you get the gist ...

Loving my job,
Jose'
