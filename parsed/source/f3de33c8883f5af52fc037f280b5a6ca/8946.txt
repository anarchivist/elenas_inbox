               Julia had written the following to make up b/c she had been hassling me to
               have you call the Gannett reporter and I had responded that we did not
               get the reporter info until 6:20 and you had been in Erskine's office ever
               since.  So then Amy was in fact thanking you.

               "laura, thank you very much for helping the press office with this. we
               really, really do appreciate all of your work and assistance. thanks
               again! II

I second that emotion! And, I did enjoy reading the email traffic on
this ... it seemed uncertain, but, as always, Elena pulled through! PIs
thank her for us. This stuff really helps. And we know how busy she is.
Thanks again!
