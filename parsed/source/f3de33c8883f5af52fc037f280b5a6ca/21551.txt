The final bill that we read through yesterday had only the $5 m. more for
FDA. As you can see in the e-mail below, the House clerks allegedly
talked to FDA and got the impression that FDA was "drowning" in food
safety money.  Dan Mendelson talked later to FDA, who denied saying that,
but the damage was done.

Sally Chadbourne (Obey) called this afternoon to report that the majority
has changed the allocation of our $23 million food safety addback. Tim
Sanders (Skeen) and Sally report that FDA told them that they can not
spend the $9.9 million in the original allocation on food safety and that
if they get it they would propose to reprogram it to other activities
later in the year.                  .

Needless to say, Tim decided to reduce the $9.9 million to $5 million


(allocating the balance to various USDA agencies).   Their current plan is
to allocate the $23 million as follows:

FDA $5
FSIS $8m
Cooperative State Res, Ed and extension   $3.9 million
ARS$3.6
AMS $2.8
