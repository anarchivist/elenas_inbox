TEXT:
It is appalling that Congress would decide to intervene in the drug safety
practices of the Food and Drug Administration.   For years the FDA has used
vigorous testing and the highest of scientific standards to protect public
health.  This unprecedented Congressional action substitutes political
ideology for sound science. It would restrict scientific research that
can protect women's lives and offer them safe medical choices.   It shows
the extremism' of those whose real agenda is to deny completely the ability
of women to make their own reproductive choices.
