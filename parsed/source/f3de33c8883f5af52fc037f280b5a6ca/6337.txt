     TEXT:
     Judge Ross checked into the car booting idea -- here's what he said.  It
     looks like we would be able to calIon Congress to pass legislation and
     cite Virginia as a model, but that we wouldn't be able to do it as an
     executive action.

     Subject: Re: Re: Federal Licenses

     We have talked about it and decided that, absent legislation - similar to
     what we have in the law regarding state license revocation, booting cannot
     be
     mandated by regulation. As you may know, the State of Virginia has begun
     a
     very aggressive program of booting and the State Director there tells me
     that
     it has been very successful.  I.have asked the editor of our Child Support
     Report that goes to employees across the nation, to feature the Virginia
     project in an article. We also do a best practices manual.   If the
     results
     continue to be beneficial, we will include it in a future edition.  It
     might
     be worthwhile, however, for the President to mention it in some future
     child
     support radio address. Hope this helps.   David Ross.
