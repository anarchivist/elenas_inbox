TEXT:
Ladies--I just want to say thank you. You all worked so hard to make
Tuesday's event the success it was.  I know there were some rough
spots--lists, program, speakers (where are the basketball players),
reception, policy, those expanding conference calls--but those rough spots
are long forgotten in the glow of the success. Thanks again.
