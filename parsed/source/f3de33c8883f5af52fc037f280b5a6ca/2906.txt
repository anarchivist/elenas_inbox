I'm not crazy about this, but I hope it helps.   I've tried to take some of
our biggest accomplishments on crime and cast them in the most positive
light, but I'm afraid this effort needs continued work. Clearly, though,
community policing, gun violence and crime prevention are the three
biggest positives.  If we want, we can get Leanne to dig up some good cop
anecdotes tomorrow if that's helpful.  I'm. afra~d I've struck out for now
(as I mentioned) on some specific -- and juicy -- tidbits relating to polic
e hiring.

fowarding phone with signal if you need me later or Saturday.   I'll be
