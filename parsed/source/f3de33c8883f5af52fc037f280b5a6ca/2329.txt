TEXT:
I made the executive decision to circulate the Drug Q's/A's on meth and
money laundering to staff secretary, Rahm and lower press.  I don't think
they're too eventful, but here they are again if you want to see them in
the morning.  Please page me or Leanne first thing if you think there are
problems.  I'm sorry for not being able to circulate them until late
today; I promise my timing will improve ..

Also, I've dropped off a copy of the speech with some of my edits in case
your interested. As with last week's FOP speech I have serious concerns
about what exactly we're trying to say in our crime/drug speeches.
Perhaps we should visit on this later.

(BR: Forgive the late night call, but I was really worried about the
speech and felt the need to touch base w/you.)

Jose'
