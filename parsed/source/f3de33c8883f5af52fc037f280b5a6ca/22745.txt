   TEXT:
   As I work through transition with Mary Beth in OPL, it occurred to me that
   many of your offices could be extremely helpful to her in this transition
   if you notified her of the various meetings that take place in your
   offices. As you are all well aware, in order for her and the OPL ~taff to
   do an effective job on your behalf, they must be kept updated on issues
   that impact the various constituents.  Because of the unique blend of


policy and political experience that Mary Beth brings to the table, her
insight could be invaluable to your office.   Please add her to your
distribution list.  . I understand as time goes on, she will be setting up
meetings with many of you.

Thanks   (Welcome Mary Beth)
