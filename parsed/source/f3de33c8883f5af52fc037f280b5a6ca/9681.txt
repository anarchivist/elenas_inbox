TEXT:
Remember the compact to facilitate background checks? It passed!   And the
President mentioned it in today's event, see excerpt below:

             Last night Congress passed a bill by a large bipartisan
margin that will build on our progress -- a bill I'll sign into law
later today.  It will provide states with more than $1 billion over
the next five years to modernize not only their criminal records
systems, but also to upgrade their communications and criminal
identification systems.  It will include legislation I proposed last
year at the White House Conference on Child Care the First Lady and I
sponsored, to help us build a new electronic information sharing
partnership with state and local law enforcement to keep our child
care and our child care and our elder care systems safe.
