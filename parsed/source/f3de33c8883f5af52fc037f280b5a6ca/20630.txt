                STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY

             H.R. 3248 - DOLLARS TO THE CLASSROOM ACT
        (Sponsors:   Pitts (R), Pennsylvania and 84 others)
     The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 3248, as reported by
the Committee on Education and the Workforce. If this bill were
presented to the President, his senior advisors would recommend that
he veto it.
      H.R. 3248 would convert a wide array of Federal education
programs that address national priorities into a single, unfocused,
block-grant program of general aid for education. The bill would
eliminate programs that focus on our neediest children and schools,
and on activities in which national leadership can playa critical
role, such as helping States and school districts raise educational
standards and achievement for students, improving the quality of
teaching, bringing the benefits of technology to our Nation's
students, and increasing the availabili ty of after-school programs.
     Block grants would replace these worthy efforts with general
aid for school operations, which is the responsibility of States
and communities to provide, with no attention to national priorities
and no accountability for results.
