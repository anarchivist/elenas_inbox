RE:                    Reconciliation Outreach Efforts

In developing recommendations for your initiative on race and diversity, we consulted a number
of individuals and national leaders who have spoken out on this issue in the past. We explained
that you were considering a number ofproposaJs that would speak to the unresolved issue of
racial and ethnic discrimination, and would focus on the great challenge facing our country as we
move into the next century. We solicited their views regarding the advisability of a Presidential
initiative on race, whether such an initiative should take the form of a commission or some type
ofa White House summit, and asked for suggestions of who should be asked to serve on a
commission, if that were to be established.

Everyone we called supported the idea of a Presidential initiative; many speaking enthusiastically
of your unique ability to speak to the nation on the subject ofrace and reconciliation and to move
the country toward racial healing and tolerance. For example, Father O'Donnovan and Father
Hesburgh both expressed strong support for your taking on the race issue. Father Hesburgh
cited your success with the Memphis speech and said he felt America is ready to face this issue
and suggested that you should try to build on the 1964 Civil Rights Act.

Several people expressed concern about creating a commission believing that it would run the
risk of being big on rhetoric and short on substance. Some argued that there.has been enough
study; that it was time for action. Among those cautioning against a commission were Al
Fromm, Xavier Becerra and Hugh Price. Others such as Kwesi Mfume and Joe Lowery, while
not opposing a commission, were more concerned about the potential lack of concrete actions.
John Sweeney thought selecting a commission would be hard but supported your effort to engage
the public on the issue. Senator Moseley-Braun thought a commission was an excellent idea and
the you were ideally suited to leave a lasting legacy on the matter ofrace. She believes that you
have the credibility and can give direction to the nation on this important issue


Hugh Price also suggested that the real challenge for the future is ensuring that what he called the
"opportunity structure" be open to all populations in the country, and not just focus on past
discrimination. He proposed that you convene a dialogue with mayors who have real life
experiences with interactions among different people and the difficulty of governing diverse
                                                            Automated Records Management System
                                                            Hex-Dump Conversion
poverty and highlighting the common goal of economic security. He also thought consideration
should be given to human relations and how we develop respect for all types of diversity.

Representative Mink said that the commission should have a name that was inclusive and that a
commission on race was a very bad idea which conjured up very negative and divisive signals.
Representative Matsui agreed with the idea of a reconciliation commission and suggested several
prominent Asian-Americans be considered. Becerra of the Hispanic Caucus also stressed the
importance of going beyond a black and white dialogue. Ron Allen, a Native American leader,
expressed great concern that racism was at the very heart of the problems besetting the Native
American community but that a commission on race would not address the needs of this
community. Substantial participation by Native Americans in this initiative will be required to
allay concerns.

Anna Devere Smith argued that the press should be challenged and included in the effort to bring
about reconciliation.

We also had lengthy conversations with both Mayor Dennis Archer and Mayor Willie Brown;
both of whom were highly supportive and pleased to be asked for their advice. Mayor Brown
was particularly interested in trying to identify new leadership -- younger people not already
previously identified with the Civil Rights movement to participate in this effort. Both indicated
they will applaud you when you make your speech ..

Lastly, we have spoken with Rev. Jackson who stressed that vision, policy and politics must be
connected. The key question for him is whether you are prepared to make some bold moves to
advance this effort with particular emphasis on our criminal justice system and our economic
structure. While he believes that you are deeply committed to the issue, but the initiative must
be more than dialogue.

Below is a list of the individuals with whom we spoke:

Kwesi Mfume                       Senator Ted Kennedy
Wade Henderson                    Vernon Jordan
George Stephanapoulos             Bill Galston
Taylor Branch              Secretary Rodney Slater
Chris Edley                       William Julius Wilson
Hugh Price                        Congressman Xavier Beccerra
John Sweeney                      Governor Winter
Michael Wenger                    Al Fromm
Mayor Dennis Archer               Mayor Willie Brown
Rev.Jesse Jackson                 Father Ted Hesburgh
Rev. Joseph Lowery                Senator Carol Mosley Braun
Congressman John Lewis            Congresswoman Maxine Waters
Congressman Bob Matsui            Warren Christopher
Ambassador Bill Richardson        Secretary Federico Pena
Father Leo O'Donnovan
Before the initiative can be announced and before your speech, there are two critical calls that
remain to be made: Rev. Jesse Jackson and Mary Francis Berry, Chair of the U.S. Commission
on Civil Rights. There is no plan to place either on the commission, but we propose to consult
with them regularly throughout this effort. Our recommendation is that you speak with Rev.
Jackson to ensure his support for your initiative.

We also suggest that the Vice President speak with Mary Berry. The U.S. Civil Rights
Commission, in particular, has addressed aspects of this issue of race as part of their ongoing
work and one question that will have to be answered is why create another commission.
Certainly there are opportunities to use some of the Commission's findings and research as we do
our work.

Before the speech is given, we plan to call 10-15 key elected officials nationwide to give them
advance notice of the speech. Additionally, attached is a much longer list of people whom we
intend to call in advance of the speech
