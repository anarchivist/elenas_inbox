TEXT:
Just got a call from an old education contact who quietly wants to run the
following idea by us in relation to the Monday mtg. Her education
association was approached by a major company (who is well known for their
charitable activities) that wants to "give millions" to set up a
foundation/grassroots campaign for kids and violence. This is a reputable
education group but they want to know whether we want to be involved.
They were a bit hesitant about details.
