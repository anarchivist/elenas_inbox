TEXT:
I talked to Rob about Friday's meeting with Wade, and reminded him that
Wade had contacted you to set up the meeting, and that you would be
running the meeting.  He understood,and indicated that "Chuck is generally
not proprietary about these things" but also suggested that you and Chuck
talk directly.  I agree; with you setting up the Friday meeting and Chuck
arranging yesterday's as well as one later today or tommorow with ED and
EEOC, the potential for confusion about your roles is high, and it would
be helpful if the two of you directly made sure you were on the same page
throughout.
