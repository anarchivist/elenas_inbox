TEXT:
As you think about this timing issue and events next week, you
should know that Chater's last day is Friday, Jan. 31.  It
certainly would not be appropriate to do this after she leaves, or
even in her last few days so that it appears she is running out
the door as she announces it.  My recommendation would be to do it
Thursday or Friday of next week; or else Monday or at the latest
Tuesday of the following week.
