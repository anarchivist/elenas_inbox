TEXT:
Because cloning is June 9th, we are being asked to look into doing Kaiser
as a satellite in LA on June 23rd.  I think we will get more California
press if he does this on the ground in LA.  There is lots of competition
on the 23rd, though, so we would need to push this hard as soon as
possible if this is our first choice.
