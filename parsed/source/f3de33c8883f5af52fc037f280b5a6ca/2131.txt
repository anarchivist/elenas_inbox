TEXT:
I know you had said last week that we needed to oppose the Repub. bill
limiting lawsuits where volunteeri are involved.   But I seem to recall a
newspaper article in the past few days saying some kind of compromise was
struck which allowed 99 Senators to vote for it.   I think it protected the
volunteers themselves but not organizations.   Do you know if we have
moderated our position to support: this new version?
