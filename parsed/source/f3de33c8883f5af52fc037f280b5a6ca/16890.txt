  DEPUTY DIRECTOR JACK LEW
  ACTING DEP. DIRECTOR FOR MANAGEMENT ED    DESEVE
  EXECUTIVE ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR JOSH GOTBAUM

FROM: OMB LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS

DATE: SEPTEMBER 10, 1997

SUBJECT:   LEGISLATIVE REPORT


Budget Committee Chairmen Domenici and Kasich held a press conference today
objecting to the Shuster highway bill as a budget buster.    In his statement,
Domenici said:   "The House bill will break the agreement by authorizing all
five years of highway and mass transit contract authority given to them in the
Budget Agreement over the next three years.   The consequences of this action is
to authorize approximately $40 billion over the next five years for
transportation spending above the Budget Agreement.   If the Appropriations
Committee chooses to eventually fund this higher authorization, any additional
spending by the Appropriations Committee for ISTEA activities will have to be
offset by reductions elsewhere among discretionary spending accounts."

Chairman Domenici is announcing the creation of four Senate Budget Committee
bipartisan task forces on:  (1) Social Security, chaired by Gregg;  (2) foreign
affairs budgeting, chaired by Gordon Smith; (3) education funding, chaired by
Frist; and (4) federal credit programs, chaired by Abraham.  The foreign
affairs task force will have a hearing on September 30.

Administrator Sally Katzen will testify on Friday, September 12, before the
Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs regarding S. 981, the Regulatory
Improvement Act of 1997.
