    Did you know that if you get your bullets to me, today, by 3:00 pm, they
    will be included in the President's Daily Report that is being sent to
    Shanghai?

    Just so you know:

    Shanghai is a world-famous metropolis and the largest city in China.  It
    is situated on the coast of the East China Sea and on the Changjiang
    River, the third longest river in the world. Its total area is 6,184 sq.
    km of which 340 sq. km constitute the city proper. Its total population is
    12.05 million, of which 6.4 million live in the urban area. Shanghai has
    developed into an important base in China's industry, foreign trade,
    science and technology, as well as a centre of culture and education in
    the country.
