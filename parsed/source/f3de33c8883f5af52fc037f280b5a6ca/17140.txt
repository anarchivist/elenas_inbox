        STATEMENT OF THE PRESIDENT ON THE FINAL REPORT OF THE
                COMMISSION ON IMMIGRATION REFORM


The Commission on Immigration Refonn, chaired by the Honorable Shirley Hufstedler, and the
late Barbara Jordan, issued its final report today. This report, which reiterates many of the
excellent recommendations contained in the Commission's interim reports, further contributes to
our country's understanding ofthe role of immigration in the United States. I commend the
Commission's work and its contribution to the national dialogue on immigration policy.

America has always been a nation of immigrants, and I am proud of the significant progress my
Administration has made toward improving America's iinmigration system. My Administration
has curtailed illegal immigration through tougher border control, strengthened worksite
enforcement, and the removal of record numbers of criminal and other illegal aliens. We have
also worked to improve and tighten the naturalization process, and have made needed refonns to
our asylum system for refugees fleeing persecution.

One of the Commission's recommendations is to restructure the immigration system by
reallocating the main functions of the Immigration and Naturalization Service to other agencies.
This proposal raises difficult and complex issues, which need further consideration. I have
asked the Domestic Policy Council to coordinate with the affected federal agencies to evaluate
carefully the Commission's proposal and other refonn options designed to improve the executive
branch's administration of the nation's immigration laws.

With this report, the Commission completes its work. I want to thank all of its members and
staff for their service and contribution on these important issues.
