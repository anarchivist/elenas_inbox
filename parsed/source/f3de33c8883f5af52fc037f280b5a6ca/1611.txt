                     Background on Standards and Testing in California

State Superintendent of Public Instruction Delaine Eastin's announcement of support for
California's participation in your national standards and testing initiative comes against the
backdrop of a difficult history to set standards and assess student progress in California over the
past 5 years, as well as a major political battle with Governor Wilson over participation in Goals
2000. Her announcement will gamer support among key segments of the education community
(e.g., higher education, the AFT and NEA affiliates, the state PTA). It will also be played out in
the press and in the political arena against the backdrop of recent battles and developments,
including:

1. Gov. Wilson's cancellation ofthe California Learning Assessment System (CLAS) in
1994. The CLAS test, initially hailed as a model of new, performance-oriented assessments,
was canceled by Gov. Wilson in 1994, only a few years after its initial administration. The
testing program came under strong attack, especially by conservatives, for a number of reasons.
A number of test questions were seen as focusing on values and invading student and family
privacy, and some of the reading passages contained material some viewed as objectionable.
The political outcry that was generated by these concerns overwhelmed the capacity of the
Department of Education to defend the tests, and Gov. Wilson and the state legislature ended
funding for the tests in 1994. Since that time, there has been no statewide testing in California,
although local school districts continue to administer their own tests.

2. Establishment of a state standards commission. In 1995, Assembly Bill 265, with the
support of both Gov. Wilson and Delaine Eastin, and over the opposition of conservative
legislators, was enacted into law. The Act establishes a standards commission (2/3 of the
members appointed by Gov. Wilson, 1/3 appointed by Delaine Eastin) charged with
responsibility of developing model academic standards. The first standards, in Language Arts
and Math at Grades 4, 8 and 10, are to be completed and presented to the State Board of
Education in October 1997. Other subject areas will follow. These model standards will be the
basis of statewide tests to be developed. The math and Language Arts tests will be available in
2001. However, unlike statewide tests in almost every other state, these tests will not produce
individual student scores.

In addition, to encourage individual student testing, this legislation provides a $5 per student
state subsidy to local school districts that test all students using a state-approved test.

3. Delaine Eastin's Challenge Districts. In 1995, Delaine Eastin launched a standards-based
challenge to local school districts in California, to adopt local standards and local assessments,
and to be held accountable for year-to-year progress in reaching these standards. In exchange,
the California Department of Education provides these districts with technical assistance,
networking, and regulatory flexibility.

To support these local districts, and to shape the work of the standards commission discussed
above, Delaine has worked with the higher education community and New Standards to develop
                                                      Hex-Dump COilve:sioil

model standards. These standards, nearing completion, will be consistent with the NAEP and
TIMSS frameworks that provide the foundation for the national tests.

Gov. Wilson's 9-month refusal to accept Goals 2000 funds. From July 1995 to March 1996,
Gov. Wilson refused to permit California to accept Goals 2000 funds, because of unspecified
concerns about "federal intrusion." This stance was well received among staunch conservatives
in the state, including in the legislature. However, after increasing pressure from the education
and business community, and considerable negative press, Gov. Wilson finally agreed to accept
the funds after receiving assurances from Secretary Riley that this would not interfere with
California's ability to control its own education system. California is now using most of its Goals
2000 funds to support an early reading initiative.
