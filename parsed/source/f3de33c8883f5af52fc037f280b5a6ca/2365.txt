TEXT:
We were so close to doing the midwest tobacco forum in Chicago on Nov. 17,

however, the two Senators cannot do the event w/ us on that day.     Since

Shalala is out of the country for three weeks, our scheduling office

informs us that Nov. 17 is really the only day the VP can travel for a

tobacco event.     So, Cleveland is back in the picture.   Bruce, you had said

earlier that you thought a tobacco event might work b/c of Rep. Sherrod

Brown.     Any other thoughts on the Governor or AG or any other input on a

tobacco event in Cleveland?



Thanks again.
