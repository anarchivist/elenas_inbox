TEXT:
Press (Lori McHugh) advised Friday that they wanted to put the report and
EO out this Friday, March 28th, at the top of McCurry's briefing, but now
Press office is revisiting.  I do not want to sit on this beyond Monday as
the main coalition of interest groups -- the Task Force on Radiation and
Human Rights -- has asked us to get it out the door before their meeting
April 1 (per a letter Diane brought to my attention Friday). DOE and my
preference is to release the report, however we can, this week.   Pena and
key Asst. Secretary are available Friday and MAY be available Thursday.
Barry Toiv is now working to get closure in the press office.   If this
comes up again, please let people know we need to get it out the door. We
just need 2 days notice to get to advisory committee members, certain
reporters, and key Hill people if we want to get any decent press and not
offend anyone.  Since 7 agencies are involved, outreach can't be done at
very last minute.  Thanks for your help.
