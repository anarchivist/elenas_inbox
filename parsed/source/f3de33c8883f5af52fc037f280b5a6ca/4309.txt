MEMORANDUM FOR THE CHIEF OF STAFF

FROM:          Bruce Reed

SUBJECT:       Tobacco Roll Out Plan

This memo describes the roll out plan for our tobacco announcement. Our goal is to build
momentum and support for the enactment of comprehensive tobacco control legislation next
year.

Notifying Key Groups

Prior to the announcement, we will notify key groups about the President's plan to enact
comprehensive legislation to reduce youth smoking. We will work with OPL, Legislative
Affairs, Intergovernmental Affairs, and HHS to ensure that leaders in public health, in Congress,
among the attorneys general, and among governors are prepared to validate the President's stand.

Donna and I will meet with the House and Senate Democratic Tobacco Task Forces late in the
day on Tuesday. We will also try to meet with the Republican leadership. I will call Governors
Hunt and Patton. (Chiles?)

Press Strategy

There will be considerable press interest in our announcement. We should take advantage of the
heightened interest to get out our message, shape the debate, and build momentum for enactment
of our plan.

To get the most out of the event, we should surround the President with leaders from public
health, the attorneys general, and possibly the Congress. Our goal is a picture that sends a clear
message that we are putting the public interest first. It is a message that contrasts with the AGs
announcement, which although not by design, ended up appearing to be validated by the industry
and trial attorneys, and ultimately at odds with the public interest.

The event itself will be limited to remarks by the Vice-President and President. Donna and I
will join the President, Vice-President, and validators on stage. Donna and I will lead Mike
McCurry's afternoon briefing.

In addition to the President's and Vice-President's remarks, we will provide a short white paper
                                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion
that can be handed out, a backgrounder that promotes the Administration's record, and Q&As.

Follow-up

In addition to the typical follow-up briefings for interested groups, we will develop a detailed
plan of actions we will take throughout the remainder of 1997 to maintain interest and build
momentum for enactment of comprehensive legislation next year. We will work with the
Vice-President and his staff to establish a visible leadership role for him.

Legislative Strategy

We will need to work closely with the Congress to lay the groundwork for Congressional action
next year. At least six committees in the Senate and possibly as many in the House would have
jurisdiction over legislation enacting the President's plan. The lack of an effective legislative
strategy has been cited repeatedly as a key reason for the failure of attorney's general proposed
settlement. We will not repeat their mistake.
