TEXT:
At today's event on Social Security and women, the President said the
following about expanding the FMLA:

         "We believe -- the Vice President and I and our spouses
-- that the Family Leave law ought to be expanded some.   (Applause.)
We've tried in two Congresses to do that and haven't gotten very far.
But we'll keep plugging away at it, because I think unless people
have been in this situation where they're afraid they're going to
lose their job, or wreck their retirement because they're just doing
what's necessary to hold their families together, they can't imagine
it. And the law is actually a great -- it's actually good for
businesses, too, because it doesn't put any employers at a
competitive disadvantage if it applies to all employers equally.   It
tends to minimize the cost, the burden of risk, for that."
