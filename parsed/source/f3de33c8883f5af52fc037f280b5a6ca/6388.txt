TEXT:
We are working to get this out before the NGA.  Rob Weiner's
recommendation is that we concur with DOL's recommendation to give the AFL
a heads up on this, so I am working with Karen Tramantano to do that
tomorrow.

Regarding whether this IRS ruling will do any damage to our FLSA
position: According to DOL, it is a question of degrees of risk.    Issuing
this ruling will marginally increase the risk that a court wouldn't uphold
employee rights for workfare recipients.  Rob is working with DOL and
Treasury on language to minimize the added risk, but DOL argues there is
no way to do this ruling that doesn't add some risk.   Rob doesn't
disagree.  So if no added risk is our standard, we would not issue this.
(The risk is not zero even without this ruling.)  Interestingly, DOL says
the risk is less for FLSA than for the NLRA and other laws, I think
because of the different laws' definition of employee.

I'll know more tomorrow.
