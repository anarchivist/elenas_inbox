                                               DRAFT -- November 21, 1997

               Tonight, I issue a chaUenge to the nation: Every state should adopt high national standards,
               and . .. every state should test every 4th grader in reading and every 8th grader in math to
               make sure these standards are met.
                                                                President Bill Clinton
                                                                1997 State of the Union Address

Today, in his weekly radio address, President Clinton commended the bipartisan, independent National
Assessment Governing Board (NAGB) for its plan to develop and pilot the new voluntary national tests in
4th grade reading and 8th grade math. The President also announced new appointments to the Board,
including Diane Ravitch, former Assistant Secretary of Education in the Bush Administration and a strong
supporter of national standards and tests.

NAGB Assumes Control for National Tests. As proposed by the President, the recently enacted
Labor-Health and Human Services-Education Appropriations Bill places the bipartisan, independent NAGB
in complete control of further work in developing the voluntary national tests. NAGB currently oversees
the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), a sample test of core subjects that tracks the
progress of the nation as a whole and of 43 participating states, but does not provide individual student,
school, or district level results.

The new national tests will be modeled on the NAEP content frameworks in 4th grade reading and 8th grade
mathematics. The NAEP standards refled a national consensus of what students should know and be able to
do when they reach these crucial stages of learning.

Under the legislation, NAGB is now responsible for formulating policy for the voluntary national tests, just
as it does for NAEP. The law charges NAGB with reviewing and modifying, if necessary, the contract to
develop the tests. NAGB can also review, modify, and approve test specifications. This week, before
meeting with the President, NAGB formally assumed control over the tests and adopted a detailed plan and
timeline for test development.

New Appointment Underscores Bipartisan Commitment to National Tests. Along with two other new
members ofNAGB, the President announced that Secretary Riley had appointed to the Board Diane Ravitch,
a long-time supporter of national standards and tests. Ravitch, former Assistant Secretary for Educational
Research and Improvement under the Bush Administration, has supported enhancing independence of the
national tests by giving control to NAGB.
                                                                                       Hex-Dump Conversion



Work Will Proceed in Key Areas of Test Development. Under the plan approved by NAGB, it will
begin this month to establish specifications for the national tests to ensure that the tests are based on
the same content in NAEP.. The board hopes to approve specifications in March 1998. Test items
will then be developed for and approved by NAGB based on those specifications. Approved items
will be used to prepare pilot tests and to plan for field tests. In addition, the Board will oversee
development of guidelines for testing students with disabilities, appropriate test use, and test
reporting, and will guide preparation of materials to inform states and school districts, as well as
parents, teachers and students, about the tests.

A Strategy to Master the Basics and Reach High Standards.    The voluntary national tests will provide students,
parents, and teachers with meaningful scores to compare individual student performance to widely accepted
national and international standards and to identify students and schools that need extra help. In addition,
when parents, teachers and students receive test results, they will also learn which questions the student got
right an~ which ones were incorrect. These standard measures of excellence will help teachers and principals
improve curriculum and instruction, give students a guide for charting their own progress, and help parents
hold schools accountable for improved performance.
