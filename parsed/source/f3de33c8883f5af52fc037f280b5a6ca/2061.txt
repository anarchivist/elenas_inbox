TEXT:
The Charter Schools National Study will be back from the printer by May 8,
and folks at Education are anxious to release it, based in part on high
congressional interest.   Among other things, the study will confirm the
need for help with start-up costs, which our budget proposal addresses.
Unfortunately, the Washington State charter schools legislation, for which
we had hoped to do a signing event, appears dead for the year; we are
checking on other states which might pass a bill that we're comfortable wi
th, but for now there's no clear back-up.   I gather that radio addresses
are pretty tight for the next few weeks. Any thoughts on how we could get
the study release on the President's schedule?

Thanks
