Hi.   I just spoke to Sally and informed her that she would be chairing the
H-2A meeting on Monday.· I will give her the DOL memo outlining the "idea
inventory," however she would also like to know, in advance, your
assessment of the different ideas.   She would also like to know what you
would like to corne out of this meeting.  Sally will be in tomorrow morning
but will leave mid-afternoon.

Thanks.

-- Ceci
