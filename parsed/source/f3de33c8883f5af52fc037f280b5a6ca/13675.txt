Elena--
will you please let me know if this response is sufficient for those who
supported the President's veto of the product liability legislation?
thanks,
Jeff
Thank you for your letter regarding the Product Liability Reform
Act of 1996. I appreciate having your perspective on this issue.
While I believe our legal system needs reform, I vetoed the
product liability bill because I concluded that it failed to
provide adequate protection to the interests of consumers, in
addition to the interests of manufacturers and sellers.
Congress could have passed limited, but balanced product
liability reform.  If Congress had done so, I gladly would have
signed the legislation. As I continue working with Congress to
achieve this end, I appreciate knowing your thoughts.
