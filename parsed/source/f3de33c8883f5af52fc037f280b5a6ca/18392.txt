TEXT:
Erskine asked Bruce to follow up on a child nutrition idea put together by
coalition of groups.  Here are a few points:

1.   In essence, the proposal is for universal access to school breakfasts
for kids.

2.    The proposal is the same as the one Glickman pitched to us, pitched
to Chow at OMB yesterday, and supposedly to the President.

3.    None of us (Bruce, OMB and   the President who Barbara Chow   says
hasn't asked for follow-up) have   found it compelling. Mary and    I followed
up on the statistics, which seem   to indicate that kids rate of    having
breakfast wouldn't increase much   with the proposal (most eat at   home if
not at school) and it is costly.

4.    Along with OMB we are looking for some pro-school breakfast
nutrition program that makes sense and is feasible.   We are hoping to get
it done within 3 weeks, we're particularly interested in food safety.

We've talked to OMB, OPL, the leader of the group writing Erskine, and
USDA .
