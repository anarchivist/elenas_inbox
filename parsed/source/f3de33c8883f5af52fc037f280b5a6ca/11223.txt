PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
REMARKS ON LONG-TERM CARE TAX CREDIT
DOVER, NEW HAMPSHIRE
February 18, 1999

          Acknowledgments: Gov. Shaheen; panel members TK

         I want to thank the Governor for her remarks, and I especially
want to thank her for all sheD,s doing to improve the quality and
availability of health care here in New Hampshire.   I think her proposals
are good ones. And I think they will go a long way toward helping the
people of New Hampshire meet the challenges of health care in the 21st
Century.

        Today, before we hear from our panelists, I want to talk briefly
about another health care challenge and what we are doing to meet it. As
the Baby Boom becomes the Senior Boom, long-term care will become a
growing need.  So it is more important than ever that we help families
provide that essential kind of care for their loved ones.

        I will have more to say about that in a moment.  But first, let me
just step back and put this issue in a larger context. Really, what
weD,re talking about this morning is not just health care but the choices
you in New Hampshire are making and people allover America are making' for
the future.

        We in Washington have some choices to make, too. As you know, we
are engaged in a great debate right now about how to use the budget
surplus. Now, we can all agree that America should have tax cuts. But
there are two very different ways we can go about it.  First, there is the


Republican plan. The Republican plan says cut taxes first, save Social
Security later.      Cut taxes first, strengthen Medicare later, if at all
  . . Cut taxes first, pay down the national debt later, if at all.  The
Republican plan says splurge today, save tomorrow.

        That is not my approach. My approach says invest today, save for
tomorrow.  My kind of tax cut is one that doesnD,t destroy our fiscal
discipline, but preserves it. My kind of tax cut is not indiscriminate,
but is, instead, targeted to meet peopleD,s real needs for the future.
Above all, my kind of tax cut wonD,t get in the way of saving Social
Security and Medicare for the 21st Century.

        If we make the right choice, future generations wonD,t say we
squandered our historic opportunity to save Social Security and Medicare,
and pay down the debt. As I said in my State of the Union Address one
month ago, we can make good on that opportunity -- while providing tax
relief like USA Accounts, and while making targeted tax cuts in areas from
urban investment to clean energy technology, and from child care to
long-term care. That is the way we should use our surplus: We should
invest it.  Invest it in AmericaD,s future.
