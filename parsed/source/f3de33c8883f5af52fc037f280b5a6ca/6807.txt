TEXT:
Jerry tells me that you will be there and run the meeting: David Korn is
hosting a meeting this morning to prepare for our meeting. They are
discussing a proposal along the lines we had discussed earlier that
combines FDA regulatory authority with case-by-case review by a body
similar to NIH's Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee (RAC).

This morning I heard of a possible scenario involving attaching a cloning
amendment to an NIH appropriations bill.   In the worst case, there would
be no tobacco money and a continuing resolution until the last minute when
an unvetoable bill would come in with cloning attached.    Sounds like
business as usual.
