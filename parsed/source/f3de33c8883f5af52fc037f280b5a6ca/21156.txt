TEXT:
I wanted to check in with everyone on the status of the pending Air Bags,
Math & Science Awards, and Drug Free Grants events.

Air Bags

Air Bags event is off for tomorrow.  It will be replaced by the Math andd
Science Awards.  Last night, I thought we would just.let DOT announce the
new air bag rule on their own.  Elena said this mornring that she and
Bruce may want to raise the possibility of doing air bags as the Saturday
ra~io address -- so this is just pending for now.   Christa -- will you
let us know if Elena and Bruce are going to push for this to be the radio
address?

Math and Science Awards


The President will award Math and Science Teacher awards in a Roosevelt
Room ceremony tomorrow. We assume the pool will be brought in for remarks
only, but are waiting for OSTP to confirm that they can build a 50 person
audience for the event.  President will announce a new policy to ecourage
more hiring of minorities and women in science and techonolgy areas.
There is a 10:45 am meeting on this event in Stacie's office (Room 173).

Drug-Free Community Grants

Drug-Free Community Grants are still a possibility for Saturday's radio
address, if air bags falls through. Anne McGuire -- please make sure
ONDCP does not confirm plans for the radio address yet. Let me know if
this is a problem.

Thanks, all.
