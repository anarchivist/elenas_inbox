Rahm, Bruce, EK, et.al.:

Attached please find a draft letter threatening to veto the CJS bill if it
includes language on curios and relics.   Peter would like to use this on
the Hill before the CJS conference officially starts next week.    Rahm
said he was okay in principle, and wanted to threaten to veto this
provision when it was on Treasury/Postal.   Peter needs to run it by
Hilley, and everyone else is reviewing it for the first time.

Please let me know what you think.

The Honorable Bob Livingston
Chainnan
Committee on Appropriations
U.S. House of Representatives
Washington, D.C. 20515

Dear Mr. Chainnan:

        The Administration strongly objects to the inclusion of any provision in the FY 1998
Commerce, Justice and State Appropriations Conference Report to allow for the importation of
surplus military weapons. We have repeatedly opposed such provisions, and the President's
senior advisers would recommend that he veto the bill if it includes language that would large
quantities of surplus military weapons to be imported.

         The Administration finds it unacceptable that -- in the same appropriations bill that funds .
the nation's law enforcement priorities, such as putting more police on our streets -- the
Committee is considering language that could flood our streets with millions of military surplus
weapons. These weapons, especially M-l carbines, M-l Garrands and M-1911 .45 caliber
pistols, were designed for military purposes and provided to foreign governments as a fonn of
military aid over the past several decades. Moreover, thousands of these firearms have already
been used in crimes -- including to take the lives of police officers. Opening the door to more of
these weapons would only serve to further undennine public safety.

       We urge the Committee to reject this provision.

                                      Sincerely,



                                      Franklin Raines
