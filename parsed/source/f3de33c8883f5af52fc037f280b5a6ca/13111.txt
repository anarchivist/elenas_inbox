TEXT:
This confirms that you may accept invitations to speak at academic conferences
where it is clear that you are being invited because of your position with the
University of Chicago/your academic persona. As we discussed, however, you may
not accept honoraria for such speaking engagements. If the requesting
organization offers to pay your travel expenses, meals, lodging, you may accept
such payments as a personal gift pursuant to 5CFR 2635.204{e) (2). You should
keep track of gifts the total value of which exceed $250 to be reported on your
annual financial disclosure report.
Any questions, you know where to find me.
