TEXT:
1.  I talked to Dan and after nUmerous conversations Kevin agreed to last
year's needles language.

2.  The vets line:   In my budget, I have proposed expanding emergency
care to high priority veterans.

3.  One other fact issue that I think Chris will bring to your attention.
Electronic records have not increased, but instead decreased threats to
privacy of records.

Thanks.
