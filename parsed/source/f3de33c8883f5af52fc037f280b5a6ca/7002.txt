TEXT:
FYI--the original e-mail is from the exec. dir. of the WH Initiative on
Hispanic Education, which met last week in CA and took the surprising
position of opposing Unz.  In addition to sharing the statement of
opposition with us, the exec. dir (Sarita Brown) alerted us to the
concerns the commission members raised that we might be proposing a "mend
it don't end it" approach to bilingual ed.  I'll spare you the details of
their argument; suffice it to say that their argument makes me look
ultraconservative and will make us all vote for "1 year and your out" out
of frustration!

Thanks.

It concerns me that 1) any position we might take gets out before the
President or Vice President has a chance to think this through; 2)
affirmative action is no less important than bilingual education, and the
president certainly did right by it with a policy of "mend it, don't end
it;"  3) we've met with probably 200 people, and I'd say about 8% of them
thought the bilingual ed. program was in such good shape it could not
benefit from improvements.

Of course, I am no expert on these matters.
