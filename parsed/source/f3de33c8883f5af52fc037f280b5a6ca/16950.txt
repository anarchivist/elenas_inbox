TEXT:
The 4 groups would like to do statements for tomorrow.  They would not be
released until after the event 11:00am. However, to do statements they
need general information. Matt is already set.   Do you mind if I give
ACS, AHA and AMA some general information. As they report, some
information is already floating around outside like the $1.50.  Let me
know.
