Rahm/Bruce/Elena:

While these are only suspensions that will pass overwhelmingly, and our
SAPs are often ignored, I can't believe that they don't have the potential
to come back and haunt us.

Michael/Jack:

I know that tomorrow's suspension calendar for the House is hardly the
most pressing thing around here right now, but I suggest we don't "take
the bait" being offered to us by the R's -- and oppose two bills that will
pass overwhelmingly. They are:

(1) H.R. 3718 -- We should send no SAP on this bill to prevent federal
judges from releasing prisoners early.. While this is a bad piece of
legislation, we have a strong record in this area and shouldn't send up a
SAP in simple opposition that might undermine our record.  Besides,
according to Peter, this is not likely to move in the Senate anytime soon,
so we'll have some time to think about our position.

(2) H.R. 3809 -- Can't we find a way to be more supportive for Custom's


  role in fighting Drugs at the Southwest Border? Opposing this bill
  because it undermines collective bargaining and calls for more overtime,
  while a legitimate concern, only feeds the R's argument that we're not
  serious about fighting drugs at the Border.  Besides, you may want to
  double-check w/Rahm, but last I heard the President was very eager for us
  to focus more on the border, drugs, technology, and I'm not sure he'll
  want to oppose the R's Drug-Free Borders Bill.

  Let me know what you think.

  Jose'
