 TEXT:
 I will drop off some material that identifies some of the major changes in
 the immigration law that are effective April 1st. This material (in
 draft) is the subject of tomorrow's INS briefing for the press and I am
 providing it to you for your information.   The changes are sweeping,
·technical and complicated -- you will see from the material that the
 changes probably defy meaningful summary due to the danger of
 oversimplification. That is one of the reasons that there is so much
 misinformation heightening anxiety in many communities.    (You may have
 seen that the NY INS office has had lines so long that it decided to close
 the office to walk-in traffic.   People now must send in a form.   To get
 the form, they have to call the INS. . But because of the huge demand,
 the telephone lines are likely to be busy. A logistical mess, in other
 words!)   This material reflects only the beginning of the changes that are
 to corne with additional significant national policy and implementation
 issues needing decisions in the immigration area as a result of the new
 law.

I also dropped off in your box the agenda and some material that was
distributed from this week's WH Immigration Core Group Meeting, again just
FYI.

Hope this is helpful.   thanks Elena.
