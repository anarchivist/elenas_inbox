TEXT:
At Bruce's request I've tried to capture the general approach we said we
would use with the civil rights groups today.  I've essentialy laid out
the basic points we want to make, based on what we told POTUS.  I assume
we will discuss the approach in more general and tentative terms, and give
them a chance to have some input:

1. Our intent in ESEA reauthorization is to take a tougher approach to
accountability across the board--for states and school districts, schools,
educators and students. While the 1994 ESEA provides a framework for
tougher accountabilty, we believe it doesnD,t go far enough:
  need faster action than current requirements to intervene in low
performing schools
 Hold up Bill TaylorD,s report and indicate that we know implementation of
current law could be improved

 Highlight our proposal to put $200 million in FY2000 budget [I presume we
donD,t want to give them specific budget figure) and to require states to
immediately identify and begin to intervene in the lowest performing
schools -- those with low tests scores that have not made any improvement
over the past 3 years. We will insist that states rely on whatever tests
are currently in use--even if they are not the final ones required under
ESEA--to meet this requirement.

 Highlight our teacher accountability provisions--require phase out of (1)
teachers on emergency credentials, (2) out-of-field teaching, and (3) use
of instructional aides as lead instructors -- all practices that
disproportionately occur in high poverty schools.

         Point out that we are working on overhauling programs such as
Eisenhower, Goals, etc.--so they help provide the resources to phase out
these practices

 Highlight ending social promotion as part of this.  Talk about linking
promotion policy to implementing steps necessary to help kids meet
standards the first time--expanded Head Start, smaller classes, improved
classroom instruction and better teachers, use of proven practices such as
Success for All, early identification of kids who need help, after-school
and summer school programs, etc.
ARMS                                                                       Page 2 of2


 One issue they will raise is the use of tests --we should ask for their
advice on how to handle this, indicating that we want the tests to be
valid for these purposes, and we like the idea of using O&multiple
measures08 and factors such as teacher judgment.  I think we should use
this as an opportunity to hear what they think.

 I expect they will want to know how we will monitor this requirement --
how we will make sure that states do this the right way. We can talk
about requiring plans that will need to be reviewed and approved against
some criteria of good practices.

Tell them about tomorrow's announcement
