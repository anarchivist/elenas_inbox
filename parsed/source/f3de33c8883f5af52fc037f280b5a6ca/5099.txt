TEXT:
Here's what happened at the tobacco strategy meeting today.

1. Bills. We went over Hatch/Kennedy. Rich reported the bill looked like
$1.50 with .85 cents straight federal share, child care, research money,
and some uncertainty on legal issues. Looks like they like Lugar on
farms (seems unlikely), and no word on international.

2.   Bills.     I went over Lautenberg/Hansen.

3. Bills.   I asked which agencies had been approached for technical
help. The most serious is Treasury which has been approached by Harkin
and Conrad. Larry Sommers is talking to these guys. I gather Bruce.R. is
on top of this one.

 HHS·has been contacted for some additional help as has USDA.  I tried to
stress that when agencies get contacted they need to reach DPC (Bruce)
and make sure we are not making policy choices in these consultations.

4. Medicaid Letter. We talked about the medicaid letter. Jennings
briefed everyone. Bruce Lindsey showed up and seemed comfortable with the
way the letter would be handled.

5. Fourth Circuit. O'hara promised to have some language on dealing with
the 4th Circuit by early next week.

6. Farmers. We talked about the Senate farmers bills. The House
(Baesler) seems to be moving towards something as well. Charlies still
doesn't worry they are building a consensus yet.  I ani a little worried
the farmers are going to have unnaturally high expectations. The bills
are floating around high numbers.

7. Money. Jerry said the vending machine people want $2.4 billion, he
told them to talk to the Hill. OMB mentioned the VA and DOD requests for a
share.

Regards, Tom
