TEXT:
The Senate is expected to consider the Defense FY99 Appropriations bill
early this week,  Could you also provide comments/clearance on the
attached Senate SAP by noon tomorrow, Tuesday (6/23),  Many thanks.

    S. 2132 -- DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS BILL, FY 1999
(Sponsor:  Stevens (R), Alaska)


        This Statement of Administration Policy provides the
AdministrationD,s views on S. 2132, the Department of Defense
Appropriations Bill, FY 1999, as reported by the Senate Appropriations
Committee,   Your consideration of the AdministrationD,s views would be
appreciated.

        The Committee has developed a bill providing requested funding for
many of the AdministrationD,s priorities. We appreciate the CommitteeD,s
decision to fully fund the military pay raise and readiness programs at
requested levels. Also, we are pleased that most of the modernization


 priorities of the Department of Defense'are funded at or near requested
 levels. However, the Administration is disappointed that the Senate,
 based on OMB's preliminary scoring, has provided $436 million below the
 President's overall request for this bill due to increases in lower
 priority military construction projects. Also, as discussed below, the
 Administration has serious concerns about certain provisions included in
 the Committee bill, which must be addressed satisfactorily as the bill
 moves through the process.

 Funding for Bosnia

          The Administration regrets that the Committee has not included
 funding for our ongoing operations in Bosnia. U.S. military presence,
 albeit at lower force levels, is critical for continued progress in
 implementing the Dayton Peace Accords. Although funding requirements for
 operations in Bosnia were not known when the FY 1999 Budget was prepared,
 the Administration created a funding reserve in the budget to cover these
 costs, and on March 3, 1998, the President requested funding for this
 purpose. A secure funding source at the start of the fiscal year allows
 the Department to manage its readiness accounts effectively throughout the
 year.   The Administration strongly urges the Congress to provide emergency
 funding in the Defense Appropriations bill to support the U.S. troops in
 Bosnia.

 Unrequested Funding

         The Committee bill increases funding for programs that due to
 higher priority military requirements are not in the Future Years Defense
 Program (FYDP), or, that should not be funded at the expense of DoDD,s FY
 1999 requirements. These increases include $50 million for C-130J airlift
 aircraft, $287 million for National Guard and Reserve equipment (not
 including C-130 aircraft), $94 million for the Space Based Laser program,
 and $50 million for advance procurement of the LHD-8 amphibious ship.
 Moreover, to complete procurement of the LHD-8, extensive funding will be
 required in later years. These increases would be at the expense of
 higher priority defense programs.

 Reduction in Request for Intelligence Budget

         The Administration objects to the Committee's significant
 reduction to the FY 1999 funding request for U.S. intelligence. The
 CommitteeD,s reduction would slow the Administration'S efforts to
 strengthen the Intelligence Community. The Administration urges the
 Senate to appropriate the full amount of. the President's request to ensure
 that the Intelligence Community can meet the most pressing needs of our
 national policy makers and combatant commanders. The Director of Central
 Intelligence will provide additional detail on these classified issues
 prior to the conference on the Defense appropriations bill.

 O&M Adjustments

          The Administration appreciates the billD,s emphasis on preserving
 military readiness through strong funding of most O&M programs.   However,
 force readiness could be threatened by the billD,s reductions to other O&M
 efforts, such as civilian personnel pay. The presidentD,s request is very
 tightly constructed within the discretionary caps agreed to in the
 Bipartisan Budget Agreement.   Any adjustments must be carefully evaluated
 to ensure that sufficient funding is available for DoD operations and
 support programs. The Administration is also concerned that additional
 restrictions may be placed on O&M accounts that would further hinder the
·
       ability of field level commanders to meet mission requirements quickly in
       a constantly changing environment. The Administration would like to work
       with the Congress to address these issues prior to final congressional
       action on the bill.

       Reduced Funding for the Next-Generation Aircraft Carrier

               The Committee bill would reduce funding for research and
       development of CVX-78, the next-generation aircraft carrier, by $116
       million, a 61-percent decrease from the President'l,s request. A reduction
       of this magnitude would jeopardize the Navy's ability to design and
       deliver new aircraft carrier technologies and would make it difficult to
       achieve life-cycle cost reductions, a major goal of the aircraft carrier
       development program. The Administration urges the Senate to restore
       funding to this important development effort.

       Reduced Funding for Dual Use R&D

               The Committee has provided $36 million for the Dual Use
       Applications Program, $30 million below the President's request, and $73
       million for the Commercial Operations and Support Savings Initiative, $30
       million below the request.  The Administration urges full support of these
       programs, which are needed to ensure that DoD systems employ technologies
       used in commercial products to good advantage. These dual-use
       technologies will help lower production and support costs and help
       modernize many DoD systems more readily than could be done through use of
       DoD-unique technologies.

       Next Generation Internet

               The Committee has provided only $30 million for Next Generation
       Internet (NGI) funding, $10 million less than requested.  Funding this
       program will support research into high-rate data networking technologies
       that will be needed by DoD's information-intensive systems in the near
       future.  The Administration urges full funding of the NGI request.
