MEMORANDUM FOR DISTRIBUTION

FROM:            KRIS M. BALDERSTON
                 SEAN P. O'SHEA

SUBJECT:         Agency Updates - Columbine School Shooting Relief Efforts

The last of the funerals for the victims of Columbine is scheduled   for
today.

A memorial services will be held this Sunday at Red Rock to include the
students, faculties, and parents.  It is expected to be sponsored by the
Jefferson County school system and will be closed to outsiders.

OPL joined the call today to gather information so as to direct callers
offering assistance in responding to the shootings.  Each agency will
provide contact names and numbers so OPL may direct callers
appropriately.  In addition, OPL will forward printed materials to those
agencies as they are gathered. There are essentially two types of
inquiries: offers of counseling assistance (which we are forwarding to the
state of Colorado) and proposals for legislation and new initiatives
(which we will forward to the appropriate agencies and DPC) .

The local officials have asked for help in archiving some of the articles
left at memorial sites near and around Columbine High School.  We are
contacting the National Park'Service to see if they can be of assistance.

The Department of Education

Bill Modzeleski, of DOEd's Safe and Drug Free Schools, recently returned
from two days of meetings at Columbine officials.   Students and faculty
will return to Columbine tomorrow and throughout the weekend to retrieve
materials such as backpacks, lesson plans, books, schedules, etc. needed
to restart their teaching and learning efforts.   Student and teachers
will begin classes on Monday at nearby Chatfield High School.

Secretary Riley will participate in a discussion with students, teachers,
and faculty tomorrow, April 30, at Walt Whitman High School in Maryland.
The Secretary will then hold a press availability afterwards.

To date, the State of Colorado has provided $1 million in discretionary
state funding to help respond to this crisis.   School damage is estimated
to be around $5 million (although the exact estimates will not be
available until the crime scene has been cleared) .

For parents and others interested in gathering information on guides they
may call 1-800-USA-LEARN.


The Department of Health and Human Services

On Friday, April 30, United Way will host a meeting to outline efforts to
distribute contributions that have been collected over the past week.

On Wednesday, May 5, from 1:00-3:00pm, the Governor's Task Force will
convene in Colorado to discuss long term recovery efforts.
