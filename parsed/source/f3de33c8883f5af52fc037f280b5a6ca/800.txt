As you know, Secretary Shala1a is scheduled to testify on the Medicare,
Medicaid, and welfare proposals included in the President's FY98 Budget on
Wednesday before the House Ways and Means Committee and on Thursday before
the Senate Finance Committee.     I have just faxed you a copy of the
proposed OMB passback on the welfare-related portion of the HHS
testimony.   Please provide me with comments on this draft by 11 a.m. today
     Thank you.
