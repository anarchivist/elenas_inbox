TEXT:
Hotline summary of KY politics on farmers.  This is a pretty great issue
for them -- you can see Bunning immediately distanced himself from
McConnel.
It is the big issue there right now.


Tobacco On The Attack-O
                  Louisville Courier-Journal's Eagles & Wilson report,
Baesler "motored around
           west-central" KY in a pickup," Owen "headed to his hometown of
Lexington," and
           Henry "worked the phones" as all three Dems "defended the
tobacco price-support
           program" following Sen. Mitch McConnell's (R) "surprise
announcement" 5/18 "that he
           will join" Sen. Richard Lugar (R-IN) "in proposing to abolish
it." Baesler called
           McConnell a "turncoat," saying he has "really done farmers a
disservice ... [GOPers
           have] turned their back on the farmer." Owen: "It will
devastate Kentucky'S small
           tobacco farmers and our rural communities." Henry: "At the most
critical time in the last
           50 years ... he walked away." Bunning: "[I am] firmly committed
to doing everything
           humanly possible to preserve the tobacco program" (5/20).
Lexington Herald-Leader's
           Muhs and Brammer report that Owen accused McConnell of "playing
for national
           attention" with his proposal. Baesler continued to "emphasize
his background as the only
           tobacco farmer in Congress" (5/20).

           McConnell's Gamble
                 McConnell's "retreat on a government program long
considered sacrosanct in


           Kentucky" is "one of the biggest gambles of his political
career." McConnell's "bombshell
           infuriated leaders of the state's leading tobacco-growing
group, who predicted rural
           Kentucky voters will punish" GOPers in the '98 elections "for
McConnell's abandonment
           of the tobacco price-support program in a time of peril." Dems,
"who for years have
           been on the defensive" on national issues in KY, "clearly
sensed an opening." All three
           Dems "excoriated McConnell" and "laid plans for to keep
hammering on the issue in the
           final week of their primary race." But McConnell "insisted he
was acting" in KY's
           interests. He cast himself as "a political realist and straight
shooter." McConnell: "[It is)
           politically impossible to keep the program." More McConnell:
"You have to ask yourself,
            'If there isn't a corn program, will there be a tobacco
program?' I think the answer to that
           is no" (Garrett, Courier-Journal, 5/20). Herald-Leader's Gibson
reports that "while
           McConnell argues that the death of the price-support program is
imminent in today's
           anti-tobacco political environment," retiring Sen. wendell Ford
(D) "thinks it can be
           preserved for years to come." The McConnell-Ford split "marks a
first in the history of
           tobacco policy debates," as "no two Kentucky Senators have ever
been on opposite
           sides of this issue" (5/20).
