TEXT:
I talked to Ann Lewis about the radio address on Dec. 19th, and she
thought that if there was no FAA announcement we should get the HUD
Homeless grants ready for that date.  Also, she did not think the
President should make any policy announcements at his service/shelter
visit on Dec. 21 (which is why now the HUD grants need their own date) .
