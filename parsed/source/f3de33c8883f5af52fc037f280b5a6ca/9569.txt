TEXT:
Based some additional discussions with Treasury, Jon and I think we should
include a paragraph about EFT '99 in the IDA/Head Start Reauthorization
bill signing event.  This is in part because Treasury has already
announced the overall approach and is on the air with public service
announcements.  EFT '99 is complementary to IDAs, and we could have the
President announce that shortly Treasury will be issuing regulations and
guidelines describing the EFT account.
