TEXT:
Negotiations in the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee on
SUperfund reauthorization ended last week.  Last week, Administrator
Browner and Sens. Baucus and Lautenberg responded to the "global offer"
presented by Committee Republicans. Senators Chafee and Smith have
decided not to respond to the Democratic offer.  They indicated that
mark-up of a Superfund Reathorization bill should not be expected this
year.

In the House, Chairman Boehlert has indicated that the Transportation and
Infrastructure Subcommittee on Water Resources and the Environment will
proceed to a mark-up on this week.  Subcommittee minority and majority
staff are caucusing this week to discuss the differences between Rep.
Boehlert's bill and Rep. Borski's position on reauthorization.

In the House Commerce Committee, Rep. Bliley has still not rescheduled a
10/30 hearing to focus on the majority's proposals on remedy and community
and state role issues. However, Finance and Hazardous Materials
Subcommittee Chairman Oxley has indicated that he plans to introduce
Superfund reauthorization proposals in the near future.  His bill is
expected to be co-sponsored by a number of "blue dog" Democrats. EPA has
not been given the opportunity to review his proposal.
