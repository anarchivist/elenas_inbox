Subject:          Gov Patton


        I understand that you have been made aware that Gov Paul Patton is
quite upset with the Administration over a number of recent events and
policy announcements. His anger boiled over in a meeting today with Nancy
Ann and the senior staff of HCFA where he angrily stormed out and then
colorfully expressed his anger to me in the hall. It had been building
over the past few months. A brief synopsis:

1. Kentucky CHIP. Kentucky recently had its state CHIP plan approved but
the plan did not include coverage of the dependents of Kentucky state
employees. The state originally believed it had been assured by HCFA that
the children of state employees would receive coverage and had represented
that widely in state legislative hearings when Kentucky passed its plan.
When it was learned that this assumption was wrong, the Kentucky
legislature and the Kentucky Teachers Assoc. went nuts. This is the
pressure Patton is reacting to.
        The federal law says that the federal govt. cannot cover the
dependents of state employees where the state already does so or provides
a benefit to the employee that can be used to cover their dependents.  In
Kentucky the state provides a cash stipend that is used by the employee to
cover the cost of insurance. The weighted average cost of a state
employees insurance package is $199 and the state employee subsidy is
$203. (So the average net subsidy "benefit" is $4)  All of the printed
materials given to employees are drafted to assume this stipend covers
only the.employee. sut, since it is possible for a state employee to opt
for one of the less expensive plans and then have a cash/stipend balance
which could be used for additional coverage for kids,  HCFA concludes
that a dependent benefit has been achieved and therefore the feds cannot
cover the kids. The goal of the law was to prevent the states from using
federal money to replace pre-existing state commitments.
        Kentucky points out that only a small minority of the 160,000
state employees buy a smaller policy than what the stipend covers, and
those that do usually first add spousal coverage not dependent coverage.


So, if in fact their are cases where state money is being used by
individual employees to buy dependent coverage, it is very few and the
dollars used to do so are tiny. Of particular frustration is that HCFA has
approved two state plans (NC and Mississippi) which are similar except
they provide their employees a plan itself rather than a subsidy to pay
for the plan. The Governor sees HCFA as turning him - and the kids of
Kentucky - down for coverage over the $4 difference.
        The two obvious remedies are (1) Kentucky can change its state
law, and (2) the Congress can change the federal law.  Neither are likely
to be achieved before Governor Patton's 1999 election date.
        If you want more, Chris Jennings and I will come up and brief you.

2. Kentucky Locks. The Governor has asked for our commitment to allocate
$20 million in FY 2000 for the replacement of the 60 year old lock on the
Tennessee River at the Kentucky Dam which is the linchpin for Commerce
moving between the Ohio River and the Tennessee River. In the last two
years he made a similar request but we did not include this in our 98 or
99 budget. Sen. McConnell inserted approx. 8.4 million in last years
budget and 4.2 mil in the 98 budget.   Elgie Holstein informs us that this
year we will include between 8 and 10 million for the lock. This is less
than what the Gov is seeking, but is very helpful, and I suspect a smart
hedge against another McConnell budget addition.

3. Transportation money. Last year, DOT awarded discretionary grants under
section 1101 of the TEA-21 Act to all but three states. Kentucky was one
of the 3 states.  (I can give you DOT's individual justifications for each
proposed project denial if you need them) Unfortunately this was more
painful because Gov Patton was the lead Governor on Transportation and was
very active in the lobbing for TEA 21. DOT is currently looking at the
next batch of awards for next year.

4. EPA Air regs. As the Governor of a coal state, Patton lobbied hard
against the recently promulgated rule on NOX emissions. He argued for less
stringent standards, and was frustrated that the decision process did not
permit him to make his case directly to the President. His industry feels
as though he was unable to use his "clout" with the democratic
administration to adequately convey the economic harm the new regs will do
to his eneergy producers.

As you can see, we have had a string of bad luck. In addition, of course
he hasn't been thrilled with much of our position on tobacco.

NOw, all of this is not to say that we haven't had successes. We have
worked with him successfully on federal funding for his home visitation
project and early childhood development proposal, for his VINE program on
sex offenders, Appalachian Regional Council (ARC) reform, etc. and he has
been included in a number of high profile events at the White House. We
have a warm personal relationship, and Audrey's joining MEGs staff has
assured that good relations remain.  But he is hoppin' mad on the "big"
issues and is seeking our help.
