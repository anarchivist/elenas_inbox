     TEXT:
             You are invited to a meeting in 472 OEOB, Thursday, 9/10, at 3:00,
     to talk about RLPA. As you may know, the House Constitution Subcommittee
     recently reported RLPA favorably, but the committee split along party
     lines. All the Republicans voted for it; all the Democrats voted no (or in
     the case of Nadler, a co-sponsor, voted present). We understand the Senate
     Judiciary Committee may mark it up soon as well. Hatch and Kennedy are
     co-sponsors, but the same concerns that troubled House Democrats will
     probably arise in the Senate, too.
              As you will recall, RLPA responds to the Supreme Court's decision
     striking down RFRA, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. RFRA was
     intended to restore a constitutional standard that the Court had followed
     for many years, which gave substantial protection to religious liberties.
     However, the Court struck down most of the provisions of the statute on
     the grounds that Congress does not have the power to define the reach of
     the Fourteenth Amendment. RLPA is intended to provide another basis for
     Congress to act to achieve the same goals.
              The President strongly supported RFRA and, therefore, we have
     supported the goals of RLPA, too. We have worked with the coalition of
     religious organizations supporting the bill. They are still supportive,
     though some have concerns about the form in which the bill was reported in
     the House. However, some civil rights groups, particularly those in the
     gay community, have recently raised concerns about the effects of RLPA on
     civil rights laws, such as local ordinances banning discrimination in
     housing. In addition, the Constitution Subcommittee deleted the Commerce
     Clause as a basis for Congressional power to enact the bill, leaving only
     the Spending Clause as a basis.  This, too, raises some concerns about the
     ultimate effect and constitutionality of the bill. All these developments


suggest that we talk about the administration's position and approach to
the bill.
        If this suggested time creates a problem, would you please let me
know, or ask your scheduler to work Alissa BrowT., 62615.
