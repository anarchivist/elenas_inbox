TO:   DIRECTOR FRANK RAINES
  DEPUTY DIRECTOR JACK LEW
  DEPUTY DIRECTOR JOHN KOSKINEN

FROM: OMB LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS

DATE: MAY 13, 1997

SUBJECT:   LEGISLATIVE REPORT


Hearings

Affairs DC Subcommittee regarding the AdministrationD,s DC Revitalization
Plan.

The House Budget Committee is currently still scheduled to hold their markup of
the budget resolution tomorrow afternoon.

Deputy Director Jack Lew testifies on Thursday, May 15th, before the
Subcommittee on Public Buildings and Economic Development of the Committee on

The Bosnia/Disaster Supplemental
The House Rules Committee today approved a rule for consideration of H.R. 1469,
the Supplemental Appropriations Bill for FY 1997.
  [House Rules SAP sent, 5/13: Presidential veto over automatic CR issue]

Upon adoption of the Rule, the following two items are approved: 1) the
Riggs/Kaptur/Roukema amendment to increase WIC funding from $38 million to $76
million, offset by a NASA windtunnels rescission, and 2) drop the $1.7 million
of FEC funding.

The Committee made the following amendments in order:
o Spence/Gilman/Solomon amendment, which would prohibit the use of any funds
for troops in Bosnia after June 30, 1998, with a limited exception for
protecting citizens and diplomats, and a 30 day extension if the President
certifies that certain conditions necessitate the extension.   (Rumors are,
however, that while the amendment was made in order, it may not be offered.)

o Gekas automatic continuing resolution provision (the Senate version)

o Neumann amendment to strike $2.4 billion of FEMA funding, strike the $3.8
billion HUD assisted housing rescission and substitute a $3.6 billion
unallocated rescission of non- defense discretionary funding (requiring the
President to make such reductions) .

o Thune/Pomeroy amendment to transfer $500 million from FEMA disaster relief
to CDBG

o Solomon amendment to reduce Nunn/Lugar funding by $600-700 million and
restore $600-700 million of Committee rescissions of specific projects.

o Diaz-Balart/Meek amendment to extend SSI benefits to the end of FY97 for
legalized aliens

o McKeon amendment for $650,000 for a higher education commission

o Dingell amendment to provide $300,000 for Monroe County, Michigan for costs
incurred by the Comair crash.

Amendments were not made in order regarding 1) limitations on census sampling,
2) the Texas public assistance program, 3) the wilderness right-of-way (RS2477)
issue, and 4) the Goodling amendment to prohibit the use of funds for education
testing.

The following five provisions of the committee bill are not protected under the
rule, .and are expected to be stricken on points of order: 1) Conservation
Reserve Program limitation (Representative Bob Smith expected to strike), 2)
Endangered Species Act compromise language, 3) the currency paper procurement
