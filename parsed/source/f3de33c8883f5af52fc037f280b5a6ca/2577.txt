TEXT:
One borderline education question that we think the President is fairly
likely to get and which Mike and I do not have much on is: How will you
protect children against indecency and other harmful aspects of the
Internet? I believe the POTUS signed legislation on this and we are
fighting a court challenge to the legislation.  Do you know if we have a
stock Q&A on this? Is there someone in the counsel's office we should
talk to?

This was on the list of primarily non-education questions I e-mailed to
you yesterday, but I wanted to draw special attention to it especially
because one of the things we will be highlighting in West Virginia is all
that they are doing on educational technology.

Thanks.
