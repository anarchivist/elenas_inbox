Update on radio address ...

You should both have the draft I-pager and speech. Please review if you
can. NB: DOJ called me a short bit ago to say that their numbers are
wrong, and that they will get us the best numbers possible tomorrow before
noon.  It's likely that the overall number of checks will go up, but that
the denials will go down significantly -- maybe to about 200. As long as
we can show that 100+ criminals were stopped in the first three days, and
that most law abiding gun owners got their guns w/little or no delay, I
think we're in good shape.

Two notes on the lawsuit language:   (1) EK, I may need you to speak w/Rob
weiner.   I gave him a heads up tonight because I expect him to be more
helpful than DOJ, but I we'll need your help in nailing this language
down.   (2) FYI -- DOJ will file its response to the NRA's lawsuit on
Monday.

Let's chat in the morning ... jc3
