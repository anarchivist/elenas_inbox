     DRAFT STATEMENT BY THE PRESIDENT



     "I am pleased that today's decision by the Supreme Court in Bragdon v. Abbott
     reinforces the protections offered by the landmark Americans With Disabilities Act for
     Americans living with HIV disease and AIDS.     The ADA was enacted with strong
     bi-partisan support to protect Americans with disabilities from discrimination. The
     Administration filed a brief in this case arguing successfully that people with HIV are
     disabled whether or not they are symptomatic, and that the protections offered by the
     ADA therefore apply.


     I want to assure all Americans with disabilities, including those living with HIV disease
     and AIDS, that this Administration is firmly committed to protecting them from
     discrimination. Today's decision will assist us in fulfilling that commitment."
