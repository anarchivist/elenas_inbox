TEXT:
I sat down with Tom Kalil today. Sperling asked Kalil to draft a memo to
the President on the virtual university by Friday ( Sperling evidently .
asked NEC staff for memos for POTUS on each of the topics they worked on
in the SOTU memo-- he's also doing one on teacher technology).  I
emphasized ways to make it easier for students to use t~e virtual
university (improve student aid, clarify accredition-- not subsidizing new
software). I n addition, in response to the President's query in the
memo, its worth brainstorming on how this could fit with other
Administration thermes such as welfare reform, or helping workers retrain
to improve their skills. We are doing a conference call with Roemer this
week, and sitting down with him next week.
