TEXT:
Here is a very draft proposal to increase funding for homeless veterans
programs that Tom and I have been working on. The cost is about $50-$60
million per year, as it is drafted.  It would try to reach thousands more
homeless veterans per year.  If this is something you're interested in, we
should push VA to include it in·their FY2000 budget.    Thanks, Mary;;;;============

         This is a very rough draft of an initiative that we received from the VA to address more
fully the needs of homeless veterans. According to the Federal Plan to Break the Cycle of
Homelessness, there are as many as 600,000 homeless persons on any given night. The National
Coalition of Homeless Veterans estimates that there are 275,000 homeless veterans on any given
night. They estimate that there would be double that number over the course of a year. This
initiative would reach                  additional veterans per year for a total of -------------.

I.     FEDERAL PROGRAMS TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS

        The McKinney Act, which was enacted in 1987, is the major federal legislation
addressing homelessness. McKinney funding for targeted homeless assistance has increased
dramatically, from $490 million in FY 1987 to            in FY 1998. The McKinney Act grant
assistance programs fund activities that provide homeless men, women, and children, with
emergency food and shelter, surplus goods and property, transitional housing, some supportive
housing, primary health-care services, mental health care, alcohol and drug abuse treatment,
education, and job training. HUD currently administers nearly 70 percent check of the
McKinney Act funds, or spends approximately $1 billion on homelessness per year (OMB).

      The total V A budget for Homeless is $90 million per year check. There are three major
VA programs that work with the homeless:

       1.     Grant per diam. This program gives grants to community-based organizations to
              acquire transitional beds. In FY 94 through FY 97, 101 grants were awarded to
              84 non-profit or state or local government agencies in 36 states. There is $5
              million per year for new grants. Pays up to $16/day for ongoing operational
              costs.

       2.     Homeless Chronically Mentally III Veterans Program. The HCMI program
              places homeless veterans needing more intensive treatment into one of its roughly
              125 contracted community-based facilities. The program serves over 19,000
              homeless veterans per year, with over 3,000 receiving residential treatment. The
              average cost per day is $38.
       3.     Domiciliary Care. Treatment takes place in approximately 1500 dedicated beds
              at VA medical center domiciliaries.


SPECIFIC PROPOSAL FROM VETERANS AFFAIRS

A.     Increase Funding for VA's Homeless Grant and Per Diem Program


                                                              Automated Records Management System

                                                              Hex-DlIIllp Conversion
This program allows for the provision of grants and per diem payments to assist public and
non-profit organizations establish and operate new supportive housing and service centers for
homeless veterans. Since the first round of funding in 1994, the V A has awarded 101 grants to
84 community agencies in 36 states and the District of Columbia. Total VA funding for these
projects was over $21 million, or approximately $5 million annually. When these projects are
completed, approximately 1,700 new community-based beds will be available for homeless
veterans. With the current round of funding that number is expected to grow to 2,200 beds in
the future.

1.     Increase funding for new grants by $7 million. This additional $7 million, added to
       the $5 million already funded by the V A for a total of $12 million, would create
       approximately 1000-5000 new beds annually with services for homeless veterans. 75%
       ofthe beds would be for VA-eligible persons.

2.     Increase per diem funding by $7 million. This funding is for ongoing operations, and
       it subsidizes providers, paying no more than one-half of their operating costs. Currently,
       approximately 5,500 veterans receive services from existing programs. Check: [It costs
       approximately $6,000 per year to pay per diem to service providers on an annualized
       basis. This would pay for approximately 2,250 different veterans receiving care from
       VA. Check 2250 x 6000 = 13,500,000] Within 2 years, more 10,000 homeless veterans
       annually could be completing treatment in V A quality-approved community setting
       operated by nonprofit entities, Native American tribes, or state and local governments.

3.     Provide $5 million in new per diem funding. P.L. 102-590 that created the Homeless
       Grant and Per Diem Program did not require an entity to receive a grant in order to be
       eligible for per diem; however, V A, by regulation and in an attempt to protect its grant
       investment, has limited per diem to programs that receive a grant. This would help to
       pay for care of approximately 2000 veterans in non-grantee, yet V A-approved,
       community-based programs.

Part A summary: $24 million in funding ($19 million if existing $5 million not counted) for
treatment and services for more than 5,000 veterans annually with service provided in
community-based settings.

B.     Increase Funding for Dedicated Staff and Contract Care Dollars at Each VA
       Medical Center.

Background

There are approximately 171 VA Medical Centers across the country. At 61 of these centers,
there are dedicated staff with contract dollars to buy services from community service providers
for homeless veterans. At those sites approximately 75 veterans are serviced at each site for an


                                                2              Automated Records Management System
                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion
without contract care money.

1.     Increase funding by $27 million so that each of the approximately 171 V A Medical
       Centers in the country will have dedicated staff and contract dollars to address the
       needs of homeless veterans.        If this proposal is initiated with an average of 1.5 FTE
       per site for a cost of $100,000 annually and contract care dollars for residential contract
       care and transportation for a cost of $150,000 per site annually, there would be, for the
       first time, a comprehensive nationwide system to address the needs of homeless veterans
       by having dedicated staff at each VA Medical Center. Costs are approximately $250,000
       annually per site. Check{This would allow as many as 6,000 new veterans to be treated
       in community residential settings. A total of up to 12,000 homeless veterans could be
       treated annually under this program by expanding the existing program} New: Dedicated
       staff at all VA Medical Centers would mean that more than 100,000 veterans could be
       seen and interviewed by V A clinicians in outreach activities over a three-year period.
       The additional staff (150 FTE) would, on average spend half their time on outreach
       activities thereby seeing an additional 10,200 veterans each year or more than 30,000
       veterans over a three-year peirod.

2.     Provide $2 million in new funding for Homeless Women Veterans Programs. These
       funds would be used to develop up to 20 new programs for outreach, case management,
       and to provide residential care for homeless women veterans. Less than 3 percent of
       veterans treated under current programs are women. Special programs are needed
       because current offerings are male dominated making many women veterans
       uncomfortable, particularly considering a high rate of sexual trauma among women
       veterans. These programs would be largely contracted community care. The
       Department of Veterans Affairs estimates that up to 1,000 women veterans could be
       served under this initiative.

3.     Provide $2 million in new funding for Compensated Work Therapy. VA's medical
       care program offers Compensated Work Therapy (CWT) to help homeless veterans
       become gainfully employed. This program offers many veterans with significant barriers
       to employment, particularly homelessness, with job readiness experiences. At present,
       this program helps approximately 3,500 check veterans annually to be able to move
       directly into competitive work in the community, and helps another 10,000 who need
       additional skills development and training. This program ties very closely with a number
       of programs at the Department of Labor to help veterans gain employment. The V A
       estimates that an additional $2 million could help more than 2,000 veterans by expanding
       ten sites and ten program augmentations of CWT sites. Check if this is 20 or just 10?

Part B summary: $31 million in funding to provide a V A continuum of care for all check the
word "all" veterans, including some hard-to-reach rural and women veterans with an estimated
9,000 new veterans being assisted.

1.   Increase funding by $10 million for the Homeless Veterans Reintegration Program
     (HVRP). The Department of Labor's Homeless Veterans Reintegration Program
     (HVRP) provides grants to community-based, nonprofit organizations that work directly
     with homeless veterans. Currently, this program receives $2.5 million and has 2
     operating sites. The VA estimates that an increase offunding of $1 0 million for a total
     of $12.5 million would permit grants to be awarded to one or more projects in
     approximately 37 states. The VA estimates that with an additional $10 million would
     allow up to 100 grantees to be funded and that up to 45,000 veterans could be served with
     up to 30,000 placed back on the employment rolls over a three-year period.

2.   Provide an additional $2.5 million for Stand Downs. At almost 100 sites across the
     country each year, community-sponsored events called "Stand Downs" bring homeless
     veterans together with community-based service providers; state and local government
     service providers; VA health care and benefits staff; and many others prepared to assist
     homeless veterans and their families with housing, health care, employment, legal
     matters, education, transportation, and other barriers preventing them from reintegrating
     into the social mainstream. The V A estimates that, with an additional $2.5 million, more
     than 100 sites would be able to conduct these one-stop service delivery programs for
     homeless veterans. A three-year study of227 events showed that more than 80,000
     veterans and their family members were assisted by these events. The VA proposes that
     these additional funds could be used to help between 25,000 and 50,000 veterans attend
     "Millennium Stand Downs," which is a White House project (involving Dena Wood and
     John Hanson) with a goal of ensuring that all veterans will have safe lodging and will be
     able to secure treatment at the Millennium. The V A estimates that over a three-year
     period, between 50,000 and 100,000 veterans could be engaged in first-step recovery
     activities.

3.   Fund an additional $0.5 million to provide excess property to homeless veterans.
     The VA, along with the General Services Administration and the Department of Defense,
     provide excess property each year to homeless veterans. Primarily, this program
     provides clothing such as boots, hats, coats, pants, shirts, and other excess military
     personal clothing items. However, sleeping bags, blankets and other items are
     sometimes available as well. A current inventory lists over 220 items with a total value
     of more than $11 million. This Hammer Award-winning program has distributed more
     than $35 million of property to homeless veterans during the last four years. The VA
     proposes a new initiative to add donated civilian clothing, furniture, and equipment to
     assist thousands of homeless veterans and community-based homeless veterans service
     providers. The VA estimates that an additional $0.5 million could secure additional
     warehouse space and pay for shipping costs associated with this initiative and could help
     approximately 25,000 to 50,000 veterans. The V A estimates that approximately 70,000

Part C summary: $3.5 million in funding for VA and $10 million for the Department of
Labor for job training and services for more than 115,000 homeless veterans annually. While
some of these veterans may be duplicated, it would certainly represent the largest commitment
ever made to improve the lives of homeless veterans.                                      .

D.     Improvement ofHUD's McKinney Act Funding Sources for Veterans.

Background:

Veteran-specific HUD McKinney Act funded projects are disproportionately under funded, and
many projects claiming to be veterans' projects are not really targeted to veterans. After HUD's
last round of funding, the VA contacted each of the projects listed by HUD as veteran-targeted or
veteran-specific and found that many were not targeted or designed to serve veterans.
According to information supplied by HUD, more than $21 million was earmarked for "veteran"
projects; however, V A discovered that more than $9.5 million was not available for veterans. In
its assessment, the VA excluded projects where less than one-third of their clients would be
veterans. In fact, the VA found that many of the projects stated that no veterans or less than ten
percent of the population to be served were expected to be veterans.

1.     Veteran representation on HUD's local planning boards. Veterans Service
       Organizations believe that there is a strong need to have veterans' advocates at the local
       level because there is no existing mechanism to assist veterans at the national level to
       ensure that the needs of homeless veterans are addressed.

2.     Require HUD to use the "CHALENG for Veterans" Report. For more than four
       years, VA has conducted meetings with strong participation from the veterans community
       in order to examine the services available locally for homeless veterans, identify the
       unmet needs of homeless veterans, and develop local action plans to address those unmet
       needs. This meeting and report called "CHALENG for Veterans" occurs at each V A
       medical center across the country and contains local resource information and a "veterans
       community view" of the unmet needs of veterans in the area. The overall information is
       folded into a national report. The V A proposes to require HUD and its local planning
       process to use the "CHALENG for Veterans" report to ensure that the needs of homeless
       veterans will be met under HUD's local continuum of care plans. As with any reporting
       system, the weight each community would give to this information would vary; however,
       the V A believes that it is imperative that this information be available.

3.     Provide an additional $4 million to HUD-V ASH. In this joint Supported Housing
       program with the Department of Housing and Urban Development, V A staff at 35 V A

                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion
       homeless veterans in permanent housing supported by nearly 2,000 specially-designed
       HUD rental assistance vouchers. Long-term housing has been identified as one of the
       top unruet needs of veterans for several years in the CHALENG report. Each VA
       employee, usually a social worker, manages approximately 30 voucher recipients. The
       VA estimates that up to 500 HUD Section 8 vouchers are expected to expire in the near
       future. The V A proposes that all current vouchers for veterans should be held and that
       more vouchers should be offered for seriously mentally and physically ill homeless
       veterans. The VA recommends that thirty additional sites be added and that 1,800
       vouchers be added. The V A estimates that an additional $4 million will permit
       approximately 1,800 veterans to gain long-term housing which will reduce their
       dependence on the V A health care system. [HUD costs associated with this proposal
       have not be estimated.]

4.     Americorps. Military service and civilian volunteer service are highly compatible under
       the Corporation for National Service's "Collaboration for Homeless Veterans." LA
       VETS is a National Direct grantee from the Corporation and operates a highly effective
       program with approximately 90 full-time members. Approximately 40 percent of those
       members are veterans and many of those veterans have been homeless. The V A
       estimates that a near tripling of full-time members to 250 nationwide would mean
       operating programs in at least 20 states and providing outreach and coordinating
       community resources with VA health care for at least 50,000 homeless veterans.


Part D summary: $4 million in funding to provide long-term housing for approximately 1,800
veterans.

FINAL COSTS/SUMMARY

This proposal would constitute the single largest investment into breaking the cycle of
home1essness among veterans. This proposal seeks to increase residential alternatives,
community-based contracted care, job preparation activities, stand down activities, the
distribution of clothing, and long-term housing. This proposal is estimated to positively impact
100,000 to 150,000 veterans annually. Additional funding for the VA would be $60.5 million
and additional funding for the Department of Labor's Homeless Veterans Reintegration Program
(HVRP) would be $10 million. HUD's Section 8 costs are not contained in this estimate. [There
appears to be a significant effort to increase section 8 long-term housing alternatives and this
would simply urge a portion of those new voucher to be dedicated under this effort. Additional
resources in the amount of $5 million per year for the next two years would be needed. After
three years, the increased funding could be reduced to the present level ifprojections of services
are achieved.]
