Q:         Would you support an FDA-only bill?

A:      We would not rule it out.  However, The President has supported
comprehensive legislation and it is prmature to speculate about the next
Congresss. A significant reduction in youth smoking will take actions on
many fronts, including a price increase and public health efforts such as
research and cessation, as well as the advertising and access restrictions
in the FDA rule.
