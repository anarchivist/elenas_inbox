TEXT:
Tomorrow the INS will have its media briefing on the new guidelines for
naturalizing individuals with disabilities. As you know, DOJ concluded
that the present law will not allow all disabled individuals to satisfy
the oath requirement and become citizens.   The INS wants to know whether
Commissioner Meissner should use this opportunity to explicitly link this
limitation to the President's welfare fix proposal.   In her statement, she
could say something about naturalization is not the full answer to address
ing the harsh provisions pertaining to legal immigrants in the welfare
reform law, then discuss how the Administration is proposing to address
the problem legislatively.  The INS has asked whether we would want to
have a White House statement or a letter from the President about the
Administration's proposals to distribute at the briefing.

I guess I think that the Commissioner should probably make the link in her
statement because one of the first questions that is likely to be asked is
what is to become of these people and what does the Administration propose
to help them.   I am less certain that it would be helpful to release a
White House statement on welfare reform at an INS briefing.

Any thoughts on this?   I would need to get back to INS later today.

Thanks.
