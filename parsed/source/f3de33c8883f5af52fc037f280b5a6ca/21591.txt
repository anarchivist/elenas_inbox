TEXT:
Elena,

Bruce Reed suggested that I get your thoughts regarding the idea I've been
promoting about Army-style prep schools to encourage diversity at elite
colleges (see below).  If you have a few minutes to talk, I'd be
grateful. Thanks.

-How to keep elite colleges diverse, the Army way: The Clinton
administration will continue to support the right of colleges and
universities to take race into account for admissions purposes. And
rightly so, because itO,s clear from studies--including the new book by
Derek Bok and William Bowen--that diversity works. The problem is that
courts and ballot measures have chipped away at the legal basis of
race-conscious admissions policies, and will probably continue to do so.
WhatCl,s needed is a second front for affirmative action--a way of creating
a supply of minority students whose test scores and academic performance
are high enough that they can be admitted to elite schools without racial
preferences. Such a system already exist in the U.S. military. The Army,
for instance, has a larger proportion of blacks in its upper ranks than
almost any other large institution in America.   ItO,s secret: The U.S.
Military Academic Prepatory School (USMAPS) in New Jersey.   Every year,
USMAPS accepts hundreds of promising but academically ill-prepared
minority high school graduates. These cadets go through a grueling
10-month course of training in reading, math, military discipline, and
good study habits. Cadets who make it through go on to West Point, their
SAT scores having risen 110 points higher than when they entered USMAPS.
Just as important, USMAPS cadets graduate from West Point at the same or
higher rate than their West Point classmates who didnO,t go through USMAPS
{by contrast, blacks at elite civilian colleges graduate at substantially
lower rates than whites}.   Action: The POTUS should empanel a commission
of military generals and elite college presidents to explore the
possibility of adapting the USMAPS model to civilian higher education.
