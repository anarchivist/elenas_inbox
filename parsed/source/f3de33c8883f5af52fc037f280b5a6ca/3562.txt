              is a one-pager on the welfare issues in the conference. As you know, the
              leadership had decided against us on everyone (except food stamp work
              slots was apparently worked out this weekend) .

              Also fyi -- Ron Haskins called to say we could pick up paper, and he'd be
              happy to answer any questions. ==================== ATTACHMENT   1 =================

                                       Welfare Reform Conference Issues
                                                      7/21/97                   Automated Records Manage~ent System
                                                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion

     Benefits for Legal Immigrants: The President has stated that he will not sign legislation that does not
     provide disability and health benefits to legal immigrants who are or become disabled. If resources are
     available, we strongly urge the conferees to adopt all the Senate provisions regarding legal immigrants.

     Administering Agency for $3 Billion Welfare to Work Program: We insist that the $3 billion welfare to
     work program be administered by the Department of Labor and operated through DOL's local Private
     Industry Councils (PICs), as done in the House bill.

     Minimum Wage, Worker Protections, and Required Hours per Week of Work for Workfare. We insist
     on dropping all language in House bills which dilutes current law minimum wage enforcement, worker
     protections, and welfare reform work requirements.

     Privatization of Medicaid and Food Stamp Operations. We insist that the conferees drop the House
     provisions allowing states to privatize all Medicaid and Food Stamp operations.

     SSI State Supplements: We strongly oppose the House provision, which would repeal the current law
     maintenance of effort requirements which prevent States from lowering or eliminating State supplemental
     SSI payments.

     Worker Displacement. We strongly urge the conferees to adopt the Senate anti-worker displacement
     language and apply it to the entire Temporary Assistance for Needy Families welfare reform program.

     $3 Billion Welfare to Work Program: Distribution of Funds. We strongly prefer the distribution of funds
     as reported out by the House Ways and Means committee: 50% of funds by formula, 50% by competitive
     grants; no small state minimum for formula grants; 65% of competitive funds set-aside for 100 cities with
     the largest poverty populations.

     Welfare to Work Performance Bonus: We strongly prefer an alternative which improves upon the Senate
     performance bonus in which Governors would use a share of their discretionary funds and the Secretary of
     Labor would use a share of competitive funds to reward high-achieving welfare-to-work programs.

     $3 Billion Welfare to Work Program: Community Service as Allowable Use. We prefer the language
     passed by the House and Senate which allows funds from the $3 billion program to be used for "job
     creation through public or private subsidies" but not language which may be added in conference allowing
     "community service/work experience."

  Food Stamp Work Slots: The Administration endorses the Senate reimbursement structure and the House
  provisions for maintenence of effort in order to ensure that the maximum number of work slots are
 .created.

     Vocational Education: We urge conferees to drop all provisions changing how vocational education is
     counted toward the work requirements.

     TANF Transfers to Title XX: We urge conferees to drop the House provisions.

     Medicaid Benefits for Children Losing SSI Benefits: The Agreement calls for restoration of these benefits,
