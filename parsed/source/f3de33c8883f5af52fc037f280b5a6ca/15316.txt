Laura, I guess I don't expect that the President is likely to get
immigration questions on Friday.  If he does, the most likely question is
welfare and immigrants, perhaps on Florida's suit challenging the welfare
bill. Mike has a Q&A that was put together for his briefing today (and I
think he was asked about it). But by Friday the press will probably have
moved on to other things.

Other immigration matters going on include INS' release yesterday of
higher legal immigration numbers (27% increase).   This may begin the
discussion again about the appropriate level of legal immigration, but I
don't think that the White House press is likely to ask about it Friday.
And there was a hearing today on border control. Representative Silvestre
Reyes apparently called for splitting INS in two with one component to
deal with enforcement and the other with services such as naturalization.
Again, probably not a topic for Friday.

So the bottom line is that the White House Press probably won't ask about
immigration, at least outside of the context of welfare.


Thanks.
