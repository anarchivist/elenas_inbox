Q:   Is it true that the White House is supporting the repeal of the provision that gives
     medical I.Ds. to every American?

A:   The Congress directed HHS to develop unique health identifier numbers under the Health
     Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. The Administration has
     consistently taken the position that we will not implement this legislation until there are
     strong privacy protections in place.

     In the interim, the only action we have taken has been a can for information to an
     interested parties, particularly consumer representatives, so that we have an the
     information necessary to implement the law.

     Once again, however, our number one priority is to put in place strong privacy
     protections. Our preference is for Congress to pass meaningful, bipartisan legislation
     this year. Ifnot we fully intend to implement strong privacy protections, as is consistent
     with the authority given to us by the law.
