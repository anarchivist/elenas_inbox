TEXT:
On December 2nd, Children's Defense Fund and National Coalition for the
Homeless are releasing a rather pessimistic report on welfare reform
called "welfare .to What: Early Findings on Family Hardship and Well
Being". The report mainly compiles findings from previous studies; the
only new data were collected by local non-profit advocacy organizations
monitoring welfare reform in six states.   I'm currently reviewing the
report and will provide a summary later this evening.
