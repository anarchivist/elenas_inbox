1.              PURPOSE

You will discuss the constructive steps the Administration has taken and
will take to root out police misconduct and strengthen the bond between
police officers and the communities they serve.


II.             BACKGROUND

With this radio address you will bring together a group of civil rights


advocates, police chiefs and rank-and-file law enforcement organizations
to ask these leaders to work with you to make sure that the criminal
justice system serves the needs of all Americans, and to make the system
both fairer and more effective.

You will also discuss new provisions to be included in your 21st Century
Crime Bill that will help accomplish this, such as more and better police
training, more education for police, improved efforts to recruit
minorities, and a long-term commitment to strengthen community policing
efforts across the country.

Finally, you will direct the Attorney General to convene a series of
meetings of representatives of the interested groups to examine ways of
addressing the problem and recommend further actions that the
Administration can take.
