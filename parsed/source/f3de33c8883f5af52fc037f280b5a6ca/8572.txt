         TEXT:
         Thought you'd find this interesting--it appears that the Cal. State Board
         of Education is looking to give districts considerable flexibility in
         implementing Unz, making it as easy as possible under the law to allow
         parents to put their kids in bilingual programs, and requiring districts
         to figure out some way to provide kids additional services if they haven't
         learned English after a year.

         State starts putting Proposition 227 in place
         Flexibility built into rules for school districts

        By Janine DeFao Bee Staff Writer
        The California State Board of Education unanimously adopted emergency
        regulations Thursday intended to give local schools and parents as much
        flexibility as possible in carrying out Proposition 227, the
        voter-approved initiative that sought to end bilingual education.
        "I think we're trying to be flexible for programs that are successful and
        that have parent buy-in," said board president Yvonne Larsen.
        "This should be considered a parent- and local school board-driven syst
        em," added the board's executive director, Bill Lucia.
        The emergency regulations, which first need to be approved by the Office
        of Administrative Law before taking effect, say that schools must have
        "structured English immersion" programs 0* the content of which remains
        undefined 0* for any semester or equivalent term that begins after Aug. 2.
        But advocates of bilingual education, which uses a child's native language
        in teaching English and other academic subjects, are hoping that a federal
        judge will block the initiative's enactment after a court hearing next
        week.
        A coalition of civil rights group is seeking a preliminary injunction on
        the grounds that the initiative is discriminatory and violates federal law.


 Nearly 1.4 million students, a quarter of the state's public school
 enrollment, are not fluent in English. About a third have been taught in
 bilingual programs.
 While the state board already had decided it does not have the authority
 to grant waivers to school districts that want to maintain bilingual
 programs, its action Thursday stressed that parents themselves can request
 waivers to place their children in programs other than English immersion.
 The regulations say such parent waivers "shall be granted unless the
 school principal and education staff have substantial evidence that the
 alternative program requested by parents would not be better suited for
 the pupil."
 "Our target is to be protective of parents," said board vice president
 Robert Trigg.

 But Ron Unz, author of Proposition 227, said Thursday that the initiative
 is clear "that parents who want their children in a bilingual program must
 provide evidence of the effectiveness of that bilingual program."
 "So long as the initiative is interpreted in any reasonable manner, it
 would certainly end the overwhelming majority of bilingual programs in the
 state. Those programs have no evidence of children succeeding in them,"
 Unz said.
 The initiative states that limited-English students must be placed in an
 English immersion program and taught "overwhelmingly" in English for a
 period not normally to exceed one year. But a school must provide an
 alternative program if parents of more than 20 students in one grade re
 ceive waivers.
 The head of one of the groups seeking to block the initiative said the
 parent waiver provision "is not a savior by a long shot."
 "There is a very serious question about the ability of
 non-English-speaking parents to leverage a school system in this way,"
 said Peter Roos, co-director of Multicultural Education, Training and
 Advocacy.
 Also problematic to Roos and to several speakers at Thursday's board
 hearing is the requirement that all children be placed in an English
 language classroom for 20 instructional days before a waiver can be
 granted.
 The regulations also state that school districts have to provide services
 to English learners, beyond one year of English immersion, until students
 are proficient in English and have erased any academic deficits.
 But the regulations do not specify what will be taught in those English
 immersion programs and whether, or how much, of a child's native language
 can be used.
 "We will have mUltiple ways of what (districts) think structured English
 immersion looks like," Lucia said.
 State schools chief Delaine Eastin, who was not at Thursday's meeting,
 said in a statement that the regulations give schools "the flexibility
 to create programs suitable to meet the needs of their students."
 But Eastin added, "This is by no means the final act in this drama.
 Implementing this initiative will be a challenging task."D%
