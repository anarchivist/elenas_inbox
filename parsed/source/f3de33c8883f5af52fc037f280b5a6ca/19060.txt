TEXT:
INS seems to think that they are respected by the public, and that a great
wellspring of support for INS lies waiting to be tapped.  Myself, I vote
w/Peter -- we win the restructuring battle only if we stay low-key and
provide an opportunity for the R's to take up our proposal and somehow
make it their own (or at least accept our proposal as a nonpartisan,
good=government management idea).  If INS stirs up the media and promotes
press stories that play up the 'us versus them' aspect of the
restructuring debate (did CIR or the Administration win?), I think we will
lose big time.  Someone should ask the AG to talk w/Meissner and tell her
to follow the lead of the WH on communications/legislative strategies.
