TEXT:
         But before we begin, I want to comment on a recent development, by
using some of the plainest language I know: Smoking Kills.   Just this past
weekend we found even more evidence to prove that the tobacco companies
have been targeting our children for decades -- a Lorillard document from
197B that states bluntly: the o&base of our business is the high school
student.oB

        Let me say on behalf of President Clinton that the base of our business
is protecting Americao,s children.  That is why the President and have
been working so hard to pass comprehensive tobacco legislation to reduce
youth smoking and save one million precious lives.

        These latest documents reinforce what we have seen in hundreds of
other documents released in the past several months: for decades, the
tobacco industry did intense research on the smoking habits of children as
young as 12. The tobacco companies knew their product was addictive and
deadly.  The tobacco companies knew a price increase would specifically
drive down the number of young people smoking. And the tobacco companies
have continued to market their products to young people.

        The President and I strongly believe that high school students
should not be the base of business for the tobacco industry -- and neither
should Congress. The President and I will continue to expose the
deceptions of the tobacco industry through these documents, and we will
not stop until comprehensive legislation is passed into law.
