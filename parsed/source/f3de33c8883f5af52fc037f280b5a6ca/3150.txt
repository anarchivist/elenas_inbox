  TEXT:
  A few more July/August education event suggestions came in from ED.  I've
  included
  the best of them below.  In the main, they are not terribly sexy, but they
  have the advantage of
  being tied to real -- though routine -- government actions, and could be a
  platform for focusing
  on aspects of our current agenda.

  Goals 2000:  allocations go out on July 1 for fourth year G2K state grants
  to
       states that already have plans in place.  This would be an
  opportunity for the
   President to stress our long~standing support for raising standards; to
  praise states for
  their efforts, and to make the case for why national standards are needed.

   Parental Assistance Center Grants under Goals 2000 are due in mid-July
       -- they would be a good opportunity to highlight the importance of
       parental involvement in education -- could also tie in to Parents as
       First Teachers component of America Reads;

   House Appropriations Subcommittee mark-up to Labor/HHS/Ed Appropriations
   bill on July 15. This gives the President a platform to highlight some
  of his education investments
  and education reform agenda, particularly Technology Literacy Challenge,
  School to Work and
  Goals 2000 (which together are in a budget category specifically protected
  by the budget agreement.
    If the committee sticks to the budget agreement then we will either get
  significant victories for two
  highly controversial programs (Goals 2000 and school-to-work), or a huge
  increase for the technology
   literacy challenge program.

  Depending upon the other decisions the committee makes, we will have an
  opportunity to either claim
  credit or begin to define the battle.


  School To Work Grants-- there are 13 state implementation grants to be
  made over
  the next several months; they will be made on a rolling basis as they are


 ready.  We could
 package a few of them   together and do an event that highlights the success
 of the School-to-work
 program, and use that   as a basis for promoting (1) national standards and
 tests (2) any part of   our
 higher education. job   training and lifelong learning agenda we want.
