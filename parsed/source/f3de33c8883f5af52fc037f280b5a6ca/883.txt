TEXT:
do you agree with me that Michael Kharfen's quotes yesterday about a block
grant alternative to our legal immigrant fixes were too positive? He said
we are not rejecting a block grant approach; and that "it's the same thing
by another name."  I just called him and said I thought our strategy would
be to say that a block grant isn't anywhere near the right solution. Do I
need to call him back and clarify?
