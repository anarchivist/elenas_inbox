      TEXT:
      There is a lot of info forthcoming.  The big wig meetings on Medicare
      reforms with the Mainstream Coalition will probably most interest the big
      guy.  I am sorry so long, but I think the info is important.  I hope I am
      ok on the needle exchange info; I think I am, but it may be redundant on
      what Bruce and you have formerly sent.  I just don't know ...

      Call with questions, ok?

Medicare Reform. On Wednesday, Erskine, Gene Sperling, Frank Raines, Secretary Rubin,
John Hilley, and Chris Jennings met with the Senate "Mainstream" Coalition (Breaux, Chafee,
Kerrey, Frist, Conrad, Gordon, Frist, Mack, et al) to discuss the Medicare "reform" agenda that
they are advocating. Interestingly, they did not push -- or even mention -- the home care
copayment issue; rather, they focused their interest on the income related (means-tested)
premium and the 65-67 age eligibility issue. Erskine emphasized that we strongly support the
income related premium, as long as our policy concerns were met. The group was pleased to
hear this message, but was unwilling to move off their approach until they had a more detailed
briefing and discussion of policy alternatives to the Senate-passed bill. Although we raised
serious concerns about the age eligibility issue, we indicated a willingness to hear them out on
policy options to address the uninsured problem.

On Thursday, Chris, HHS, OMB and Treasury made a presentation to the Coalition group on
their two Medicare issues. We outlined the administrative problems related to the income
related premium and seerned to convince the Members that the Treasury Department route was
the way to go. They were particularly won over by the revenue loss ($8.9 billion vs. $3.9
billion), the administrative costs ($30-50 million vs. $10 million), the 2-3 year accurate income
reporting lag, and the potential for major privacy violations should Treasury be forced to send
income records to HHS. Although there remained political concerns about winning over House
Republicans for a Treasury-administered approach, Senator Chafee said, "it should be Treasury
or nothing." The discussion concluded with a request to see if Treasury could assess the
premium on something other than the tax form. (On Friday, we completed our first-cut on
developing such an option; we are checking to see how much revenue this option loses, but it
looks promising.)

.Our presentation on the eligibility age issue focused on the Coalition's recent proposal to offer 65
and 66-year olds access to the Medicare program through a $54 a month premium. This would
be assessed for the rest of a seniors' life and is consistent with a suggestion made by Bob
Reischauer. While we raised concerns that such a premium would be unaffordable for many
elderly (thus not adequately addressing the uninsured problem) and would end up shifting
billions of dollars of costs to the states (because of mandated low income beneficiary buy-in
requirements and SSI eligibility), we agreed to work through options. We concluded with an
honest assessment of how unlikely the House would go for anything on this issue in the budget
agreement; while the Coalition Members agreed with the assessment, they still pushed us to look
at options. We agreed to provide technical assistance, but were clear that we were doing it in
reponse to options that they (particularly Conrad and Kerrey) suggest. This meeting conclude on
a very positive and appreciative manner; the Members were genuinely pleased that we were not
throwing up roadblocks just to have roadblocks.

Budget Developments on Medicare and Medicaid. The Budget conferees have not finalized
their work on Medicare and Medicaid. They hope to finish most of the issues over the weekend
for final review by the Republican Leadership. At that time, the Leaders will apparently engage
us for a final review and a round of negotiations over major issues. The primary outstanding tier
one issues for Medicare appear to be the income related premium, the structure of the Medicare
Commission, the MSA compromise, and the Republican plan option that allows for balance
billing (charging beneficiaries over approved Medicare rates.) The major Medicaid issues that
have not been resolved are the Disproportionate Share (DSH) state-by-state formula, the policy
surrounding $1.5 billion Medicare low income protection provision, and the D.C. and the Puerto
     .                                                                      Automated Records Management Systerr
                                                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion

         Rico Medicaid investments that were included in the budget agreement
         Budget Developments on Children's Health. Most of the major children's issues have not
         been resolved. Still outstanding is whether and, if so, how much of any tobacco tax will be
         dedicated to children's health, whether the benefits package and cost-sharing protections will be
         meaningful to low-income children, and whether the accountability provisions are to our liking.
         The Republicans seem to be watering down these provisions because they know they are
         important to us and our Democratic supporters. (Some suggest they are doing this so they can
         trade on this issue for their tax priorities.)


         Immunization Event. Next Wednesday, you and the First Lady are announcing that we are
         ahead of schedule in meeting our goals for immunization rates. In 1996, 90 percent of
         America's toddlers received the most critical doses of the recommended vaccines for children by
         age two. You are also scheduled to announce a new child care regulation that ensures that all
         children in federal child care will be immunized. Senator Bumpers will be in attendance, as will
         be the likely next Surgeon General nominee -- CDC's Dr. David Satcher. While Dr. Satcher's
         final clearance has not been completed and we do not think it advisable to rush out his
         announcement, this event provides a good opportunity to showcase Dr. Satcher and his
         achievements.

         FDA Reform. We are approaching the final days of negotiation with Members of the Senate
         Labor and Human Resources Committee on a major FDA reform bill. There appears to be just a
         few issues remaining, including one that would allow manufacturers to provide peer-reviewed
         articles to physicians that outline as yet non-approved, but apparently effective uses of
         prescription drugs. This is a very controversial issue and a compromise will be difficult to
         reach. However, both sides (as well as the drug industry) very much want to you to sign a FDA
         reform bill into law. Ifwe can agree on this and some other relatively non-high-profile issues,
         we fully anticipate a quick House approval and final passage of the bill by sometime in
         mid-September. Ifwe cannot agree on a compromise bill by that time-frame, the provisions in
         current law that authorize user fees will expire and individuals reviewing new drug products for
         FDA will begin to be layed off.

         Needle Exchange. Your public health advisors at HHS are now concluding that the science
         exists to certify that needle exchange programs not only reduce the spread of AIDS, but also does
         not increase drug use. (Currently law requires the Administration to certify that needle
         exchange programs do NOT increase drug use BEFORE allowing for CDC funding to be used
         for this purpose -- at the discretion oflocal communities.) Before we make any final
         recommendation to you, however, we believe it is important for General McCaffrey to weigh in
         with his views. Although he is reportedly less skeptical than he has been previously, the
         General has not indicated that he agrees with the public health advisors. Next week, the General
         and NIH's
         Dr. Harold Varmus are scheduled to meet on this matter. In the interim, we continue our efforts
         (so far successful) to head off attempts by the House Appropriations Committee to strip the
         Administration of the needle exchange certification authority.


         AIDS Drugs Assistance Programs (ADAP). The Labor-HHS committee voted an $132
         million increase over your budget for ADAP. The AIDS community has been lobbying the
                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion
Administration and the Hill for an increase in ADAP programs. They argue that given the
recent release of the HHS guidelines on AIDS drug treatments, we should also support an
increase in these treatments and give more and more Americans access to these much-needed
treatments. Allocating an increase in ADAP would definitely help our politics with the AIDS
community, particularly given the fact that they want us to move quicker on needle exchange.
However, the discretionary funding ceilings are already lower in the budget agreement than in
your budget and there will be a great deal of competition for resources for important priorities,
including many of your education priorities. We are working with OMB to develop some
options for your consideration.
