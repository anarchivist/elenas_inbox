TEXT:
Tobacco -- MMWR Study:   On April 2, in conjunction with Kick Butts Day,
the CDC released a new study ("Tobacco Use Among High School Students --
United States, 1997") which found that cigarette smoking rates among high
school students rose by nearly a third between 1991 and 1997, from 27.5
percent to 36.4 percent, with the sharpest increase among African American
students.  Cigarette smoking was highest among white students (40
percent), rising by 28 percent from 1991 (31 percent).  While the level of
cigarette smoking among African-American students was lower than for white
students, the rate increased by 80 percent between 1991 and 1997 (from
12.6 percent to 22.7 percent). Overall, the study found that nearly half
of male students and more than a third of female students used cigarettes,
cigars, or smokeless tobacco during the previous month.  This 1997 data
was derived from a survey of over 16,000 students in grades 9-12.
