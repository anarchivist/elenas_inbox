Please keep me in the loop on announcements for Presidents remarks to USCM
on Friday. This is very late in the day---5pm EST. We reported on our
department/agency conference call today to coordinate our preperation for
the USCM meeting that we expected the President would focus on State of
the Cities Report, Repubican Budget Proposal, perhaps guns and Kosovo. As
staff contact for this activity, I would appreciate your help. Thanks.

At this point I am not sure that we are going to do the announcements
because we may announce a Brady report.  However, the combination of the
State of the Cities Report and the three initiatives on low income
homeownership are probably presidential enough.
