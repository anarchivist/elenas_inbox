H.R. 2570 - Forced Abortion Condemnation Act
(Fowler (R) Florida and 12 cosponsors)

The' Administration agrees with the proponents of H.R. 2570 that the
practice of forced abortion and involuntary sterilization is abhorrent.
The Administration, however, strongly opposes H.R. 2570 on several
grounds.

The Administration opposes the bill because it would:

o       Contradict U.S. policy to expand dialogue with the Chinese in
order to advance critical U.S. security, political, and economic interests.

o       Possibly prompt China to impose its own visa restriction that
could curtail the ability of U.S. officials and American religious figures
to advocate views in China.

o       Raise serious constitutional concerns to the extent that it would
inhibit the PresidentD,s ability to conduct the foreign relations of the
united States and to receive foreign government officials.

o       Fail to take account of U.S. international obligations to admit
certain foreigners to the United Nations and other international
organizations.

o       Require the State Department to divert scarce resources from core
tasks to comply with the requirement to maintain lists of officials
covered by the bill.

U.S. interests are best served by increasing the transparency of Chinese
society and promoting expansion of ChinaD,s participation in international
fora governed by standards and rules agreed to by the international
community of nations. U.S. engagement exposes Chinese officials
first-hand to the benefits of an open and democratic system.  There is no
better way to demonstrate the advantages of a free and open society than
to let them experience it for themselves.

In addition, the Administration is concerned that this and other China
legislation being considered in the House would undermine U.S. efforts to
address these issues on the eve of the late October summit meeting.  This
summit will provide an opportunity to work for concrete progress on issues
of concern to the United States. Consideration of H.R. 2570 and related
legislation only makes that task more difficult.

Forced Abortion Condemnation Act (Introduced in the House)

HR 2570 IH

                              105th CONGRESS


                                   1st session

                                   H. R. 2570

To condemn those officials of the Chinese communist Party, the Government
of the People's
Republic of China, and other persons who are involved in the enforcement
of forced abortions by
preventing such persons from entering or remaining in the United States.

                     IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

                             September 29, 1997

Mrs. FOWLER (for herself, Mr. COX of California, Mr. GIBBONS, Mr. GILMAN,
Mr.
HUNTER, Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas, Mr. MCINTOSH, Mr. ROHRABACHER, Mr.
ROYCE, Mr. SHADEGG, Mr. SMITH of New Jersey, Mr. SOLOMON, and Mr. SPENCE)
introduced the following bill; which was referred to the Committee on the
Judiciary



                                   A BILL

To condemn those officials of the Chinese communist Party, the Government
of the People's
Republic of China, and other persons who are involved in the enforcement
of forced abortions by
preventing such persons from entering or remaining in the United States.

     Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
united States of
     America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

     This Act may be cited as the 'Forced Abortion Condemnation Act'.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

     The Congress makes the following findings:

           (1) Forced abortion was rightly denounced as a crime against
humani ty by the
           Nuremberg War Crimes Tribunal.

          (2) For over 15 years there have been frequent and credible
reports of forced abortion
          and forced sterilization in connection with the population
control policies of the
          People's Republic of China. These reports indicate the following:

                (A) Although it is the stated position of the politburo of
the Chinese Communist
                Party that forced abortion and forced sterilization have no
role in the population
                control program, in fact the Communist Chinese Government
encourages both
                forced abortion and forced sterilization through a


combination of strictly
               enforced birth quotas and immunity for local population
control officials who
               engage in coercion. Officials acknowledge that there have
been instances of
               forced abortions and sterilization, and no evidence has
been made available to
               suggest that the perpetrators have been punished.

               (B) People's Republic of China population control
officials, in cooperation with
               employers and works unit officials, routinely monitor
women's menstrual cycles
               and subject women who conceive without government a
uthorization to extreme
               psychological pressure, to harsh economic sanctions,
including unpayable fines
               and loss of employment, and often to physical force.

                (C) Official sanctions for giving birth to unauthorized
children include fines in
                amounts several times larger than the per capita annual
incomes of residents of
                the People's Republic of China. In Fujian, for example, the
average fine is
                estimated to be twice a family's gross annual income.
Families which cannot pay
                the fine may be subject to confiscation and destruction of
their homes and
                personal property.

               (D) Especially harsh punishments have been inflicted on
those whose resistance
               is motivated by religion. For example, according to a 1995
Amnesty
               International report, the Catholic inhabitants of 2
villages in Hebei Province were
               subjected to population control under the slogan 'better to
have more graves
               than one more child'. Enforcement measures included
torture, sexual abuse, and
               the detention of resisters' relatives as hostages.

               (E) Forced abortions in communist China often have taken
place in the very late
               stages of pregnancy.

               (F) Since 1994 forced abortion and sterilization have been
used in Communist
               China not only to regulate the number of children, but also
to eliminate those
               who are regarded as defective in accordance with the of
ficial eugenic policy
               known as the 'Natal and Health Care Law'.

SEC. 3. DENIAL OF ENTRY INTO THE UNITED STATES OF PERSONS IN
THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA ENGAGED IN ENFORCEMENT
OF FORCED ABORTION POLICY.

      The Secretary of State may not issue any visa to, and the Attorney
'"

 General may not admit to
      the United States, any national of the People's Republic of China,
 including any official of the
      Communist Party or the Government of the People's Republic of China
 and its regional, local,
      and village authorities who the Secretary finds, based on credible
 information, has been
      involved in the establishment or enforcement of population control
 policies resulting in a
      woman being forced to undergo an abortion against her free choice, or
 resulting in a man or
      woman being forced to undergo sterilization against his or her free
 choice.
