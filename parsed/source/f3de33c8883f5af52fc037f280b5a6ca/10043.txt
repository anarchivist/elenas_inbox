Crime -- Survey on Gun Ownership: On Friday, the Center to Prevent
Handgun Violence released a survey of 806 parents showing that 43 percent
of households with children have guns, and of those households, 23 percent
keep a gun loaded, and 28% keep a gun hidden and unlocked. However, ne
arly two-thirds of parents surveyed -- 73 percent -- believe that it is
"not at all likely" that their child would find and handle a gun without
permission. The survey also found that while 75 percent of parents say
they have discussed with their children what to do if they find a gun in
the home of a friend or neighbor, only 30 percent have asked parents of
their children's friends if there is a gun in the home before allowing
them to visit.
