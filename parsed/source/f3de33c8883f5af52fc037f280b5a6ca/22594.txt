                              WASHINGTON (AP) -- Dr. Scott Baumgartner has
good news
                              and bad news for his elderly patients with
rheumatoid arthritis: A
                              revolutionary new drug can treat their disease,
but it costs up to
                              $1,000 a month and Medicare won't pay for it
or any
                              prescription drug.

                              "It's a shame to have to say,    'Well, here's
this medicine' --
                              they've all read about it,   they know it might
help them -- 'but you
                              can't do it,'"   Baumgartner said.

                              Some patients in his Spokane, Wash., practice
are taking the drug,
                              Enbrel, for a few weeks at a time as they can
afford it. Others
                              simply stay with inferior treatments.

                              Medicare, the government health insurance
program for 39 million
                              elderly and disabled Americans, has never paid
for prescriptions.

                              President Clinton as well as many Republicans
would like to
                              change that. But the costs could be daunting
for a program
i.


                                    already facing a shaky financial future.

                                    New drugs are among the greatest medical
     advances in recent
                                    years, reducing heart attacks and cancer deaths
     and even slowing
                                     the progress of AIDS. As a result,   the lack of
     prescription
                                     coverage is becoming a bigger problem.

                                     "If elderly Americans are not getting the
     medicines they need,    it's
                                     costing the nation a lot of dollars for
     increased medical care, "      said
                                     Dr. Raymond Woosley, who heads the pharmacology
     department
                                    at Georgetown University Medical Center.

                                     Enbrel is an extreme example. But the costs of
     older drugs also
                                     can add up: one common blood thinner used to
     avoid blood clots in
                                    heart and stroke patients costs $60 a month and
     a common heart
                                    drug $180. Older Americans take five or six
     prescription drugs on
                                    average.

                                    Clinton has said he wants to add drug coverage
     to Medicare
                                    assuming he and lawmakers can find a way to
     ensure the
                                    program can provide the benefits it already
     promises.

                                     The president has suggested using some of the
     expected federal
                                    budget surplus for Medicare. Even so, Medicare
     is expected to
                                     run short of cash as the huge baby boom
     generation retires,
                                     entering the program in waves around 2010.

                                    That has members of a commission advising the
     president and
                                    Congress on Medicare searching for options.

                                     "People would like to have a drug program if
     we can find a way
                                     to pay for it, "   said Sen. John Breaux, D-La.

                                     The government estimates about two-thirds of
     senior citizens
                                     have some drug coverage. Most get it through
     retiree health
                                     benefits offered by former employers, or
     through supplemental
                                     policies known as Medigap that they buy on
     their own.
I.


                              Others get coverage through the small number of
     Medicare
                              HMOs, or through Medicaid public assistance for
     the poor.

                              But the percentage of large companies offering
     health benefits to
                              their retirees has dropped by 20 percent in the
     1990s. And a
                              recent Consumer Reports study found Medigap pric
     es have gone
                              up as much as a third.

                              Meanwhile, HMOs squeezed by Medicare's
     cost-cutting are
                              curbing drug reimbursements offered as perks to
     attract the
                              elderly, or limiting them to cheaper generic or
     older brand-name
                              drugs.

                              The result: The newest drugs, expensive because
     they're
                              developed at tremendous cost to companies
     trying to return
                              profits to investors, are out of reach for many.

                              Nevertheless, there is mounting evidence that
     Medicare will
                              actually lose money in the long run if the
     elderly cannot get the
                              best medicine.

                              One recent study,    for example, attributed a
     rash of broken hips to
                              retirees taking older antidepressants, which
     are cheaper but can
                              cause a drop in blood pressure and thus diz
     ziness, Woosley said.
                              Newer but more expensive antidepressants don't
     affect blood
                              pressure as much.

                              "A prescription drug costs an awful lot less
     than a
                              hospitalization, "   Woosley said.

                              But the upfront expense of paying drug costs
     for the elderly is
                              daunting. One government estimate found that
     adding even a
                              modest benefit -- having Medicare pay,    for
     example, 75 percent
                              of their drug bills -- would cost at least $20
     billion a year.

                              Still, senior citizens are pressing hard.

                              "1 don't think you can have the pretense of
     having an adequate


                            health care program in the future without
having drug coverage, ' ,
                            said John Rother of AARP,   the largest organiz
ation of older
                            adults.

                            Some Medicare commission members also fear that
if the
                            government starts paying for retirees' drugs,
corporate retirement
                            benefits might dry up.

                            Therefore, they are considering another option:
Requiring private
                            insurers to offer better, cheaper drug benefits
to seniors. Then,
                            new Medicare subsidies could help the poorest
get private
                            coverage, so government spending would be
limited to those who
                            need it most.
