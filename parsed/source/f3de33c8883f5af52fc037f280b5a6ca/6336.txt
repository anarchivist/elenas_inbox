               RE:           FEB. 10 SINGLE SEX SCHOOLS MEETING

               As you know, a small group of ED officials met with
       representatives
       from Chancellor Rudy Crew's office yesterday in New York. Overall, the
       meeting
       went well and there appears to be a strong willingness on the part of
       Crew's
       office to pursue options, particularly the affirmative action/remedial
       option.
       Also, there seems to be a willingness to look at, on grounds that relate
       to
       educational need, an option of opening a "boys" school.  Crew feels
       strongly
       against offering that option in response to a complaint, but Kent McGuire,
       our
       nominated assistant secretary for our research branch, helped Crew's folks
       to
       view it as an educational sound idea separate from the case. He was quite
       indispensable, I believe.  Rudy Crew is absolutely opposed to any
       discussion
       of any option involving opening the present school to boys.


               The next step is for Lynne (Crew's COS) and I to figure out the
       best
       complement of folks for the next meeting and begin discussions regarding
       what
       type of information the school board has/could get which could help make a
       "remedial" case.  I suggested it is probably NOT the complement of folks
       at
       yesterday's meeting (while a number of educators/policy makers, still too


    many
    lawyers).   Also,   I believe Crew's folks will also be exploring the "boys"
    option.

            You should know that in the days prior to the meeting, the New
    York
    Times and Newsday each ran a very short piece (more of a paragraph)
    announcing
    "federal officials" w~re to be meeting with school board officials.
    Though
    Crew's COC assured us that this was not a public event for them and they
    would
    not be speaking to the press, there may be press generated from the very
    impatient complainants.

            Let me know if you have questions or suggestions.
