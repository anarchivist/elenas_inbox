                                         July 12, 1997


MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:         Bruce Reed
              Elena Kagan

RE:           DPC Weekly Report


        1. Welfare -- Children's SSI Cut-offs Begin:  This month, SSA will begin to cut off
SSI benefits for children who do not meet the new defmition of childhood disability under
welfare reform. Time Magazine ran a story on the issue this week, and ABC World News
Tonight is expected to cover this in the coming weeks. The law called for SSA to complete
eligibility reviews of 260,000 children by August 22, with 135,000 expected to ultimately
lose benefits. However, Congress is likely to give SSA another 6 months to complete the
process, which is behind schedule. Under the budget agreement, these children would
have their Medicaid benefits grandfathered. The Senate, however, failed to include this
provision, while the House has made it a state option. We are endeavoring to get the full
budget agreement in this area.

        2. Welfare -- Teen Parents and Welfare: Last Thursday, before you taped the radio
address, you told us about a friend who had hired a welfare recipient who turned out not to be
ready for the workplace. The same day, several newspapers had articles about the New Chance
project for teen mothers, all with conclusions like the Wall Street Journal's "Welfare Services
Seem Little Help to Teen Mothers." We thought we'd take a closer look at what we know about
whether programs like these help teen parents become self sufficient.

       We looked at three well-known, rigorously evaluated programs for teen parents, including
the New Chance study. Our most interesting finding is that the two studies in which the
program group had significantly better outcomes than the control group are ones which included
sanctions and penalties, in some cases along with support services. New Chance, on the other
hand, was a voluntary program, which offered employment and support services but did not
sanction individuals for not meeting program expectations. The teen mothers in New Chance
were not more likely to hold jobs or leave welfare than the teens in the control group, partly
because both groups improved over time.

       However, the two programs with sanctions, Ohio's LEAP program and the Teenage
Parent Demonstration project, both had significantly better results than the voluntary New
                                            Hex-DiJmp Conversion


Chance program. The LEAP program, for example, required teen mothers to stay in school and
offered financial rewards in addition to sanctions (although no specific services). After three
years, teens in LEAP had an employment rate of 33 percent compared with the control group's
28 percent, and 17 vs. 12 percent had left welfare. (We expect to have updated results from
LEAP within the month.) The Teenage Parent Demonstration program, which required teen
parents to stay in school and to use services or face sanctions, also showed success. The
program increased school enrollment levels by from 29 to 42 percent and the teens' employment
rate from 43 to 48 percent.

       These results show that it is very difficult to tum around the lives of teen parents on
welfare. They also indicate that requiring teen parents to stay in school and providing sanctions
and services to help them do so, as the new welfare law requires, works better than simply
providing services.

        3. Welfare -- White House Hiring of Welfare Recipients: Weare pleased to tell you
not-yet-announced news that the Executive Office of the President has achieved its goal, set in
April, of hiring six welfare recipients. One of them is working for the Domestic Policy Council.
 We are saving this announcement for an appropriate time, and trying to ensure that such an
announcement won't jeopardize the privacy of these workers.

        4. Welfare -- Speech to the National Governors' Association: After reading Secretary
Shalala's memo on how states are using extra funds from the welfare block grant available from
falling welfare caseloads, you asked if you should do a letter to the governors on the topic. We
suggest you send such a letter as part of the speech to the National Governors' Association
you're scheduled to give on July 28th. We recommend that in that speech you expand upon the
challenge you issued in last week's radio address, for "every state to take the money they save
from lowering their caseloads and use it -- for child care, for transportation, to subsidize the
training and wage help that people need to move from welfare to work."

        5. Welfare --California and New York State Welfare Plans: California and New
York have about one-third of the nation's welfare recipients between them, but state
politics have long stymied welfare reform plans in each state. This week, there was
legislative activity in both states.

        In California, Democrats in the legislature finally passed a fairly tough plan.
Governor Wilson, however, immediately vetoed the first of the four bills sent to him,
criticizing it with very strong rhetoric, and legislative leaders then withdrew the remaining
bills. The Democratic legislature voted to limit each period of welfare receipt to 24
months, but Wilson prefers 12 months for all new recipients. Democrats oppose Wilson's
plan to cut benefits by 15 percent after a family has been on the rolls for six months. The
Democrats' bill would permit mothers with infants to stay at home, while Wilson wants
women to start job search when their children are 12 weeks old. Democrats voted for a
partial state takeover of the state general assistance program, but Wilson has proposed to


                                                2
                                            Hex-Dump ConYl1:sion .

eliminate the state requirement that counties provide general assistance. Democrats were
unable to muster enough votes to pass plans to make up for federal cuts in food stamps and
SSI. Democrats are now negotiating with the Governor and Republican legislators, but it
is not clear when or whether an agreement will emerge.
        In New York, state legislative leaders appear to be close to an agreement with
Governor Pataki, after years of impasse. The Governor recently signaled that he will drop
or soften features of his original plan, such as decreasing welfare benefits over time and
converting the state's general assistance program from cash to vouchers. A significant
increase in child care spending appears likely. The resolution of the issue is bound up
with the overall state budget and other end-of-session issues.

        6. Service -- Upcoming High School Service Events: Next Friday, as part of an
event with Girls Nation, you are scheduled to announce that 1,600 high school students
across the country have been named the first "National Service Scholars" and awarded
$1,000 scholarships, in the first year of a program you announced last year at Penn State.
These high school juniors and seniors were selected by their principals based on
outstanding service records. The federal government, through the Corporation for
National Service, puts up $500 per scholarship, with civic organizations and other groups
invited to match that amount. Groups that have stepped forward to match these first
1,600 scholarships include the Kiwanis, Rotary, VFW, Junior Leagues, Chambers of
Commerce, PT As, the Miss America organization, and the American Legion. Sallie Mae
agreed to provide the match for all high schools in D.C., while the Minnesota state
legislature voted to provide funds for every high school in the state next year. The goal is
to institute this scholarship in as many of the 20,000 high schools in the country as possible.
 We are drafting a letter for you to send to all high school principals advising them ofthis
opportunity.

       In addition, that same day the Rev. Tony Campolo and an organization called
"Youth for Christ" are holding a rally on the Mall with 25-30,000 young people, each of
whom has pledged to serve 3 hours a week for the next 6 months in their communities.
They are largely high school students and from Christian denominations ranging from
Roman Catholic to Pentacostal. A similar event is Los Angeles in June drew 11,000 young
people. Campolo invited General Colin Powell to attend, but he is apparently out of the
country.

Elena: I included the next item because I've heard about 2 media stories on it in the past few
days. He's pretty familiar with the issue.

       7. Crime -- Brady Follow-up: On Wednesday, July 16th, the Attorney General and
Secretary of the Treasury will host a meeting for law enforcement representatives from the
national organizations and the 23 Brady states. We hope to accomplish the following: (1) to
brieflaw enforcement on the Supreme Court's decision and issue guidance on how they can
continue to conduct background checks; (2) to get county and/or state law enforcement agencies


                                               3
                                                Hex-Dump COil version .

to agree to do background checks for the handful of local jurisdictions that have stopped doing
them; and (3) to discuss and seek support for legislation that makes clear that states, unless
expressly prohibited by state law, have the authority to conduct background checks. This
legislation is necessary because the NRA is challenging the authority of 19 of the 23 Brady states
to continue to conduct Brady checks. As you know, the attorneys general in Arkansas and Ohio
are claiming that they do not have the authority under state law to do Brady checks.

            8_ Crime -- Recommendations on Crack Cocaine Sentencing: We have met with
the Justice Department and ONDCP to discuss how to unveil their recommendations on crack
cocaine sentencing. At the recommendation of Senators Biden and Kennedy, our initial goal has
been to keep the Senate Judiciary Committee from taking up ill-advised amendments to simply
drop the threshold for powder cocaine during the mark-up of the juvenile crime bill. To this
end, Justice has spoken with Senator Abraham, and it looks as ifhe will not offer his
amendment. Afterwards, Justice and ONDCP will take the lead in reaching out to members of
the Judiciary Committees, the Black Caucus and law enforcement representatives. If they can
build enough support for their recommendations, we will try and offer attach to the juvenile
crime bill when it is considered on the floor of the Senate this fall.


          9_ Crime -- Youth Handgun Tracing/Interdiction: At the Saturday, July 19th radio
address you will release a I-year report by the Treasury Department on the 17-city Youth
Handgun Tracing initiative. Participating cities will, for the first time, have an unprecedented
amount of information about where the guns used to commit crimes in their communities come
from. The report's general findings include:

·       4 out of J0 crime guns recovered by police are from youth (17 and under) or juveniles (18
        to 24);

·      more than half of all crime guns are semiautomatic pistols, and more than 70 percent are
       handguns, generally;

·       at least a quarter of the crime guns that police recover from juvenile and youth come from
        legitimate retail sales and are rapidly diverted to the black market; and

·      while thousands of guns are available, crime guns are constrained to a relatively small
       number of makes and models in each city.

        Additionally, you will announce a $12-15 million expansion of the initiative that
includes: more funds for A TF agents to investigate gun crimes in these cities; 5 to 10 new cities
to participate in the tracing of crime guns; and additional resources to train participating state and
local enforcement agencies.

        10. Education -- NAACP Speech: Your speech to the NAACP will provide an
opportunity to discuss education issues in the context of your race initiative. This will enable
you to discuss the importance of national standards and tests as a tool for improving learning for
all students, to highlight the steps the Administration has already taken to provide the tools to
help students -- especially those in urban and rural areas with large concentrations of high
poverty and minority students -- reach challenging standards, and to frame the issues that will
be addressed and steps that will be in the future to continue to provide all students with the
preparation they need.

The speech will also provide the opportunity to announce a new, concrete step to improve urban
education. DPC is working with the Education Department to complete the development of a
new initiative for recruiting, preparing and retaining teachers in urban and poor rural
communities. Part of the Education Department's proposal for the reauthorization of the Higher
Education Act, this program will provide funds to strengthen teacher training programs which
place large proportions of their graduates in urban or poor rural communities, and will also
enable institutions of higher education to provide scholarships to talented and diverse students
who will commit to teach in urban and poor rural areas for three years after graduation.
