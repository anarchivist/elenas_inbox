              Attached is the current draft of EO.  Other updates: 1.   I've now
            spoken in general terms to two of the three leading advocates, they like
            our concept (one said "great") ; 2. Bill Schultz said he had "given off
            the record" talks to Elena and I and he wanted to call back to say he
            thought the EO was a better idea than he had said to us previously.   3.
            Getting USDA on with some enthusiasm is important to making this not be
            the subject of retribution on the Hill, the agency seems discontented
            still. Eric thought giving it more time might help the agency placate
            opposition.

            Mary and I would like to come over before I leave at 3 pm today to walk
            through the likely future disputes and what is in the EO.    Maybe around

(a)     The Council shall develop a comprehensive strategic Federal food safety plan that
contains specific recommendations on needed changes. Specifically, the plan should identify
changes in existing programs, administrative policies, and laws that must be enacted to achieve a
seamless and science-based food safety system from the farm to the table. The planning process
should consider both short and long-term issues including new and emerging threats and the
special needs of vulnerable populations such as children and the elderly. In developing this

consumers, producers, industry, and academia. This plan shall serve as a guide in developing a
coordinated federal food safety budget.

as the Council determines appropriate.

conducting food safety research activities consistent with the President's Food Safety Initiative
and to coordinate efficiently all federal food safety research, including with the private sector and
academia.

from Production to Consumption." After providing opportunity for public comment, including
public meetings, the Council shall report to the President, within 180 days, with

recommendations should be consistent with the comprehensive strategic Federal food safety plan
which the Council will develop.
