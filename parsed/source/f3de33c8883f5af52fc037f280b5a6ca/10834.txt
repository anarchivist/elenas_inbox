TEXT:
USDA is worried it is going to get attacked for its handling of the
listeria outbreak. The critiquer is a University of Minnesota
epidemiologist who says USDA didn't do enough testing at the offending
plant and they didn't put out a public warning or press releases. USDA
says they did do testing, they have closed the offending lines in the
plant, they posted Sara Lee's press release and have given multiple press
interviews on the subject. They are putting out a list of the steps they
have taken. Before he got on a plane to Russia, Glickman also had them put
out a statement on their new lower salmonella numbers.
