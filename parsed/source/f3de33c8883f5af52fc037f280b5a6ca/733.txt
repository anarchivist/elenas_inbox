 TEXT:
 FYI, attached is OMB's latest draft of the welfare budget rollout
 document.  It reflects comments from us.

 Their latest catch phrase for the welfare fixes is "restoring fairness to
 federal safety net programs", which is much better than "moderating the
 harsh impact of welfare reform," the previous language.

              AND PROPOSAL TO CHANGE FOOD STAMPS
                AND BENEFITS FOR LEGAL IMMIGRANTS



Cost of the Proposals   Welfare to Work Initiatives: Approximately $3.3 billion over 5 years

                        Changes to Food Stamps and Benefits for Legal Immigrants:
                        $17.9 billion over 5 years

Welfare to Work         The Welfare to Work proposal is a comprehensive approach to
Initiatives             helping States and cities create new jobs and prepare individuals for
                        them, as well as providing employers with incentives to create new
                        job opportunities for long term welfare recipients.


Incentives for States   Creates the Welfare to Work Jobs Challenge. The Jobs Challenge is
and Cities              designed to help States and cities move a million of the hardest to
                        employ welfare recipients into lasting jobs by the year 2000.

                        The proposal provides $3 billion in mandatory funding for job
                        placement and job creation. States and cities can use these funds to
                        provide subsidies and other incentives to encourage private business
                        to hire welfare recipients. States will also have the option to
                        encourage the growth of intermediaries as job readiness and job
                        placement agents and may use voucher like arrangements, to
                        empower individuals with the tools and choices to help them get jobs
                        and keep them.

                        Establishes Access to Jobs and Training. An important element of
                        moving people from welfare to work is providing access to mobility.
                        The FY98 budget provides $100 million for a new Access to Jobs
                        and Traininglnitiative within the Department of Transportation.
                        This new activity will offer Federal Transit Administration grants to
                        states and local entities for new or modified transportation services
                        that target low income individuals, including current welfare
                        recipients.

                        Establishes Bridges to Work. This comprehensive initiative also
                        expands the Department of Housing and Urban Development's
                        (HUD) Bridges to Work demonstration Project, which links
                        low-income people in central cities to job opportunities in
                        surrounding suburban communities. In addition, HUD will award
                        new portable rental assistance to localities that link their housing
                        assistance with their efforts to move welfare recipients to work.
                                                                              I '~A·t,;ump ConVCiSiJn

Access to Credit        Increases the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund.
                        Finally, the Administration proposes to increase the Community
                        Development Financial Institutions Fund to $1 billion over the next
                        five years thereby expanding the availability of credit, investment
                        capital, financial services, and other development services in
                        distressed urban and rural communities.

Incentives for          Enhances the Work Opportunity Tax Credit. The Administration
Employers               would provide further incentives to create new job opportunities for
                        long-term welfare recipients by converting the current Work
                        Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) into a much enhanced credit that
                        focus on those who need the most help -- long term welfare
                        recipients. The new credit would let employers claim a 50% credit
                        on the first $10,000 a year of wages, for up to two years, for workers
                        they hire who were once long term welfare recipients.

                        Expands the Work Opportunity Tax Credit. In addition, the existing
                        WOTC would be expanded to include able bodied childless adults
                        aged 18-50 who are subject to a rigorous work requirement under the
                        Administration's .food stamp legislative proposal.

Restoring Fairness to   Several provisions in last year's Personal Responsibility and Work
the Federal Safety      Opportunities Act have nothing to do with the goals of welfare
Net Programs            reform -- moving people from welfare to work. Rather, they were
                        misguided cuts in Federal Support to vulnerable populations,
                        including the elderly and people with disabilities.

Food Stamps             Creates and Funds a Real Food Stamp Work Requirement. Instead
                        of the harsh and unreasonable time limit in the welfare bill, which
                        limits food, stamp to able bodied childless adults between the ages of
                        18 and 50 to 3 months in 36, the President proposes a real work
                        requirement for this group. Food Stamps would be limited to 6
                        months in 12 for those who refuse a work opportunity, a policy that
                        would encourage work while giving those out of work the transitory
                        help they need to get back on their feet. New funding and a wage
                        supplementation option are expected to expand the number of work
                        slots available to this group by 380,000 over five years.

                        Helps Families with High Housing Costs. Cuts to families with high
                        housing costs would be ameliorated by increasing and eventually
                        lifting the cap on the excess shelter deduction. This would restore
                        the link between such families and the total cost of their housing.

                        Provides Benefits Which Recognize the Cost of Living. Low income
                        families and individuals face increasing living costs each year. The
                        Administration's proposal would reestablish the relationship between
                        benefits and a rising cost of living, including the value of a
Equity for Immigrants   Protects Immigrants Who Become Disabled. Over 250,000 legal
                        immigrants who experienced an accident or illness which resulted in
                        disability after entering the U.S. would continue to receive SSI and
                        Medicaid benefits. The welfare bill's bar on cash and medical
                        assistance was short-sighted and particularly harsh towards those
                        immigrants who can no longer support themselves because of
                        disabilities.
                        Provides Targeted Assistance to Immigrant Children. The
                        Administration's budget would continue to provide essential cash
                        and medical assistance for low income legal immigrant children --
                        especially the disabled.

                        Creates an Exemptionfor Refugees More Sensitive to their Needs.
                        The welfare bill exempted refugees and asylees from the benefit
                        restrictions for their first five years in the country. The budget
                        would lengthen the exemption for refugees and asylees from 5 to 7
                        years to provide a more appropriate amount of time for refugees and
                        asylees to become citizens.

                        Delays the Banfor Immigrants Receiving Food Stamps. The
                        Administration proposes to delay the ban on Food Stamps for legal
                        immigrants until the end of FY 1997 in order to give legal immigrant
                        families, elderly and disabled more time to naturalize.

Protections for         Provides Adequate Fundingfor States During Recessions. The
Children                proposal would provide sufficient funding for States who face
                        regional or nationwide economic downturns which the current
                        Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant does
                        not include.

                        Continues Medical Care for Low-Income Disabled Children. The
                        President would allow disabled children who lose their SSI eligibility
                        due to changes in the definition of childhood disability to retain their
                        Medicaid health coverage.
