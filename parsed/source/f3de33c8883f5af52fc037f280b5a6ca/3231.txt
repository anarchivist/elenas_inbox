 TEXT:
 Here's the (tentatively) good news: Corr will get back to us tomorrow
 a.m. early reo Koop-Kessler mtg. He thinks it will be o.k., but wants to
 clear with Donna and Kevin (will somebody please delegate some
 decision-making authority?!).  Prefers Tuesday.

 Here's the usual HHS news: Corr wants to work out the entire outreach
 process before we start any meetings.  He's very concerned about such
 questions as: should the meetings be open to press? Which should Donna
 and Bruce do versus staff? How do we make sure we touch all affected
 groups, like retailers? Should we hold a public meeting? etc. etc. etc.
 etc.   He thinks, at our first meeting, we need to be prepared to answer
 reporters' questions about exactly who else we will meet with .

. I walked him back through the Erskine memo, reminded him we had already
  agreed that Bruce/Donna would do 6-8 public health meetings etc., and said
  we didn't need to solve everything about press/who/what/when before we
  started.

We agreed to the following schedule.
1.      We get Koop-Kessler mtg. o.k. from HHS tomorrow and set up
meeting for Tues         (or Monday if White House insists and HHS
relents) .
2.       Tomorrow HHS sends over its detailed written outreach proposal.
(Elena -- you    may need to call Bill tomorrow and reinforce that
this deadline cannot slip).·
3.       Monday WH/HHS meet to close on specific outreach plan and begin
scheduling       additional meetings.

 Does this work?
