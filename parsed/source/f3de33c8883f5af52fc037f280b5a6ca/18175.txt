TEXT:
Sylvia and I and others thought it a good idea for the main addressees of
this e-mail to attend the referenced mtg.

Audrey -- as we discussed, pls get to everyone a list of attendees wi
titles and an agenda, which needs to be crafted so that WH staff can
attend only the first hour of this 3 hour mtg.  Thanks.
