TEXT:
While the District Court has stayed discovery against us pending a
decision on our motion to dismiss, it has ordered us to comply with the
"initial disclosure" requirements of Rule 26(a), which means, inter alia,
that Justice has to identify White House officials who are likely to have
discoverable info on disputed factual issues.   (Of course, privilege
claims on the underlying testimony and documents will be preserved.) We
plan to respond by identifying White House officials who participated
significantly in the Escalante decision.   Since neither Rob nor I was
around at the time, I would like 5 minutes of your time to review a
proposed list. We need to do this by Weds.    please give me a call at
67448.
