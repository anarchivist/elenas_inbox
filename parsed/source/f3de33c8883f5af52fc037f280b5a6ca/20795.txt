MEMORANDUM FOR ERSKINE BOWLES

FROM:          Beverly Barnes

RE:            Additional Issue for Meeting With Asian Pacific American Leaders


Doris Matsui learned today of one additional issue that might come up in the meeting tomorrow.
Below you will find background information and a talking point prepared by DPC.

Also, I have confirmed that Barbara Chow, Elena Kagan, Al Maldon, and Bob Nash will join you
and Doris for the meeting.                .


INS/DOL Collaboration on Labor Inspections

Background:
The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA) requires the Department of Labor to
determine, as part of its regular labor inspection process, whether the employer is in compliance
with the requirement that the employer verify whether each of its employees is authorized to
work (as demonstrated by the employer filling out an 1-9 form for each employee). If the Labor
inspector finds that the employer has not been filling out the 1-9 forms (and therefore not
verifying authorization to work), he is required to refer the matter to the INS. The Labor
Department has no authority to sanction the employer for this violation.

Some within the immigrant and labor communities are concerned that the Department of Labor's
role in enforcing the immigration laws might chill the reporting of other labor violations by
undocumented workers.

Talking point:
·      We are aware of the concerns about the Department of Labor's role in enforcing the
       immigration laws. We have been engaged in discussions with the DOL and INS to
       determine the best way to protect the rights oflegal workers, consistent with the statutory
       requirements set forth by Congress.
