 MEMO TO SUBGROUP ON IMPLEMENTATION, WELFARE REFORM WORKING GROUP
 FROM;             Jeremy Ben

 -Ami
                         Diana Fortuna
                         Domestic Policy Council
 SUBJECT;                Meeting on Monday, August 19
 Each of your offices should have gotten a call by now inviting
 you to a meeting on Monday, August 19 at 2;00 p.m. in Room 211 of
 the OEOB.  This will be the first meeting of the subgroup on
 welfare reform implementation, one of three subgroups outlined at
 a meeting of the larger welfare reform working group that many of
 you attended last Friday.   (That larger group will meet again on
 Tuesday, August 20.)
 The purpose of Monday's meeting is to go over the implementation
 timetables/workplans that you are all developing and to flag any
 policy issues that must be decided along the way.   We will then
 incorporate that information into a government
 o
 -wide calendar.  It
 will be more of a work session than Tuesday's meeting, where our
 subgroup will be expected to report on our progress.
 Please bring to Monday's meeting the documents you are doubtless
 preparing that reflect the tasks your agency must complete and
 the timeline. Timeline information should include relevant
 effective dates of the law and target dates for items such as
 regulations, guidance, instructions, and notices to
 beneficiaries.  Timelines should also reflect differences in the
 process for current recipients and new applicants, when that is
 appropriate. Where target dates are undecided, you should
 provide a range of options, and a description of why you have
 discretion.  In addition, please be prepared to discuss -- or at
 least list -- policy issues that need the group's attention.
 You can call Diana at 45'6
 o
 -5570 with any questions.  Please make
 sure you have provided clearance information (date of birth) to
 Dorothy K. Craft at 456
 o
 -5571.
