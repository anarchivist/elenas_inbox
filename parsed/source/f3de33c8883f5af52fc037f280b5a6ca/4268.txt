Subject:         AIDS Budget

Call Jacquie Lawing at HUD about your budget. They do intend to fund the
AIDS Office, they just need to figure out how to do it. She is incredibly
helpful, so be calm. Jacquie is trying to rap it up today.

By the way, make certain that future memos from Sandy are less threatening
and more policy oriented. This will ensure that the appropriators
understand the funding from HUD is on policy grounds, not based on White
House threats.
