MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:          Bruce Reed
               Elena Kagan

RE:            DPC Weekly Report


       Tobacco -- Legislative Update: On Monday, the Senate will begin consideration of the
McCain bill. We have spent this week negotiating with Senators McCain and Hollings to
develop an agreed upon manager's amendment as well as an amendment strategy for the floor.

        On Thursday, the Finance Committee marked up those sections of the McCain bill that
are within its jurisdiction. The Committee adopted a Conrad amendment raising the per pack
price from $1.10 to $1.50, adopted a Nickels amendment to remove the child care authorization
language, and struck language from the Committee mark which would have devoted revenues
raised under the bill to health care related tax relief.

        Tobacco -- Scoring: On Thursday, the Joint Committee on Taxation released their
score of the McCain bill, estimating a per pack price increase of $1.89 in 2003 (adjusted for
inflation), instead of $1.1 0 estimated by Treasury (in 1998 dollars). The Joint Tax estimate,
however, is only $1.69 when viewed in terms of 1998 dollars. The differences in our analysis
and Joint Tax's are attributable to a number of technical assumptions based on the expected
volume oftobacco product sales. We assume that wholesalers and retailers will not add an
additional markup to the $1.10 price in(;rease, that states will not add new tobacco taxes (due to
the large payments they will receive under the legislation), and that smuggling will be minimized
through a system based on the current successful model for alcohol.

           Tobacco -- House Activity: On Thursday, Representatives Hansen, Meehan, and
  Waxman introduced bipartisan comprehensive tobacco legislation which would raise the price of
. cigarettes by $1.50 over three years, reduce youth smoking by 80% over 10 years (compared to
  60% in McCain), contain very strong company specific penalties (but no industry-wide
  penalties), provide full FDA authority to regulate tobacco under the existing drug and device
  titles, and include strong protections against environmental smoke. The proposal would raise
  approximately $500 billion over 25 years, with 10% of spending for public health and education
  programs, 35% for the states, and 55% for federal debt reduction. The proposal does not
  provide any assistance to farmers. The bill had 90 original cosponsors. 11 were
  Republican.
                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion

         Health Care -- Breast Cancer Legislation: During the Senate Finance Committee
mark up of the tobacco legislation, Senator D' Amato's mastectomy amendment passed by a
narrow 11 to 9 vote. This legislation requires health plans to allow women to stay in the
hospital as long as is medically necessary following a mastectomy, to cover breast reconstruction,
and to guarantee women a second opinion on breast cancer. It did not pass by an overwhelming
vote for a number of reasons. Some felt that tobacco legislation was an inappropriate vehicle for
this legislation; some were concerned that this proposal just contains "body part mandates" rather
than broader patient protections, such as assuring access to specialists, emergency care, and an
external appeals process for patients to address grievances. Others argued that the D' Amato
legislation is designed to be a substitute for a more comprehensive patients' bill of rights, such as
the bill of rights recommended by your quality commission or the Dingell/Kennedy or Norwood
legislation. While we generally support this legislation, we agree with the Democratic
Leadership that it should be done in the context of the broader set of patient protections that you
have been advocating. We do believe, however, that this issue will resonate with both the
disability and the women's community. Therefore, we are tentatively scheduling an event with
you to underscore the importance of the patients' bill of rights to women and to unveil some type
of report that underscores the need legislation.

         Health Care -- Health Care Tax Deductions: The Senate Finance COrrimittee also
voted  to reject Senator Roth's proposal to dedicate a portion of the tobacco revenues to offset the
cost of two health care tax deductions -- a faster phase-in of the self-employed tax deduction
                                                                                                        /
($5.5 billion over five years) and a deduction for those who buy in the individual health
insurance market (about $12 billion over five years). The rationale for the Committee's decision
to reject these proposals mirrored our stated concerns -- that the proposal was inappropriate in
this context because it would undermine the potential to invest dollars from tobacco legislation in
public health, research, and programs to benefit children. With regard to the proposal to allow
deductibility for individual health insurance market, we underscored that such an approach is
regressive, will not significantly increase the number of insured, could create an incentive for
some employers to drop coverage, and is not advisable, particularly in the absence of broader
reforms in the individual insurance market. Because there remains a real possibility that
Republicans will insist on some type of tax proposal in the tobacco legislation, we have
established a process to review options in this regard.

Elena should we delete this section? It was already briefly discussed in the first tobacco
section.

        Welfare Reform -- Vice President's Coalition Meeting: On May 19th the Vice President will
hold the third meeting of the Welfare to Work Coalition to Sustain Success. The Coalition
consists primarily of non-profit and faith-based organizations who are involved in helping
welfare recipients succeed on the job through mentoring and other supports. This meeting will
focus on connecting small businesses with the community-based organizations who can help
them retain welfare recipients. The VP and SBA Administrator will facilitate a town-hall
meeting in the OEOB, with 14 satellite sites around the country hosted by the SBA regional
administrators and other federal partners. The panel will also include two Coalition
                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion       .

 members (such as the YMCA and Women's Missionary Union), at least one small business
 (possibly one of SBA's Welfare to Work award winners to be recognized as part of Small
 Business Week that begins on May 31st), and a former welfare recipient on the panel.
 Participants at each site will include representatives from small businesses,
 community-based organizations, and public agencies.

           Welfare -- New Database Beginning to Find Parents Who Owe Child Support: Since
  it became operational in last October, the National Directory of New Hires, established by the
  welfare refonn law, has identified 900,000 parents who owe child support. The database has
  infonnation on new hires, as well as wage and unemployment insurance data for all workers. In
  all of the cases identified through the new database, states were unable to find the absent parent
  using in-state data alone. Once these parents are found, states then follow up by using wage
  withholding to begin to collect the overdue payments. Database operations will greatly improve
. after October 1998, when HHS will have in place a national registry of child support orders, and
  will no longer have to rely on states to request infonnation on individual child support orders.

         Note: It would be good to get this item in this week, because HHS is testifying on the
 database before Shaw on Tuesday. (It's expected to be a friendly hearing.) HHS was planning
 to announce the 900,000 number below at the hearing, but they'll hold it if we want them to do
 so. Possible opportunities to announce the number are the signing statement for the child
 support felony bill or, if we hold off longer, a signing statementiceremony for the child support
 incentives bill. (Maybe the number will be over 1 million by then.) Note: USA had a story on
 this number on April 24, but the number reported then was 700,000 matches. This is more up to
 date.

          Crime -- Police Week: This week is Police Week, dedicated to honoring law
  enforcement officers around the country. On Wednesday night, the Attorney General
  participated in the annual candlelight vigil held on the Mall; on Friday, the Vice President will
. speak at the Peace Officers' Memorial to commemorate officers slain in the line of duty. In
  1997, 159 law enforcement officers were killed in the line of duty. This represents an increase
  of almost 40% from the number killed in 1996 (116). By the end of the week, we expect
  Congress to pass two bills that are strongly supported by law enforcement and the
  Administration. One establishes a grant program to help local law enforcement agencies purchase
  bulletproof vests for their officers; the other helps fund counseling services for dependents of
  slain officers.

          Crime -- Law Enforcement Technology: Next Tuesday, the Vice President will
 announce a partnership between the Departments of Energy, Justice, and Treasury to provide for
 the transfer of key technologies from the National Laboratories to federal, state and local law
 enforcement to be used to fight crime, drugs, and terrorism. Examples of these technologies,
 which will be on display in the Indian Treaty Room, include: a miniaturized gas chromatograph
 -- the size of a calculator -- which can analyze forensic evidence at the crime scene; and the
 "team leader" multimedia system, which enables law enforcement to simultaneously collect and

  transfer crime scene data as well as communicate with other team members and their command
. post.

         Crime -- Missing Children: Next Thursday, the Justice Department will release a
 guide developed to give family members the information and tools they need to work with law
 enforcement to find their missing child. The guide was written by parents who have
 experienced the trauma of a missing child (including Patty Wetterling and Colleen Nick), with
 the assistance oflaw enforcement and youth service professionals. National Missing and
 Exploited Children's Day is May 25.
