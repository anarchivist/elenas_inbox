TEXT:
You probably know this, but the President misspoke today in the DLC speech
on America Reads.  He said:

"Today, good news -- I expect to sign into law full funding for the
America Reads challenge,
which will significantly increase support, Senator Wofford, for
Americorps, a legacy of the
DLC, so that our young citizen service can harness the energy of a whole
army of volunteer
tutors, now including over 800 colleges and universities in America who
are going out into
schools to teach young children to read."

The suggested language I gave Waldman said, "Today I will sign an
appropriations bill that will give the AmeriCorps program its first
significant increase in funding since 1995. Those funds will support one
of my highest priorities, the America Reads initiative .... " I assume he
ad-libbed the full funding line.  Shireman says that Gene and Jake have
clarified this for the press.
