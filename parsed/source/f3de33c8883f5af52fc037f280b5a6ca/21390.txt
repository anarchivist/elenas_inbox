TEXT:
BR/EK:

I just got invited to a meeting at ONDCP tomorrow on the DC medical
marijuana initiative.  I understand that McCaffrey wants us (WH Counsel,
DPC, DOJ, ONDCP) to meet/strategize on this ASAP, since he's thinking
about doing a press conference w/Mario Cuomo and Bill Bennett next
Thursday.

EK:  The meeting is tomorrow at 10:30am at ONDCP.   Are you interested in
going?

BR:   Any important history I need to know on how we handled this the last
time?

Any other thoughts, reactions?

Jose'
