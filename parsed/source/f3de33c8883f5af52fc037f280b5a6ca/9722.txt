TEXT:
Sen Mack has told Gov Chiles that Sen Lott asked Erskine if we were ready
to talk about tobacco and weather we would buy the Chiles proposal.
Erskine reportedly said no. Chiles is worked up thinking this violates
the commitment made at the meeting between Chiles and Erskine that we
attended.  I fully appreciate how vague Chiles request was, and how vague
but generally supportive ("we can do business on this") we were. There
must be some fine print here not getting reported. Do either of you know
what transpired and have advice for what to tell Chiles.

Thank you.
