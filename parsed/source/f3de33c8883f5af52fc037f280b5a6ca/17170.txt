Work Participation Rates

Question:     Why are so many states not meeting the work rates?       Does that mean welfare
              reform is a failure?

Answer:       It's important to keep in perspective that 93 percent of the welfare caseload is
              made up of single parent families and nearly all states expect to meet the work
              rates for those families. The law requires 25 percent of the total welfare caseload
              to work and 75 percent of the two parent families to work. We think these work
              rules are tough but fair and states with serious welfare reform efforts should be
              able to meet them. Mter all, in these families one parent can work while the
              other takes care of the children.

Question:     How many states do you expect to fail the work rates?

Answer:       We are not sure.    States have until mid-November to report data.      Informally,
most
              states have told us they will meet the overall 25 percent work rate, but many have
              reported concerns about meeting the 75 percent two parent rate. As you may
              know, the Associated Press surveyed states and found 19 states exped to fail the
              two parent work rates and seven states do not know. However, because of the
              staggered start dates for state TANF plans, only two-thirds of states have to report
              data and are subject to financial penalties this fiscal year, and none of these states
              will be reporting more than three months of data (from July 1- September 30th) ..

Question:     Will the Administration penalize states that fail the work rates?

Answer.       We will impose penalties on states that do not meet work rates. We believe it is
              critical that states place a priority on putting welfare families to work. The law
              does provide states with the opportunity to receive a credit toward the work rates
              for those who leave the welfare rolls and allows them to propose a corrective
              compliance plan in lieu of a penalty. We will evaluate these requests on a case
              by case basis.

Question:    Is the Administration going to weaken the two parent work rate through
             regulations, as The New York Times reported this morning?

Answer:      The welfare law explicitly says that states shall receive a "pro rata reduction of the
             participation rate due to caseload reductions" and provides a formula for reducing
             the work rates from, for example, 75 to 50 percent, if the state has had a 25 .
             percent caseload reduction. Thus it is the law, not the regulation, which provides
             the caseload credit.

             [Background: the issue raised in The New York Times this morning is whether
             the regulation will give states the choice of using the percentage reduction in two
             parent families or the percentage reduction in all families when subtracting the
             credit from the 75 percent two-parent work rate.]

Question:    What will the penalties be?

Answer:      States will be penalized 5 percent of their TANF block grant for the period in
             question (in this case, one to three months). For each consecutive year of
             failure, the penalty will increase.

Question:    What data will be available today?

Answer:      Actually, we don't have any data to release today because states have until mid-
             ovember to report work participation data to HHS for the fiscal year ending
             September 30th. Also, because of the staggered start dates for state TANF plans,
             only 34 states have to report data this fiscal year, and none of these states will be
             reporting more than three months of data (from July 1- September 30th).

Child Support Computer Systems

Question:    Haven't a lot of states failed to meet the October 1st deadline for having state-wide
             child support computer systems in place? What is the Adminstration planning. to
             do about this?

Answer.       States have had nine years to develop these computer systems, and we don't
             intend to extend the deadline any further. We do, however, believe that the
             current law -- which requires us to withhold all federal child support funds -- will
             undermine efforts to collect child support for need families. Thus, while we
             proceed with the penalty process, we intend to accept the invitation from members
             of Congress such as Chairman Shaw to try to work together to devise an
             additional penalty structure.                       .
                                                                                        '4\

Question:   Doesn't the states failure to put in place these computer systems show that these
            computer systems will never work?

Answer:     To·the contrary -- the increasing computerization of the child support enforcement
            has been one of the key reasons child support collections have increased by 50
            percent over the past four years. Computers enable us to find and withhold child
            support from paycheck and bank accounts automatically. The National Directory
            of New Hires, which will go on line today, will enable us to find parents working
            in another state from their children.

Question:   What exactly is the National Directory of New Hires?

Answer:     Whenever a new employee is hired, employers will report six types of data --
            employee name, addresss, Social Security number and employer names, address,
            and federal employer identification number -- to a state new hire database. Each
            of the fifty states will then report that data to the National Directory of New Hires,
            where it will be matched against records of parents who owe child support to
            locate and begin collection procedures against them.

Question:   Which states will not have met this computer systems deadline?

Answer:     The Department of Health and Human Services believes that 17 states and the
            District of Columbia will not meet the deadline. These states are: California,
            Michigan, Illinois, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Nevada, South Carolina, New Mexico,
            Alaska, Maryland, Indiana, Hawaii, Massachusetts, North ,Dakota, South Dakota,
            Oregon, and Missouri.
