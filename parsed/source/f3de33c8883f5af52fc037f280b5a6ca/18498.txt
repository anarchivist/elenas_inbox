Subject:         Revised Draft Agenda

Attached is a revised agenda that better reflects our desire to have one
panel that focuses on national issues and the other that focuses on local
issues with people who have experience working with people in poverty.   It
would be great if you could send this one out and ask people to ignore
the earlier one.

                       President's Advisory Board On Race
                     Northern California, February 10-11, 1998

Theme: Race and Poverty in America

The purpose of this meeting is to examine the relationship between race, poverty, and public
policy in both urban and rural America. We will explore why, despite important
improvements, minorities remain most impacted by poverty, examining the link between race
and poverty. The poverty rate for Hispanics and Asian Pacific Americans in 1990 was, for
example, higher then it was in 1969. Typically the highest rates of poverty are experienced by
American Indians. At the same time, from 1960 through 1990, the poverty rate for
African-Americans has been significantly higher than for almost any other racial group.

Further, we will examine the need for and effectiveness of public and private sector responses
to the persistence and concentration of race-based poverty, including breaking the
well-documented cycle of poverty. Recommendations made thirty years ago by the Kerner
Commission in addressing race will be reviewed for their relevance. We will identify some
promising practices aimed at reducing poverty in minority communities including SBA,
housing and community development projects.

Key Questions:

·   To what extent are poverty and race related? Is there a link between race and concentrated
    poverty?

·   What are the main causes of continuing and concentrated poverty among whites and
    minorities? Does discrimination continue to effect opportunities for minorities to move
    out of poor, segregated neighborhoods? What are the connections between racial isolation
    and poverty and how can we alter the negative aspects of these connections?

·   What governmental and non-governmental programs and policies are most effective in
    addressing minority group poverty and racial segregation? Should such policies and
    programs differ in order to address the distinctive position and needs of different
    raciaVethnic groups? How should they do this?

Day 1 (San Francisco/OaklandlEast Palo Alto):

The day will be devoted to having Board members visit Promising Practices sites in the San
Francisco, Oakland, and East Palo Alto communities. The day will end with a community

(CMSA). The presenter will describe who is poor in America, trends in poverty and race,
and how racial groups differ from each other.
Possible presenters: Dr. Laura Tyson, University of California at Berkeley or local area
expert.

9:40 am - 11:45 am: Poverty and Race: Facts, Causes, and National Issues

HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo will be invited to participate in the morning panel with the
Advisory Board. This round table discussion will bring together national experts to discuss if
there is a link between race and poverty, as well as the status and causes of continuous and
concentrated poverty in urban and rural communities. Economic inequality and race will be
assessed as will the role of housing discrimination and how it limits opportunities to move out
of "ghetto" neighborhoods. The key controversies have been the extent to which the causes
are racial or non-racial and the extent to which the poor themselves bear responsibility for the
continued impoverishment. The focus will be on national policies, programs, and legislative
issues.

        Professor William Julius Wilson, Harvard;
        Professor Douglas Massey, University of Pennsylvania;
