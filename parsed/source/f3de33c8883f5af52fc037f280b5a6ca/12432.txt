           The idea below -- many e-mails below (smile) is very good.  Can someone
           provide Ben with some direction in terms of whether or not pursuing would
           be good.  I do believe it would be an excellent way for the President to
           reach thousands of young people. He could certainly speak from the
           perspective of a Father and President.  Thanks!

          Why don't you raise it with Loretta and If she doesn't respond in a
          positive way, I'll raise it and get the team to raise it.   I just think as
          the Weekly Reader folks do, that this is a golden opportunity to reach out
          to a large group of young people in the aftermath of littleton.

 ben, my best guess is that. this is a speechwriting assignment.  they could
 probably take the text of some speech theY've done, shorten it and rewrite
 it in appropriate language.   the other possibility would be dpc doing a
 draft that speechwriting then approves.   great idea! bb

 I just got off the phone with the Chairman of the Board of the Weekly
 Reader and he thinks an article from the POTUS in their 6-7th grade
 edition is a good idea. He is meeting with his editorial Board to decide
 whether to extend the offer and said he will get back with me in a few
 days.   If he says its a go, who in the White House do I get with to write
 a short thoughtful piece on tolerance. He said kids allover the country
 are feeling the affects of littleton.   Sylvia .... he is fedexing me some
 copies, I'll make sure you guys get a copy to bring back memories.
