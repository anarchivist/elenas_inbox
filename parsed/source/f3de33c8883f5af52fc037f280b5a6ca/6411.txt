Do you agree with OMB on this? I do. The proposal might appear to take
the place of our asking for a more comprehensive bill.

Subject:         Re: HHS A-19 on Ingredient Disclosure in Tobacco Products

Josh Gotbaum asked us to seek your views on a legislative proposal that
HHS/CDC would like to submit to the Hill this year regarding ingredient
disclosure (see attached e-mails for summary.) Although we have no
technical objections to the proposal, we recommend not sending this to the
Hill this year, since the Administration is not proposing comprehensive
tobacco legislation. A very similar proposal as the one HHS/CDC would
like to send is also included in the Conrad bill, for which the
Administration has expressed support.

Please let us know if you/DPC concur with the OMB recommendation.
Thanks. Greg.

Subject:         HHS A-19 on Ingredient Disclosure in Tobacco Products

HHS has sent us ah A-19 legislative proposal for CDC that would expand
HHS' ability to obtain specific information on the type and quantity of
ingredients in tobacco products.   We are seeking your guidance on whether
you would like HHS to submit this A-19 proposal to Congress.

HD Recommendation: HD staff have no technical objections to the A-19 (see
description below).  However, given that the Administration is not
submitting tobacco legislation to Congress this year, we recommend that
HHS not send this A-19 forward.   In addition, similar versions of HHS'
A-19 are already included in the Jeffords and Conrad tobacco bills,

summary of the A-19: The A-19 would do the following 3 things:

(1) Authorize HHS to obtain brand-specific information on ingredients in
cigarette and smokeless tobacco products, including the quantity of
ingredients;

(2) Authorize HHS to report to the public any potential health risks
associated with exposure to these ingredients; and

(3) Amend current law to require manufacturers of tobacco products to
disclose their products' ingredients in descending order according to
weight, measure or numerical count, as part of the packaging.

Current Law requires the tobacco industry to annually provide to HHS a
list of ingredients added to tobacco in the manufacturing of tobacco
products. However, the industry is neither required to report the
quantity and relative proportion of these ingredients nor provide this
information by brand or by company.  CDC staff advises that the law firm
of covington and Burling provides this list of ingredients to HHS on
behalf of the industry.   According to CDC staff, HHS is also required to
treat this information as confidential to assure that trade secret
information is not released or be subject to FOIA requests.

HHS Rationale for A-19: According to CDC staff, HHS is required to analyze
and report to Congress the possible adverse health effects of specific
ingredients in tobacco products.  In order to carry out this authority,
HHS believes they must have information on the quantify and brand-specific
use of ingredients in these products.  They would also like to provide
this information to consumers so that they can make fully informed choices
regarding the products they choose to purchase.

The AG Settlement includes similar, but not exactly the same, provisions


as those included in the HHS A-19.   The AG settlement would give FDA the
authority to evaluate all additives in tobacco products.   (See pages 19-20
of the Settlement.)  Under the settlement, no non-tobacco ingredient could
be used in manufacturing tobacco products unless the manufacturer could
demonstrate within 5 years after the enactment of tobacco legislation that
such ingredient is not harmful under the intended conditions of use.   It
would also require the manufacturers to disclose to FDA the ingredients
and the amounts in each brand. Finally, it would require manufacturers to
disclose ingredient information to the public under regulations comparable
to what current federal law requires for food products.     The HHS A-19
would have the industry report this information to CDC, as opposed to the
FDA.

If you concur, we will advise HHS staff that we have no objection to the
concept, but that it doesn't make sense to transmit a small piece of
tobacco legislation, while not submitting comprehensive language in
support of the Budget.   Please let us know how you would like to
proceed.
