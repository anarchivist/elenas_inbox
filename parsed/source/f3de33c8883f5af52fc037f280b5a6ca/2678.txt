TEXT:
We are hearing that Shaw plans to add a bunch of punitive immigrati"on
measures that we have fought in the past to the markup he is doing to
restore benefits to legal immigrants. We are getting more details, but I
think these are things like requiring sponsors to have higher incomes,
deporting immigrants who use means-tested benefits, and other things that
we successfully knocked out of the immigration bill at the 11th hour.
Elena, since we are seeing Haskins tomorrow, I thought you should know.
Jose/Leanne/Steve:  are you working on this? OMB is trying to gather
info, and points out it's all Byrd-able in the Senate.
