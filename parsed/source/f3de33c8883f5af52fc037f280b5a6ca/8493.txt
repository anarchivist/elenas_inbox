TEXT:
Here are the first two --the one with all the announcements and the one on
the Food Safety Research Institute.   There is one problem with the
Institute --even though OSTP, USDA, and OMB are pretty much fine with it,
Jim O'Hara doesn't want HHS to be a part of it because he (1) thinks we
already have an interagency working group and this doesn't do anything
new; and (2) we are doing this so fast that he is concerned about the 90
day report and thinks this should just coordinate USDA's internal
research.     ==================== ATTACHMENT   1 ==================== .

            THE PRESIDENT ANNOUNCES JOINT INSTITUTE FOR FOOD SAFETY
                     RESEARCH AND LABELING OF FRESH JUICES
                                  July 4,1998

     In his weekly radio address, the President will announce the publication of a final rule to increase
     the safety of fruit and vegetable juices. The new regulation, which will take effect in time for
     this year's apple cider season, would help control illnesses that may come from fresh,
     unpasteurized juices by requiring labels to alert those most at risk of food-borne illness such as
     children and the elderly. The rule will require that all packaged fresh juice be labeled with a
     warning advising consumers of the potential risks of juice that has not been processed to
     eliminate harmful bacteria. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) estimates that there are
     up to 48,000 cases of juice-related illness each year. In addition, the President will announce a
     plan to begin developing a Joint Institute for Food Safety Research that will strategically plan
     food safety research activities consistent with the President's Food Safety Initiative. Finally, the
     Presidentwill call on Congress to fully fund his Food Safety Initiative, pass vital food safety
     legislation, and confirm Dr. Jane E. Henney as the new FDA commissioner.

     Providing Warning Labels for Consumers. The President will announce a final rule that will
     require warning labels on juice products that have not been processed to reduce microbial risk.
     These labels would state that the product has not been treated to eliminate microbes; that the
     product may contain pathogens known to cause serious illness; and that the risk is greatest for
     children, the elderly, and people with weakened immune systems. These labels would be
     required for all packages of untreated, fresh juices but not for juice sold for on-site consumption
     such as in restaurants. This rule will be effective for this year's apple cider season.

     Food Safety Research Institute. The President will direct the Secretaries of Health and
     Human Services (HHS) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to develop within 90
     days a plan for creating a Joint Institute for Food Safety Research that will: (1) strategically plan
     food safety research activities consistent with the President's Food Safety Initiative; and (2)
     efficiently coordinate all Federal food safety research, including with the private sector and
     academia. The goal of this Joint Institute for Food Safety Research will be to develop the means
     to identify and characterize foodbome hazards more rapidly and accurately, and to develop
     effective interventions that can be used as appropriate to prevent food contamination at each step
     from farm to table.

     Fund Food Safety Initiative and Pass Food Safety Legislation. The President also will call
     on Congress to fully fund his $101 million food safety initiative which provides for a number of
     initiatives including funding research on the detection of pathogens, enhancing FDA's inspection
     capabilities, and expanding consumer education initiatives. The President will call on Congress
     to pass two vital pieces offood safety legislation that will improve the safety of this Nation's
     food supply. The first piece oflegislation will ensure that the FDA halts imports of fruits,
     vegetables, and other food products from any foreign country with food safety systems that do
     not provide the same level of protection required for U.S. products. This legislation gives FDA
     authority that is comparable to USDA's existing authority to prevent the importation of unsafe
     meat and poultry. The second piece oflegislation will give USDA the authority to issue
                                                                 ~x·Dump Conversion
mandatory recalls and impose civil penalties for unsafe meat and poultry.

Confirm New FDA Commissioner. The President also called on Congress to confirm Dr. Jane
E. Henney as the new Commissioner of the FDA. The FDA needs the strong leadership of Dr.
Henney to help lead the way to improving food safety and to assure the safety and efficacy of
pharmaceutical and biological therapeutics, medical devices, blood products, generic drugs, food
additives and cosmetics.

            Clinton Administration Accomplishments In Improving Food Safety

The President's announcement builds on a strong record of food safety initiatives, ensuring that
Americans eat the safest possible food. The Administration has put into place improved safety
standards for meat, poultry, and seafood products, and has begun the process of developing
enhanced standards for fruit and vegetable juices. The Administration also has expanded
research, education, and surveillance activities throughout the food safety system.

*February, 1998. Administration announces its proposed food safety budget, which requests an
approximate $101 million increase for food safety initiatives.

*May, 1997. Administration announces comprehensive new initiative to improve the safety of
nation's food supply --"Food Safety from Farm to Table" -- detailing a $43 million food safety
program, including measures to improve surveillance, outbreak response, education, and
research.

*January,1997. President announces new Early-Warning System to gather critical scientific
data to help stop foodbome disease outbreaks quickly and to improve prevention systems further.

*August,1996. President signs Safe Drinking Water Act of 1996. The law requires drinking
water systems to protect against dangerous contaminants like cryptosporidium, and gives people
the right to know about contaminants in their tap water.

*August, 1996. President signs Food Quality Protection Act of 1996, which streamlines
regulation of pesticides by FDA and EPA and puts important new public-health protections in
place, especially for children.      .

*July,1996. President Clinton announces new regulations that modernize the nation's meat and
poultry inspection system for the first time in 90 years. New standards help prevent E.coli
bacteria contamination in meat.

*December,1995. Administration issues new rules to ensure seafood safety, utilizing HACCP
regulatory programs to require food industries to design and implement preventive measures and
increase the industries' responsibility for and control of their safety assurance actions.

*1994. CDC embarks on strategic program to detect, prevent, and control emerging infectious
disease threats, some of which are food borne, making significant progress toward this goal in
each successive year.

*1993. Vice-President's National Performance Review issues report recommending
government and industry move toward a system of preventive controls.

                      THE PRESIDENT ANNOUNCES FOOD SAFETY
                               RESEARCH INSTITUTE
                                    July 1, 1998

In his weekly radio address, the President will announce a plan to develop a Joint Institute for
Food Safety Research that will strategically plan food safety research activities consistent with
the President's Food Safety Initiative.

Joint Institute for Food Safety Research. The President will direct the Secretaries of the U.S.
Department of Agriculture (USDA) and Health and Human Services (HHS) to develop within 90
days a plan for creating a Joint Institute for Food Safety Research that will: (1) strategically plan
food safety research activities consistent with the President's Food Safety Initiative; and (2)
efficiently coordinate all Federal food safety research, including with the private sector and
academia. Two of the principal goals of this Joint Institute for Food Safety Research will be to
develop the means to identify and characterize foodbome hazards more rapidly and accurately,
and to develop effective interventions that can be used as appropriate to prevent food
contamination at each step from farm to table.

Food safety research is critically needed to develop the means to identify and characterize
foodborne hazards more rapidly and accurately, to provide information and tools for
regulatory programs and enforcement, and to develop effective interventions that can be
used as appropriate to prevent food contamination at each step from farm to table. New
pathogens appear or grow more resistant, and we need the best science available to better
improve food safety.

Currently, there are at least 12 agencies that conduct food safety research. Under the
President's food safety initiative, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy
has established an interagency food safety research council to help coordinate Federal
research priorities and planning. While this interagency process is improving our
coordination, a Joint Institute for Food Safety Research will provide an even stronger and
better focused research strategy for food safety.

In addition to improving coordination among the Federal agencies, the Institute will serve
as a focal point for coordinating research with states, the private sector, and academia,
including public-private research partnerships, as appropriate. The specific structure and
operations of the Institute will be outlined in the agencies' report back to the President, and
will be based on extensive consultations with all stakeholders.
