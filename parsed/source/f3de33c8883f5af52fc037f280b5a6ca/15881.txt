TEXT:
fOLKS--I need some guidance here. While it may be true that the President
indicated his support for a National Museum of Women's History--there has
been no White House process to determine whether or not the President
should appoint such a task force.  Moreover, until Sondra's e-mail I was
unaware of any letter signed by 46 congress folks that hadn't been
responded to--the first I heard about this issue and the effort to creat a
Task Force was Sondra's scheduling request and I sent her back to counsel
to figure out where things were.  In my opinion is not the way to approach
issues like this, but maybe I'm wrong.   What do we think?

Subject:         Re: POTUS/FLOTUS message request for Suffrage Event

Maria -- speaking of the politics -- I just got a call from Gayle
Ravnitzky in Rep. Carol Maloney's office stressing the need for this
message of support from the President. They are hoping that the reason
none of the principals can attend the rededication ceremony is simply
scheduling conflicts and NOT because of CD Tucker or any loss of support
for the importance of the event or the NMWH by the President. Gayle
reminded me that when Rep. Maloney participated in the Congressional
Women's Caucus meeting with the POTUS and VPOTUS a few months ago that she
brought up the idea of the President forming a joint task force on the


National Museum of Women's History -- and he said it was a GREAT idea.
Now, they're wanting to know:  1) if in fact the President is still
supporting this idea,
2)  how far along are we in the process of getting it formed, and 3) if
there could be a mention of this in his letter to be ready at the
rededication.   Gayle was also wondering why the White House (the
President) has NOT even responded to the letter to the President signed
by 46 members of Congress urging the formation of this task force.

I think Congresswoman Maloney may need to get a call from you or another
senior person regarding the following:
1) The continued support of the Administration for the formation of a
Presidential Joint Task Force on the NMWH and the Suffrage Statue (and why
we will have no senior Adminstration representation at the rededication
event) ;
2) Where we are on the task force process (it's in General Counsel's
hands under review right now - with Rob Weiner -- as of Monday);
3) The prospect of a Presidential message to be read aloud at the
Rededication ceremony 6/26 and the possib1ity its mentioning the possible
formation of the task force; and
4) The propspect of a written response from the President to the letter of
wide support from the 46 House Represenatives for the formation of a
Presidential Task Force on the NMWH.

Please advise.
