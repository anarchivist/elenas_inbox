Subject:         Daily report on public charge--

Public Charge: Yesterday, the National Council of La Raza advised us
against issuing a general statement on our decision that use of Medicaid,
ChildrenD,s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and/or Food Stamps will not
be considered in determining whether a legal immigrant is a "public
charge" except where an individual has received institutionalized care
funded by Medicaid. We had considered issuing such a statement, so that
immigrants newly eligible for Food Stamps starting November 1st would have
this information, even though the detailed INS guidance about the entire
public charge issue is being held up as the OLC considers one more legal
issue. However, La Raza argued that this general statement -- without
backup detail on a host of related issues -- would create more confusion
in the immigrant community and would not be welcomed.

A 3:30 call we intended to be about "can we issue this statement and how"
thus became an opportunity for us to 1) remind DOJ we need an answer to
the legal question ASAP and 2) once OLC makes its ruling, we will need to
move forward as quickly as possible.

The La Raza board is coming to the White House Friday for a long scheduled
meeting. Maria had said we might use the opportunity have a quiet side
conversation about the issue and that she would involve us in this
discussion.
