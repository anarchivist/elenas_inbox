TEXT:
Jon and I wanted to flag some issues around increased federal investments
for IDEA in the context of the tobacco proposal, IDEA/class size measure
in the Senate Ed-Flex bill, and a proposed DNC resolution.  We are
continuing to have discussions with OMB and ED to determine the impact of
increases in federal spending on the state/local share of the costs of
educating children with disabilities. Attached is a draft memo that
summarizes information from OMB and ED on the relevant IDEA funding
provisions and outlines our current understanding of how these provisions
would impact the ability of state/locals to use federal increases in IDEA
funding.

I am also forwarding an email from OMB/David Rowe that goes into more
detail on the MOE/Trigger/40% provisions  (see below). David is out his
week, but we will connect with him next week.

Included in this email is a summary of the following:

The Maintenance of Effort (MOE) requirement in the IDEA statute.

The IDEA funding "trigger" when appropriations exceed $4.1 billion.

The 40 percent federal funding "commitment" for IDEA.

When I refer to "Part B" grants in this email, I mean IDEA, Part B Grants
to States. This is the largest piece of federal special education funding
(in FY 1999, it made up $4.3 billion of the $5.3 billion total for special
education), the piece Congress has been outbidding the Administration on,
and the piece for which the "trigger" applies. The FY 2000 Budget
increases federal special education spending by $116 million, but provides
only a $3 million increase to Part B Grants to States.

Maintenance of Effort (MOE)

The IDEA statute only requires that States do not reduce their financial
support for special education and related services below the preceding
fiscal year's financial support.   If a State doesn't meet this
requirement, then the State's following year Part B allocation is reduced
by the same amount by which the State did not meet the requirement.
States do not need to match federal IDEA dollars or increases to federal
spending.

At the local level, LEAs are also required to not reduce their
expenditures for students with disabilities from the previous fiscal year,
except under certain circumstances (e.g., the number of students with
disabilities in the LEA decreases). Again, there is no required match to
receive these funds.  This MOE requirement is enforced by each State's
educational agency.

The IDEA Funding "Trigger"

In general, it is safe to say that:

Of every dollar the federal government spends on Special Education State
Grants that exceeds $4.1 billion, LEAs could use up to 20 cents (i.e., 20
percent) to supplant, not supplement, their own spending on special
education.

The IDEA "trigger" goes into effect when total Part B appropriations
exceed $4.1 billion, which happened for the first time in FY 1999. Under
the IDEA "trigger," LEAs can treat as local funds up to 20 percent of the
increase in Part B funds it received over the amount it received the
previous year.   But, when determining local level expenditures for
purposes of MOE in the next fiscal year, only the actual local funds are
counted.

The best way to illustrate how this trigger works is with an example.
Let's sayan LEA received $1 million in Part B funds in FY 1998 and spent
$3 million of its own funds for special education.  In FY 1999, the first
year in which the trigger is in effect, the LEA receives $1.2 million in
Part B funds.  Of this total, the trigger applies to 20 percent of the
$200,000 increase, or $40,000.  So, in FY 1999, in order to meet the local
MOE requirement the LEA would only have to spend $2.96 million of its own
funds for special education.


In the next year, FY 2000, let's say the LEA receives $1.3 million in Part
B funds.  Of this total, the trigger applies to 20 percent of the $100,000
increase, or $20,000. But, the relevant local funds from the prior year
is only $2.96 million, of which $20,000 can be covered by the LEAs Part B
allocation.   In FY 2000, in order to meet the local MOE requirement the
LEA would only have to spend $2.94 million of its own funds for special
education, $20,000 less than the previous year, and $60,000 less than in
FY 1998. Thus, the longer the trigger stays in effect and appropriations
grow, the lower the MOE and the more money the LEA or State can spend on
other, non-IDEA, purposes.

On 12/3/98 Chairman Goodling sent a letter to each school superintendents
telling them about the trigger.  In this letter, Goodling described the
trigger as a provision that provides "direct spending relief for local
school districts."  "This provision," Goodling wrote, "allows your school
district to reduce its level of local expenditures for special education
and related services."

40 Percent "Commitment"

The IDEA authorization level for Part B is "such sums as may be
necessary." The IDEA statute then states that the "maximum" Part B grant
a State is entitled to in any fiscal year is the sum of the number of
children with disabilities in the State receiving special education
services multiplied by 40 percent of the U.S. average per-pupil
expenditure (APPE) in public elementary and secondary schools.  This is
not in the statute and there never has been an explicit "commitment" to
provide States an amount per eligible child equal to 40 percent of the
national APPE.

The federal government has never come close to providing 40 percent of the
APPE for each disabled child; the highest the federal government has ever
provided was 12.5 percent in FY 1979 (the total State Grants appropriation
that year was $804 million).

The FY 1999 Part B appropriation covered about 11.7 percent of APPE, the
FY 2000 request should cover about 11.2 percent.  If the federal
government were to provide the 40 percent of APPE maximum in FY 2000, it
would have to provide $15.3 billion to Part B Grants, or $11 billion (255
percent) more than the FY 2000 Budget requests.

Note that both the number of children with disabilities and the APPE
increases every year.  In the past five years, the APPE has increased by
an average of 2.5 percent annually, and the number of children with
disabilities has increased by an average of 2.7 percent annually.    So, in
other words, increasing IDEA State Grant spending to $15.3 billion in ten
years would not cover 40 percent of the APPE in that lOth year.   Using the
above five-year averages. if the federal government wanted to cover 40
percent of the APPE for each special education child in 10 years (i.e., in
FY 2009), it would have to provide about $24.3 billion in FY 2009.

Draft Memorandum

Generally, increases in federal funding for grants to states under IDEA would not result in
comparable decreases in the amount that states and districts would contribute to special
education funding. Under IDEA's maintenance of effort and supplement-not-supplant provisions,
increases in federal IDEA funding would immediately increase the overall dollars spent on
special education, but would move slowly to shift a portion of the state/local share to the federal
government.

 IDEA Provisions:

(1) 40% federal funding "commitment"
Under the IDEA statute, the maximum that a state can receive under the state grants program is
the sum of the number of children with disabilities in the State receiving special education
services multiplied by 40 percent of the national average per-pupil expenditure (APPE) in public
elementary and secondary schools. This cap on federal funding is often misconstrued as a
"commitment" to provide 40% of state special education costs.' According to OMB, if the
federal government were to provide the 40 percent of APPE maximum in FY 2000, it would
have to provide $15.3 billion in state grants, or $11 billion more than is in the FY 2000 Budget
request. Since both the number of children with disabilities and the APPE increases every year,
OMB estimates that covering the same 40% of APPE in FY 2009 would take $24.3 billion

(2) Maintenance of Effort (MOE)
States cannot reduce their funding for special education below the prior year's level. If a state
fails to meet this requirement, than the following year's grant is reduced by the same amount by
which the state did not meet the MOE requirement. At the local level, school districts are also
required to maintain their expenditures for students with disabilities from the previous fiscal
year, except under certain circumstances (e.g., the number of students with disabilities in the
district decreases). Federal increases in IDEA spending cannot be used by local districts to meet
their MOE requirement - with a limited exception when total federal IDEA spending passes a
certain level (see below). Other non-IDEA federal funds can be used by local districts to meet
its MOE requirement only where the district is not accountable for the use of the federal funds.
This is generally a tough requirement to meet - as most federal education funding is targeted
toward specific purposes. Education suggested that impact aid (which basically functions as a
block grant to districts to compensate for presence of non-taxable military facilities) might fit this
non-IDEA federal funds exception. Neither states nor local districts are required to match federal
increases in IDEA spending.

(3) IDEA Funding "Trigger"
Once the federal appropriations for state grants exceeds $4.1 billion B which happened for the
first time in FY 1999 - school districts can use up to 20% of a federal increase in state grants to

          'The 40% of APPE number is used as a proxy for the additional costs of providing special education
services to disabled students. Education estimated that if the federal government were to provide 40% of the APPE
for each disabled child in FY 2000, it would equal roughly 34% of the actual cost of special education services.
                                 TIex-Dump Conversion

replace their own spending on special education. Moreover, in the subsequent fiscal year, the
MOE requirement for the local district is reduced by that same 20% (to reflect the amount of its
own funds that the local district actually spent). Over time, continued increases in federal funding
for state grants will result in decreased MOE requirements for local districts B and thus, will
slowly begin to shift a portion of the local costs to the federal government.

Increases in Federal IDEA Spending

 Tobacco
If funds are set aside from the tobacco settlement for IDEA and those funds are treated as a
federal IDEA spending- then the increases would largely supplement, not supplant state and local
funding. School districts would have to maintain their local level of spending from the prior year
and would only be free to use 20% of the federal increase to supplant local spending. In order to
continue to decrease the local MOE share, federal funding would have to increase in subsequent
years. Each year, the local district could then reduce its spending by 20% of the increase from
the prior year. A move toward meeting 40% of the average per pupil expenditure would allow
local districts to slowly reduce their own spending over time (and would also help districts meet
continuing increases in the cost of providing special education service). If the tobacco funds are
not subject to the IDEA maintenance of effort provisions - then districts could potentially use
100% of the IDEA/tobacco set-aside to their supplant their own local funding2.

Class-Size/IDEA
Although our strategy on dealing with this measure is focused on eliminating it in conference, we
thought it was worth examining how this provision would work - as it may yield additional
substantive arguments against the Jeffords measure and it is fair to expect that Republicans may
try a similar maneuver at a later point. It is not clear whether the IDEA maintenance of
effort/supplement provisions would apply to class size funds that districts used for special
education as permitted under the current Senate Ed-Flex bill.

According to a preliminary read by ED, the language in the amendment stating that class size
funds may be used for special education services "in accordance with the requirements of
IDEA" suggests that the MOE provisions would apply. If so, then school districts that used
their class size allocation for special education costs would have to treat it as a federal IDEA
increase -- and thus, would at most only be able to reduce their local share of special education
funding by 20% of amount of their class size allocation. This somewhat weakens the Republican
argument that shifting class size funding to special education would reduce the local burden and
allow school districts to use their funds for class size, after school, dropout prevention -- since
in reality the amount local districts would have to contribute for special education would be
reduced only slightly next fiscal year. However, over time and with continued federal increases,
the local school district's MOE requirement would continue to decrease. If the ability to spend


          2This could be the case because (I) the tobacco funds are not considered "federal" funds and are treated as
local dollars, or (2) the tobacco funds fit the exception allowing the use of other non-IDEA federal funds to supplant
local IDEA spending, or (3) the tobacco legislation contains a provision to allow the IDEA set-aside to be used to
supplant local spending.
                          Hex-Dump Conversion

class size dollars on special education is not considered an increase in federal IDEA spending,
then school districts could seemingly use 100% of their class size allocation to supplant their
local IDEA spending. Education thinks that the class size federal funds would not fit the "other
non-IDEA federal funds" exception that allows for local supplanting because districts are held
accountable for the use of class size dollars.

DNC resolution
Jon mentioned that he (and you, he thought) had received a memo from Minyon Moore asking
for feedback on a possible DNC resolution calling for federal funding of IDEA up to the 40% of
average per pupil expenditure level within three years. If the IDEA provisions apply, increased
federal funding would cause an immediate increase in overall special education spending, but"
states/locals would still have to maintain their same level of spending and use all but 20% of the
increase for special education. lfthe IDEA provisions either do not apply, or an additional
exemption for supplanting is created than local districts would be able to more significantly
reduce their own spending. The position we take here should be in accordance with our
strategy/response regarding federal increases in IDEA spending in the tobacco/class size
contexts.
