TEXT:
The NC flue-cured association exec. director passes along the following
which Dallas Smith thinks is credible: the offer from the companies to
farmers is headed down from $5 billion to $3.8 billion reflecting RJR's
decision to simply increase its purchase intentions rather than
participate in the lump sum payment; the farmers who want to remain in
farming favor the RJR approach (companies buy less overseas, more
domestic) because it stabilizes their market for the next decade; the
farmers suspect (and they think companies do as well) that Phillip Morris
is hoping to gain market share by cutting purchase intentions, eliminating
the quota program, reducing the cost of tobacco, and underselling their
competition. They also think Phillip Morris is trying to subsidize a bid
by LeBow to buy RJR's cig. business.
