                           DRAFT STATEMENT BY THE PRESIDENT


           I am disappointed in today's Supreme Court's decision which rules part of the Brady Law
    unconstitutional. The Brady Law has kept 250,000 felons, fugitives, and mentally unstable
    persons from purchasing handguns. And I will do everything in my power to make sure that we
    continue to keep handguns out of the hands of criminals.

             Today's ruling should not mean an end to Brady background checks. Twenty-seven
    states -- nine more than when the Brady Law first passed -- now conduct background checks as a
    matter of state law and will continue to do so.

           We expect that the majority oflaw enforcement agencies in the remaining states will
    continue to conduct background checks-- not because they are required by federallaw-- but
    because that is good law enforcement policy. I have directed Attorney General Reno and
    Treasury Secretary Rubin to contact police departments across the country today, to make sure
    they know that Brady background checks can continue to be done on a voluntary basis.

           But we should not stop there. [I have also asked the Attorney General and Secretary
    Rubin to immediately convene a meeting with the nation's law enforcement leaders to review
    and develop recommendations to ensure that background checks will continue to be conducted.]
    Our goal is clear: no background check, no handgun.

            We recently received encouraging news from the Justice Department that last year we
    saw the largest drop in violent crime in more than three and a half decades. Murders dropped a
    stunning 11 percent in 1996. Our strategy of more police, tougher punishments, and fewer guns
    in the hands of criminals is making a difference. But we cannot let up. The safety of our
    communities and of all Americans is better assured when Brady background checks are
    conducted.
