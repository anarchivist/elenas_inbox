I've added three bullets on the top about where we are and made a small change
in the bankruptcy bullet.  I'm sending these on to Commerce (better something
now than perfection later), but if anyone else is going to use these things, we
probably should continue working.  I'll call Jacoby and see if I can find out
what's going on. Ellen

TALKING POINTS ON PRODUCT LIABILITY BILL
The President has stated that he will veto H.R. 956 in its
present form because it unduly and inequitably impinges of the
traditional prerogatives of the states in this area of law and
unfairly tilts the legal playing field against consumers.
The Administration has long stated that it supports enactment of
limited but meaningful products liability reform at the federal
level, but has also stated that any such legislation must fairly
balance the interests of consumers with those of manufacturers
and sellers and must respect the important role of the states.
Following passage of the bill in the Senate, the President stated
that, while the Senate bill was an improvement on the far broader
House bill, there were two major problems that would lead him not
to support it: (i) a cap on punitive damages, which are meant to
punish and deter egregious wrongdoing and (ii) establishment of
several -- rather than joint -- liability for noneconomic damages
such as pain and suffering. The Conference Report on H.R. 956
does not respond to these problems, and in addition, moves
backwards toward the House bill by, for example, effectively
severely shortening the statute of limitations against a company
that goes into bankruptcy or reorganization and shortening the
statute of repose from 20 years to 15.
If H.R. 956 becomes law in its present form:
?       Injured victims of defective products may not receive the
full measure of their damages.
A victim of a defective product who incurs noneconomic
damage -- such as pain and suffering -- will have to sue
every person or business that contributed to the injury.    If
one of the wrongdoers has died or gone bankrupt or otherwise
become unavailable to suit, the victim will not receive the
portion of noneconomic damages for which that wrongdoer is
responsible.  Under. current law, the other wrongdoers pick
up this portion of the damages award; under this bill, the
innocent victim suffers.
Remember that companies that manufacture and sell defective
products stand a much higher than usual chance of going


     bankrupt; consider, for example, manufacturers of asbestos
     or breast implants or intra
     o
     -uterine devices.  For this
     reason, the situation described above is very likely to
     occur in products liability cases.
     ?       The incentive for companies to engage in egregious
     misconduct, such as knowingly manufacturing and selling

     defective products, will dramatically increase.

     o
     The bill's cap on punitive damages invites wealthy potential
     defendants, deciding whether to manufacture or sell a
     defective product, to weigh the costs of wrongdoing against
     the potential gains or profits.  Punitive awards prevent
     sellers and manufacturers from engaging in such coldblooded
     analysis by making deliberate wrongdoers pay more than the
     harm they have caused. Under this bill, there is no such
     deterrence of wrongful conduct.
     The provision of the bill allowing judges to exceed the cap
     in certain circumstances does not cure this problem, given
     the clear intent of Congress that "the occasions for
     additional awards will be very limited."
     ?       Injured victims of defective products may not even be able
     to bring suit.
     A victim of a defective product manufactured by a company
     that has gone bankrupt may not even be able to bring suit
     under this bill.  This is because the bill, unlike the prior
     Senate version, does not stop the statute of limitations
     from running when a bankruptcy court (as often happens)
     issues an order preventing pending lawsuits from going
     forward and new lawsuits from being brought.
     Again, remember that companies that manufacture and sell
     defective products stand a much higher than usual chance of
     going bankrupt.  For this reason, the change in the bill's
     statute of limitations provision matters greatly.
