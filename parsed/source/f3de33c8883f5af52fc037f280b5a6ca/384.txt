TEXT:
Just ran into a furious Laurie Rubiner of Chafee's staff who says
she is hearing from you guys that you are reading the waiver
provisions of section 1931 in a way that would potentially gut
1931(b).  She says there is a meeting Tuesday with her, some
advocates, and Debbie Chang.
Since you guys have said you don't have an interpretation on this
yet and that's why we haven't been briefed, I can't imagine that
you are telling outsiders how you read this provision at this
point. What is she hearing that is alarming her and why are we
having to raise people's blood pressure before we know whether
it's necessary?
Please call me.
