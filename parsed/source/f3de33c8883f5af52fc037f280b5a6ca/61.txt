TEXT:
I don't know who is working on the SAP, but wish to suggest that
in addition to what are our concerns in bill, we also raise some
of the issues that we recognize are good in the bill. We have
been getting calls from the health companies concerned about bio
materials and their comments seemed to make a fair case.  If there
are some issues that we could highlight in a possitive way it
might help later regardless of our final decision on the bill.
