TEXT:
Since the staff of Sec'Rubin's CEO Childcare working group is meeting the
week of Dec 5, we thought CEA could release the CEA Childcare paper that
week. Tenatively, our plan is that Janet Yellen would hold a press
briefing to formally release the paper, and then we'll send it out w/ a
letter from Janet to the CEO's in the Rubin Childcare working group, the
people who attended the WH Childcare Conf, the Board on Children and
Families, the NICD, and others ( any suggestions?). Do you think this
will be a problem? Do you have any other suggestions about timing,
method, etc of release?
Thanks.
Michele
