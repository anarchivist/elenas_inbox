TEXT:
As Bruce mentioned this morning, there is a good idea floating around for
a Presidential event prior to the Service Summit. As you know, we have
wanted to have at least one event prior to the Summit itself to keep the
focus on this issue/event.

I am forwarding you the glossy one-pager that Bruce referred to this
morning, but here are the basics:

We are establishing something called the "National Service Scholars
Program." This would be a $1,000 scholarship for high school juniors or
seniors who have performed outstanding service.   The Federal government
puts up $500, and some local source/community puts up the matching $500.
The Corporation has gotten the Lions/Elks/Kiwanis/Moose groups interested
in putting up the match, and they would presumably attend such an event.
There was also some talk of the President doing a letter to every HS
principal.

This is a nice event for us because it is more focused on young people
doing service, rather than pure volunteer stuff,and therefore nicely ties
in with the Administration's concept of service.

The President already "launched" this idea at some event at Penn State
last year, so I believe the news here is that we are inviting high schools
to submit names if they have the match.

I need to check exactly what the budget picture is.  For 1997, there is a
set budget amount of $3 million. The hope is to go nation-wide within a
year or two, but I don't know if there are budget constraints to that goal.
