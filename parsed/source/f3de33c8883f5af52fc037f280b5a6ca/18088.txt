                     THE HISTORIC KYOTO AGREEMENT:
       A CRITICAL FIRST STEP IN A GLOBAL EFFORT TO ADDRESS GLOBAL
                                  WARMING
                               December 11,1997



    The Kyoto agreement represents an historic and unprecedented step to reduce the
    threat of global warming in an environmentally strong and economically sound
    way. It involves 160 nations, and recognizes the crucial importance of specific
    steps to address climate change. The leadership offered by the President and
    Vice President allowed this agreement to be completed -- and generations from
    now, the agreement will be remembered as establishing the core elements of a
    strong, realistic, and legally binding framework.


·        Target and Timetable: The United States agreed to a binding target of reducing
         greenhouse gas emissions to 7 percent below a baseline based on 1990 levels by
         2008-2012. The agreement, however, included a new accounting system -- so that the 7
         percent reduction is roughly equivalent to the President's initial proposal.

·        Market-Based: The agreement reflects an historic emphasis on market-based
         mechanisms to address an environmental problem. In addition to the Clean
         Development Mechanism, the agreement includes a framework for emissions trading
         among industrialized countries -- producing the most efficient means of reducing
         emissions.

·        Coverage of Agreement: The agreement covers six greenhouse gases, which had been a
         priority of the United States but had not been included in the proposals from other major
         economies. The inclusion of all six gases represents a major U.S. victory in the
         agreement and ensures that the environment will be protected against all greenhouse
         gases.

·        Joint Implementation: The agreement includes a Clean Development Mechanism, that
         will allow the types of joint implementation projects that will benefit U.S. businesses.
         The mechanism gives U.S. companies credit for improving energy efficiency in
         developing countries.

·        Developing Country Participation: Global warming is a global problem requiring a
         global solution. We have therefore adopted a two-step process to this problem. This
         agreement locks in hard commitments by the developed countries, as well as some
         commitments by the developing countries (such as on the Clean Development
         Mechanism). But the President has made very clear that the United States would not
         take on legally binding targets until there is meaningful participation by developing
         countries. We will be working hard over the coming months and years to secure that
