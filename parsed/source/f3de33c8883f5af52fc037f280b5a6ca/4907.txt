TEXT:
This is being set up for Thursday instead of Wednesday since NSC is out of
the country through tomorrow. Also, I wanted to clarify that the Senate
took procedural votes on the Central Americans legislation on the DC
approps bill but did not take an up or down vote on it. WH Leg still
thinks the Central Americans piece will be dealt with in the DC Approps
conference.
