TEXT:
For Elena's review, here is a draft Q&A on Shaw's Fatherhood bill for use
by the VP and Kevin Thurm who are both speaking at the National Fatherhood
Summit on 'Monday (see background below). I'd like to get a ·final version
to them by COB today if possible.


Background
Monday is National Fatherhood Initiative's fatherhood summit here at the
Marriott. VP is the keynote speaker at lunch, Judge Ross is chairing one
of the public policy sector meetings in the afternoon, Kevin Thurm is on
the closing panel, and I believe Secretary Riley is also speaking.
Several Governors (Ridge and Carper) and members of Congress also invited.

VP is going to present a Hammer award to the federal interagency forum on
child and family statistics, which formed in response to the 6/95 Exec.
Memorandum which, among other things, directed agencies to incorporate
fathers into research efforts on family and children issues.  He is also
going to strongly emphasize the Administration'S history and commitment to
fatherhood issues.

Apparently the producers of a Ford, Casey, and Work/Families Institute
documentary coming out next week on fatherhood failed to include the
Administration -- Bill Bradley is doing the voice over-- so VP's office is
upset and is looking to remind people of our record on this. The VP will
probably highlight a few of the agency initiatives implemented in response
to the Exec Memo. (15 agencies have submitted responses to VP memo asking
them to submit accomplishments, contact person, and new ideas in preparatio
n for the PMC meeting discussion on fatherhood that Kevin chaired last
week.)  I've suggested he also highlight the WTW $ going to non-custodial
parents and have passed along info on both the formula and competitive
grants. Tom Rosshirt is working on the speech and I'm supposed to see it
on Sunday. At this point, there are no plans for VP to make any other
announcements.

It's not clear how much play the Republican fatherhood block grant bill
will get.  So far, the bill has been stalled due to concerns among


Republicans, but the summit may generate more momentum and interest.

                                                                       Hex-Dump Conversion
                          Question and Answer on Fathers Count Act
                                        June 12, 1998

    Question:   Does the Administration support HR 3314, the Fathers Count Act of 1998?

    Answer:     We certainly support the general goal of encouraging states and communities to
                help fathers become more involved in their children's lives and share the concerns
                about working families, both mothers and fathers. The Administration has
                always placed a high priority on supporting strong and healthy two parent families
                and the role of fathers. This track record includes: family friendly policies such
                as the Family and Medical Leave Act, expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit
                and the new Child Tax Credit; initiatives to promote father involvement in child
                health immunization and early education; demonstration projects to promote
                responsible fatherhood; and employment programs for non-custodial parents of
                children on welfare so they can help support their children. We remain ready to
                work with Congress on initiatives that will help hard pressed families meet their
                needs, including child care.

                We would be glad to work with Congress on the specific provisions of the Fathers
                Count Act at an appropriate time. Funding for the initiative would need to be
                considered within the context of other priorities and within the context of the
                balanced budget.

                Background
                The bill was introduced by Clay Shaw on March 3 and now has 7 Republican
                co-sponsors. It would authorize $2 billion over five years for block grants to states
                for projects to encourage fathers to become better parents. Funding levels grow
                from $200 M in 2000 to $500 M in 2004. The funds would be distributed by HHS
                to states based on their share of total population, and would be targeted to private
                organizations (75 percent) and to fathers below the state or local average income
                of male earners (80 percent). The bill specifically declares religious
                organizations eligible to receive funds under the act.

                Funds could be used to: 1) encourage unmarried or prospective fathers to get
                married, and encourage better parenting both by fathers who are living with their
                children and those who are ,not and 2) help fathers obtain gainful employment or
                increase their skills in order to qualify for higher paying jobs .. The bill also
                specifies that a state who receives a Fathers grant may use Welfare-to-Work and
                Title XX (Social Services Block Grant) funds for the same purpose. Up to $10
                million annually is earmarked for research and evaluation, with another $10
                million annually earmarked for technical assistance.

                While the bill has not moved to date, it is possible that the National Fatherhood
                summit on June 15th may generate new momentum.
