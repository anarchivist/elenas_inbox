TEXT:
Barry said he's scheduled the Department of Education's "director's
review" in a couple of weeks and it would very helpful to know more of
what we want to spend new money on by then.

He said this to me at a meeting he hosted on the Department of Labor's
budget request. He will be hosting one of these before each of the
director's review meetings, to give White House policy staff the
opportunity to weigh in on the Department's proposed new spending
initiatives.
