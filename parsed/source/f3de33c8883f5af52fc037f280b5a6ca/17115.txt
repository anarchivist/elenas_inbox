FROM:      OMB LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS

DATE:      SEPTEMBER 25, 1997

SUBJECT:           LEGISLATIVE REPORT


The House vote on census sampling was postponed until Tuesday, September
30th.

Today the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee marked up
and approved the transit title of the SenateD,s ISTEA reauthorization
(17-1) .  Senators D'Amato and Sarbanes co-sponsored a substitute
amendment. The Senate bill retains current program structure and provides
$35.7 billion over six years.  In addition, the bill adopts the
Administration's proposed language on expanding the definition of capital
to include preventive maintenance and consolidating the 16 metropolitan
planning factors into 7.

Senate Commerce will mark up the highway safety titles next week.   The
House and Senate are heading towards a collision in conference, with the
House planning to bring a simple 6-month extension to the Floor, and the
Senate moving ahead with its 6-year reauthorization.   Majority Leader
Lott said on the Floor again today that the Senate will do a 6-year bill
within the budget.

Representative Kasich and Senator Brownback have announced a renewed
effort to eliminate the Commerce Department; they will likely pursue this
again during consideration of the FY 1999 budget resolution.

House Commerce Committee today marked up two of the three FDA reform
bills, but delayed until Friday markup on the medical device bill in order
to give negotiators more time to work out a compromise.

The House Rules Committee will consider a rule on the first FY 1998
Continuing Resolution on Friday morning, September 26th.
