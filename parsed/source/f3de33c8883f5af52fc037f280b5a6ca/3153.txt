      DRUG-FREE COMMUNITIES ACT OF 1997 & TOBACCO SETTLEMENT REVIEW
                            THE WHITE HOUSE
                               JUNE 27, 1997

     sponsors: Reps. Rob Portman, Sander Levin, Charles Rangel and Dennis Hastert; other Members

            {Possible insert if Brady Bill Struck Down]

             1 am here today to sign an important bill that builds on our efforts to protect our young
     people from the dangers of drugs. But, before 1 begin, I want to comment on today's Supreme
     Court ruling on the Brady Bill.

             The Brady Law has kept 250,000 felons, fugitives, and mentally unstable persons from
     purchasing handguns. And I will do everything in my power to make sure that we continue
     to keep handguns out of the hands of criminals.

            Background checks continue to make good sense. They continue to save lives. And
     today's ruling need not -- and must not - mean an end to criminal background checks.
     Twenty-seven states - nine more than when the Brady Law first passed - now conduct
     criminal background checks as a matter of state law and will continue to do so.

             The Brady Law was drafted by America's law enforcement community. It was passed
     due to the efforts of thousands of local police and prosecutors across America. And I am
     confident that these state and local law enforcement officials will continue to conduct
     background checks. I have directed Attorney General Reno and Treasury Secretary Rubin to
     contact police departments across the country today, to make sure they know that Brady
     background checks can and should continue to be done by local police on a voluntary basis.

             But we will not stop there. I have also asked the Attorney General and Secretary Rubin
     to immediately convene a meeting with the nation's law enforcement leaders to review and
     develop recommendations to ensure that background checks will continue to be conducted.
     Our goal is clear: no criminal background check, no handgun, anywhere in America. No
     state should become a safe haven for criminals that want to buy handguns.

            We know that tremendous progress is being made, all across the country, in thefight
     against crime. Last year saw the largest drop in violent crime in more than three and a half
     decades, with murders dropping a stunning 11% in 1996. Our strategy of more police,
     tougher punishment, and fewer guns in the hands of criminals is making a difference. We
     cannot let up. For the continued safety of our communities and of all Americans, Brady

                                                                         Automated Records Management System
                                                                         Hex-Dump Conversion


       I am delighted that we are joined today by many Americans who have committed
themselves at the national, state, and community levels to reducing illicit drug use and its
destructive consequences. The bill I am about to sign is a tribute to the bipartisan efforts
of Congress, which set aside partisan politics to do the right thing for our children and
our nation. I want to commend Rob Portman, Charlie Rangel and all others involved for
recognizing that drug abuse is not a Democratic problem or a Republican problem -- it is
an American problem that can only be solved if we all pull together.

        The "Drug-Free Communities Act of 1997" which was overwhelmingly passed
by both the Senate and the House takes into account some very important truths:
First, a decade of progress in the effort to reduce the demand for illegal drugs is
threatened by resurgent drug use by our children. Overall drug use is down. But,
while casual drug use has plummeted over the past fifteen years, it has doubled among
young people in the past five years, and tripled among eighth-graders. This is a real
threat to America's future. We must take decisive action now to protect both our
children and our nation from the ravages of drug abuse.

       The middle schooler or high schooler who mistakenly decides to try cocaine,
heroin, marijuana, LSD, methamphetamine or any of the so-called designer drugs is
playing a very dangerous game. Too many of those who start using drugs when they are
young will face a lifelong struggle with addiction. A study by Columbia's Center for
Addiction and Substance Abuse has shown, a young person who uses marijuana is 85
times more likely to use cocaine than his peers who don't use marijuana.

         The second truth embodied in this legislation is that broadly-based community
  anti-drug coalitions have been instrumental in driving down casual drug use and
  drug-related violence over the past decade. As I have said before, the era of big
  government may be over, but the era of big challenges is not. Saving our young people
  from drug addiction is a big challenge that must be met, not by top-down government
. intervention, but family by family, neighborhood by neighborhood, community by
  community. Government has a role to play, but our success ultimately hinges on
  grassroots action at the 10calleveI.

       The Drug-Free Communities Act of 1997 reflects that reality. More than 4,300
communities in all fifty states and U.S. territories have recognized the seriousness of the
drug threat and organized accordingly. Parents who seek to educate their children
about the dangers of drugs and teachers, coaches and principals who are fighting to
establish safe and drug-free schools and communities -- all rely on these coalitions to
put their ideas into action. That is how we will achieve our goal of dramatically
reducing the demand for drugs. I am proud that our drug control strategy makes the


                                              2



    federal government a partner with local communities in this mission. One of the best
    ways we can help is by educating our young people about the dangers of drugs and
    urging them to reject illegal drugs as well as alcohol and tobacco. That is why my
    balanced budget contains $175 million for an unprecedented paid advertising campaign
    that, for the first time, targets anti-drug messages to our young people during prime
    time.                              .

            We can reduce the demand for drugs. The Drug-Free Communities Act of 1997
    will help more communities form coalitions dedicated to that goal.

           Before I sign this bill, I want to say a word about another substance abuse
    problem that threatens our young people -- the problem of teen smoking. Each day,
    3,000 young people become regular smokers and 1,000 of them will have their lives cut
    short as a result. Last week, the tobacco industry and advocates for children's health
    reached a settlement that seeks to advance our struggle to protect the health of children
    against the dangers of tobacco.

            Now, we must take a close look at this settlement to make sure we are doing our
    best to protect the public health -- particularly our children's health -- to the greatest
    extent possible. Over the next month, we will undertake a thorough public health
    review. I have asked Bruce Reed, my Domestic Policy Advisor and Donna Shalala,
    Secretary of Health and Human Services to engage in extensive consultations with the
    public health community and others to subject this agreement to the strictest scrutiny.
    This settlement is an extraordinary opportunity to begin a national debate on how to
    build on our efforts to reduce smoking -- especially by children. That is what this
    review is all about.
