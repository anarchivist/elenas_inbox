TEXT:
We need to consult among ourselves and with the Dellinger and
Schiffer shops at DOJ re what we might/should say in a signing
statement on the technical corrections bill for the omnibus
approps law, re the Tongass issue.
The current plan by the appropriators is to have the bill clear
tha House and Senate today, although there is a still a Democratic
hold on the bill in the Senate.
Let me know what the thinking is. Calling me or leaving voice
mail at 61988 would be fine.
