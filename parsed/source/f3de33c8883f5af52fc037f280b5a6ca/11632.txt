TEXT:
Iowa AG Tom Miller is calling to check on status of his idea to
determine/negotiate the Medicaid share of the tobacco settlement. You guys
were going to get DOJ to review this.  Tom has pushed the idea with other
AGs so when they come here on the 23- 25th of march it will come up.

Did you get a DOJ response?    Thanks.

Speaking of the AGs, we will host a WH briefing on the afternoon of the
25th.  I would REALLY like Bruce or Elena to do a piece on tobacco. The VP
times are unsettled but the window is 2 to 4.
