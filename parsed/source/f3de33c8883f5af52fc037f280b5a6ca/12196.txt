         Hello

         NSC has drafted a 3 page memo to the President on the bioterrorism
         provisions in the crime bill. Our comments (which have not been sent to
         NSC yet) are primarily on the portion of the memo that describes the HHS
         position. They are attached -- Chris wanted you to have them before you,
         Jose, Chris, and Bruce discuss what DPC's position will be.

         Please let me know if you have any questions.

         Devorah

             DPC COMMENTS ON.NSC BACKGROUNDER ON BIOTERRORISM

    1.   Page 2, fourth full paragraph, first sentence.

         Please modify the first part of this sentence to read, "This provision attempts to
         capture ... "

    2.   Page 2, last paragraph, last sentence.

         Please delete this sentence. HHS never proposed and would never agree to send this
         legislation to the Congress as it is and attach a statement that we will review it with the
         scientific community and advise the Congress if changes are necessary.

    3.   Page 3, HHS Option

         Please delete this section and insert the following:

         HHS Option. Although HHS supports the establishment of criminal sanctions on
         unauthorized possession of select agents, it believes that the proposal to criminalize the
         reckless use and handling of select agents potentially threatens legitimate science. The
         DOJ proposal takes an overly broad approach and criminalizes the reckless handling of
         dangerous substances in a manner that captures unintended oversights and accidents, as
         well as the intentionally harmful behavior the provision is meant to target. HHS strongly
         believes that such an approach would needlessly alienate the very scientific community
         that has provided valuable validation for our past activities on bioterrorism.

          HHS also believes that the requirement for background checks for individuals handling or
          possessing dangerous biological agents does not ensure that the investigation focuses on
         .reasonable indicators of irresponsible behavior or terrorist proclivities. For example, the
          provision covers misdemeanor convictions, which could include domestic violence;
          addiction to controlled substances, which could include prescription medications; or
          hospitalization for mental conditions, which could include temporary depressions.
          Although the Justice provision allows for exceptions, HHS believes that in practice,
          employers would not be willing to accept the risk of waiving the requirement for certain
          employees, thus essentially excluding qualified scientists with minor offenses from the
          profession.

         HHS would instead set a Presidential deadline of 60 days for consultation with the
         scientific community to draft a proposal to this issue. It would include: measures to
         address the training of scientists; safe procedures for handling, storage and security of
         biocontaminants; civil fines and penalties; and the question of what personal
         characteristics or events in an individual's history could legitimately support exclusion
         from research on select agents. HHS believes that investing the community in the
         subsequent drafting process would invest this extremely important constituency in our
         policy. In addition, this provision would codify HHS' commitment to establishing
                         Hex-Dump Conversion

     measures to address the conscious, gross deviations from accepted scientific norms that
     the DO] proposal attempts to target without chilling the scientific research needed to
     develop the drugs, vaccines, and medical knowledge necessa'ry to arm the nation against
     bioterrorism.

     OSTP has researched this extensively and has been unable to find an example of a similar
     law governing the use of other sensitive materials. Please check with Jerry Epstein at
