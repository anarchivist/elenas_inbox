TEXT:
America's Promise (Gen. Powell's organization) has invited me to a meeting
in New York on Wednesday to discuss their next steps on child health
outreach. You may recall that the President and Powell have talked about
working together on this issue.  The meeting includes Ray Chambers, the
Academy of Pediatrics, Robert Wood Johnson, and Rob Reiner, on behalf of
his "I Am Your Child" campaign.  I am assuming I should go, and am
consulting with Jeanne to make sure I am up to speed on Medicaid/CHIP
outreach.
