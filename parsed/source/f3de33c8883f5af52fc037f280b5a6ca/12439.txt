TEXT:
I just saw a copy of the latest langauge on social promotions that was
distributed at yesterday's ED strategy meeting.  The section on page three
that describes assessments reads:

(D)  Any assessment used by a State, local educational agency or school
for purposes of implementing policy required by the subsection shall:

(v) provide reasonble adaptations and accomodations for students with
diverse learning needs.


Bethany said that this section was not specifically discussed during
yesterday's meeting.  We wanted to highlight it because you had raised
concerns during an earlier meeting about the meaning of "diverse learning
needs".  I'm concerned about how using that phrase would broaden
requirements for accomodations during assessments.  If it can still be
changed, I would recommend using "students with learning disabilities."
