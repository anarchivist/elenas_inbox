MEDICARE COMMISSION

Q:   Why haven't you appointed a chair for your Medicare Commission? What's the
     hold up?

A:   First, let me say I am very pleased with my appointments to the Commission. I believe
     they will serve the Commission and the nation well. The Chair is required by law to be
     mutually agreed to by the Republican leadership and myself. We have yet to reach a
     consensus on a candidate that is acceptable for all of us. However, I am confident that
     we will be able to come to closure on this in short order.

Q:   Have you given up on Senator Breaux? Are there other candidates that you would
     fmd acceptable?

A:   I believe Senator Breaux would be a great addition to the Commission and a very good
     Chainnan. For this reason, I would support him in that capacity. I have not given up on
     him as a possibility for the Chair.

Q:   Are you ruling out anyone other than Senator Breaux?

A:   No. But I am not going to get involved in any public discussion about this appointment.
     We plan to get closure on this issue very soon and it would not be constructive to
     speculate on this matter at this time.

Q:   Do you think the Medicare Commission is dead on arrival?

A:   Of course not. Conventional wisdom in Washington is often wrong. In 1996, few
                                                                   people thought that
                                                                   Republicans and
                                                                   Democrats could ever

Q:   Do you think the Chairman or the Commission should uphold the Speaker's no tax
     pledge in its upcoming deliberations?

A:   As I have mentioned before, I do not know if taxes will be necessary to address the
     challenges the program faces. However, I do not believe that any preconditions should
     be placed on the members of this Commission. I do think we should wait before we start
     to speculate on what they might be recommending to address the challenges Medicare
     faces.


MEDICARE POLICY


Q:   Will you be supporting proposals to extend health care coverage to older Americans
     who are not yet eligible for Medicare?

A:   I have always been extremely concerned about this vulnerable population, and the
     difficulties that many of these Americans face. These older Americans are one of the
     most difficult to insure populations: they tend to be less healthy and are more likely to
     have problems accessing affordable health care.

     I have asked for infonnation to better understand the challenges this population faces and
     options to assist them to obtain more affordable health care coverage. However, it is early
     in my review process and no decisions have been made at this time.

Q:   What is your response to reports that Medicare is overpaying for prescription drugs
     by $447 million?

A:   I am well aware of concerns about Medicare's overpayments for prescription drugs. For
     this reason, I included a proposal in last year's budget to ensure that the program pays no·
     more than the actual costs for these drugs. This proposal is consistent with the IG's
     report and recommendations that have been reported on in recent days.

     I fully intend to include this proposal in my upcoming FY 1999 budget. If Congress
     passes this provision, the Department estimates that it will save millions of dollars.

Q:   Oncologists claim if this proposal were enacted, they would be forced to stop seeing
     Medicare beneficiaries because their payment rates are so low. Aren't you
     concerned about access limitations?

A:   Medicare, and the taxpayers who support it, should not be forced to pay excessively high
     prices for drugs. If oncologists believe that Medicare is not compensating them
     adequately, they should provide infonnation that we have requested to document their
     case. If they can illustrate there is a problem, we should consider modifying our
     reimbursement to physicians for their services, but not the payment rates they receive for
                                  Automated Records Management System
                                          Hex-DiJmp Conversion
    the drugs they administer. Medicare should not, however, pay more for what the
    physicians pay for these medications. That is not fair to the beneficiaries, the program,
    and the taxpayers.
