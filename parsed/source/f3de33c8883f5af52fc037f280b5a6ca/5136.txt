TEXT:
As I mentioned in the meeting this morning, McCaffrey has told Stephen
Silverman that he would prefer to do the Drug Policy meeting in December,
instead of November 12.

Stacie, Stephen and I talked after the meeting, though, and learned that
McCaffrey was not aware of the interest in doing this meeting before
Zedillo. Stephen is going to go back to McCaffrey to see if it is
possible to do the meeting in November and Communications is calling a
message meeting for tomorrow afternoon to resolve this matter.
