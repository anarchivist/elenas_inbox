MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT


From:          Sandy Thurman

Date:          July 21, 1997

Subject:       Update on HIV/AIDS Issues for Your Meeting Tomorrow with GaylLesbian
               Leaders



This memorandum is to provide you with a quick update on current HIV/AIDS issues for your
meeting tomorrow with gay and lesbian activists.

Background - While the AIDS groups are grateful for the support the Administration has given
them in the past, there is considerable anxiety and doubt regarding our ongoing commitment to
this issue. This concern began when AIDS programs ( including the Ryan White CARE Act)
were not included on a small list of discretionary programs that were listed as protected programs
in the balanced budget agreement (neither were many other important programs). The community
interprets this action to mean that the issue has been "de-prioritized." In addition, following the
release of guidelines for AIDS treatment which advocated more aggressive use of triple drug
combinations, the Administration did not request any additional dollars in the 1998 budget for
AIDS Drug Assistance Programs (ADAP). (However, it should be noted that we have
continually supported increases in ADAP, including 2 budget amendments last year and have
always indicated our willingness to consider additional requests for this program.) All this,
combined with delays in receiving the report the Vice President requested on Medicaid
expansion to people with HIV (due to indications from HCFA that there is no way to make this
budget neutral), and that little visible progress has been made on removing the restrictions on
federal funding for needle exchange programs, has made the AIDS community a little irritated
with us.

We have been working nonstop with the AIDS groups on these issues. The bottom line is, while
we have pending issues, it has been a pretty extraordinary year so far for the AIDS community.

Decrease in the AIDS Death Rate -On July 14, the CDC released new figures showing a 19%
decrease in the number of AIDS deaths in the first nine months of 1996, compared with the same
period of 1995. In contrast with earlier data, the number of deaths due to AIDS among women
decreased 7%, and mortality numbers dropped for all racial groups and categories ofHIV
transmission. The CDC attributed these findings to greater access to medical care and the
development of effective therapies for HIV and associated opportunistic infections. AIDS
advocates noted that as AIDS death rates drop, there are increasing numbers of individuals
                                                                            Hex-Dump Conversion

living with HIV who require access to these lifesaving interventions. Clearly, our investment in
the AIDS epidemic is beginning to payoff as a significant achievement, given increasing AIDS
deaths and infections worldwide. It is important to note, however, that there is no evidence
that the number of new HIV infections is slowing indicating that prevention and education
efforts must be reinforced.

Funding Issues - In the House Appropriations subcommittee mark-up, the full $40 million
increase in the Administration's FY 1998 budget request for the Ryan White CARE Act
programs was provided, with some reallocation of the increases among Ryan White programs.
In addition, the mark up included a $132 million increase for ADAP in the Chairman's mark.
No formal budget amendment was sent forward by the Administration for this, given the size of
the offset. You may want to take this opportunity to formally support this increase. OMB asserts
that this increase is going to happen anyway, so we might as well take credit for it. The
community will obviously appreciate your support.

The House subcommittee increased funds for AIDS prevention by $5 million ($12 million below
budget request) and AIDS research by $73 million ($33 million above budget request). The
Senate LaborlHHS subcommittee's 602B allocation is $200 million below the House's, making
it less likely that the Senate will fund AIDS programs at the House levels. In V AlHUD, the
Housing Opportunities for People With AIDS (HOPWA) program has been funded at the budget
request of $204 million (an $8 million increase).

Model Clinical Practice Guidelines for Treatment of DIV ID.fection - On June 19, an
independent panel of experts convened by HHS and the Kaiser Family Foundation published
treatment guidelines for antiretroviral therapy in adults and adolescents. The draft guidelines
address a critical need among providers as to how to best to use new AIDS drugs most
effectively. The guidelines recommend a more aggressive approach to treatment using triple
drug combinations at earlier stages ofHIV infection to avert immune system damage.

While the draft of these guidelines is not technically a government document, issues of payment
for this new standard of care clearly confront us,. HHS has stressed that the respon.sibility for
HIV treatment is shared one by the federal government, states, private and non-profit sectors and
individuals each playing an important role. The additional $132 million in ADAP funding
included in the House Appropriation's subcommittee is a good start towards trying to address
expanding demand for these new therapies.

Medicaid Expansion for DIY Infection - On April 9, the Vice President requested that HHS
report to him on the feasibility of a Medicaid demonstration project expanding Medicaid
eligibility to people with HIV infection prior to the onset of full-blown AIDS. Currently, over
50% of people with AIDS depend on Medicaid for their health care. New AIDS therapies like
the protease inhibitor drugs have been effective in delaying disability and reducing hospital costs
for many people. This has raised speculation about whether the question if earlier access to drug
therapies and primary care would prove cost-effective for Medicaid as well as other public
spending for services to people with HIV/AIDS.
                                                                         Hex-Dump Conversion


HHS briefed the Vice President's office in late May/early June and is now working to address
budget concerns. HHS will likely submit a report to the Vice President in the next few weeks.
The report will likely say that it would be feasible to do a demonstration program limited to
several sites but with capped enrollment. This demonstration, however, would not be budget
neutral, and thus would represent a break in our longstanding budget neutrality criteria in
Medicaid waivers. There are some at HHS and OMB who believe that it would be preferable
for the Administration to support full legislation to change the Medicaid program to cover this
population earlier rather than break our budget neutrality standard. However, this proposal
would be quite expensive.

Needle Exchange Programs - The House Appropriations subcommittee for Labor, Health and
Human Services marked up their bill on July 15, preserving the authority of the Secretary of HHS
to lift the restrictions on use of federal funds for needle exchange programs. HHS does not
expect a challenge to this at full committee next week, it is pursuing a strategy of watchful
waiting, maintaining a low profile for as long as possible. Most of the AIDS groups accept this
strategy as long as the Secretary's authority is not endangered. We held a meeting at the White
House last week with the AIDS groups and HHS to facilitate communication on this issue.
