TEXT:
As we discussed:

 (1) Talked to HUD (CoS and Andrew) and they understand.  They will hold
the grants until we determine whether we are indeed going to move this to
12/23. They have also asked whether the 12/26 radio address is an option.

(2) DOT is checking the status on the drunk driving issue for the radio
address.  The CoS there is not certain about the grants but we should hear
back shortly.
