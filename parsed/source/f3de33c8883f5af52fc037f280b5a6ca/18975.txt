I.     PURPOSE

       To highlight an Administration initiative aimed at increasing employment for people with
       disabilities.


II.    BACKGROUND

       People with disabilities are at least twice as likely as people without disabilities to be
       unemployed, and their low employment rate is estimated to cost society in excess of
       $200 billion annually. During the last year, an interagency group working to
       address this problem has drafted an Executive Order that establishes a task force of
       federal agencies that will make recommendations aimed at removing workplace
       barriers for people with disabilities in areas such as employment discrimination,
       health care, housing, education, telecommunications, child care, and rehabilitation
       and training.

       The task force established by the Executive Order will be chaired by Labor
       Secretary Herman and co-chaired by Tony Coelho, Chair of the President's
       Committee on Employment of People with Disabilities. (Coelho is traveling on
       business and is unable to attend.) Secretaries of relevant federal agencies are
       members. The task force will issue its first report later this year with
       recommendations to bring the employment rate of people with disabilities as close as
       possible to the rate of the general population.

        The disability community is very cognizant of your longstanding commitment to
      . their priorities. However, they believe that their issues have been absent from our
        budget initiatives. They are looking (1) to extend health care and tax credits to
        those on the disability rolls seeking to return to work and (2) shifting Medicaid from
      is considering legislation on both these issues, but we have so far withheld our
      support because of cost concerns. This task force should help address some of the
      concerns of the community.

                                 TALKING POINTS
                    DISABILITY EMPLOYMENT EXECUTIVE ORDER
                                  March 13, 1998


o     I am pleased to welcome you to the Oval Office this morning to celebrate an historic
      moment in the movement to bring people with disabilities into the mainstream of our
      country's economy. I am particularly pleased to welcome the members of Congress
      who are here, members of my Administration, as well as my very good friend, Justin
      Dart.

o     Today, our economy is strong. Since 1993, we have created 15 million new jobs. But
      as I have said before, this is not a time to rest, but a time to build, to build the America
      within our reach.

o     That is why I'm so pleased today to sign an executive order aimed at building --
      building employment opportunities for people with disabilities and addressing the
      unacceptably high unemployment rates among people with disabilities.

o     Many of you have spoken to me about the critical need for this initiative. When I met
      with leaders from the disability community last year, I remember my friend Tony Coelho
      saying that people with disabilities are the only group of Americans who are actually
      seeking to pay taxes, because pay taxes means they are working and contributing
      members of society.

o     This Executive Order will focus my Cabinet, led by Secretary Herman, on removing
      workplace barriers for people with disabilities and designing a strategy to make equality
      of opportunity, full participation, inclusion, and economic self-sufficiency realities for all
      30 million working-age Americans with disabilities.

o     This task force will focus on the most important policy issues affecting the employment
      of people with disabilities since the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act
      (ADA), including education, vocational rehabilitation, training, health care, increased
      work incentives for those on the disability rolls, discrimination, telecommunications,
      assistive technology, personal assistance services, and transportation.

o     This is not to say that people with disabilities haven't made progress since the passage of
      the ADA. They certainly have made progress. Look at the 800,000 people with severe
      disabilities who got jobs in the first three years after the ADA's employment provisions
      took effect. All over this country, people with disabilities and their families have refused
           to accept the outmoded policies, programs, and attitudes that for centuries have kept
           citizens with disabilities and their caregivers on the sidelines of our economy and society.

       o   I also want to emphasize that, as this task force takes some months to develop its
           recommendations, that doesn't mean we are standing still on immediate action to address
           these problems. Just this week, the Department of Health and Human Services issued
           guidance to states on how to implement a new Administration health care initiative that
           we got included in last year's Balanced Budget Act. This new state option will allow
           individuals with disabilities who return to work to buy into the Medicaid program even if
           their earnings exceed current thresholds. And federal agencies are working with
           committees in the House and the Senate as they develop new legislation on this issue.

       o   One slip, one accident, one stroke, one anomaly of birth, or one stray bullet, and anyone
           of us may be confronted with a disability. This I know from personal experience.

       o   Since I first ran for President, I have been committed to a government that puts people
           first and that promotes inclusion, empowerment and independence for all Americans,
           including Americans with disabilities. By signing this Executive Order, I direct
           Secretary Herman, members of the task force, and the rest of my cabinet, and the entire
           executive branch to work together to build on the progress of the last six years and
           promote policies and programs that enable people with disabilities and their families to
           share more fully in the American dream.

       o   I am excited that Secretary Herman has embraced this challenging assignment, assisted by
           Vice-Chair by Tony Coelho. I am confident that all of the agency heads who are here
           with us today, as well as those who could not be here, will give this assignment the
           serious work and commitment that it merits.

       o   I look forward to receiving the task force's reports and to working with the Congress on
           these critical issues. Thank you.
