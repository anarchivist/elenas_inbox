     TEXT:
     Looking ahead to Wednesday's meeting with the intergovernmental
     groups, here is a rough cut at the agenda and the status of the
     various items that I know of.   Please review (particularly Diana
     and Emily) and see what needs to be added. Note also the loops
     that need to be closed by Wednesday.

     I.      10/23 Q and A -- The answers to these questions still need
     final clearance from OMB.  I will talk to Keith Fontenot and we
     will get out as many of the answers as possible.

     II.     Cost Neutrality and Waivers    Since we have an answer on
     this question now, we should spend some time on this on the
     agenda. EMILY will be talking to Monahan, Yvette Jackson and OMB
     about what paper we can share and how to present the answer.

     III.    Means Tested Benefits -- It is possible the decision may be
     made on this one as well.   ELENA -- I have a call into you to
     discuss how we should be presenting this decision: what paper can
     be shared?

     IV.     Food Stamp 18-50 Guidance -- Should be cleared by
     Wednesday. USDA should be able to hand out and discuss.   I am
     working with OMB to get that done.

     Other items from last time:
     -- John Monahan and Elaine Ryan agreed to meet to discuss TANF
     administration issues.
     -- Bruce agreed to meet with the groups on welfare-to-work
     proposal.
     -- NGA was having several meetings on employment issues.
     -- There were also supposed to be further meetings with HHS on
     regs.
     We agreed to have reports on each of these at 12/4 meeting.


Emily: can you find out from John if the regs and TANF meetings
took place? Bruce: did you meet with them?
We'll add reports from those meetings to the agenda if they took
place!
Look OK??
