TEXT:
EK/BR:

Dennis and some of the DOJ folks are coming over to meet w/Leg. Affairs on
what's happening with the McDade Amendment (applying state ethics
requirements to federal prosecutors). As you know, DOJ remains pretty
exercised about this, and it is sure to play into the crime
bill/appropriations deliberations.  I plan on going, but thought, EK, you
may be interested.  Also, what was the final resolution on this w/Podesta
during last year's budget negotiations ... I forget what, if any,
commitments were made to the AG, members, etc.

We can catch up on this tomorrow.

Jose'
