I think we can definitely accomodate them and we should talk about who are
the right people to brief, Elena will have ideas on health perhaps and
other issues.

we've been asked to hold a meeting here with them when they are here for
national meeting on immigration issues.  Backlog, health needs, are on
their agenda. We were going to ask Doris Meissner to come over--I don't
know what the immigration group has been doing, but this mayan
opportunity to share knowledge and defuse concerns.  It will not be all of
the counties--Santa Clara, Alameda, Imperial, Sacramento, San Bernadino,
Los Angeles, and the Urban Counties Caucus.
