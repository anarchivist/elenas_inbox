    Senate Democrats are getting to close to .working out a deal with Senate
    Republicans on the contours of an Amtrak reform bill to be included in
    reconciliation. The current proposal on the table from the Senate
    Republicans to Senate Democrats is as follows (I have only summarized the
    larger issues):

    LIABILITY:  (This dispute has killed reform the last few years and has
    pitted trial lawyer groups against freight railroads).   Amtrak would be
    subjected to state law caps for tort liability (these vary state to
    state). There would also be a global cap of $150 million per incident.
    This global cap would apply to both freight railroads and Amtrak.
    Democratic staff seems to think that the final deal may have a global cap
    at a higher number (maybe $250 million per incident).



 LABOR:   (Current law provides up to six years of pay to employees who
 lose jobs in downsizing of Amtrak) .  The six year protection currently
 provided by statute, would be reduced to one year.  If there were a
 bankruptcy the one year protection would be eliminated.  (Rail labor is
 now meeting with Senator Kerry to discuss their objections.)

 CONTRACTING OUT: The current ban prevents Amtrak from contracting out any
 work other than food and beverage.  The ban would be repealed one year
 after enactment of the legislation. The subject would still be subject to
 negotiations under the Railway Labor Act.

 LIQUIDATION: The proposal would have an expedited liquidation procedure
 (that is, Amtrak would be liquidated if certain performance targets and
 reforms were not satisfied). This procedure would require a vote of the
 House and Senate to approve liquidation, but no Presidential approval.
 The liquidation would be recommended to the Congress by a temporary Amtrak
 Reform Council.


 We have tried to talk to many of you on the e-mail list here about the
 problem of Justice's concerns about constitutionality of the reform
 proposal. Although the Administration is on record about the labor and
 liability issues through letters sent to Sen. Commerce Committee last
 month, a DOJ letter objecting to the Senate reform proposal was prepared
 prior to Commerce committee mark up last month, but was not sent. DOJ has
 very serious concerns about the make up of a Reform Councilor a revamped
 Board of Directors and may seek to bring their objections to the attention
 of the negotiators. Jim Jukes/LRD will be following up on this after
 consulting with all of you for your thoughts on this subject.

 5-1090 if you have any questions.
