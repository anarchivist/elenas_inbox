TEXT:
He said they'd be happy to get any and all bill clean-up comments -- late
in the week would work.  They are trying to complete language by the end
of next week.  He lamented how they're getting "killed" by the industry.

He said Hollings and McCain are doing a S.C. tobacco event on Friday.
Jacoby and I told him the President will be in Kentucky on Thursday --
Ivan said we should invite McCain and that we need to work to keep McCain
bought in.  I did not tell Ivan, but now wonder if I should have, that
Ford will be part of our Thursday event.
