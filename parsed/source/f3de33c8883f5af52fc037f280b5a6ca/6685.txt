       PRESIDENT CLINTON JOINS DEMOCRATS TO UNVEIL LEGISLATION GIVING
      AMERICANS AGES 55 TO 65 NEW HEALTH INSURANCE OPTIONS AND RELEASES
        ST ATE-BY -STATE STUDY WHICH UNDERSCORES NEED FOR THIS POLICY
                                  March 17, 1998

    Today, President Clinton joined Democrats on the Hill to unveil legislation that would provide
    Americans ages 55 to 65 health insurance options and urged Congress to send it to him for enactment.
    This targeted, paid-for proposal will give an estimated 300,000 to 400,000 vulnerable Americans new
    choices for more affordable health care coverage. The President also released a state-by-state analysis
    that documents the need for this policy.

    RELEASED NEW STATE-BY-STATE STUDY THAT DEMONSTRATES THE DIFFICULTY
    AMERICANS AGES 55 TO 65 HAVE ACCESSING HEALTH INSURANCE. The report the
    President released today underscores the difficulty Americans ages 55 to 65 have accessing health
    insurance. The new report, prepared by the Domestic Policy Council and the National Economic
    Council, found that:

           Five million -- or twenty-two percent of Americans ages 55 to 65 -- are either uninsured or
           insured through the individual insurance market. In some states, such as North Dakota,
           Texas and Nebraska, the percentage of these individuals is as high as 30 percent.

                  Three million are uninsured. Some Americans ages 55 to 65 lose their
                  employer-based health insurance when their spouse (frequently the husband) becomes
                  eligible for Medicare. Many lose their coverage because they lose their jobs due to
                  company downsizing or plant closings. Still others lose insurance when their retiree
                  health coverage is dropped unexpectedly.

                  Many are left to buy into an unaffordable individual insurance market, where
                  premiums can be as high as $1,000 per month. Individual insurance can be
                  prohibitively expensive, particularly for those who have pre-existing conditions.

           In 38 states, individual insurance policies can be denied outright. Sixteen million
           Americans ages 55 to 65 -- 76 percent of this population --live in one of the 38 states where
           individual insurance can be outright denied. This often leaves these individuals no where else
           to tum for health care coverage.

           In twenty-one states there are no protections to assure pre-existing conditions are
           covered. In these states, where 8 million, or 36 percent, of 55 to 65 year olds live, there are no
           protections against pre-existing condition exclusions in the individual market. This means that
           individuals may not be able to get coverage for the care they need most, such as diabetes
           management or cancer treatment.

           There are no protections against exorbitant premiums in forty states. In these states, where
           16 million Americans ages 55 to 65 live, individuals have no protections against exorbitant
           premiums based on age or health status ..
                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion


UNVEILED LEGISLATION THAT ALLOWS AMERICANS NEW CHOICES TO ACCESS
HEALTH CARE COVERAGE. The legislation unveiled on the Hill today provides new health
insurance options for Americans ages to 55 to 65. This legislation is being introduced by a numerous
Democrats, including both Democratic leaders [Senator Daschle and Congressman Gephardt] as well
as all the ranking Democrats on the Committees of Jurisdiction: Senators Moynihan and Rockefeller
and Representatives Rangel, Stark, Dingell, and Brown. It:

       Enables Americans ages 62 to 65 to buy into Medicare, by paying a premium.

       Provides displaced workers over 55 access to Medicare by offering those who have
       involuntarily lost their jobs and their health care coverage a similar Medicare buy-in option.
       Such workers have a harder time finding new jobs: only 52 percent are reemployed compared to
       over 70 percent of younger workers.

       Allows retirees ages 55 and older whose employers dropped their health coverage access
       to former employers' health plan. This allows retirees whose employers dropped their
       health coverage after they have retired buy into the employer's health plan through "COBRA"
       coverage.

CONFIRMED THIS IS A P~UDENT, TARGETED PROPOSAL THAT GIVES AMERICANS
AGES 55 TO 65 NEW CHOICES WITHOUT HARMING MEDICARE. The Congressional
Budget Office recently released estimates that validate that the Medicare buy-in proposal is a carefully
targeted policy that will not burden the Medicare Trust Fund.

       Paid for by premiums and anti-fraud and overpayment savings. Under this proposal,
       participants would pay the premium in two parts: most up front (the base premium) and a part
       after they tum 65 years old (the risk portion of the premium that accounts for the fact that
       less-than-healthier beneficiaries may be likely to opt for this policy). Medicare would in effect
       "loan" participants the second part of the premium until they reach 65 when they would make a
       small payment as an add on their regular Medicare Part B premium. This means there will be
       temporary costs to the Medicare program, which is paid for, dollar-for-dollar, by a series of
       anti-fraud and anti-overpayment initiatives.

       Separate Trust Fund. The buy-in takes advantage of Medicare's low administrative costs and
       choice of providers and plans, but its financing is kept completely separate from the Medicare
       Trust Fund.
