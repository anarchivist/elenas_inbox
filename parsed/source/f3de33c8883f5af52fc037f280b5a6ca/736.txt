TEXT:
In case we don't catch up, here are a few details on the New Hampshire
waiver:

Submitted 9/95, approved 6/96
"New Hampshire Employment Program"
statewide
requires recipients to "undertake job search efforts within 6 mos of
participation in work activities" (I find this somewhat confusing)
Sanctions increased for non-cooperation or refusal of a job offer
new applicants must be assessed for employability as a condition of
eligibility
jointly administered by state human services agency and Department of
Employment Security
for children concived while family is on AFDC, mothers are exempt from
work only until the child is 13 weeks old.
limits time recipients may spend in post-secondary educational activities
unemployed non-custodial parents can be required to participate in work
activities.
provides transitional Medicaid, case management
raises resource limit and disregards value of one car

I do remember this tortured history of Merrill wanting a "fast track"
waiver and HHS saying he didn't really qualify for one. Approval took 9
months
