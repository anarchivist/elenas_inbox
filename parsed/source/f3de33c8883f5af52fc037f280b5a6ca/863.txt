TEXT:
I understand that Katie will be requesting a meeting for the week of 2/24
with Bruce and Gene to discuss how to better coordinate environmental
policy in the White House.  I expect that Katie will come in with a
proposal to more closely coordinate--perhaps with regular meetings.

I agree that the White House as a whole can use some improvment in this
area, and I have no objection to this meeting.  The meeting will be
significantly more productive if the four of us can find time a few days
in advance to talk through what the key environmental issues are in the
upcoming year, and what each office should bring to the table in resolving
them.

I suggest that we try for a meeting on Wednesday or Thursday of next week
to discuss these issues.
