COOL--Country of origin labeling.

Two things you need to be aware of, please share with Bruce.

GAO is likely to put out a report next week (we just had exit interview
today)
saying essentially, bad idea, not enforceable, costs too much ...

FSIS is doing also doing a study as required by the Omnibus (inserted after
COOL was stripped out in conference). Trying to figure out timing etc and
will provide further info.
