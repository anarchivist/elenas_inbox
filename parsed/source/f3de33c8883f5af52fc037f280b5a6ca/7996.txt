                            Modified Gramm Amendment Would Consume
                       Nearly 80 Percent of Tobacco Revenues Between 2008-2022


     Background note: This is based on OMB's analysis of receipts under the McCain bill.

     Talking Points:

            I strongly urge you to vote against the Gramm amendment because it would prevent the
            legislation from achieving important health goals.

            Over the first four years, the Gramm amendment would spend $13 billion for tax cuts, or
            28 percent of the $45.7 billion in spending under the McCain bill. If funding for states
            and farmers is held constant, funding for public health and research would be reduced by
            67 percent.

            Over the next five years, the Gramm amendment would spend an additional $30 billion
            on tax cuts, or 42 percent of the $71.1 billion in the McCain bill allocated for spending.
            If states and farmers get first priority in terms of funding, the amendment would
            completely eliminate all funding for public health and medical research during those
            years.

     ·      Between 2008 and 2022, the Gramm amendment explodes: it would absorb $225 billion,
            or 78 percent, of the $289.5 billion in the McCain bill allocated for spending. If states
            and farmers get first priority in terms of funding, the amendment would completely
            eliminate all funding for public health and medical research during those years. Funding
            for the states would by reduced by 62 percent, and funding for farmers would be reduced
            by 57 percent.

            The Gramm amendment would thus eviscerate funding for critical public health programs
            such as smoking cessation, education and counteradvertising. This would significantly
            undermine efforts to reduce youth smoking in this country and help adults who want to
            quit. Critical funding for medical research would also be cut drastically, including
            research into smoking-related diseases such as cancer and heart disease.

            Additionally, States would be expected to forgo their claims in court and receive, in
            exchange, minimal compensation for their enormous expenditures related to
            smoking-related illnesses. Funding would also be significantly reduced for tobacco
            farmers, who have done nothing wrong and who deserve to be compensated for the losses
            they will suffer as a result of tobacco legislation.
