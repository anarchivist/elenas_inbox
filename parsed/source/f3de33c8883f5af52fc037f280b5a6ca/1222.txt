                       Making Work Pay For Low-Income Federal EmployeJ!Jtx-Dump Conversion

The President's directive asks appropriate agencies to take three steps that will assist all
low-income federal employees, whether or not former welfare recipients. Following is an
explanation of the existing government services in these three areas and the rationale for agencies to
expand their use of each.

Notifying Those Eligible About The EITC

The President directs each agency head to notify all employees eligible for the Earned Income Tax
Credit (EITC) of both their eligibility and their ability to receive EITC monies each month in their
paychecks.

The EITC is available to low-income individuals with incomes up to $25,760 who have at least one
child living with them in a home in the United States. The credit is based on a percentage of the
employee's earned income. An eligible employee can claim the credit on the individual income tax
return at the end of the year or the employee may receive advance payments with her pay.
Payment of the advance EITC is limited to 60 percent of what an eligible employee would receive if
she has only one qualifying child. For 1997, the maximum amount that may be advanced is $1,326.

While agencies are currently encouraged to notity eligible employees about the EITC and the
payment options, not all agencies do so. By directing each agency to notify its eligible employees
about the EITC, the Federal government will ensure that its low-income employees receive the
EITC in the manner that best enables them to cover costs such as child care, transportation, and
housing, without which an employee may not be able to enter or remain in the labor market.

Encouraging Agency Use of the Federal Fare Subsidy Program

 The President directs the General Services Administration (GSA) to issue guidelines that address
 whether agencies may offer fare subsidies based on the employee's income.

The Federal Fare Subsidy Program is one of several programs Federal agencies have the option to
offer employees as part of the 1993 Federal Employees Clean Air Incentives Act. As of 1994 (the
most current data available) ten agencies offered direct fare subsidies to over 30,000 employees to
encourage them to use mass transit. The maximum allowable subsidy under the law is $60 a
month, though an agency can choose any subsidy level up to that. The General Services
Administration-facilitated program is currently under used.

If the GSA finds that agencies may offer fare subsidies based on an employee's income, the finding
will reduce the agency's cost of engaging in this program thereby enabling more agencies to
participate while helping low-income workers with the cost of transportation to and from work.

, Finding Affordable Child Care

The President directs the GSA, after consultation with all federal agencies, to report on plans to assist
low-income federal workers in finding affordable child care. In particular, the directive asks that
attention be paid to the option to contract with local resource and referral agencies.

The Federal government currently offers agencies two specific options to offer all employees access
to child care: the authority to contract with private child care service providers to run on-site child
care centers, and the option to contract with local child care resource and referral agencies that will
connect Federal employees to accessible and affordable child care. The Department of Defense also
runs its own child care center and offers child care subsidies to its employees (an option not
available to other Federal agencies) as allowed under the Military Child Care Act of 1989.

There are over 200 agency-spo~sored child care centers around the country and more are being
                                                                          Hex-Dump Conversion
built. However, while capacity is available in agency-sponsored child care centers the cost of care is
often too high for those in lower income brackets. It is for this reason that the President is asking
agencies to report on plans to expand the use of their option to contract with local child care
resource and referral agencies.
