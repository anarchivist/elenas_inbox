Senate Approves Health Insurance for Domestic Partners

   Health coverage for domestic partners and stiff penalties for red-light
runners and body piercing without parental permission are among nearly four
dozen bills passed by the Senate.
By Corey Grice
   Gay couples, unmarried seniors and others living in committed
"alternative
relationships" would be able to cover their dependent domestic partners
under
their employee health insurance if AB 1059 earns the governor's signature.
   The bill, by Assemblywoman Carole Migden, D-San Francisco, passed the
Senate Thursday on a 21-14 vote and will face another vote in the Assembly
before going to the governor's desk.
   The measure requires health plans that offer group coverage to extend
those benefits to unmarried adults over age 18 who live together in a home
and share living expenses in "an intimate and committed relationship of
mutual caring."
   Blood relatives who are not legally able to marry, such as a
brother-sister combination, are not elegible under the legislation but
same-sex couples and senior citizens would be extended coverage.
   "There are many seniors who are unmarried and choose not to for fear of
loss of benefits," Migden said.
   Senate Republican Whip Ray Haynes of Murietta said the government should
not mandate that health insurers provide coverage to domestic partners.
   "This bill forces people to do something that they mayor may not wish
to
do," Haynes said on the floor. "If insurance companies find this line of
insurance profitable, they'll offer it."
   More than 500 corporations offer coverage to domestic partners including
IBM, Genentech, Disney, Chevron, Northwest Airlines and Bank of America in


addition to major health insurance carriers Blue Cross, Health Net and Blue
Shield.
   Republican Gov. Pete Wilson is expected to veto the legislation because
he
views it is a mandate on health care providers.
   "We shouldn't be telling these providers which products they should
offer," said Wilson spokesman Steve Tatum.
   "It's certainly an uphill climb but not an impossible reach," said a
hopeful Migden. "I think it's an idea that will eventually take hold."
   AB 1059 was one of 47 bills passed by the Senate Thursday:
