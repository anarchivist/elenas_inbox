TEXT:
DNA Plant Technology Corp., a California biotech company, agreed today to
plead guilty to conspiring with an unnamed (B&W) tobacco company to grow
tobacco with a high nicotine content. This was the first charge filed in
DoJ's broad investigation of the tobacco industry. The gov't cited the
tobacco company as an unindicted coconspirator but refused to identify it
by name. However, the entire episode, including B&W's role, was first
revealed as part of FDA's investigation, is a matter of public record, and
was presented by Kessler at a Congressional hearing in 1994.

B&W and the biotech firm devised a scheme to develop high nicotine yield
plants. The seeds were developed in the U.S., sent to Brazil (I believe
this where the law was violated), high nicotine-yield plants were grown in
Brazil and then shipped back to the U.S.  B&W's goal was to develop a
reliable source of high-nicotine tobacco that it could use to control and
manipulate the nicotine levels of its cigarettes.

I recommend that we refer press inquiries to DoJ for comment.
