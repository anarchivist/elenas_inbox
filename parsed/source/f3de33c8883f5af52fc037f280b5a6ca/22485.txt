               Guidance on Senate Mark-Up of Ed-Flex Partnership Act


Q.   Does the Administration support the Ed-Flex bill marked-up by the Senate Health,
     Education, Labor and Pensions Committee today?


A.   The President strongly supports the principle of greater flexibility in federal education
     programs, tied to greater accountability for results. Last year the President proposed an
     expansion of the Ed-Flex demonstration program -- part of his Goals 2000 program-
     that allows states to waive certain federal education requirements if they interfere with
     state or local approaches to improving student achievement. States would be eligible for
     this additional flexibility if they had in place high academic standards, tests that measure
     students and schools against these standards, school report cards telling parents and the
     public how well each school is doing, and a system for identifying and helping tum
     around the lowest performing schools. This is a responsible way to provide more
     flexibility, in exchange for greater accountability.

     Unfortunately, Congress was unable to pass this proposal last year, and so is taking it up
     again now. The Administration would prefer to address this issue as part of the overall
     reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, to best ensure that we .
     design Ed-Flex to fit the programs as they are designed for the next five years, not the last
     five years. The Administration's bill, to be transmitted in March, will contain such a
     proposal.

     The bill under consideration by the Senate committee today is consistent with our
     proposal from last year. It passed with bipartisan support. We support it. And we will
     work with the Congress on this bill and through the ESEA reauthorization to ensure that
     we have both strong accountability and appropriate flexibility in federal education
     programs.

Q.   Under the Senate bill, would states be able to waive the accountability requirements the
     President proposed in his State of the Union Address?

A.   This bill, based on last year's proposal, actually contains many of the provisions in the
     President's proposal- higher standards, student testing, school report cards, and a
     procedure for intervening in failing schools. The underlying principle is consistent with
     the President's proposals and long-standing views - more flexibility in exchange for
     greater accountability. Because the President's State of the Union proposals have not
     been enacted, this bill does not address them. We will work with the Congress, on this
     bill and again in the ESEA reauthorization process, to ensure that a final Ed-Flex bill
     ensures that states meet all of their accountability obligations.
