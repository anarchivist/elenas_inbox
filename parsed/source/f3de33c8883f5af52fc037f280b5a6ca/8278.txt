   FROM:     OMB LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS

  DATE:      JUNE 19, 1998

  SUBJECT:           LEGISLATIVE REPORT


  DOD Authorization/China: A cloture petition was filed today on the DOD
  Authorization bill; the vote will occur on Tuesday.   If cloture is invoked
  on Tuesday, only germane amendments will be in order.   Currently pending
  are two non-germane amendments offered by Senator Hutchinson - (I) an
  amendment to prohibit entrance/visas to any Chinese official participating
  in religious persecution; and (2) prohibit entrance to any official
  participating in forced abortion policies.

  Emergency Spending and Y2K:  the House Republican confererice has decided
  NOT to allow any emergency designation of funding in the regular
  appropriations bills. This means that the Y2K money in the
  Treasury/Postal bill and the Defense bill will be stricken, probably with
  a self-enacting rule.

  The House Appropriators are expecting a 1999 supplemental later this year
  to pay for all emergency spending which will be paid for with mandatory
  offsets.  This bill would probably be around $5 billion:   $3.85 bill for
  Y2K, $250 mill for FEMA, $1.1 bill for LIHEAP and possibly $35 million for
  an ag provision on sanctions.

  Acting Deputy Director for Management Ed DeSeve is scheduled to testify on
  Y2K before the House Reform & Oversight Subcommittee on Government
  Management on Monday, June 22.
