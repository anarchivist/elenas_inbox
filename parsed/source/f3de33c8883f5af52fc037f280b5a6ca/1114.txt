TEXT:
I assume you don't plan to come to tomorrow's 11a.m. meeting of the
federal agencies on the summit, which is fine.

The agencies submitted a hodge-podge of material that I have sent over to
you.   There are some good things in there, but we need to separate wheat
from chaff. A lot of it is volunteering by Federal employees.    I am doing
a summary, but I also need to make sure I'm on your wave length in terms
of what is a good idea.   I would love to sit down with you in a day or two
if. possible.

I can make tomorrow's meeting productive by allowing some of the obviously
better agencies to talk about their ideas, in hopes of bring other
agencies up to their level.  I would single out proposals that work with
communities/voluntary efforts to help support the agency's mission.

One major. question:  I need to be sure I can define service in a way that
distinguishes it from voluntarism.   The Corporation has told me both that
voluntarism is a subset of service, and that service is generally more
sustained than voluntarism. Also, they say that service has more emphasis
on how the person doing the serving benefits from their service.   But I
imagine that voluntarism types assert that many volunteers do sustained
work, and that they get a ton out of it, so I'm not sure this distinction
works.   I assume service needn't be paid.  In any case, your reaction
would be helpful as I try to make sure Federal agencies are holding up the
service end of the equation.
