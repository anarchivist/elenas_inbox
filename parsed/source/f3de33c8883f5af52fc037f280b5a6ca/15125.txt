TEXT:
Wendy Hartman in the VP's office just called me to discuss the VP's role
in the Conference and asked for some paper on the Conference.   I'm going
to forward the POTUS' statement, the agenda as is, and a note saying that
we had thought the VP might open the 2nd panel as the POTUS opens the
first.   I'll also suggest that Elaine follow up with you or me to
discuss.   Sound okay?

Also, fyi, Stacey Rubin in Leg Affairs mentioned that Hilley is rethinking
the need for MOC to have a speaking role, given the role of the
governors.  I suggested that Hilley call you about this. By the end of
this, we'll have more speakers than we have audience members.
