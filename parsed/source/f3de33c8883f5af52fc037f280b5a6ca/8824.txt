TEXT:
Following is a reformulation of the Wellstone paragraph for the ED letter
to conferees on HR 6, the Higher Education bill.  It has been cleared by
Barry and Barbara.

Please let me know by 5:00 p.m. today if this language is acceptable so
that I can circulate it to ED and HHS for concurrence.

The Senate bill contains a provision amending the Temporary Assistance for
Needy Families program (TANF).   It would expand the type and length of
education programs that can be counted toward a State's "work activity"
participation rate.  The provision would also extend the FY98 and FY99
exclusion of teen parents from the cap on education programs that can be
counted toward a State's "work activity" participation rate to FY2000 and
beyond. The Administration strongly supports the TANF goal of enabling
more welfare recipients to move from welfare to work.   We look forward to
working with conferees to ensure that the final l'egislation recognizes the
role of education in meeting this goal, while still maintaining the
welfare law's strong work focus.
