         TEXT:
         Here are the offsets OMB has come up with for class size. Are you ok with
         this list? I'll pass on what we get from Treasury on the tax side later
         today.

         We are meeting with Greg Williamson from Murray's staff later today.   I'm
         sure that he's going to push us--now, or within the next day or two--to
         commit to express our support for the offsets that Murray finally goes
         with. As far as I can tell, our biggest problem in doing that will be
         that we may want to use some of the offsets down the road for other
         purposes.  I don't know if we can get by being supportive now, and worring
         about using these offsets for other purposes when we get that far down the
         road--though I'll try to make that work.

         Another point--these offsets won't add up to $7.4 billion over 5 years or
         $12.4 over 7--the number we need to keep our message of reducing class
         size to 18 in grades 1-3. Nonetheless, I think our priority should be to
         keep our message consistent, and not back off on the grade levels of
         average class size. We can try to do this either by simply not specifying
         how long it will take to get there, by trying to get away with fudging the
         offsets enough so no one can figure out that we can't reach· our original g
         oal, or by talking about the Murray bill as a first step toward our goal.

         Sound ok to you?

         Subject:         Re: Class Size offsets

         Here's where things stand on class size offsets.·

         There are a number of offsets available to use for Murray's bill.  The way
         Jack Lew would like to approach this is to provide Murray an updated list
         of the mandatory offsets from the budget (updated to reflect which ones
         are still available and current costing estimates).  That way, Murray can
         chose from the list, rather receiving a list of offsets that may appear
         to be hand-picked by the Adminstration. We're updating the list from the


budget now and will finish it by early afternoon.  It's OK to brief Murray
verbally on pros and cons of various offsets -- Jack just doesn't want
anything in writing that is different from the complete list that was in
the budget.

Examples of mandatory offsets that were in the budget and are still
available include:

Social Services Block Grant -- about $500 M in 1999 and 2000 (after that,
over $600 M fromSSBG is used by the highway bill)

Medicaid Cost Allocation proposal -- about $300-$600 Ma year based on
changing match rates

Student Loans -- about $50-$75 M a year resulting from a reduction in the
amount guaranty agencies keep from default collections

FHA -- about $200 M a year resulting from increasing the FHA loan limit to
conform to the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac limits.

We still have not heard from Treasury on tax options, but, as you know,
there seem to be a few possibilies that could.easily generate $1-2 billion
a year.
