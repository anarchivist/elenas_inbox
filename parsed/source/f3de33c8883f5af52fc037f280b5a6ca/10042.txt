Procedures: There are growing concerns that in converting welfare offices into 'job centers"
New York City may be inappropriately preventing families from obtaining Food Stamps and
Medicaid by requiring them to wait until their second visit to apply. While agencies do not need
to offer TANF assistance to applicants when they first apply (they can, for example, require an
applicant to search for ajob first), Food Stamp law requires agencies to allow applicants "to
apply ... on the same day that the household first contacts a food stamp office" and Medicaid
regulations require agencies to provide "the opportunity to apply for Medicaid without delay."
Currently, both USDA and HCFA are requesting information from city and state officials about
their application procedures. Unfortunately, Mayor Guiliani has criticized this review as an
attack on his work first agenda, and has been publicly disagreeing with his welfare
commissioner, Jason Turner, and The New York Times, which reported the story and which
Guiliani says misquoted Turner. We are trying to get this issue out ofthe spotlight while using
our legal leverage to ensure the federal Food Stamp and Medicaid guarantee.
