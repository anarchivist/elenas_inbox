                    RACE/RECONCILIATION
                COMMUNICATIONS STRATEGY PLAN
OBJECTIVES

       · Emphasizing the importance and necessity of the race and reconciliation initiative
  Through the communications roll out to as wide an audience as possible.

        · Illustrate the President's long-term commitment to, and understanding oj the issue of
              race in America.

        · Develop the message to reflect accurately and appropriately the scope and nature of
the       President's initiative, ensuring that our means of communication are as accurate and
 inclusive as the initiative itseljwill be.

Following is an outline of the communications strategy including press, surrogate and outreach
plans and timelines. This is intended for planning purposes only.


                          Week of May 12: Lay the Ground Work


Event          Tuskegee Apology
                     The Tuskegee story will be the hook for many reporters to write about the
                     race initiative from a historical perspective.

                      Press: Dr. David Satcher will go to the stakeout. Identify Administration
                      spokesperson to put this in context of the larger race initiative (or brief
                      Satcher).

                      Morgan State Commencement

                      Press: Side-bar/feature stories on Terry Edmonds, first African-American
                      speech writer for a U.S. President, Morgan State alumni.

Media          Finalize Press Plan

                      and outlets) for inclusion in roll out.

Outreach              Identify Surrogates
                      Validate the President's commitment to this issue and provide thoughts
                      and anecdotes. These should be people from various disciplines
                      (activists, religious, friends, family, political) who can address this issue in
                      context of stages of the President's life.
