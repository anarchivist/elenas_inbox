TEXT:
1) A bonus formula which only rewards unsubsidized employment (i.e.
excludes even subsidies paid with TANF funds) may disproportionately
affect those areas and populations the WTW funds were intended to serve,
i.e. concentrated poverty and hardest to serve. While we don't yet have
hard data on how much subsidized employment is occuring with TANF funds,
it may be used more where it's harder for someone to get an unsubsidized
job.   Also, it may take longer for people to move from subsidized to
unsubsized jobs where the economy is worse or the individuals haye more
barriers. Given the one-shot, short-term time frame for the WTW bonus,
we'd penalize these places by only counting unsubsidized placements.

2) Just a reminder that it was never our intention to reward fully
subsidized jobs, i.e. workfare. The TANF bonus only rewards jobs that are
less than 100% subsidized, and it's always been our intent to do the same
here.  In other words, the employer is paying someone $6.00 hour, but gets
a subsidy that partially offsets these costs (typically a cash out of the
person's welfare check).   I'm pretty sure OMB knows this at a staff
level, but just wanted to make you had this info if i t should come up with
Jack.
