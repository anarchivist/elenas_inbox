TEXT:
I am trying to coordinate this FLSA document, but have heard conflicting
things about timing and release:

1. Emily said there was some conference call I missed where-it was
decided that it won't be released till next week, to accommodate Dem Govs.

2. However, Stacey Grundman of DOL says there was some conference call I
missed yesterday with Kitty Higgins where it was decided to roll it out
starting tonight.   In fact, by accident I found out Stacey planned to send
it to the Hill tonight, based on instructions in that call.   Since I
haven't yet seen the final version reflecting everyone's comments, this
would be a problem.
