TEXT:
The stories on AP/Reuters are bad, but seem to have seen little daylight.
USDA and Amy were favoring just letting them die but will call the
reporters back.   [O'hara swears on a bible they didn't do this, and it is
true the industry put out press releases saying the report was against a
single food agency.    I had taked to Durbin's staff last night and at a
hearing today, he noted the industry response, but said our report was
supportive of a single food agency.    The Reuters reporter who wrote the
line, "US rejects single food agency" reporter told Smith Dewall "maybe
a I got spun by the manufacturers." 1

Anyway,  I talked to Amy Weiss and Andy Solomon (USDA has a relationship
with the reporters)  and he'll call to tell them they got the story
wrong. Caroline Smith Dewall also said she'd call back to stress that we
endorsed but she is also saying we need to explicitly favor the single
food agency.  You just can't believe what you read.
