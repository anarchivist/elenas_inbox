TEXT:
I'm uncomfortable with the sentence as written, especially
"directed"---how about something like; " In keeping with the commitment
president Clinton made when he visited Central AMerica in the spring, the
new program is as accessible and simple as the law permits. "--edits
welcomed

subject:         NACARA Roll-out document

In my edits to the INS Press document on the NACARA reg, I suggest adding
to the last paragraph on the first page some recognition of the
President's role in this process and the sentence would therefore read:.

"As President Clinton directed, this new program is the culmination of the
Administration's efforts to create as accessible and simple a process as
the law permits," says INS Commissioner Meissiner.

please let me know if you have any concerns adding this reference to the
President.

Thanks.
