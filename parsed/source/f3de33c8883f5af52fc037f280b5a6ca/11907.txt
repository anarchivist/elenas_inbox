    Bush opposes adoptions by gays
    He's against hate law covering orientation
    By Wayne Slater / The Dallas Morning News
         AUSTIN - Gov. George W. Bush said Monday that he opposes adoptions by
    gays
    or lesbians, saying the proper parents for a child are a married man and
    woman.
         "I'm against gay adoptions," Mr. Bush said, responding to questions
    about
    bills that would bar the state from designating gays and lesbians as foster
    parents or permitting them to adopt children.
         "I believe children ought to be adopted in families with a woman and a
    man
    who are married," said Mr. Bush, who has launched a exploratory committee


 to
 consider a race for the White House.
       The Republican governor also said he opposes including sexual
 orientation
 in a bill to clarify the state's hate-crimes law, which increases
 penalties in
 cases in which a victim is targeted for a specific reason such as race or
 gender.
      Mr. Bush said he doesn't think there is a need for such a bill
 clarifying
 the law.
      "I've always said all crime is hate crime," he said. "People, when they
 commit a crime, have hate in their heart. And it's hard to distinguish
 between
 one degree of hate and another."
      The bills to block gay people from adopting children in the custody of
 Child Protective services were sponsored by Rep. Warren Chisum, R-Pampa.
 The
 agency takes custody of abused or neglected children.
      Mr. Chisum said gays and lesbians provide an inappropriate environment
 for
 raising children and should be barred from adopting them.
      Dianne Hardy-Garcia of the Austin-based Lesbian and Gay Rights Lobby of
 Texas was out of town Monday and unavailable for comment.
      On Sunday, more than 6,000 people marched in Austin to protest the
 proposed
 legislation. Among those attending the rally were Chastity Bono, daughter
 of
 the late u.S. Rep. Sonny Bono and entertainer Cher.
      Ms. Bono publicly declared she was gay in 1995.
      "The tools they use against us are hate, fear and the false mythology
 that
 somehow gay and lesbian people are a threat to family values and a threat
 to
 the American way," she told the Austin crowd.
      At a news conference Monday, Mr. Bush was asked whether children
 already
 in the custody of gays or lesbians should be removed.
      "I have no idea whether the children ought to be removed or not
 removed, II
 he said. "The question is whether I'm for gay adoption. And the answer is,
 I'm
 not."
      Democratic presidential candidate Bill Bradley said earlier this month
 during a visit to Texas that he would use Mr. Bush's opposition to the
 hate-
 crimes bill against him should the two be their respective parties'
 presidential nominees.
      The New Jersey senator said people who commit crimes based on race,
 gender,
 sexual orientation or ethnicity should be punished. He referred to the mu
 rder
 of James Byrd Jr., the Jasper, Texas, man dragged to death last year.
      Mr. Bush noted that one of the men charged in the murder has been
 convicted and sentenced to death. He said the laws already in place permit
 stiff sentences.
      "The guy's going to be put to death," he said. "I can't think of a more
 harsh penal ty. "
