TEXT:
Please Jo~n Mickey Ibarra and Ann Lewis in a meeting to discuss the
upcoming IGA meetings and message strategy on Wednesday, 1/21, at 3:00pm
in Mickey's office.

POTUS is addressing the u.s. Conference of Mayors on 1/30 and the National
Governors' Association on 2/23.  Including meetings the VP will address or
drop by, we have six major and several other additional conventions of
state and local elected officials in Washington in the next few weeks.
We'd really like to develop a common message for delivery at these
meetings.

FYI -- Attached is a calendar of upcoming IGA meetings.

please let me know soon. if 3:00pm on 1/21 does not work for you.

Thanks.==================== ATTACHMENT    1 ====================
