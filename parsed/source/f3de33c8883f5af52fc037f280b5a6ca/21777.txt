 TEXT:
 I have touched base w/ the Office of Refugee Resettlement at HHS re: how
 this proposed initiative might complement existing resettlement services
.currently provided to refugees. They confirm there is a need for ESL and
 general adjustment services for the vast majority of immigrants who are
 not refugees.  Some families include some members who enter the country as
 refugees and some who do not.  The refugee service programs have to deny
 services to the non-refugees.  Similarly, some refugees later bring over
 other family member (who enter as non-refugees) and then bring them to the
 programs they attended to learn english, get help with employment,
 citizinship and other forms of adjustment assistance, only to find out
 these programs cannot serve the other members of the family.
