TEXT:
FYI, I looked into this for Susan Liss on Mrs. Gore's staff.     Following is
the information I was given.

The actual authorization for Title X funding (public funds to support
family planning services) expired in 1995. Since 1995, this
Administration has dealt with Title X on an annual basis thorugh the
appropriations process. The President's budget contains $203 million in
FY '98 for Title X. This is a $5 million increase over the previous
year's funding.

Title X is run by the Office of Population Affairs in the Department of
Health and Human Services, Public Health Service.  Every year, through
this office, the Secretary sends up to the Hill a request to reauthorize
Title X, however, because of the hostile Congress, the request is really
just perfunctory.
