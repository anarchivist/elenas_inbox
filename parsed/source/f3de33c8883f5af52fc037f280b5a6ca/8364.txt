TEXT:
The Administration's letter responding to Goodling's block grant proposal
is going through final clearance this afternoon. Tanya and I are handling
it, but Elena, I wanted to see if you object to the letter saying the
President's senior advisors would recommend a veto of the bill.  Current
language has Secretary Riley recommending the veto, but Education would
like to make it a sr-advisors level veto instead.  The President has
previously threatened to veto a similar block grant bill, so this is not
breaking much new ground.  Tanya and I are OK with this change, as is OMB
and Congressional affairs. Do you object to this change? Do you need to
know more about it?
