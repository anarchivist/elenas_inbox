                       IRS Allows Smokers Some Deductions

                      By Curt Anderson
                      AP Tax Writer
                      Thursday, June 10, 1999; 5:48 p.m. EDT

                      WASHINGTON (AP)    -- Smokers trying to kick the habit can
claim
                       some costs as medical expenses on income tax returns
under a decision
                      Thursday by the Internal Revenue Service that reverses a
20-year-old
                      agency position.

                      Doctors involved in smoking cessation programs said the
IRS ruling could
                      have broader ramifications by persuading providers of
health benefits
                      packages to include such treatment in their coverage.

                       "It's about time, "     said Dr. Mike Eriksen, director of
smoking and health
                 at the federal Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta.
"There is no better
                 preventative program than stopping someone from
smoking. ' ,

                      Citing Surgeon General reports since 1988 that nicotine
is addictive and
                      smoking harms health, the IRS concluded that programs


and prescription
                  drugs that help someone quit smoking are no different
from efforts to treat
                  alcoholism or drug addiction -- both of which are tax
deductible.

                     --What the research of the last decade has documented is
that this is one
                     of the most powerful addictions that a person can
succumb to,"     said Dr.
                     Michael Fiore, director of the Center for Tobbaco
Research and
                  Prevention at the University of Wisconsin.       --It's not
just some bad habit.
                  It's a dangerous, chronic disease."

                     In revoking its 1979 position against the deduction, the
IRS agreed: - - A
                     strong causal link exists between smoking and several
diseases, "    the
                     agency said in its announcement.    --Nicotine, a substance
common to all
                     forms of tobacco, is a powerfully addictive drug. ' ,

                     Not every expense can be deducted. The law does not
permit a taxpayer
                     to claim such non-prescription medications as nicotine
patches or gum.
                     Also, the total in medical expenses -- smoking-related
or otherwise --
                     must reach 7.5 percent of a taxpayer's adjusted gross
income in order to
                     qualify as an itemized deduction.

                  But prescriptions, doctor bills or cessation programs
offered by hospitals
                  or other treatment facilities could be deducted, so long
as they are not
                  reimbursed by an employer or by insurance.

                     Eriksen said there are an increasing number of intensive
programs
                     available, including some at drug treatment centers that
have added
                  nicotine addiction. There are also more and more
pharmaceutical options,
                  he said.

                   --It's the right thing to do in terms of the dollar
invested and tlie dollar
                   saved, " he said.

                     Taxpayers who paid for a smoking cessation program in
recent years
                  could file an amended return to claim those costs,
particularly if they
                  already had enough medical expenses to qualify. Other
taxpayers should
                  check past returns to figure if the smoking expenses
reached the 7.5


                    percent of adjusted gross income threshold.

                    Taxpayers can generally file an amended return for three
years after the
                    due date of the original return using IRS Form 1040X.
