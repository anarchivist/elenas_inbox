TEXT:
Ann is beginning to look for possible announcements/reports/etc. that
could be announced while the POTUS is away on vacation in the second half
of August and early September (these could involve VP, Cabinet, etc., or
just be released to the press).  Could your offices compile lists of any
such options, and send them to us via memo or e-mail?

Many thanks ...
