                                    Supreme Court Gun Case
                                      Question and Answer
                                        March 31, 1999


    Q:   Yesterday, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed a lower court decision and held that
         individuals charged in multi-state crime sprees can be prosecuted in any of those
         states for using a gun even if they used the gun in only one state. Are you
         supportive of the Court's decision?

    A:   Criminals who threaten the public safety by using guns during the commission of violent
         crimes should be subject to the tough, mandatory sentences set out in federal law. We
         are pleased with the Court's strong 7-2 decision in favor ofthe Justice Department's
         appeal to make sure we can bring armed criminals engaged in multi-state crimes to
         justice.

         The President recently signed into law provisions to further strengthen penalties for
         criminals who use guns to commit their crimes. The law signed by the President last
         November assures that criminals who possess firearms in furtherance of drug-related or
         violent crimes receive an additional 5-year sentence for their possession of the firearm,
         and adds a new penalty for those who brandish firearms during the commission of their
         cnme.
