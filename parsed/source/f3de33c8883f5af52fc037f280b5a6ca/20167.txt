                Dear                                                                          Hex-Dump Conversion


                        The Administration would support narrowly tailored legislation that would make it illegal
                to transport minors across state lines for the purposes of avoiding parental involvement
                requirements. The Administration appreciates the concerns of the sponsors of S. 1645 about
                fostering parental and family involvement in a minor's decision to obtain an abortion and their
                concerns about overbearing and sometimes predatory adults who improperly influence minors'
                ,abortion decisions. The Administration believes, however, that S. 1645, as currently drafted,
                inappropriately and perhaps inadvertently reaches beyond these important goals.

                        First, S. 1645 would subject close family members to criminal and civil penalty. Under
                the legislation, grandmothers, aunts, and adult siblings could face criminal prosecution for
                coming to the aid of a relative in distress. Even a mother or father could be exposed to
                criminal penalty if she or he resides in a state which requires the consent or notification of both
                parents. Imposing criminal and civil sanctions on family members for helping their relatives,
                however, does not further the interests of healthy fami'ly communications. Subjecting family
                members to criminal or civil sanction, moreover, would also further isolate the minor by
                discouraging her from seeking advice and counsel from those closest to her. Finally, creating a
                       ,              .
                civil action which allows family members to sue each other when a minor within that family has
                an abortion does not serve the goal offosteri.ng strong families.

                         Second, the bill would potentially impose liability on persons providing information,
                counseling, referral, or medical services to the minor. The bill as written, for example, could
                potentially subject a telephone receptionist to civil or criminal liability merely for informing an
                unnamed caller about the availability of abortion services. Holding such persons criminally or
                civilly liable, however, does not further the interests in promoting family communication or
                deterring those who would inappropriately transport minors across state line to obtain abortions.

                        The Justice Department has also identified a number of constitutional and practical
                enforcement concerns that inhere in particular aspects of the legislation. The Department will
                forward their concerns subsequently and would be pleased to work with the sponsors in crafting
                legislation that remedies those defects and the other matters noted above.

                        The Administration is concerned that S.1645 represents an unprecedented intrusion into
                federalism and the rights of states to regulate matters within their own boundaries.     The
                Administration believes, however, that well-crafted legislation, carefully tailored to the
                protection of minors, will serve to minimize the federalism concerns.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:                  Charles F. C. Ruff, Counsel to the President
                       William Marshall, Associate Counsel to the President


SUBJECT:               The Child Custody Protection Act




I. THE CHILD CUSTODY PROTECTION ACT
                                                                         ·
        Congress is currently considering S. 1645, the Child Custody Protection Act -- a bill
which would impose civil and criminal liability on any person who knowingly transports a minor
across a state line to obtain an abortion in cases in which the minor has not satisfied her home
state's law~ regarding "parental involvement" (i.e. la~s requiring parental consent or parental
notification).

        The bill constitutes a novel form of federal legislation in that it prohibits persons from
traveling across state lines to engage in conduct that is legal in the second state. 1 It also
uniquely conditions liability upon the law of the state where the person comes from rather than
the law of the state in which the conduct occurs.                ..




        1 The only possible exception to this is the Mann Act which may arguably be read as
prohibiting transporting women across state lines for prostitution to a state where prostitution is
legal.


                                                  1
                                                                              Automated Records Management System
                                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion

             As described by its sponsors, the bill is designed to protect the rights of parents to
     participate in their minor child's abortion decision against those who would encourage her to
     have a "secret" abortion -- a category which, according to the sponsors, includes out-of-state
     abortion clinics who advertise the availability of abortions without parental involvement2 and
     adult males who impregnate minors and then attempt to erase the consequences of their actions
     by transporting the minors out of state for the abortion procedures.

             Politically, however, the bill is more easily characterized as an attempt to provoke
     controversy on a sensitive and divisive issue than as an effort to address a legitimate area of
     federal interest. Substantively, the bill raises troublesome policy; constitutional, and practical
     law enforcement concerns and is counterproductive to its asserted goals.

     II. BACKGROUND -- PARENTAL INVOLVEMENT REQUIREMENTS

             Currently twenty-two states require parental consent for a minor to terminate her
     pregnancy while seventeen states have opted for the lesser requirement of parental notification.
     Six of these states require notice to or consent from both parents, while four states would allow
     the notification or consent requirements to be satisfied by persons other than the minor's parents
     (such as a grandparent or an adult sibling.) Eleven states have no parental involvement
     requirements.

             The constitutionality of parental involvement requirements has generally been upheld by
     the Supreme Court. Although holding that pregnant minors have a constitutional right to choose
     whether to terminate a pregnancy, the Court has determined that a state may require parental
     notice or consent in the interest of ensuring that the minor's decision to terminate her pregnancy
     is "knowing, intelligent, and deliberate." The parental involvement requirements, however,
     may not impose an "undue burden" upon a minor who is capable of giving an informed consent
     to the abortion procedure. States must also provide a judicial "bypass" mechanism which allows
     the minor to avoid the parental involvement requirements if she establishes either 1) that she is
     sufficiently mature and well-informed to make the abortion decision independently or 2) that an
     abortion without parental involvement would be in her best interests. 3

     III, ANALYSIS

            2  The law does not explicitly prohibit advertising. The sponsors might, however,
     envision extending liability to advertisers through some application of accomplice liability.
     See Part III, below.

              3 The Supreme Court has ruled that bypass procedures are constitutionally mandated in
     states that require the consent or notification of both parents; but the Court has not had occasion
     to rule on whether bypass procedures are required in a one parent state.




                                                      2



                                                                                 Automated Records Management System
                                                                                         Hex-Dump Conversion
                   S. 1645 represents a dramatic incursion into the traditional understanding of federalism.
          Federalism presumes that a citizen is free to take advantage of favorable laws in other states and
          that states have the right to regulate matters within their own boundaries (unless the matter is
          directly regulated by the federal government.) S. 1645, however, is unique in that it attempts, by
          force of federal law, to enforce one state's laws in the territory of another. As such, it sets a
          dangerous precedent for federal interference with such matters as gaming, alcohol, tobacco, guns
          and other items whose regulation varies significantly from state to state.

                  Despite the seriousness of the federalism concerns, however, S. 1645 is not clearly
          unconstitutional on those grounds. Because the approach taken by the sponsors is so novel,
          there is virtually no Supreme Court precedent, on either side, from which to take direction.
          Accordingly, while constitutional arguments against the legislation can be made based upon
          general federalism principles (or upon right to travel or privilege and immunities grounds), a
          definitive constitutional assessment cannot be offered with any degree of certainty. The
          federalism objection, therefore, is best characterized as a policy, and not as a constitutional,
          concern.

                   There is also no constitutional abortion rights argument that would support invalidating
          the bill as whole. DOJ has indicated that the bill would be unconstitutional as applied in certain
          circumstances (for example when the law would require the minor to satisfy the parental
          involvement laws of two separate states) but the constitutional concerns noted by DOJ, although
          serious, can be remedied by re-drafting the legislation.

                  The strongest objections to the legislation are based on policy, rather than on
          constitutional, grounds. The bill's first and most glaring weakness is that it subjects family
          members to criminal and civil liability. Under the terms ofthe legislation, grandmothers, aunts,
          and adult siblings may ~e prosecuted for coming to the aid of a minor relative in distress. Even
          a mother or father may be criminally sanctioned if she or he resides in a state that requires the
          involvement of both parents. Obviously, subjecting family members to criminal and civil
          sanctions for helping their relatives does not further the interest of healthy family
          communication. Exposing family members to the possibility of criminal or civil sanction is also
          counterproductive in that it would further isolate the minor by discouraging her from seeking
          advice and counsel from those closest to her. Finally, creating a civil action which allows family
          members to sue each other when a minor within that family has an abortion does not serve the
          goal of fostering strong families.

                 Second, the bill could inappropriately impose liability on persons who merely provide
          information, advertising, counseling, referrals, or medical services to the minor. Through rules of
          accomplice liability, the bill could subject a telephone receptionist to criminal liability, for
          example, merely for informing an unnamed caller about the availability of abortion services.
          The bill's creation of a private cause of action is, from this perspective, even more problematic.



                                                           3
                                                                                Hex·Dump Conversion
A civil action would be a ready tool for those who wish to harass, intimidate, or bankrupt service
providers.

        Third, the bill imposes criminal liability on persons who may not realize they are
violating the law (as when the minor falsely infonns the transporter that she has parental
consent.) This is because the bill predicates liability on the intent to help the minor ob~in an
abortion rather than on the intent to help the minor avoid the application of a state's parental
notification requirements.

         Finally, the bill raises numerous practical law enforcement concerns. These include
the use of scarce FBI resources to prosecute violations, the need for federal law enforcement
authorities to interrogate family members and close teenage friends in order to pursue violations,
and the fact that the defendants in some cases are likely to be minors.

IV. RECOMMENDATION

        There would be little advantage in opposing this bill in its entirety. The sponsors'
example of the adult male impregnating the female minor and taking her across state lines for an
abortion without parental involvement is likely to be politically compelling and, as noted above,
there is no definitive case to be made thatimposing federal civil and criminal sanctions for this
activity is unconstitutional. At the same time, the bill, as written, significantly overreaches and
affinnatively hanns important policy and constitutional interests.

        At this point, it is unclear whether the sponsors are interested in fixing the legislation to
meet legitimate objections or whether they are merely interested in provoking confrontation. In
either case, we believe that our best action is to announce that the Administration would support
narrowly tailored legislation but, for policy and constitutional reasons, is opposed to the bill as
currently drafted. The first step in this process would be to submit a letter signed by the Director
of OMB highlighting two specific issues -- the need to exempt family members and the need to
exclude from potential liability those persons whose only connection to the abortion is. the
provision of infonnation, advertising, or a medical, referral, or counseling service. This letter
would also indicate that a complete list of our objections to the bill would be subsequently
forwarded by DO] and that you have instructed the Department to work with the sponsors in
crafting final legislation that meets Administration concerns. A draft copy of the OMB letter is
attached for your reference.
