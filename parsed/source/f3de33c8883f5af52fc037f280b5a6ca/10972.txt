TEXT:
We now have 8 people confirmed on the speaking program for tomorrow's
education event in Boston:

principal of Jackson/Mann (just to welcome)
Mayor Menino
Rep. Capuano (school is in his district)
Sen. Kerry
Sen. Kennedy
Gov. Celluci
Sec. Riley
POTUS

Scheduling has brought up concerns about the length of the program, and
also the possibility of eliminating the real person on the program.  We
could try to have the principal talk about changes they have made, and
talk about their support for POTUS initiatives, OR I can go back and fight
very hard to keep both the principal and real person on the program. How
do you feel about this?
