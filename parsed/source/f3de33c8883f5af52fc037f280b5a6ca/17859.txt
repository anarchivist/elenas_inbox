PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
REMARKS FOR HEALTH CARE EVENT
THE WHITE HOUSE
November 20, 1997

        Acknowledgments: Special thanks to VP Gore for overseeing this effort
both the Commission and the agencies implementing its findings will be
reporting to him. Sec. Herman; Sec. Shalala; Commissioner Peter Thomas.

        I want to thank the Commission for the remarkable job they have
done to build consensus on this challenging issue.  I am proud to accept
the CommissionD,s Health Care Bill of Rights.  I am commited to doing
everything I can to make those rights real for every American. And I
challenge the Congress to make them the law of the land.



        Throughout our nationO,s history, our strength has come from the
strength of our families, and from our ability to keep our values of
opportunity and freedom alive in each new time. Those values were
enshrined in AmericaD,s Bill of Rights.  And as times have changed, our
challenges have changed, and our nation has acted. Thirty five years ago,
during another time of change, the modern consumer movement was launched
when President Kennedy set forth a consumer bill of rights.  The laws
passed to protect those rights -- consumersO, right to be safe, to be
informed, to choose, and to be heard -- protect our children, our
investments, and our environment to this day.

        Today, American families once again face changing times -- and
nowhere are these changes more profound than in the health care industry.
The American health care system is the best in the world -- we have the
worldO,s best health care professionals, the finest medical schools, the
most advanced research and the most sophisticated technology. But in
recent years, that system has changed as millions of Americas have seen
their health plans change from traditional health insurance to HMOs and
other new kinds of health insurance.

        In many cases, managed care brings lower costs and improved
preventive care. But too often, families feel lost in this new world,
left out of the process of their own health care decisions.  Too often,
they feel as if they are getting fewer real services and more red tape.
And far too often, they feel as if they are on the losing side of a battle
between cost cutting and quality care. When lowered costs lead to lower
standards ... when life-or-death medical decisions are made by distant
case managers ... when patients are denied access to the specialized
doctors they need, then something is wrong, and we have an obligation to
do something about it.

        Today, Americans receive consumer protection when they purchase
cars, use credit cards, or even buy toys for their children.   Now we must
extend the same kind of protections to a person who visits a doctor,
checks into a hospital, or buys a health plan. Whether they have
traditional health care or managed care, we must make sure that none of
our people ever have inferior care. There must be basic standards that
every American can count on, wherever they live and whatever their needs
-- and these standards should be the right of every citizen.

        Here is what our Health Care Bill of Rights says:

        You have the right to be informed about your health plan in plain
English; you have the right to choose the right doctor for the right type
of care; the right to medical services in an emergency, wherever and
whenever the need arises; and the right to know all your medical options,
no matter how much they cost. You have the right to respectful care and
equal treatment at every health care facility, by every health care
provider; the right to know your medical records are confidential and only
used for legitimate purposes; and you have the right to express your
concerns about the quality of care you receive, and to take action when
that care is inadequate.

        This bill of rights is the product of a strong consensus from a
broad group that brings together business leaders and health insurers,
working people and health advocates, doctors and nurses. There will still
be those who oppose our bill of rights ... and that is their right. But
narrow interests should never prevail over the national interest. And the
Health Care Bill of Rights will protect quality care, protect consumers,


and protect our families.

         These protections are long overdue -- now, we must act to make
them real for all Americans.    Some of these rights will require federal
standards to be implemented.   Today, I challenge Congress to make these
rights the law of the land. There will be no more important test in the
coming months of our commitment to strengthen our families, and I look
forward to working with Congress to give all Americans the security they
deserve.

         But we should not wait for Congress to act.  Today I am acting,
within my power as President, to implement these rights to the extent I
legally can. Effective immediately, I am directing every federal agency
that administers or manages health plans to adopt the protections of the
Health Care Bill of Rights, and to report back to the Vice President about
where they need legislation to do so. With this step, we will ensure
better quality health care for tens of millions of Americans, including
all Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries, and all federal employees. And I
challenge all private health plans to adopt the Health Care Bill of Rights
voluntarily and give their members greater confidence and security.

        Finally, there can be no rights without responsibilities. This
new world of health care offers greater choice and more fundamental
opportunities for health than ever before. Today we outline the rights
that every American should have.  But every American has an enhanced
obligation to take an active role in his or her health care, and to take
responsibility for his or her own health.

        President Kennedy said, in proposing his plan for AmericaD,s
consumers, D&under our economic as well as our political form of
democracy, we share an obligation to protect the common interest in every
decision we make.DS The coming years can be a time of remarkable
advances, as the breakthroughs of science and medicine offer new hope for
health and longevity.  If we act to seize the opportunities of this time,
to reduce the risks, and to make sure that all Americans can reap the
rewards of change, we will meet our obligation to the common interest and
to future generations.
