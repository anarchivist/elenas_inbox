MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:          CHARLES F.C. RUFF
               BRUCE REED
               RAHM EMANUEL

SUBJECT:       "Sporterized" Assault Weapons Directive

        This memorandum is in response to questions you raised concerning the options
described in our memorandum of October 30 concerning the importation of "sporterized"
assault weapons. Under Option 2, Treasury would suspend action on all pending applications
and future permits but not suspend existing permits pending its full review of the sporting
purposes criteria. As part of this approach, Treasury wo~ld review the importation and criminal
use of sporterized weapons and suspend existing permits if the evidence so warranted .. You
asked how long it would take for Treasury to conduct this interim review and make such a
decision.

        We have been informed by attorneys at Treasury and ATF that the plan for the review
process is still being written. The plan is expected to have 3 separate tracks running
simultaneously, the first two of which could be completed within 5 to 10 weeks. The first track
would involve gathering and analyzing law enforcement statistics and other information relating
to the use of the imported weapons in criminal activity. These ''tracing'' figures and other
anecdotal information could support, depending on their quality, the immediate suspension of
existing permits.

        The second track would focus on a technical analysis of the weapons, comparing thern to
other acceptable sporting rifles. This analysis would include reviewing the existing sportip.g
purposes criteria and its application to the weapons at issue. This process is also estimated to
take 5 to 10 weeks and could uncover new facts that would warrant immediate suspension of the
existing permits.

        The final track, which is expected to take 120 days; will focus on the actual purpose and
use for which these weapons are acquired. This process will include a nationwide survey of the
buyers and users of these weapons. This track offers the best chance for acquiring information
supporting modification of the sporting purposes test to prohibit the importation of these
weapons.

        Treasury and ATF attorneys also noted that if there is a drastic increase in the numbers of
weapons actually being imported through existing permits during the 120 day period, in
conjunction with favorable facts gathered from any of the review tracks, our claim
that sufficient circumstances exist to warrant the suspension of existing permits would be
                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion


substantially stronger.
        In sum, it is unlikely that the review process will uncover additional facts supporting the
suspension of existing permits in less than 5 weeks. Based upon our conversations with the
attorneys at Treasury and ATF, we believe a more accurate estimate is 10 weeks, but that the
entire 120 day review may be necessary. And, as the Treasury and ATF attorneys emphasize,
even the full 120 day review may not uncover sufficient additional information that would justify
changing the sporting purposes test or suspending any existing permits.

     Finally, our respective recommendations, as set forth in the attached October 30
memorandum, have not changed as a result of this additional information.
