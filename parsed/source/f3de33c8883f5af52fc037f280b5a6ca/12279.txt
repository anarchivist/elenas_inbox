yes. I've been tracking this.  I spoke to Ray S. last Tues to express my
concern as well as to Jonathan Jones. I reminded them both that the VP was
not invited to speak to the closing NGA plenary session because it would
"appear too political." Jonathan initially believed that Carper would not
budge unless asked to do so by the VP. I conveyed that the VP making this
kind off request was a really bad idea and Jonathan agreed and urged that
Ron Klain or Craig Smith call Carper.  I briefed Klain on Wed am and he
initially wanted to discuss it with Carper. As we have gathered more info
- namely that Carper believes it will be mostly staff - Ron is less
concerned.  I have urged Carper that he shouldn't take the risk that it
becomes a bigger story and I think he is now considering this very
seriously. Ray called to tell me that he has frozen hotel and other
contracts while this gets reconsidered, and Austin does not now appear on
the list of official NGA site commitments now being handed out.
