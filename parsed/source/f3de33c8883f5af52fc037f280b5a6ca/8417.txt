New Welfare Reform Numbers

   LINDA WERTHEIMER, HOST: It's ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Linda
Wertheimer.
   NOAH ADAMS, HOST: And I'm Noah Adams.
   States are successfully moving welfare clients into jobs, according to
two studies released today by the u.S. Department of Health and Human
Services.
   NPR's Ina Jaffe has details about the studies, which looked at cities
in five different states.
   INA JAFFE, NPR REPORTER: The philosophy shared by all the welfare
programs in the studies could be summarized as "work first."   That is,
education and training in most cases took a backseat to job hunting. The
Urban Institute compared the programs in Indianapolis, Indiana, Worcester,
Massachusetts, Culpepper, Virginia, Portland, Oregon, and Racine,


     Wisconsin.
         Pamela Holcomb (ph), the author of the study, says the differences in
     the details of each state's program didn't seem to matter much. What was
     important, she says, was s·peed.
         PAMELA HOLCOMB, AUTHOR OF STUDY OF WELFARE-TO-WORK PROGRAMS: It is
     important to get recipients into the program or the work-focus as quickly
     as possible; to sort of change the message from the. beginning time that
     somebody walks in the door. That really does make a difference.
        JAFFE: Still, the results did vary from state to state. The percentage
     of welfare clients who found work range from a low of 36 percent in
     Worcester, Massachusetts to a high of 66 percent in Culpepper, Virginia.
     But the city where the effects of the work-first approach ·could be seen
     most clearly was Portland.
        That's because welfare clients required to participate in job search
     and work activities were compared with a control group who weren't
     required to do anything in exchange for their benefits.
        After two years, the number of welfare clients who found work was 11
     percent higher among those required to participate in job search. What's
     more, these Oregon welfare clients were told not just to find any job, but
     to look for a good job, with higher than minimum wages and opportunities
     for advancement. Gail Hamilton (ph) directed the Portland study for the
     Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation.
        GAIL HAMILTON, DIRECTOR OF PORTLAND STUDY OF WELFARE-TO-WORK PROGRAM,
     MANPOWER DEMONSTRATION RESEARCH CORPORATION: You're
        definitely seeing people with higher earnings, and some of this is due
     to people having better jobs. Now, it was a very good labor market out in
     Portland during this period. So that -- that probably helped facilitate
     this push to take a good job, but don't wait forever to find a good job
     and take it.
        JAFFE: The studies also found, however, some unintended consequences of
     the new federal welfare law as a result of the way different components
     interact. For example, welfare clients are now encouraged to work, even if
     they don't earn enough to get off welfare completely. To make this more
     attractive, they're allowed to keep more of their salaries without
     substantially reducing their benefits.
        But the Urban Institute's Pamela Holcomb points out during this time,
     while clients are working and doing everything else the law requires, they
     continue to use up their welfare time limit, which is five years under
     federal law. She says the State of Illinois has found one solution to this
     catch-22.
        HOLCOMB: They will fund the benefits during those months when a family
     is combining work and welfare, out of state dollars. Therefore, those
     months don't count against those person's time limit.
        JAFFE: Pamela Holcomb and Gail Hamilton both point out that while the
     work-first approach is moving welfare clients into jobs, it's the clients
     most ready to work who are' finding employment. 'So in the future, they say,
     welfare rolls will have a greater percentage of people who are not ready,
     who may be facing such obstacles as domestic violence or substance abuse,
     and states will need to develop new strategies to help these clients
     succeed in the world of work.
