TEXT:
Rahm/Elena/Karen/Bruce/Leanne:

Attached please find an initially cleared draft of the proposed directive
on modified assault wepaons. Rahm wants to temporarily hold this. Karen
wants to review it one more time w/counsel. And I would like to get some
back-up from Treasury on the #s and types of weapons involved.  Thus, we
should all review this withe expectation of doing it pretty soon, but not
just yet. ...

BR and EK: you guys have yet to review this. I'll start drafting the
Feinstein letter on this and the other two issues, with an eye towards
circulating at the start of next week.

Regards,
Jose'

MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY

Subject:      Importation ofUzi and Galil Firearms


The historic Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 banned 19 specific assault
weapons, duplicates of those 19 firearms and certain other semiautomatic weapons possessing
various military style features. The Administration and Congress worked to ban these deadly
firearms because -- as the weapon of choice for gangs and drug dealers -- they were being
recovered at numerous crime scenes and resulting in criminals being better armed than the
nation's law enforcement officers. Last year, in part as a result of the ban on assault weapons,
fewer police officers were slain in the line duty than any year since 1960, and no law
enforcement officer was killed by an assault weapon.

In addition to the prohibitions contained in the 1994 ban on assault weapons ban, the 1968 Gun
Control Act further restricts the importation of firearms unless they are determined to be
particularly suitable for or readily adaptable for sporting purposes. To enforce this law, the
Treasury Department has developed a factoring system to determine whether handguns meet this
sporting purposes test and are thus importable. The Department also determined that
semiautomatic assault type rifles do not meet the sporting purposes test and are not importable.

I am now informed that 2 of the 19 assault weapons that were specifically banned from
importation in 1989, the Galil and the Uzi, have been re-designed in order to circumvent the ban.
 Moreover, permits allowing the importation of thousands of these firearms have been approved.
 The Galil and Uzi, which are manufactured by Israeli Military Industries, were specifically
banned because these weapons were manufactured and used for military purposes and had no
legitimate sporting function. It is now appropriate to determine whether the modified weapons
would have legitimate sporting purposes in this country and are approved for continued
importation under the provisions ofthe Gun Control Act of 1968.

My Administration has aggressively enforced all applicable laws to keep non-sporting firearms
and other munitions posing a threat to public safety from entering the country. Therefore, I
direct you to:

       1)     Take the necessary steps to reexamine and determine whether the sporting
              purposes test should be modified with respect to the importation of the Galil, Uzi
              and any other firearms that have been similarly adapted or re-engineered to
              circumvent the 1989 ban on the importation of semiautomatic assault rifles or the
              1994 ban on semiautomatic assault weapons;


           2)      Suspend action on pending applications to import these weapons effectively
                   immediately; and

           3)      Delay final action on any application until this review process is completed.

    Nothing herein shall be construed to require actions contrary to applicable provisions oflaw.
