TEXT:
2/27 - Thursday   - Remarks to the Business Council

2/28 - Friday - Taping of Radio Address -- they said the topic wasn't
confirmed but that there was talk of doing certification ie.) Mexico.   I
said that you had proposed child support.  You should push Don on it if
that is what you want.

3/3 - Monday - Ad Council PSA Launch - POTUS and HRC

3/4 - Tuesday - PRESS CONFERENCE
Tuesday - HRC is doing School Construction Event -Pauline Abernathy is
working on it. We'll be meeting on it tomorrow.

3/5 - Wednesday - POTUS travels to East Lansing, Michigan to meet with 'a
State Legislature.  Marcia Hale is the staff contact.  Is this an
education message?

3/6 - Thursday -    Education Standards Meeting w/ Mark Tucker, etc. is on
the schedule and will be confirmed once Erskine signs off on it, hopefully
tomorrow.   Stephanie thinks that he will. They do not have a message event
for this day, so if there is a possible press/message event you would like
to do around this meeting I think scheduling would be open to the
suggestion.

3/7 - Friday - Taping Radio Address and Welfare Meeting - both tentative.
