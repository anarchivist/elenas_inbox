MEMORANDUM FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND SECRETARY OF THE
INTERIOR

Subject:       Law Enforcement in Indian Country

        I am proud of this Administration's progress in reducing violent crime and improving
public safety for our Nation's citizens_ Our efforts are making an important difference_
Nationwide, the violent crime rate has dropped approximately 17 percent since 1992, and the
homicide rate has declined about 22 percent.

       Unfortunately, during the same time period life has become more violent for the 1.2
million Indian citizens who live on or near reservations. Homicide rates, for example, have
increased to levels that often surpass those in large American cities. Numbers alone, however,
cannot convey the tragic impact of such violence on Indian families and their communities.

        This and other information you have provided to me make clear that we need to refocus
on this growing problem. While some tribal governments have developed strong law
enforcement programs, many others have encountered significant difficulty in doing so. Many
Indian citizens receive police, investigative, and detention services that lag far behind even this
country's poorest jurisdictions.

        The Federal govemment has taken steps to address this problem. The Administration
has sought increased Department of Interior funding and tribal control oflaw enforcement
programs on Indian lands. This year, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) established an
Office of Indian Country Investigations in its Violent Crimes Section, allocating additional
agents to Indian Country. The FBI also initiated a nationwide outreach training program for
Indian Country law enforcement officers. We have created additional tribal liaison positions in
the United States Attorney's Offices in Indian Country, intended to improve our ability to bring
offenders to justice. Through our Community Oriented Policing Services Program, we have
assisted tribal law enforcement agencies in hiring officers in Indian Country.

         Yet, law enforcement in Indian Country remains a serious problem. For these reasons,
consistent with the spirit of my 1994 memorandum on govemment-to-govemment relations and
tribal self-governance, I hereby request the Attorney General and Secretary of the Interior to work
with tribal leaders to analyze law enforcement problems on Indian lands. By October 31, 1997,
the Departments of Justice and Interior should provide options for improving public safety and
criminal justice in Indian Country. To the extent that these options might affect the
Departments' budgets, they should be included in your 1999 budget submissions and should be
consistent with the funding targets of the Bipartisan Balanced Budget Agreement.

    MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

    FROM:                      ELENA KAGAN
                               LEANNESH~ABUKURO


     SUBJECT:                  DIRECTIVE ON LAW ENFORCEMENT IN INDIAN COUNTRY

            The attached Executive Memorandum directs the Attorney General and Secretary of the
    Interior to analyze the law enforcement problem in Indian Country and submit options to you by
    October 31, 1997 for improving public safety in those areas. The Attorney General and
    Secretary proposed the Memorandum; they hope to submit it to the House Appropriations
    Committee next week in support of a request to reprogram funds to pay for this project.

             Indian Country is currently facing a law enforcement crisis. While violent crime has
      dropped nationwide, it has increased on Indian lands -- with homicide rates rising a full 80%
      since 1992. On many American Indian reservations, public safety is less secure than in the most
    . crime-plagued inner cities. Many violent crimes in Indian Country go wholly uninvestigated
      because of a shortage of law enforcement officers, and jails are grossly inadequate.

            The federal government generally has jurisdiction over major crimes committed on Indian
    lands; it therefore has responsibility for -- and can act to remedy -- this escalating crime problem.
     The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) at Interior currently wields most of the law enforcement
    authority of the federal government, but its budget for these activities has declined by 5.1 percent
    since 1992. This decline stands in stark contrast to the increased funding that other federal law
    enforcement agencies have gained during the same period. One possible solution to the Indian
    Country law enforcement problem, now being considered jointly by the two departments, is to
    transfer some or all of Interior's law enforcement authority to the Justice Department.

            Upon receiving your directive, the Attorney General and Secretary of the Interior will
    appoint a IS-member committee, including agency representatives, tribal leaders, and experts, to
    develop recommendations on how best to address criminal justice problems in Indian Country.
    Consistent with the Presidential Memorandum you signed in September 1994 on
    government-to-government relations with tribes, the memorandum states that tribal leaders will
    participate directly in this process.
