     Questions/Answers for National Association of Black Journalists Meeting
                                 July 16, 1997

Q:    Over the past few years, Mr. President, several African American leaders
      have criticized your Administration for not advancing an urban strategy or
      policy for our cities? What is your response to this criticism?

A:    Well, frankly, I wouldn't agree. I think our economic policies have
      supported and strengthened our cities. In fact, many of our cities are
      experiencing the biggest economic resurgence since World War II. In the
      50 largest cities, the unemployment rate is down by a third, and more
      downtowns and neighborhoods are making a comeback. And because
      of the disciplined and creative leadership of mayors, cities are in strong
      fiscal health and booming with ideas for reform.

      Instead of trying to impose ready-made solutions from Washington or
      ignore cities' problems altogether. my Administration has tried to give
      local leaders the tools and support they need to meet their challenges.
      That's why we've supported initiatives like empowerment zones and
      enterprise communities, the Earned Income Tax Credit, Community
      Development Financial Institutions and the flexible crime control and
      prevention initiatives in the Crime Bill. That's why we've called for an
      expansion of brown fields to help put abandoned and contaminated city
      properties back into productive use. And that's why we've fought for a
      $3 billion welfare-to-work initiative that will help our cities put former
      welfare recipients to work.

      All of these initiatives and more are tools that we've developed in tandem
      with cities, and I think the record shows that they're making a difference.
