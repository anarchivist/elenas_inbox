 TEXT:
 Good news from House on welfare to work housing vouchers among other
 things--$100 M (compared with $40 M in Senate).  I'll follow up to get
 details on vouchers.  Bruce, did you ever have a chance to make calls to
 the members HUD suggested?

 Subject:                     HUD's Appropriations, House Subcommittee Mark for FY 1999

 Good news.  The House Subcommittee added $1.7 billion above the
 Administration's requests

 Most of the overall difference in BA funding results from contract
 renewals and amendments.  However, even after adjusting for these
 programs, the House adds nearly $0.6 billion above the President's request
 (see table below). Hence, a very good overall mark for HUD.

                                                                                                    (B
 millions)

 Gains.  Includes $100 million for Welfare-to-Work Vouchers, $10 million
 for Regional Opportunity Counseling, $975 million for homeless, adequate
 funds for public housing and the HOME block grants.   CBDG funding is
 adequate; while it includes more set-asides than the President's request,
 it still provides for a modest increase in funds distributed by formula to
 States and entitlement communities.   Fair Housing's BA is increased from,
 $30 million to $40 million with an allocation that supports the
 Administration'S initiatives, including $7.5 million for a nationwide
 audit of housing discrimination.   (The Fair Housing mark is still $12
 million below the $52 million request) .

 Losses. While information remains preliminary, the Chairman's notes do
 not raise the FHA loan limits or permit more flexibility for single family
 property disposition.   The Secretary's Economic Development Initiative was
 funded at $50 million within CDBG, instead of the $400 million separate
 appropriation that was requested.   The House Subcommittee also did not
 provided funding for the Regional Connections Initiative; the Budget
 requested $100 million for this initiative as a set-aside within CDBG.
 The mark continues appropriation language requiring a 3-month pause in
 re-,issuing housing vouchers and certificates (Senate language would end
 this objectionable practice) .

 Details on Major Programs.

 Section 8 Contract Renewals.    Provides $9.6   billion (almost identical to
 the Senate level). The House level exceeds      our request by $2.4 billion in
 order to rest'ore the $2.3 billion rescinded    in the Supplemental bill.
 Both House and Senate levels fully fund all     expiring contracts. No issue.

 Section 8 Contract Amendments.  Provides $98 million.  Still unclear how
 much is needed here; however, this is much better than the Senate mark of
 -$1.4 billion.

 Welfare-to-Work Vouchers.  Provides $100 million as a set-aside in the
 large account for certificates.  Funds one-third of our request of $283
 million. Appears to grant funding as we requested but we will need to
 closely examine the appropriation language before knowing if the
 initiative is funded.

 Regional Opportunity Counseling.   Provides $10 million.  First time the
 Administration has received funding for this mobility initiative to help
 assisted tenants relocate into neighborhoods with more jobs, better
 schools and other services. The Administration requested $20 million.


 Public Housing.  Provides almost $500 million above our request:  +$450
 million for modernization, from $2,550 million to $3,000 million; +$50
 million for Revitalization of Severely Distressed Public Housing, from
 $550 million to $600 million, +$20 million for Indian Housing block
 grants, from $600 million to $620 million; -$20 million for Drug
 Elimination Grants, from $310 miliion to $290 million.

 CDBG. Provides $4,725 million, the same as the request.   However, it
 includes set asides where the Administration requested separate funding,


such as the Economic Development Initiative ($50 million) Brownfields ($20
million) Youthbuild ($35 million).  Senate provided $4,750 million.
Still, funding available to distribute to States and entitlement
communities would increase from 1998 enacted by $178 million (as compared
to the $238 million increased provided by the President's Budget).

HOME. Provides $1,600 million. This is $50 million above our request
without the set-aside for elderly/disabled. Senate provided $1,550
million.

Homeless.  Provides $975 million versus our request of $1,150 million (FY
1998 base of $823 million). The Senate provided $1,000 million. A
significant increase over last year's level but not as much as requested.

Elderly/Disabled, primarily new construction.  Provides $839 million
versus .our request within HOME of $333 million.  Senate provided $870
million.

Fair Housing.  Provides $40 million versus our request of $52 million (FY
1998 Base of $30 million). House includes $7.5 million for a nationwide
audit of housing discrimination, and all of the House increase is in the
Fair Housing Initiative Program (FHIP).    Senate provided $35 million.

Salaries & Expenses (S&E) Funding.   Provides $986 million, including
transfers, versus our request of $1,001 million (base of $1,001 million).
Senate provided our full request.  The $15 million reduction in S&E funds
is the exact same amount that is added to the IG.

Inspector General (IG) Funding.   Provides $82 million, including
transfers, versus our request of $67 million (base of $67 million) .
Senate provided our request.   The additional $15 million would more than
double the IG's Anti-fraud initiative, which was started by the House
Appropriations Subcommittee· last year.

FHA Single Family Property Dispositions.  Failed to provide appropriation
language, which would permit more flexibility to use contractors to
accelerate property disposition.  CBO priced this saving proposal at $400
million. Senate also failed to include this proposal.

FHA Single Family Loan Limit Increase. An amendment, which was offered in
Subcommittee markup, to increase the loan limits was rejected. Senate
included modified version of our proposal.

Administrative Provisions/Savings Proposals.  Continues the objectionalble
language requiring a 3-month delay on reissuing housing certificates and
vouchers. The House provided most of Administration's savings proposals,
including authorizing single persons in the voucher program to pay
efficiency rents and eliminating the shopping incentive for in-place
voucher families.  The Senate did not accept our proposals.
