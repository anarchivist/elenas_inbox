    TEXT:
    Jose suggested I send you our proposed list of speakers for the crime
    event, but we have not actually reached out to anyone yet.   I can be
    reached through Si'gnal, and will be able to work on the speaking program
    and what each speaker will say from my vacation tomorrow.

    Program:
    1. Boston Mayor Menino
    (to talk about Boston's success w/ community policing - and possibly
    announce new crime stats that show a continued decline in crime.)

    2. Boston Police Commissioner Paul Evans
    (to reinforce the importance of the COPS program and praise the
    President's commitment to law enforcement. Massachusetts will be
    receiving many grants being announced at this event.)

    3. Police Corps Graduate from Maryland who enlisted in the program b/c of
    his brother's gang-related death.
    (Massachusetts will be receiving Police Corps grants to create a program.
    Maryland already has a good program and will be receiving funding in this
    wave of grants for their existing program.)

    4. To introduce the President, either:
    Citizen involved in community watch activities with the Police Department,
    who became active because of a personal experience, and/or

    School Resource Officer who can talk about the importance of COPS in
    schools, and who hopefully was able to stop a student crime by being on a
    school campus.

    Sites:
    An advance lead will be arriving in Boston tomorrow and will begin looking
    at possible sites. The Mayor recommended going to the Hyde Park Municipal
    Building where there is square similar to Lafayette park where we could do
    an outdoor event.  This is in Joe Moakley's CD.  (We will need to stay out
    of the 8th CD b/c there are 10 Democratic candidates running for Joe
    Kennedy's seat in this district.) The scheduling office knows this and
·

    they wil'l be looking at the Hyde Park square and some boys and girls clubs
    tomorrow.
