  TEXT:
  After meeting with Daschle's staff, they were OK with 2 changes we had
  vetted with the agencies ( removing establishment limitation for class
  actions and extending the non-retaliation provision to applicants) .
  However, they wanted to push for the third change which was clarifying the
  application of the "catch-all" fourth affirmative defense under the Equal
  Pay Act. This defense allows for pay differences if they are "based on
  any other factor other than sex."    Daschle's office and the women's
  groups want to limit this defense to factors that relate to individual job
  performance. The women's groups have proposed language, and we will work
  with the agencies to see if it is workable. Thanks, Mary

  Subject:         Other Minor Changes to the Daschle bill

 The AFL-CIO recommended a few other smaller changes to the Daschle
 bill.     We vetted them with OMB, EEOC, Labor, Justice, CEA, and NEC who
 have agreed to the following: (1) removing the establishment limitation
 from class actions so that class members don't have to work at the same
 physical location; and (2) extending the non-retaliation provision to
 applicants as well as employees. One other change that even EEOC didn't
 agree with was a change to the fourth affirmative d~fense which would
 limit employers from arguing that they paid women unequally because the
 market permits it. Ellen Vargyas thought we could be seen as telling
 employers how to pay their employees, getting very close to issues of
 comparable worth.   If you are fine with these changes, we could tell
 Daschle's staff.   Let us know.  Thanks, Mary

    3-24-99 Changes to Daschle Bill that we could support:

    Commerce, OMB, EEOC, Labor, Justice, CEA, and NEe have agreed to these changes.


    I.     Eliminate establishment limitation in class action suits. In last year's changes to the
           Daschle legislation, we eased the requirements for class actions suits under the Equal Pay
           Act. Specifically, the Dashc1e bill amends the procedures for filing class actions
           under the EPA to conform with the general procedural rules for filing federal class
           actions in other areas of the law (class members opt out rather than opt in). This
           proposed change would eliminate the establishment requirement for class actions
           which currently requires all class members to work at the same physical location.
           We propose removing this requirement in furtherance of our change last year.

    2.     Extend non-retaliation provision to applicants not just to employees. Last year, we
           supported a non-retaliation provision that prohibits retaliation against any
           "employee" because she has inquired about, discussed or disclosed wage
           information. Title VII prohibits discrimination against employees and
           "applicants." Extending the EPA to applicants would simply mirror Title VII.
           Because most acts made unlawful by the EPA also violate Title VII, this will simply
           assure that persons who proceed only under the EPA are not penalized.

    The agencies, including EEOC, don't recommend the following change:

    3.     Market-based defense. The AFL suggested limiting the scope of the "catch all"
           fourth affirmative defense under the EPA. Under the EPA, a defendant is
           permitted to argue that it pays women unequally because of "any other factor other
           than sex." Case law has prohibited employers from arguing broadly that they pay
           unequally because the market permits it. However, employers have been able to
           argue that the "market value" of this particular employee is less than another.
           Because of the lack of clarity of the case law, the difficulty of drafting legislative
           language, and closeness of this issue to comparable worth, even EEOC recommend
           against this change. EEOC thought that would we could be seen as telling
           business what they should pay their employees and, therefore, be getting into the
           comparable worth issues.
