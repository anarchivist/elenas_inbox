        I am sorry that I have not gotten back to you with more extensive
thoughts.  It is well written and provocative;  My major concern is this:
in the set of values that is articulated (opportunity, community, heart),
what is obviously missing is the key extra element that the President
brought to the traditional liberal litany: responsibility.

           This is more than just rhetoric or political positioning.

        First, it is impossible to understand many of the changes he has
pursued in social policy without the idea of renegotiating the social
contract (the new covenant, even) that underscores it.

        Second, in terms of the report as a document to be read and
understood, without responsibility twinned with opportunity, people seem
like the subjects of scrutiny rather than actors.

        In any case, I think this is a thread that needs to be woven
throughout the document.
