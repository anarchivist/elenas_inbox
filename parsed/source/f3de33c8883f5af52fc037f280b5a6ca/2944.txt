Moore - I made all might calls and I am covering some additional bases ... Mixed reaction on the
advisory board. Generally positive on the iniative itself.. .. 1 am so tired

Lewis - I talked today with: -- the Senate Democratic Caucus, with Attorney General Reno
and Secretary Reno. We had very positive response to the Initiative from Senators. A number
made specific suggestions, including Senator Mikulski who talked about the importance of the
"social glue .. the ties that bind" She urged us to consider ethnicity as well as Race, to appreciate
the need for economic empowerment, and to talk of America as a mosaic. Mary Landrieu joins
in this recommendation. - Senators Kennedy and Feinstein had specific questions to the Attorney
General about the Hate Crimes statute. Senator Feinsetin mentioned the imprtance of positive
images in the media .

Rabbi David Saperstein: Very positive, got a lot of press calls yesterday - I encouraged him to
start returning them -- aware of advisory group and will be supportive.

Outside friends: Mike Berman, Leslie Dach, David Dreier, Jack Quinn, Steve Ricchetti,
Kirk O'Donnell. A positve response - we also went through talking points, themes and the
Advisory Board. They like idea that these are new faces, not usual suspects; think groiwng press
interest very positve fr the President. Made these recommendations:
- in addition to exisitng talking points they could use brief statement of Presidential actions (such
as defense of affirmative action, to remind people he has been working on this) ;
- stick with it ; be steadfast --now that you've told peopel this is so imprtant you have to continue
sustained effort;
- work with Advisors in advance of any "unforeseen" incidents because they will be asked for
response to events.

   Lenny Zakim --office closed for Shavuos

   Eli Weisel -- given the problems on Tuesday night, I think it best if he hears next from the
Presidnet; a draft note is at President's office.
Lovell - wonderful talk with Father Leo; I hadn't realized he was in the meeting with the
President - he said he loved it and it was very moving; he appreciated the heads up on the
advisors.

I added Lerone Bennett to the callist with Maria's OK; he is the Executive Editor of Ebony
Magazine, an historian and author of many books, including Before the Mayflower. He was
very happy to be called and said:" Ifhe can deal with this he'll go down in history - he's gone
further than any other President. It's a great, great effort." Lerone said he would talk this up
among his colleagues; we shouldn't forget to contact Ebony for an articile or interview. Lerone
was especially happy to hear about John Hope Franklin's involvment.




                                                               Automated Records Management System
                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion




     Arthur Schlesinger called back - he was again glad to be consulted - his reaction to the advisors
     was: "no Indian." He said we must hire more than one Native American on the staff.
     Otherwise positive - he said he'd call back with any suggestions as this rolls out. He repeated
     that he would like to see the President talk about the importance of JOBS in the speech - families
     do not stay together without economic security.

     I heard from Cynthia Schneider - a friend of the Clinton's and Vice-Chair of the President's
     Committee on the Arts and the Humanities - that Washington Post reporter Peter Carlson called
     her to discuss presidential commissions - his angle seemed to be that they never do anything.
     Cynthia talked to him about all the accomplishments that occur. Don't know who else he is
     talking to.

     I called Quincy Jones - did not give him advisors names but described initiative - we talked for
     almost 15 minutes; Quincy would like to be helpful and suggested a documentary film be made
     about the whole effort - to send to college campuses and for PBS and for historical purposes. I
     don't know if there is any more room at the speech/lunch in San Diego, but I think he'd be eager
     to go. Quincy said that race is THE issue in US today; race relations are worse than ever; he
     believes McVeigh crime had racial motives; he and Sidney Poitier were saying just a day ago
     that the President is the best person to speak about it; "Bill understands the street."

     Matsui - Also talked to J.D. Hokoyama ofLEAP--Leadership Education for Asian Pacific---he
     like the board and was really enthusiastic about Angela OH.
     These calls have been made:
     KarenNarasaki--National Asian Pacific Legal Consortium
     Daphne Kwok--Organization of Chinese Americans
     Matt Finucane--Asian Pacific American Legal Alliance
     Chancellor Tien
     Ron Takaki--Professor at U.C. Berkeley
     Stuart Kwoh--Asian Pacific American Legal Center of Southern California

     They are all enthused about the Advisory Board and expecially really respect the choice of
     Angela Oh. I expect that the organizations will be issuing favorable press releases.

     Liss - Wanted to give you all feedback from my call to Deval Patrick. He is very supportive of
     President's efforts, and pleased with the names of the Advisory Council. He will be doing BET
     Talk Back Live tonight, and Face the Nation on Sunday. He plans to be supportive, to say that his
     hopes are high for this initiative, and that he wants the President to raise the expectations of the
     country: "great presidents have raised expectations and invited the nation to share those high
     expectations." I shared with him the President's commitment to action, along with dialogue and
     study. I faxed him whatever you have sent us that is for external use. We should consider
     sending him more before Sunday.
spoke to him- less than stars; ; Eddie Williams (didn't know Cook) Joint Center for Policital and
Economic Studies;
Leg - called senators from ad bds states; notified the staff dir. for Labor comm
 a lot of other members called looking for info
Dorothy Height -
needs follow thru very important; any grant money for further study
Also, receiving a lot of calls - Campaign for Human Dignity; want to know what's happeneing

Advisory Board Member's Bios and reconciliation talking points have been faxed to over 250
black leaders across the country. Additionally, it has been faxed to over 300 black clergy
leaders in the U.S.

Chirwa - For starters, I only had a few people to call-- mostly old professors of mine. (I've
been too busy trying to make airline reservations for Board members to do anything so mundane
as talk to prominent people about a crucial issue of our time).

But, the feedback I've received so far:

Glad to see the President is talking about this issue -- think a national conversation is long
overdue and necessary. Most said they want to wait and see how bold the President will be.
Also, everyone said we need to focus each public discussion on a particular issue and race, rather
than "race relations" generally -- e.g. housing discrimination or economic opportunity or
educational disparity. So, we are on the right track there.

Major risk to the endeavor: That we will have this year-long effort and people will talk about
race and some of the conversations will be cathartic and then people will think at the end of the
year that they've been "innoculated" from charges that they haven't done enough to promote racial
healing and thus don't have to continue the conversation. We have to guard against an
inclination to breathe a collective sigh of relief after the year is up and say we've now finally
discussed race enough. This has to be the start of a very long process of healing which should
continue, possibly indefinitely.

Echaveste Left messages (with names of the Advisory Board) for Hugh Price--he was at his
board conference), MArian Wright Edelman, Charles Kamaski (for Raul Yzaguirre--who was
traveling), Henry Cisneros, and Cruz REynoso (also left him message re invitation to speech
and luncheon on 6/14. Judith Lichtman said she was cautiously optimistic but was not wildly
enthusiastice about the board's makeup, esp age. Marcia Greenberger was ok. Jerry Shea for
John Sweeney was not ecstatic about Robert Thomas ofNissan, but thought they (AFL-CIO)
may hold their fire, otherwise thought it was good. Dennis Rivera was positive. Belen Robles of
LULAC was positive but expressed some concern that the effort would not be limited to
black/white relations.
