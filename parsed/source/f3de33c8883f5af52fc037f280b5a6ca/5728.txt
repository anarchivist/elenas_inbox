 TEXT:
.HHS is officially responding to OMB's child support proposal as part of a
 larger budget passback document but here's a summary of their views via
 John Monahan (see below) :

If the most viable option is saving $300 million by imposing fees on
non-custodial parents, it seems to me we could do that without converting
the system to a block grant and forcing us to endure months of grief and
possibly creating unintended consequences;

Where are things in the budget   talks on this issue?


From Monahan:
In short, it is difficult to list all the objections to the OMB proposal.
Among them are the fact (1) that raising such a radical change in the
program
through a last-minute budget decision would be a severe blow to the bi-
partisan process that has served child support well over the last few
years,
(2) the numerous unintended consequences of changing so many funding flows
(many of which offset within states among various agencies, (3) the
blockgranting this program would seem to run contrary to our collective
efforts to impose on states a variety of national programmatic requiremnts
over the past few years.

Perhaps most importantly, blockgranting CSE will
send the wrong signal to state agencies about trying to provide child
support
services to all children in need of them.  Despite OMB's suggestion of
including our incentives proposal in the mix, the most powerful fiscal
incentive, by far, for states will be to make cost-effective recoveries
for
TANF children.  Thus, hard-to-serve TANF cases and non-TANF (which include
many working poor families, as you know) will get less attention in a
world
of a fixed federal payment, and state financial incentives focused on cost-
effective TANF recoveries.
