TEXT:
I am going to submit scheduling proposals for:

OTC Drug Labeling Event
Gun Tracing/Firearms Enforcement Event
Social Promotions Guide Event

Tanya also sent me info. about a possible event on choice in public
education. Do you want me to submit something on that event also?

We have already submitted proposals for the nursing homes event and the
child safety seats event, and Neera tells me we may not be ready on the
parental discrimination bill event. Are there any others you would like
me to submit right now?

Thanks!
