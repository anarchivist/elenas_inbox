Subject: Conversation with Karen Nelson on Hyde Provisions

I spoke with Karen Nelson regarding the letter to the President that you faxed
to us last night. You had a question about the following statement in the
letter: "The Senate Finance Committee attached the same restriction (Hyde
Amendment) to the entire Medicaid program in addition to the Children's Health
Initiative." This statement was not consistent with our understanding of what
was in the language. The following explanation is pretty long, but Karen's
points were complicated.

Senate Medicaid Language

Karen said that the statement refers to the provision in the Senate Finance
Medicaid language that appears on page 55 of the legislation, in the "sanctions
for noncompliance by managed care entities" section.  States may impose
sanctions on managed care organizations that fail to substantially "provide
medically necessary items and services." However, for the purposes of this


sanction authority, the term "medically necessary" shall not be construed as
requiring an abortion be performed for any individual except in the cases of
rape, incest or life of the mother."

She acknowledged that the provision in the SFC Medicaid language does not
really prohibit all Medicaid payments for abortion, it only means that if this
bill language passed, and Hyde language was no longer in the L/HHS
appropriations bill, a State would not be able to sanction a managed care
organization for refusing to provide abortion services (unless that abortion
was necessary because of rape, incest or to save the life of the mother) .

However, she said that the more important point was that the Majority had
changed the definition of "medical necessity" in the Medicaid statute.
Historically, Medicaid coverage of abortion services has ridden on the
interpretation of the term "medically necessary services" to include abortion
services. The term "medically necessary" is not currently defined anywhere in
the Social Security Act, only in regulation.

Karen said that by changing the definition of "medically necessary" to exclude
abortion services in the law (even though it is only for the purposes of
managed care sanctions and is not a blanket prohibition), the Majority is
chipping away at the current regulations which define "medically necessary"
services to include abortion services.  Karen thought that because there is no
statutory definition of what is "medically necessary", courts could point to
this definition in the managed care sanctions section to overturn the
regulation.

She also said that she had heard "fifth hand" that someone was planning to move
to strike this provision on the Senate floor because it violates the Byrd rule.

House and Senate Children's Health Language

I asked her what she thought about the effect of the Hyde Amendment provisions
in the children's health titles of the House and Senate bills.  I indicated to
her that after a preliminary review, staff thought that the Hyde Amendment
language in the children's health titles prohibits the use of the funds
allotted under the new Title XXI for abortion (with exceptions for rape,
incest, and life of the mother) .  Under this interpretation, the Hyde
Amendment language would affect the child health funds allotted under this new
title, whether the States choose to use it for Medicaid or for the other
purposes.

She said that she thought the construction of the amendments in the children's
health titles was not clear. She said that, if it passed, it would probably be
left up to the discretion of lawyers in the Administration whether or not the
prohibition would apply to Medicaid spending under the new title, or just the
new children's grant program.

She said that some could argue that the prohibition applied to all of the funds
allotted under the children's health title, whether the State chooses to use
the funds for Medicaid or a new grant. She said, on the other hand, though,
one could also argue that the title allows states to spend Medicaid funds (from
the Medicaid appropriation) equivalent to the amount of funds allotted under
the new title. Under this scenario, the funds would come from the Medicaid
appropriation, and a State's allotment under the new title would be decreased
by an equal amount.  Theoretically under this scenario, if there was no Hyde
Amendment on the Medicaid appropriation, Medicaid funds spent on children's
health would not be subject to the Hyde Amendment language in Title XXI.

She said that regardless of which interpretation is correct (which she said is


academic at this point}, they will urge the leadership to remove the
restrictions.
