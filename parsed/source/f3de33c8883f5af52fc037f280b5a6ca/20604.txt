TEXT:
I spoke with Gayle Black from OFCCP. The OFCCP started their testing
program in 1995, and so far has run one test: on entry-level banking jobs
in the D.C. area.  They tested 13 banks and then shared the information
with the banks. This was all done in the context of compliance, and there
was no enforcement angle and no sanctions of any kind.   The banks, though
not happy that some discrimination was found, were pleased with the
feedback that they received.   On July 21st, the American Bankers
Association is having a press conference to unveil a guidebook that was
developed in conjuction with the OFCCP and others.  According to Gayle,
the ABA has said that they would be happy to support the use of testers by
the DOL in compliance efforts.

The OFCCP has plans to do other tests in other areas and industries,
however nothing has yet been finalized.  They, like HUD, hired a
not-for-profit organization to run the test, and thus did not themselves
employ testers.
