TEXT:
Cabinet Affairs, at the request of the Justice Department, has submitted
requests for the President, Vice President, and First Lady to attend their
National Summit on Children Exposed to violence. The summit is taking
place in DC on June 22-24, 1999.

They would like DPC to sign on as co-sponsers to the scheduling requests.
Does anyone have a problem with this?
