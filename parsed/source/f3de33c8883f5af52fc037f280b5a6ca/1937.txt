TEXT:
Today I spoke with Torn Hehir at ED about how things are progressing on the
IDEA reauthorization. As you know, Senator LottO,s chief of staff, David
Hoppe,'has convened a bipartisan process involving key House and Senate
staff and Judy Heumann, as well as advocacy groups, to work through a set
of outstanding issues on the bill. The process has been proceeding very
smoothly, and last week there was a members' meeting at which nearly
everyone (including R's Lott, Coats, Goodling, Castle, Riggs, and Graham
and D's Harkin, Miller, Scott, Martinez, and Payne) agreed to vote down
all amendments.  However, there was one fly in the ointment ...

Senator Kennedy showed up late and said that he thought DOJ should have
expanded jurisdiction over IDEA enforcement--that DOJ should have
independent authority, not just when called in by ED (which has happened
once during this Administration), with the implication being that the
Department has not been vigorous enough.   Lott's staff views this as a
deal-breaker, and has contacted ED to ask them to intervene. Heumann has
asked for a meeting on this with Kennedy, which was scheduled then
canceled.  Currently ED thinks it's best to wait for a day or two and see
if things sort themselves out, but if not they will probably get either
Harkin or Secretary Riley to call Kennedy.   Bottom line is that ED
remains very optimistic that there is going to be a good bill for the
President to sign, but the situation with Sen. Kennedy will have to be
worked out first.
