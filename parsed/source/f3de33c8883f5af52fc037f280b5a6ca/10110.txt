 WASHINGTON MYSTICS' STAR NIKKI McCRAY TO UNVEIL HISTORIC NEW
TOBACCO RESEARCH PLANS AND NEW STEPS TO PREVENT YOUTH SMOKING
              IN HONOR OF GREAT AMERICAN SMOKE OUT
                          November 19, 1998

Today, Vice President Gore unveiled new initiatives to help prevent children from smoking,
including a new counteradvertising campaign and a challenge to schools across the country to
adopt model community-based prevention programs. He also unveiled a major new tobacco .
research plan for the 21st century, including $142 million over five years for state and
community-based programs and new transdisciplinary centers for tobacco research.

Celebrating the American Cancer Society's annual Great American Smokeout, the Vice President
joined the American Cancer Society, Washington Mystic's star Nikki McCray, and Secretary
Shalala to urge kids to choose healthy activities, such as sports, rather than smoking. While the
Administration is taking the steps it can to reduce youth smoking, the Vice President emphasized
that Congress must pass comprehensive legislation to stop the 3,000 children who start smoking
each day. Today, the Vice President:

Unveiled Comprehensive Tobacco Research Strategy at the National Cancer Institute
including $142 Million for New Tobacco Research. The Vice President:

·      Launched two major new research initiatives -- funded at $142 million over five years:
       the first funds new Transdisciplinary Tobacco Research Centers that will bring
       researchers from a range of scientific disciplines together to develop innovative research
       approaches to questions such as why children start smoking and effective strategies to
       help them stop; the second funds research on additional effective state and community
       tobacco control interventions.

·      Unveiled NCI's first ever tobacco research implementation plan that will guide tobacco
       use research strategies into the next century. This report documents the ongoing
       problems of tobacco use and outlines new approaches for research in epidemiology,
       genetics, and effective tobacco control efforts.

·      Announced that NCI will hold a meeting with states and community tobacco control
       experts to seek their input on NCI's new investments, collaborate on what experts know
       about effeCtive state and community based programs, provide technical assistance for new
       state programs, and develop strategies for collecting and sharing information as more
       states invest in these programs.

Office of National Drug Control Policy's (ONDCP) Advertising Campaign. The Vice
President announced that ONDCP has just approved nine television advertisements that will run
nationwide as part ofthe National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign launched by General
McCaffrey. This nearly $200 million annual campaign requires a 100 percent public service
"match" by the networks and local stations. The value of the tobacco ads would be $16 million
over the course of the year. These model ads have run in a variety of states and include super
model Christy Turlington and Boyz-ll-Men. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
makes these and other ads available to states and communities throughout the nation.

Called on Schools Across the Nation to Implement Effective School-Based Tobacco
Prevention Programs and Announced That 1-800 Number is Available for Educators and
Parents to Learn About Model Programs. CDC has identified two school-based curriculums
that have proven effective at preventing and stopping youth smoking. Today, the Vice President
called on every school around the nation to adopt effective programs in their schools and
communities. He also announced that parents, educators and community leaders can call a
1-800 number -- 1-800-CDC-1311 -- to learn about these programs.

Reiterated That National Tobacco Legislation Will Be Top Administration Priority for
Next Congress. While a state tobacco settlement may be reached early next week, the Vice
President emphasized that the state settlement is only a first step and the next Congress must still
finish the job. He underscored that enacting national tobacco legislation will be one ofthe
Administration's top priorities for the next Congress. The new Congress has the chance to put
politics aside and do what the last Congress failed to do -- by acting now to prevent three million
children from starting smoking and saving one million lives over the next five years.

Urged Americans to Use Great American Smokeout to Renew Efforts to Prevent Smoking.
Last year 11 million Americans, including 40 schools in the DC area, participated in the Great
American Smokeout. Today, events are being held around the nation recognizing the Great
American Smokeout.
