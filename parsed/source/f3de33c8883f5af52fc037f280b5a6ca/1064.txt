FROM: OMB LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS

DATE: FEBRUARY 27, 1997

SUBJECT:   LEGISLATIVE REPORT


CONGRESS TODAY (2/27):

SENATE:
At 10:00 am, the Congress held a joint meeting to receive President Eduardo
Frei of Chile. The Senate then resumed consideration of the Balanced Budget
Amendment:

Tabled (59-39) the Graham (FL) amendment (7) to strike public debt.

Tabled (61-39) the Kennedy amendment (10), which would have eliminated judicial
impoundment and enforcement

Tabled (69-31) the Feingold amendment (13), which would have given states only
three years to ratify the amendment, rather than seven.

Tabled (60-40) the Feingold amendment (14), which would have allowed Congress
to spend unanticipated surpluses

Tabled (65-34) the Bumpers motion (12), which would have changed the BBA to a
statutory approach

Also today, the Senate passed H.R. 668, the Airport and Airway Trust Fund Tax
Reinstatement by unanimous consent, clearing the measure for the President.
