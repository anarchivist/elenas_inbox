TEXT:
After you walked out, I pitched the idea that we suggest that if the
farmers vote out the program we propose a windfall profits tax on the
companies so that the money companies make because of the reduced price of
tobacco would go back to tobacco farmers and their communities.   Dallas
liked the idea, and I think EBB did ... Dallas thinks its pretty like the
farmers will, in the next year, vote out the program if things continue
this way.

What do you think?
