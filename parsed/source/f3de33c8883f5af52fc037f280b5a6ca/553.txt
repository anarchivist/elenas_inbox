TEXT:
It would be very helpful if we could find some time next week to talk through
the various projects I am working on.  There are a couple of projects in
particular that I would like your sense of how much WH involvement is
appropriate.  For example, I have been pulling together an interagency group on
rural development that was important to Carol, but I am unsure of how it fits
into your vision of DPC's priorities. The group is scheduled to meet again in
about 10 days, and it will be important at that point for me to have a sense of
where we are headed.
