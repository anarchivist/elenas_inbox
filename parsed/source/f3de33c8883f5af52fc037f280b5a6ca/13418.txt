     RE:              ITEM VETO AGREEMENT; LIKELY TO BE ADDED TO DEBT
     CEILING
     ce:   2d Floor. Bradshaw, Moran. Murr, Foley, Angell, Chow,
           Kagin (WH/Counsel), weinstein (DPC)
              Republican item
     o
     -veto conferees and leadership staff have
     arrived at an agreement on item veto legislation (although final
     drafting will occur on Friday). Democratic conferees have not
     been consulted during the negotiations, but Republicans believe
     they have sufficient agreement to report. The Republican
     strategy is to add item veto to the debt ceiling bill the last
     week of March. (We're also hearing that social security earnings
     limit legislation will be added to the debt ceiling.)  Following
     are the outlines of the agreement (based on conversations with
     staff, though we have not seen final language yet) :
             In general, the conferees have tentatively agreed upon the
     House's enhanced rescission model, rather than the Senate's
     separate enrollment approach.  In addition, they would apply item
     veto authority to discretionary BA, new direct spending and
     targeted tax benefits.   They are also using the term "cancel" to
     describe item veto action, rather than the term "veto". All of
     this is good news from our perspective.


         However, several aspects of t.he agreement should concern us:
 o they're including lockbox (i.e. automatic cap reductions) which
   would be a disincentive for using the authority;
 o they're not going to allow partial rescissions (although the
   President could cancel individual projects which are specified
   in report language);                         .
 o the definition of targeted tax benefits is very narrow, i.e.
   100 or fewer beneficiaries;
 o they're reserving to Congress authority to determine what tax
   benefits are subject to cancellation authority;   and
 o they are likely to defer the effective date to 1997.
 Details on specific issues follow:

 1. In whole or in part: Conferees were debating whether to limit
 the authority to canceling provisions "in whole" or permitting
 cancellations "in whole or in part." The compromise they settled
 on was to limit cancellation authority to amounts "in whole," but
 to permit the authority to apply down to the level of any project
 specified in the joint statement of managers, committee report,
 or authorizing legislation. Therefore, the President could
 cancel down to the project level, provided the project is
 specifically mentioned in report language.
 o
 2. Timing of transmittal: The President will have up to 5
 calendar days to submit cancellations.
 (The House had been pushing for transmittal of cancellations
 on the date of enactment, supposedly due to concern about
 permitting targeted tax benefits and new direct spending to
 go into effect on the date of enactment, only to be
 cancelled several days later. However, we convinced Senate
 staff this would not a problem;  in cases, where the time
 lag would be a concern, the President would simply transmit
 the cancellation immediately upon signing the bill) .

 3. Lockbox: Lockbox is still in. The prevailing view was that
 the purpose of the item veto is to save money -- not to permit a
 President to shift priorities.

 4. Definition of Cancellation:    The latest language defines
 cancellation -- with respect to targeted tax benefits and new
 direct spending -- as preventing the direct spending or tax
 provision "from taking legal force or effect." This raises
 potential constitutional concerns.   I passed along to Senate
 Republican staff DOJ's advice that the definition is more likely
 to survive constitutional scrutiny if the word "taking" is
 changed to "having."   (The reason is that preventing a law from
 "taking" effect sounds more like a straight veto, which is
 unconstitutional; preventing a law from "having" effect sounds
 more like a suspension which is a constitutional delegation of
 legislative authority.)   Senate staff understand DOJ's argument
 and will discuss this language change with the House. They're
 also willing to accept input from us for the joint statement of
 managers on this issue.

 5. Definition of Targeted Tax Benefits: The agreement limits the
 scope of the President's authority to cancel special interest tax
 provisions in two ways: first, by adopting the narrow definition
 of targeted tax benefit as a benefit going to 100 or fewer
 beneficiaries; and, second, by giving the tax


     o
     -writing committees
     the authority to specify in their tax bills what is a tax benefit
     subject to the cancellation authority.

     6. Severability:    The non
     o
     -severability provision we had objected
     to has been dropped.   (That provision would have provided that
     if the courts strike down the tax benefit and direct spending
     provisions -- the most vulnerable parts of this bill -- the
     ability to cancel discretionary spending would also fall.)

     7. Effective Date: This is the only substantive issue still
     open; Dole and Gingrich will decide when to make the authority
     effective. Reportedly, they are deciding between making it
     effective in 1997, or making it effective upon the earlier of
     1997 or enactment of a balanced budget.
