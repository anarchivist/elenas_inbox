DRAFT - NOT FOR RELEASE

        (House)




H.R. 221 - Amending the Fair Labor Standards Act to Permit Certain Youth
to Perform Certain Work with wood Products
(Pitts (R) PA and 16 others)

The Administration has deep respect for the cultural and religious
traditions of the Amish and similar communities, and recognizes the
well-intentioned efforts of the bill's sponsors to accomodate these
traditions. The Administration, however, has serious concerns that H.R.
221 could:

expose young workers to sawmills and other hazardous workplace conditions
in the wood processing industry, which has an occupational fatality rate
five times higher than the national private-industry average; and

run afoul of the Establishment and Religion Clauses of the First Amendment.

Pay-As-You-Go Scoring

H.R. 221 would reduce receipts; therefore, it is subject to the
pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of
1990. The Office of Management and Budget's preliminary scoring estimate
is that the net reduction would be insignificant.



* * * * * * * * * *
(Do Not Distribute Outside Executive Office of the President)

This position was developed by LRD (Benton) in consultation with EIML
(Matlack/Bond). TCJS (), OIRA (), the Small Business Administration (),
and the Departments of Labor (), Justice (), and Commerce () have reviewed
the proposed position and have either no comment or no objection.

Legislative History

H.R. 221 was introduced on January 6, 1999. The Education and the
Workforce Committee ordered the bill reported on February 10th, by voice
vote without amendment.  The Committee report was filed on February 26th.

H.R. 221 is identical to legislation passed by the House during the 105th
Congress.

Administration position To Date

On February 9th, 1999, the Department of Labor sent a letter to the House
Education and the Workforce Committee expressing serious concerns about
H.R. 221. Labor stated that "while we are sensitive to the cultural and
religious traditions of the Amish and similar American communities, we
believe the benefits of facilitating those traditions must be balanced
against the NationD,s longstanding concern for the safety and welfare of


children. "

The Department of Justice also sent a letter on February 9th citing
concerns about H.R. 221. Justice's letter stated that the bill would
raise serious concerns under the Establishment Clause of the First
Amendment to the Constitution, arguing that "exemptions from otherwise
generally-applicable prohibitions must be drawn on a religion-neutral
basis in order to pass muster under the Establishment Clause." Justice's
letter stated that where a statutory exception is sought, it should be
"crafted in a manner that is directly related to the alleviation of
burden. "

JusticeD,s letter also raised concerns about the billD,s condition that
minors be supervised by an adult who is a relative or member of the same
religious sect or division.  JusticeD,s letter argues that this "would, in
essence, require sawmill operators to hi!e, as supervisors of the excepted
minors, "members of the same religious sect or division as the [minors) .""
Justice asserts that this would violate the Religion Clauses of the First
Amendment, which prohibit the government from "establishing religious
tests as a condition of employment."

Background

Amish children attend school only through the eighth grade (generally
until age 14 or 15). For the remainder of their adolescent years, they
are expected to work alongside members of their family and community in
order to develop their work ethic and skills.  In the past, this work was
typically agricultural -- work that is generally permitted under the FLSA
for post-school Amish children. As farmland has become more scarce in
Amish areas, however, an increasing number of Amish families in these
areas have turned to non-agricultural businesses such as lumber and wood
processing. The FLSA,   however, prohibits minors from working in
manufacturing, including the wood processing industry. This has led to a
conflict between the Amish and the Labor Department regarding the
application of the FLSA's child labor provisions.

As part of a recent child labor compliance initiative targeting hazardous
industries, the Labor Department assessed penalties on several Amish
sawmills in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Indiana for FLSA violations.
Subsequent to that action, the Amish sought special accommodation for
their sawmills and wood processing operations, arguing that the current
requirements interfered with their cultural and religious practices.  Rep.
pitts, Chairman Specter, and other members of the Pennsylvania delegation
attempted to intervene on behalf of the Amish community through informal
negotiations with the Department of Labor.  Labor,  however, has refused
to make administrative exceptions for the Amish, asserting that the
requested accommodations could not be made under current law.  According
to the bill's sponsors, H.R. 221 would provide a legislative fix to allow
Amish children to work alongside members of their family and community in
wood processing businesses.

Summary of H.R. 221 as Reported

H.R. 221 would amend the FLSA to state that it is not considered
oppressive child labor for an individual who is:   (1) between the ages of
14 and 18 and (2) a member of a religious sect whose established teachings
do not permit formal education beyond the eighth grade to be employed in
businesses that use wood processing machinery, as long as four conditions
are met.  First, underage employees must be supervised by adults who are
members of their family or religious sect.  Second, they cannot operate or


assist in the operation of power-driven woodworking machines.  Third, they
must be protected from flying debris by a barrier or other means.  Fourth,
they must use protective equipment to limit their exposure to noise and
sawdust.

pay-As-You-Go Scoring

According to EIML (Bond) and BRD (Lee), H.R. 221 would reduce receipts;
therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus
Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. OMB estimates that the net effect of
this bill would be insignificant.
