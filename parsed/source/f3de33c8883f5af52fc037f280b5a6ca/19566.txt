TEXT:
Is there really nothing more we could have given the President to help him
prepare, if he chooses to, for the hour-long school violence event.  The
briefing memo has a couple short, general paragraphs and a list of
attendees. The report that was dropped of with it, conversely, was
twenty-something single-spaced pages, but no one thought he should look at
even the executive summary, let alone the rest of it.  Is this the best we
can do with a memo that arrives down here at 9pm?
