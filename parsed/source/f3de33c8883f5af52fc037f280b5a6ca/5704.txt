TEXT:
The following is a brief summary of our meeting with women leaders on the
Child Care Initiative (CCI). Present at the meeting were 20 leaders from
women's, religious, and children's organizations. The groups presented
three major goals for the CCI:

1.      Enhancing quality so that all children receive educationally
sound, nurturing and safe care.
2.      Expanding access to high quality, affordable early childhood
programs for working parents.
3.      Improving training and pay, so that providers are well qualified
and financially able to pursue and remain in the child care profession.


A number of   shared recommendations were voiced by participants including:

1.       CCI must be a priority initiative with sufficient funding and
resources attached to ensure it's success.
2.       CCI must be supported by a budget commitment of at least 20
billion.
3.       A mandatory funding stream and a mechanism that directs funding
for improving safety, quality and affordability is required.
4.       The link between the welfare to Work and the CCI is critical
because sustaining success at work depends on the availability of safe,
quality and affordable child care for working poor parents.
5.       Improve family friendly workplace policies like expanding Family
and Medical Leave to cover workers of mid-size companies and employees who
have not worked long enough with one employer to be eligible, and finding
mechanisms for insurance type funding of paid family leave should be part
of the CCI.
6.       Increase funding for the Child Care and Development Block Grant
so that states can serve low income families.
7.       Improve the Dependent Care Tax Credit by making it refundable,
adjusting the sliding fee scale to serve the neediest parents, and
increasing the claim amount to reflect the real cost of care.
8.       Stregnthen the child care infrastructure which includes strong
licensing standards and enforcement, training, resource and referral and
adequate compensation for child care staff. Key infrastructure strategies
suggestions include: sufficient staff to monitor and inspect programs,
scholarships for caregivers pursuing a early childhood education degree,
increased reimbursement for programs meeting high quality standards, and
improved compensation and benefits to attract and retain qualified staff.
9.       Provide tax credit for businesses who increase and improve child
care opportunities for workers and communities.
