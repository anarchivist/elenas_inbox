TEXT:
This version contains Bruce's changes, a few minor tweaks proposed by
Justice and a more significant change by Counsel's office.  (See fourth
paragraph of statement.)

Counsel had strong concerns about the President endorsing legislation or
stating that legislation is needed on the day of the decision. This draft
asks the AG and Rubin to review the decision and present the President
with options in one week.   From counsel's perspective, this would give
the lawyers sufficient time to review the decision, and determine what
next steps are most appropriate-- as was done with the Adarand case.

If this is a problem, it will need to be worked out with Counsel's
office.   Let me know. Thanks.

                       DRAFT STATEMENT BY THE PRESIDENT


       I am disappointed in today's Supreme Court's decision which rules part of the Brady Law
unconstitutional. The Brady Law has kept 186,000 felons, fugitives, and mentally unstable
persons from purchasing handguns. And I will do everything in my power to make sure that we
continue to keep handguns out of the hands of criminals.

         Today's ruling should not mean an end to Brady background checks. Twenty-seven
states -- nine more than when the Brady Law first passed -- now conduct background checks as a
matter of state law and will continue to do so.

       We expect that the majority oflaw enforcement agencies in the remaining states will
continue to conduct background checks-- not because they are required by federallaw-- but
because that is good law enforcement policy. I have directed Attorney General Reno and
Treasury Secretary Rubin to contact police departments across the country today, to make sure
they know that Brady background checks can continue to be done on a voluntary basis.

       But we should not stop there. Our goal is clear: no background check, no handgun.
Accordingly, I am also directing the Attorney General and Treasury Secretary to review today's
decision and within one week, present me with options, including legislation, on how we can
reach our goal.

        We recently received encouraging news from the Justice Department that last year we
saw the largest drop in violent crime in more than three and a half decades. Murders dropped a
stunning 11 percent in 1996. Our strategy of more police, tougher punishments, and fewer guns
in the hands of criminals is making a difference. But we cannot let up. The safety of our
communities and of all Americans is better assured when Brady background checks are
conducted.
