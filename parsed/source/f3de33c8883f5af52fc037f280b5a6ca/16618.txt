TEXT:
Now that Pat Ruggles is on board at ASPE, I've asked HHS to sit down and
explain their latest plans for use of the $15 million a year for research
and evaluation.  I will have Linda Cooper set up the meeting at a time you
can all make it -- but Bruce and Elena, if you don't make it, I will give
you a report via email.
