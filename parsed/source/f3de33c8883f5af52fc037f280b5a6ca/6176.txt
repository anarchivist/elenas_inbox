TEXT:
There was a flurry of e-mails a couple of weeks ago, in response to
Maria's suggestion that a handful of WH staff go out to California to meet
with people, rather than trying to get 20-25 Californians back east.

I think its a good idea, and that I ought to go.  I don't think I ever saw
a response from you on this; before I reconnect with Maria on this issue,
I wanted to check signals with you. Are you ok with this idea?
