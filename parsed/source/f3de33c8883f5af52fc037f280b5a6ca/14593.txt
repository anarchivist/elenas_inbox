TEXT:
FYI reo the timing of our interagency meeting on early childhood
development,  which is scheduled for Friday at 1:30pm -- the adoption
event just put on the President and First Lady's schedules is from 12:15 -
1:00pm (but may not run on time or may be moved slightly over the next few
days).  It may not be a problem, but I may be late or miss it altogether.
