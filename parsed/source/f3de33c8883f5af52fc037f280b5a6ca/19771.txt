TEXT:
As you know the PIR May Advisory Board meeting on Race, Crime and the
Administration of Justice is taking place on May 19. Attached is a list
of possible participants. Additional names were suggested to us; these
are our top contenders.

We need one presenter for the factual overview and about 8 roundtable
panelists. Keeping in mind our need for gender and racial diversity,
please let me know if there are any panelists you think we should
eliminate or that we should definitely pursue by COB tomorrow, Thursday,
May 7.

Thanks for your input. --Jacinta==================== ATTACHMENT        1 ================
