 TEXT:
 Ford-Hollings-Wyden Update

 We are meeting today with Ford and Hollings staff to make sure we're on
 the same page on the Wyden international provisions (we are).

 Ford and Hollings staff want to get us together with Wyden tomorrow.   For
 tomorrow, we'd like to focus on the least controversial issues (should
 anything leak out for Thursday) :

 Doggett: The so-called "Doggett" language which forbids the use of federal
 funds to promote the sale, manufacture, advertising or export of tobacco.
 We support making permanent the simple Doggett provision, but USTR has
 serious concerns about Wyden's more expansive "Super Doggett" language
 which could prevent the US from negotiating to reduce or eliminate all
 tariffs  (including tobacco tariffs) as part of a larger negotiation and
 establishes an "arbitrary and unjustifiable" standards on which to judge
 whether a country treats the products of one country less favorably than
 another.

 Funding: We strongly support funding both governmental and
 non-governmental efforts (Wyden funds only non-governmental efforts). We
 oppose what is essentially a 2 cent per pack excise tax on all exported
 cigarettes, and Treasury tax policy says it probably violates the U.S.
 Shoe ruling the Supreme Court handed down last week.

 Labeling/Marketing/Advertising: We are also ready to discuss -- but
 thought we should wait until after Thursday -- the labeling, marketing,
 and advertising provisions which would require U.S. firms to apply the new
 U.S. law when overseas.  (The State Department objects to exporting our 1
 aws abroad -- "extraterritoriality" as they call it -- and say they are as
 a practical matter unenforceable.  HHS and State agree that we would do
 more to protect the world's children if we work on a multilateral basis
 through the World Health Organization to encourage other countries to
 adopt similar laws.)

 Other Issues: There are several other issues we will    have internal
 meetings on tomorrow to make sure we have a handle on   them.  They are
 provisions involving military bases, duty free shops,   and international
 anti-smuggling efforts.  Thus, we are not planning to   dicuss with Ford,

Hollings, or anyone else until we discuss internally first.   I'll let you
know how those meetings go.

Waxman Update

Waxman's staff has called DOJ for a technical briefing on the Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act (which probids U.S. companies from bribing officials
overseas and is conceptually analogous to forbiding U.S companies from
engaging in certain marketing and advertising practices overseas).
Waxman's staff also called Treasury to find out what we're thinking
generally on international.  I'm afraid we need to meet with them
probably shortly after we meet with Wyden. What do you think?
