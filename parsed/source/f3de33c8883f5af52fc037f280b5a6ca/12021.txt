 MEMORANDUM TO ELENA KAGAN:

 From:          Irene Bueno

 Subject:       LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS TO PROVIDE PARITY FOR
                SALVADORANS AND GUATEMALANS - Tuesday, March 26 at: TBA

 Introduction

 On Tuesday, 3/30 you are scheduled to chair a meeting to discuss legislative options to provide
 parity to Salvadorans and Guatemalans equal to what the Nicaraguans & Cubans received under
 NACARA. On Monday, 3/29, DOJllNS will submit legislative proposals to you in preparation
 for a Tuesday meeting.

 Background

Under NACARA, Nicaraguans & Cubans who were in the country as of 12/1/95 were permitted
 to adjust their status whereas Salvadorans, Guatemalans, were only permitted to seek hardship
relief from deportation if they filed an asylum application before 12/31/91, were members of the
ABC class and met other requirements. (Similar relief was provided to Eastern Europeans who
filed asylum applications prior to 1992).

We had been exploring legislative options that were drafted by Scott Busby (see attached). Prior
to the Central America trip and before we know where DO] would come out on extreme
presumption, we decided to postpone further discussions aboutiegislative strategy until we knew
more about the presumption and recommended a strategy that the President would express
general support of legislation that provides parity.   However, since DO] will likely announce a
regulation that provides a rebuttal presumption, some Salvadorans & Guatemalans may not
meet the hardship requirement and given the President's very strong statements in support of
legislation that some in Congress interpreted that the President will submit his own parity
proposal, we have resumed our consideration of options.

Legislative Options

The options that DO] will likely propose are:

  1. Provide to minimal parity Salvadorans and Guatemalans who filed asylum applications by
. 12/31/91.
         a. Variations of this proposal include adding Hondurans and Haitians

2. Provide to complete parity Salvadorans and Guatemalans who filed asylum applications by
12/31/95.
       Variations of this include adding Hondurans and Haitians
                                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion

3. Most Generous Proposal- Rep. Guttierrez has introduced a bill that would provide
complete parity for Salvadorans, Guatemalans, Hondurans, Haitians, who were in this country as
of 1995. Eastern Europeans who had filed for asylum by 12/31 would be granted parity as well.
  This is the only legislation that have been introduced on this issue.


Legislative Outlook

Leg. Affairs has been consulting with the Hill re: what this bill would look like. There
appears to be bi-partisan (Hatch, Abraham, Diaz-Balart) interest in some kind oflegislative
package, though many members are pushing for us to do the presumption of extreme hardship
first. The Congressional Hispanic Caucus (CHC) is expecting the President to submit a
proposal but I do not believe that they expect the President's proposal to go as far as Rep.
Gutierrez. I expect that Rep. Smith will oppose anything that is proposed.

Recommendation

I think that this is really a political call. The good policy option is #1 (variation adding the
Hondurans & Haitians). However, there may be political reasons to propose #2 (& its
variations) or even #3.
