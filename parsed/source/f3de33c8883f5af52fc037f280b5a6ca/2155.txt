STATEMENT ON HOUSE AND SENATE COMMITTEE PASSAGE OF INDIVIDUALS WITH
DISABILITIES EDUCATION ACT (IDEA) REAUTHORIZATION LEGISLATION -- DRAFT

I am pleased that today the House and Senate education committees have
taken a major step towards ensuring high quality educational opportunities
for all students.  TodayO,s votes come after much hard work by
congressional Democrats and Republicans alike, along with tireless efforts
by Secretary Riley and the Department of Education.  I am especially
pleased that all of the parties, including representatives of the
education and disability communities, have been working together toward
the goal of maintaining and strengthening our commitment to children with
disabilities and their parents -- a commitment that has made it possible
for so many young people to reach their full potential since IDEA was
first enacted 20 years ago. This legislation is critical to helping
parents and local schools work together in order to strengthen teaching
and learning for students with disabilities.  I hope we can continue in
this bipartisan spirit to pass IDEA and move forward on the rest of our
agenda to improve education and prepare America for the 21st Century.
