TEXT:
The Press Office has asked whether Administration spokespeople should
respond in a substantive way to questions about the Supreme Court's
decision on sexual harassment.  Below are 1) a possible brief answer to
any questions we may get, and 2) excerpts from the Department of
Education's longer response, which may not be as helpful for White House
spokespeople. Counsel's office has initially recommended making no
comment, but the Press Office thinks a brief comment might be helpful .. _
Does any of the language below work for you? Or would prefer to stay with
the Counsel's recommendation of "no comment"? Thanks!

1) Specific questions about this decision should be referred to the U.S.
Department of Education, which has responsibility for administering Title
IX.  However, we believe that this decision clarifies important
protections from sexual harassment under Title IX, by holding school
districts liable if they are "deliberately indifferent to known and
pervasive harassment". The courts have previously provided important
protections for students from sexual harassment by adults, and this
decision makes clear a reasonable standard for holding school districts
accountable for protecting our children from known and pervasive sexual
harassment by their peers.

2) The Supreme Court's decision affirms that sexual harassment in schools
cannot be tolerated.  Under Title IX, schools must provide safe and
non-discriminatory learning environments for all students, and the
President expects that schools throughout the United States will continue
their efforts to prevent harassment from occurring, and where it does
occur, to respond to it in a prompt, reasonable and appropriate manner.

The court's decision neither imposes a national code of student conduct,
nor eradicates the flexibility school official's need in order to maintain
discipline.  Rather, it reinforces that schools need to use their own
common sense and good judgment to stop harassment and other conduct that
prevent schools from being safe places. The U.S. Department of


Education's Office of Civil Rights has co-authored a guide to preventing
hate crimes and sexual harassment, which is available on the Department's
website at www.ed.gov.

Jon/Tanya:

Do you have any take on whether spokespeople who may get q's on our
reaction to the Supreme Court decision on being liable for sexual
harassment in schools should, in light of having no comment on the
specific case (per Counsel's), offer instead, a few general policy
sentences? If so, can I get something? Thanks.
