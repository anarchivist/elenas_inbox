Subject:         revised with Chris's edits



Q.      Today, Senator Graham introduced a sense of the Senate amendment
that would dedicate any settlement funds from the Medicare tobacco lawsuit
towards a prescription drug benefit for Medicare. Do you support this
amendment?

A.       The President applauds the Senator for recognizing the need for
a long-overdue prescription drug benefit.    His amendment is a
constructive contribution to the debate about what are appropriate funding
sources.   The President is committed to designing and financing a
meaningful drug benefit in the context of broader reforms to modernize and
strengthen the Medicare program.
