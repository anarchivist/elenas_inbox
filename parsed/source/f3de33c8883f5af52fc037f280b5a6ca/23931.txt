Maria -

I wanted to thank you for indicating in the IWG meeting that it may be a
good idea for me to staff the VP for the public charge roll-out in Texas
on Tuesday, 5/25.   Please let me know what if anything I need to do to
follow-up to confirm whether I will be going to TX.   Since you indicated
I would need to find my own way back to TX, I have begun the process of
looking into return flights if indeed I am going to TX.

Thanks again.

                                Irene

Maria-

Do you think there is any possibility that I could staff the VP on the
public charge announcement in TX? I realize that both you and Janet are
planning to attend but given my deep interest and background on the issue,
it would mean alot to me.

FYI - We met with VP press staff and have a strategy -    leak for a
Tuesday, VP announcement Tuesday afternoon at issues forum,   follow up
with Latino print roundtable after the announcement,   and I am working
with Janet to confirm Feinstein and CHC involvement in the roll-out     I
have spoken with Feinstein's staff and Janet is speaking with the CHC and
plan to firm that piece up early today.

I will see at the Asian Pacific American briefing later this morning.

Thanks.
                                        Irene
                        Irene
