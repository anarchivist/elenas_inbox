TEXT:
Bruce suggested we try   to reschedule the 10:00 Friday HHS meeting reo
bifurcation because of   a conflict with an immigration meeting (see
below). We need to do    the HHS meeting ASAP though -- we can't push it off
for more than a day or   two, I think.

Elena -- since Cathy is out of the office could Laura try to reschedule
the meeting at a time that works with Bruce/Elena/HHS schedules and is not
between 9:30 and 12:00 Friday? Olivia Golden's assistant Arlene
(401-2337) is the one to coordinate with. Here is the email Cathy sent me
with the WAVES information for the attendees--
