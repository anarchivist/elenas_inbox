TEXT:
1. Education Meeting on IDEA
Sec Riley will meet with the heads of 5 organizations -- NEA, AFT, the
National School Boards, Chief State School Officers and the School
Administrators (Superintendents) tomorrow at 5PM at the Department.

The main purpose of the meeting is to explain to them what·is going-on
with IDEA -- but the Secretary will also talk to them about class size.

2. WH meeting on Class Size
ED continues to push back on the scheduling -- and see Friday meeting
with lobbyist as more effective with the groups, than one tomorrow.   Susan
is going to call you shortly to explain her rationale for Friday.    Her
main points to me were that   (1) ED will talk to the heads of the lead
organizations when they meet with Riley tomorrow (2) we shouldn't take the
lobbyists off the hill to come meet with on Wed, wait until Fri when they
are free; (3) the groups are already working this issue, and we won't lose
time by waiting until Friday and will ensure that we have better turnout.
