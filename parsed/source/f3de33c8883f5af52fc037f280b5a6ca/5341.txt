                          Rejection of Grant Application by Blind Oregon Professor
                                        DRAFT -- November 19,1997

         Background: This spring, a blind physics professor at Oregon State University submitted a grant
         proposal to the Office of Special Education at the Department of Education. The proposal did
         not conform to format requirements established by the Department (it wasn't double spaced and
         used a smaller font). In September, the application was rejected without being considered
         because of the nonconformity. Evidently no effort was made to send the application back and
         provide an opportunity to revise it. The professor says that the application was mistakenly
         submitted in the wrong format by his sighted assistant. Senator Wyden has written the Secretary
         to complain, and stories have shown up in print and on radio, and on this morning's TODAY
         show.

         In response, Secretary Riley has ordered a review of the grant application process, and has issued
         a statement expressing his concem that rules not be "applied so rigidly that they do not meet the
         test of good common sense." In addition, the Secretary indicated that the Department would
         look forward to reviewing the professor's proposal in the context of a new grants process
         beginning next Spring.

         Question:      Does the White House have any comment on why the Department of
                        Education would reject a blind applicant's grant proposal because it wasn't
                        double spaced?

         Answer:        Secretary Riley has ordered a review of this and I would refer you to his statement
                        issued by the Department of Education.                            .
