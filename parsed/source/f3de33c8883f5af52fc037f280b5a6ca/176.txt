 MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT
 FROM:           ??
 SUBJECT:                TEAM ACT LETTER TO CEOS

 Attached is a draft letter responding to 634 CEOs who wrote to
 ask you not .to veto the TEAM Act. This draft is consistent with
 the legislative strategy that was successful during both the
 House and Senate consideration of the TEAM Act. When the Senate
 voted last Wednesday, all Senate Democrats but two (Hollings and


 Nunn) voted against the TEAM Act, and Senator Ben Nighthorse
 Campbell joined the Democrats voting "no."
 The letter articulates the message that was successful in
 Congress, and was articulated in the Statement of Administration
 Policy:   1) the Administration strongly supports labor
 o
 -management
 partnerships; 2) labor management partnerships are flourishing
 under current law; 3) the TEAM Act wouldn't increase or
 strengthen these partnerships but instead would undermine the
 collective bargaining system.  It also points out that the NLRB
 will independently continue to clarify the law in this area.   It
 does not endorse any legislation to change current law.
 Pros:
 ?       Makes a strong statement in favor of labor
 o
 -management
 partnerships and your consistent support of them.
 ?        will not cause unintended consequences in the Congress.
 Constituents who are most concerned about the TEAM Act fear
 that if you make a positive statement about changes to
 ?8(a) (2) of the National Labor Relations Act, you will
 generate renewed interest in finding a legislative
 compromise that you could sign. They point out that the
 alternative Democratic bills have not generated any media
 stories suggesting that Democrats want to amend ?8(a) (2).
 But they fear that presidential support for changes to
 ?8(a) (2) is a different matter and will create momentum that
 will lead to actual changes in the law. They believe that
 any changes to

 ?8(a) (2) risk making it more difficult for employees to
 organize new workplaces; and so they believe any such
 changes are tantamount to an assault on the right of
 employees to organize unions.
 As an immediate matter, the House has yet to. vote on the
 Senate version of the TEAM Act. Any positive presidential
 statements about amending the law prior to that vote could
 potentially lead to the same problems outlined above.
 ?        Maintains a balanced approach to labor policy. While the
 NLRB estimates that an average of three businesses per year
 are ordered to disband labor
 o
 -management committees due to
 violations of 8(a) (2), it estimates that XX thousand
 businesses are found guilty each year of illegally firing
 employees because they support unions.   It would appear
 unbalanced to address the business community's concerns
 without also addressing related employee/union concerns
 which also undermine cooperation in the workplace.
 ?       will not generate criticism from the labor movement.   The
 AFL
 o
 -CIO views this issue a threat to employees' ability to
 organize -- the very essence of the labor movement. Their
 sentiments on this issue are even more intense than their
 sentiments about NAFTA.
 Cons:
 ?       If this issue takes on a larger symbolic prominence in the
 public debate, we will be hard pressed to explain why you


 are not supporting an alternative bill supported by 202
 Democratic House Members and 37 (check) Democratic Senators.
 ?       Some in the business community argue clarification is needed
 and this letter addresses that concern merely by noting the
 NLRB's ability to clarify the law.
 ?       Could be viewed as giving in to labor constituents' demands.

 Alternative
 The attached letter could also be amended to include a paragraph
 stating that to the extent some employers are reluctant to use
 labor
 o
 -management cooperation efforts due to confusion about the
 law, you would welcome reasonable clarifications to the law,
 along the lines of the Democratic bill in the Senate.  The
 advantage of this approach is it addresses the problems outlined
 in the "cons" section above, enabling you to state that you, like
 the many Democrats who voted for the bill, are in favor of
 legislative changes that facilitate labor
 [J
 -management

 partnerships.  The disadvantage of this approach is that it
 negates all but the first "pro" outlined above, potentially
 leading to unintended congressional results and definitely
 leading to harsh criticism from supporters.
