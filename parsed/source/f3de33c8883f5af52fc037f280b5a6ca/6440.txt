Dear Mr. President:

       I am pleased to be able to provide you with an overview of the key issues and
recommendations which emerged from your Advisory Board's two days of
meetings in Phoenix, Arizona on January 13 and 14th; 1998. I will briefly
highlight the key findings and reactions which I and other Board members had as
well as our recommendations.

       The subject of the two days of meetings was Race in the Workplace. We
used the opportunity to visit several promising practices in the local area as well as
to convene a major panel discussion with experts on the subject of disparities and
opportunities in employment. We also convened, for the first time, a Community
Forum which permitted residents from the Phoenix community to share their race-
related concerns and recommendations with the Board. Each of the meetings and
activities we engaged in were successful in pointing towards improved approaches
to and strategies for equal opportunity and racial reconciliation.

         Central to our findings and appreciation of race in America are the major
ways in which all racial minorities experience some basic and comparable racial
disadvantages, such as discrimination in employment, and the concomitantly strong
commitments all persons of color have to achieve and succeed. There is firm and
lasting commitment to the ideals of equal opportunity even amongst those long
deprived of its fill realization and a powerful commitment to the goals of civil rights
for all.

        We were, once again, struck by the incredible commitment, pride, and energy
which the young people of America, including representatives of all minority
groups, make to the issue of racial progress and achievement. For example, at the
Opportunities Industrialization Center in Phoenix we met individuals from the
Latino, American Indian, and African American communities who have made
effective use of job training programs to make significant economic progress in
their lives.

      Virtually all of the people with whom we met stressed that truly effective job
and career training requires counseling efforts aimed at addressing the professional
                                               Hex-Dump Conversion

needs and deficits of each client. Employment training and counseling appears to
be most effective when the total circumstances and needs of the individual and their
family are considered and addressed. In addition, it is critical that the design of
such programs be sensitive to the different strengths and needs which different
racial and ethnic communities can bring to such programs. While there are of
course substantial commonalities among all racial and ethnic groups, there are
some notable differences in the ways in which neighborhood associations, churches,
and other non-profit groups work to assist local clients in their search for improved
employment training and opportunities. Given the critical importance of
welfare-to-work training programs, I am sure that agencies such as the Department
of Health and Human Services and the Department of Labor are planning
evaluations of the relative effectiveness of various employment training programs
for different minority and immigrant communities that will highlight the
commonalities and, where they exist, the differences in their training needs.

       We were also impressed by the powerful role which television and the media
in general play in creating perceptions and biases about race which affect workplace
opportunities. A black fireman in Phoenix, for example, told us that when he
joined the Department, 26 years ago, he was the first minority person his
co-workers had ever met and that the only images they had of blacks were
previously gained through movies, television, and rumors. Programs that were
established to help integrate employment settings in Phoenix have served to dispel
some of the misperceptions and myths carried through the media about people of
color. The steady progress which the Phoenix black firefighters union has made in
advancing an affirmative employment position in Phoenix is a credit to the city.

       The meeting we held with regional American Indian tribal leaders
highlighted for us the powerfully important difference which their sovereign status
plays in thinking about economic development options. There is a clear feeling that
one of the major forms of racism that American Indians experience is a result of the
lack of respect, in both the public and private sector, for their governments. Of .
particular concern to us is the considerable difficulty which tribes interested in
economic development and access to credit continue to face, even today, in gaining
access to credit and investment resources due to confusion by investors about the
jurisdictional rules or conditions for adjudicating mortgages and foreclosure
procedures. It appears imperative for the Bureau of Indian Affairs to make every
effort to address this issue through the voluntary cooperation of major lenders and
secondary market actors, including Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Memoranda of
Understanding could be executed with major tribal associations, as well as
                                               Hex-Dump Conversion

individual tribes, which foster the necessary long-term process of building
programs to inform and educate investors and lenders about the .range of realistic,
culturally sensitive lending and investment opportunities available in Indian
Country.

       The Advisory Board is concerned by the complexity and persistence of
disadvantages in Indian country. We ask that you recommend that the Bureau of
Indian Affairs fund a major, independent assessment ofthe fairness and
effectiveness of all federal program resources intended to assist tribes and Alaska
Native villages with their economic future. This assessment should also address
the possibility that a single centralized, independent agency might provide a better
method of resolving the high levels of poverty and disadvantage in Indian country
than the current system which divides program responsibilities among several
federal agencies, such as the Department of the Interior, the department" of Housing
and Urban Development and the Indian Health Service.

       We began our meetings on January 14th with very useful information on race
and the labor market presented to us by Dr. Janet Yellen. Dr. Yellen provided us a
compelling portrait of both improvements and continuing disparities affecting most
minority groups. One clear shortcoming of the data presented was the lack of
systematic information on many key measures for Asian Americans and American
Indians. The information Dr. Yellen was able to make use of, from the U.S.
Census and other Federal surveys, is based heavily on data from African-Americans
and Hispanics, but lacks systematic information on many key measures of the labor
market, income, and other socio-economic characteristics for Asians and American
Indians. We therefore recommend that all Federal statistical data gathering
agencies make every effort to create large enough periodic samples of all minority
groups so that post censal information on race is systematically available for all
groups. This could be achieved by over-sampling Asians and American Indians as
part of such key annual data series as the Current Population Surveys.

       Following Dr. Yellen's presentation, we held a spirited, analytic discussion
of Race in the Workplace involving such experts as Glenn Loury, Harry Holzer,
Paul Ong, Jose Juarez, and James Smith, as well as program directors such as
Claudia Withers, from the Washington Fair Employment Council, and Ms. Lorenda
Sanchez, of the California Indian Manpower Coalition. All of the speakers agreed
that racial and ethnic discrimination continues to playa role in limiting people's
ability to obtain employment. They also agreed that this fact points to the need for
increased or strengthened enforcement by such agencies as the Equal Employment
                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion

OpportunitY Commission and the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs
at the Department of Labor. We commend you for your recently announced
increase in funding for these two agencies and their testing programs. We also
commend and support the forthcoming conference on racial discrimination and
testing in the areas of employment, housing, credit and other areas of social life to
be convened on March 6, 1998 by the Urban Institute, with funding and support
fromHUD.

       We ended our two days of meetings with a very useful forum which
permitted local residents to express their fears, anger and concerns about a variety
of race related issues of local concern. We in particular learned of an on-going
investigation of allegations of mistreatment of American citizens of Hispanic
descent by the Immigration and Naturalization Service and local police in Chandler,
Arizona. This investigation is, I understand, still several weeks away from
completing its initial report but we are certain the Justice Department will carefully
and fully investigate this case and will make general policy recommendations that
will help avoid the actual or perceived misuse of police and Border Patrol
authority in the future.

      My best wishes.



                                       Yours truly,
                                       John Hope Franklin
