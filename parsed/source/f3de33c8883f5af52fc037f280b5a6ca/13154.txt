TEXT:
I sent these to Melinda a few minutes ago, but you're right and
I'm wrong about deleting the caveats on our constitutional
argument.
Thanks for working with OLC -- the new draft was much much better.

TEXT:
I concur in all of Steve's comments.
I also have the following concerns:
p. 2, last graph of minor mothers argument:   This graph (which
begins "The provisions also might be challenged ... ") should be
deleted. This is a much weaker legal point, and I don't think we
should be arguing for some constitutional right to have children
outside marriage.
p. 5, both graphs:   I strongly agree with Steve that it's
ridiculous to argue the other side's case here. Both these graphs
should be dropped.
p. 10, item 4 (battered individuals): This is a policy issue, not
a legal one -- and I don't agree with their position. The last
version I saw of the SSA views letter actually argued that this
provision should not apply at all to SSI. There is no legal
reason to make the provision mandatory, and it might have the
perverse effect of letting any absent father know that the surest
way to stop a woman from naming him as the father of her child is
to beat her up.
Thanks.
