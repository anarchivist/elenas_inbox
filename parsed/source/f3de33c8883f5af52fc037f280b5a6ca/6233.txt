TEXT:
Elena,

I spoke with Danny Werfel at OMB.  Two agencies (Treasury and Commerce)
have raised concerns to Sally re: the proposed rule.  Commerce is still
concerned about (1) the provision that allows pre-complaint attorneys'
fees and (2) that the offer of resolution does not go as far as the old
offer of·full relief. They were told that the only thing that would hold
up the rule would be a call from the Secretary by COB today.  Treasury
said they wanted more time for higher level people to consider the
changes, and Sally gave them until COB tomorrow.  Danny thinks that the
rule should be ready to go by the end of this week.

If we wanted to do some sort of roll-out event (highlighting the reforms
to the federal sector program at the EEOC as a companion effort to the new
money and expanded adr in the budget), that could give Sally an opening to
push the agencies faster and, according to Danny, could get the rule
published more quickly.

Julie
