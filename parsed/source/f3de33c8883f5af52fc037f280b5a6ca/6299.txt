TEXT:
Erskine has requested a memorandum updating him on auto choice/no fault
insurance. John Orszag and I are working on a informational memorandum
that could be submitted to him next week.  I hope we, have a draft to you
by next Wednesday.

In addition, we met with' Morley W. on Thursday to discuss auto choice.
Morley thinks supporting no-fault is a mistake.    It can be characterized,
in his view, as adopting the same system that exists in New Jersey (which
has the highest rates in the country) and which would hurt women drivers
while helping bad drivers. His points are well taken. Having taken a
closer look at the data .. neither Orszag nor I can see any significant
trend that indicates that states that have moved to no-fault system have
experienced significant declines in auto insurance rates.

Morley suggested a new anti-fraud idea. Putting a V-Chip in new car
odometers so that insurance companies could check the mileage without a
trip to the insurer or having mileage charges at the gas pump. This would
give insurers an incentive to lower rates to drivers who drive less.

There are problems. Would require new regulations or maybe even
legislation, would cost automakers money, would sound big brother like
(although less than are other options). Still, the idea is worth
exploring.
