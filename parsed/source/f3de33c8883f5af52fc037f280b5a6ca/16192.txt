EK -- Here are the entries for the weekly you requested.   I'm not sure if
I have the crack piece 100% right. jciii

Brady Follow-up -- On Wednesday, July 16th, the Attorney General and
Secretary of the Treasury will host a meeting for law enforcement
representatives from the national organizations and the 23 Brady states.
We hope to accomplish the following:   (1) to brief law enforcement on the
Supreme Court's decision and issue guidance on how they can continue to
conduct background checks; (2) to get county and/or state law enforcement
agencies to agree to do background checks for the handful of local
jurisdictions that have stopped doing them; and (3) to discuss and seek
support for legislation that makes clear that states, unless expressly
prohibited by state law, have the authority to conduct background checks.
This legislation is necessary because the NRA is challenging the authority
of 19 of the 23 Brady states to continue to conduct Brady checks. As you
know, the attorneys general in Arkansas and Ohio are claiming that they do
not have the authority under state law to do Brady checks.

Recommendations on Crack Cocaine Sentencing -- We have met with the
Justice Department and ONDCP to discuss how to unveil their
recommendatations on crack cocaine sentencing. At the recommendation of
Senators Biden and Kennedy, our initial goal has been to keep the Senate
Judiciary Committee from taking up ill-advised amendments to simply drop
the threshold for powder cocaine during the mark-up of the juvenile crime
bill. To this end, Justice has spoken with Senator Abraham, and it looks
as if he will not offer his amenment. Afterwards, Justice and ONDCP will
take the lead in reaching out to members of the Judiciary Committees,the
Black Caucus and law enforcement representatives.  If they can build
enough support for their recommendations, we will.try and offer attach to
the juvenile crime bill when it is considered on the floor of the Seante
this fall.
