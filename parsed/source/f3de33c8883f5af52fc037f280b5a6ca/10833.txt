TEXT:
Bruce may want to add a line about what Gov. Hunt said to him for the
weekly item.

Tobacco Farmers.

The four largest cigarette companies agreed Thursday to set up a $5.15
billion trust fund to help tobacco growers who face a shrinking market due
to the state settlements that raised the price of smoking and is expected
to reduce demand.  The companies had agreed to meet with state officials
to discuss the trust fund for farmers as part of the $206 billion state
settlement last November. There are many details still to be worked out,
but it was announced the funds would be distributed over 12 years.   During
the fund's first year, the companies would put in $380 million, (Philip
Morris has already contributed $300 million, the bulk of the payment) .
The second year, the companies would deposit $280 million; the third year,
$400 million; years four-10, $500 million a year; the 11th year, $440
million; and the 12th year, $150 million. Gov. Hunt, who helped spearhead
the effort,  said each state will receive a share of the fund equal to the
amount of tobacco it grows. The eleven participating states are North Ca
rolina, Ohio, South Carolina, Tennessee, Alabama, Florida, Georgia,
Indiana, Kentucky, Virginia and West Virginia.  News stories quoted
Governor Hunt as stating: "We all leave here today winners with a
positive outlook for a measure of financial assistance for our tobacco
farmers."   Bruce Reed spoke with the Washington Post congratulating
Governor Hunt and other state leaders for this positive step and
reaffirming the Administration's commitment to protecting tobacco ,farmers
and their communities. USDA will issue a similar statement.   We have also
spoken with leaders of some of the leading tobacco farmer organizations to
explain recent Adminstration proposals and our continued commitment.    The
farm groups have expressed concern that a federal suit and new federal tax
will further decrease demand for tobacco, but privately acknowledge that
the threat of further federal action has thus far probably aided their
efforts in negotiating the $5 billion trust find.
