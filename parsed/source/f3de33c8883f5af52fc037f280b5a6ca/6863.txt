TEXT:
In an effort to energize minority and religous communities on tobacco, we
suggest getting Dr. Saatcher to author an op/ed. One targetted directly
to minorities re the special advertising, killing minority youth and how
minority communities have to press for comprehensive tobacco--on the faith
side it needs to focus on kids dying, targetting of low-income, need for
legislation and maybe make reference to resources for childcare  (maybe).
How do we get this done? We are working with specialty press to get this
placed--and we also need anything HHS could provide on data that would be
relevant to minorities or the faith community.
