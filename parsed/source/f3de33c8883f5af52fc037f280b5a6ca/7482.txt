TEXT:
Elena,
The meeting with high-tech human resources VPs went well.  Sally clearly
communicated our desire to work with them to develop legislative language
that meets our goals (targeting to skill shortages and protecting U.S.
workers), while not being either too burdensome on employers or too
difficult for DOL to administer. The companies have agreed to try to
draft some language (particularly on the lay-off and job contractor
provisions) that would both capture the bad actors and work effeciently
for the good actors.

Many in the room seemed to agree with our goals, but appear to be looking
for confidence on the details.

The last I knew, House Judiciary mark-up is scheduled for next Wed.   The
Abraham bill may still go to the floor next week.

Julie
