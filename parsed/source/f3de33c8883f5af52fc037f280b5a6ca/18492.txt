              We attach a copy of the agenda for the President's Advisory
Board meeting on race and poverty in the San Francisco Bay area. With
Judy's approval, we have indicated the roles which we hope that Secretary
Cuomo will contribute to at the meeting on February 11th. He is of course
most welcome to join any of the activities planned for the two days.

His role includes offering a major, keynote address on the morning of
February 11th and then joining the Advisory Board the same morning to
listen to, and ask questions of, a panel of experts on the issues of race
and poverty.  Please note that Former HUD Secretary Jack Kemp will be
invited to be a panelist for the discussion for which Secretary Cuomo
would be in attendance

We very much hope that you can encourage the Secretary's staff to include
this meeting on his agenda    We look forward to hearing back from you
soon. John Goering

                       President's Advisory Board On Race
                     Northern California, February 10-11, 1998

Theme: Race and Poverty in America

The purpose of this meeting is to examine the relationship between race, poverty, and public
policy in both urban and rural America. We will explore why, despite important
improvements, minorities remain most impacted by poverty, examining the link between race
and poverty. For example, from 1960 through 1990, the poverty rate for African-Americans
has been significantly higher than for any other racial group. The poverty rate for Hispanics
and Asian Pacific Americans in 1990 were, however, higher then they were in 1969. Further,
we will examine the need for and effectiveness of public and private sector responses to the
persistence and concentration of race-based poverty, including breaking the well-documented
cycle of poverty. Recommendations made thirty years ago by the Kerner Commission in
addressing race will be reviewed for their relevance. We will identify some promising
practices aimed at reducing poverty in minority communities including SBA, housing and
community development projects.

Key Questions:

·   To what extent are poverty and race related? Is there a link between race and concentrated
    poverty?

·   What are the main causes of continuing and concentrated poverty among whites and
    minorities? Does discrimination continue to effect opportunities for minorities to move
    out of poor, segregated neighborhoods? What are the connections between racial isolation
    and poverty and how can we alter the negative aspects of these connections?

·   What governmental and non-governmental programs and policies are most effective in
    addressing minority group poverty and racial segregation? Should such policies and
    programs differ in order to address the distinctive position and needs of different
    raciaVethnic groups? How should they do this?

9:40 am - 11 :45 am: Poverty and Race: The Facts and Causes

HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo will be invited to participate in the morning panel with the
Advisory Board. This round table discussion will bring together national experts to discuss if
there is a link between race and poverty, as well as the status and causes of continuous and
concentrated poverty in urban and rural communities. Economic inequality and race will be
assessed as will the role of housing discrimination and how it limits opportunities to move out
of'ghetto' neighborhoods. The key controversies have been the extent to which the causes are
racial or non-racial and the extent to which the poor themselves bear responsibility for the
continued impoverishment.
