TEXT:
I sent the revised timber rider modification letter to DOJ and
talked to Peter about it. Ted is on furlough and he wants Ted to
look at it, so he's going to ask him to come in tommorrow.  I'll
be on furlough tommorrow, so I asked that any communications from
Justice go directly to you.
If you come to closure on item #2, would you please get the
revised language to T.J. 's office? He hasn't heard anything about
this - frankly, I think he would consider it a technical change.
I'm not sure which of his staff actually have the language on the
machine - I think Cogswell, but I'm not sure. Anyway, I don't
know the status of any meetings he has sCheduled on this, but I'd
like to make sure he has a revised page before he hands out any
more specific language.
Thanks.  Feel free to call me at home Lp6/(b)(6)        L

having said that, I will actually be out of bot~e and office
much of the day tommorow - but I'll check in at home via voice
mail.
