TEXT:
Goodling's staff told ED this morning that Goodling will mark-up a reading
bill on wednesday, and that it will contain provisions that the
Administration will not like. Our best guess on this is that the bill
will contain a provision prohibiting national tests.

Further, Goodling is planning to attend the America Reads event with POTUS
tomorrow. That should make things quite interesting.

None of us has had a chance to figure out what to do about any of this
yet; I'm on a conference call with Shireman, Rasco, Smith and others to
sort out generally where we are on America Reads.
