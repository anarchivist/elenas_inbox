TEXT:
As Tanya and I continue to manage issues in the post-Mike transition, we
thought it might be helpful for us to attend whatever weekly and/or ESEA
mtgs you have with the Education Department.

What do you think of this? If you think it's a good idea, could you have
Cathy include us on the distribution list for meeting
notices?                        -- Jon and Tanya
