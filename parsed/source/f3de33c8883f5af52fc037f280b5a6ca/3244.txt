TEXT:
Jordan said Michael Waldman heard we might include a statement on fair
labor standards in the radio address.  I believe we decided yesterday
Hilley would need to decide whether this helps or hurts our Hill
strategy. will you talk to him?

Stacey Grunmantold Diana that DOL has their options ready, they're
complicated, and they're wondering if they can brief Hilley directly.
(This via voicemail -- Diana is out today.)  What do you think? We did do
a similar briefing on legal immigrants several weeks ago with him.
