    TEXT:
    Thought you might find this interesting.     It's an editorial from last
    Sunday's Baltimore Sun (1/24/99).

    AIDS initiative lacking
    Needle exchange: Missing component will make it more difficult to reach
    national objectives.
    AN INGREDIENT is missing in the Clinton administration's $156 million
    campaign to reduce AIDS cases in African-American and Hispanic
    communities. The plan does not fund needle exchange programs such as the
    one that has operated successfully in Baltimore since 1994.
    That's despite the Department of Health and Human Services' acknowledging
    the effectiveness of such programs in slowing the spread of HIV without
    increasing illegal drug use.
    The White House initiative directs money to HIV prevention programs, more
    drug treatment slots and local health departments that treat the medical
    needs of their AIDS populations.
    The president's campaign responds to data showing that the percentage of
    African Americans among new AIDS cases has jumped from 25 percent to 45
    percent since 1986. Among Hispanics, the percentage has increased from 14
    percent to 22 percent.
    AIDS is the leading killer of black men ages 25 to 44. The grim statistic
    is in part a result of intravenous drug use and of illicit sex in prisons,
    where the population is disproportionately African American.
    The White House initiative could free up local funding for communities to
    pay for their own needle exchange programs. But local efforts aren't
    likely to have the same support or impact as a national program to provide
    clean needles to addicts.
    The Baltimore program has distributed nearly 2 million syringes to more
    than 7,000 addicts in five years. Dr. Peter Beilenson, the city'S health
    commissioner, says studies show the AIDS transmission rate among
    needle-exchange participants is 40 percent lower than among the general
    addict population.
    Baltimore's success should not be ignored by a federal government
/-




     searching for new ways to fight AIDS. Mr. Clinton deserves commendation
     for expanding the fight against AIDS, but for maximum impact he needs to
     add needle exchange to the public health arsenal.<P
