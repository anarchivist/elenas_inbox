TEXT:
The language that follows is proposed as the opening text and statement of
position for ED's draft conferee letter on HR 6.  It contains replacement
text proposed by OMB (Barry White/ with Barbara Chow's concurrence).
Please opine on who should be delivering the "threat" (ED proposes it be
the Secretary; the alternative would be senior advisers.").  Note:   ED has
suggested that the opening position not use the "veto" word, but rather
the "not recommend signature" formulation below.   Please give me your
reaction to this language by 10:00 a.m., tomorrow, Wednesday, August
5th.   Thanks.

Rev. August 4, 1998

I am pleased that versions of H.R. 6, a bill to reauthorize the Higher
Education Act of 1965 (HEAl, have passed both the Senate and the House,
and I greatly appreciate the hard work that you and your staff have
devoted to this important legislation.  I am especially pleased that both
bills have adopted the student interest rate on new loans at the level
proposed by the Vice President last winter.  This will help students
manage better their postsecondary education debt and thus make college
more affordable.

We now have the opportunity to work together during the conference
deliberations to enact a strong bipartisan bill that will help more
Americans prepare for and gain access to college, improve teacher
recruitment and preparation, and promote better program management.  In
this work, we must all keep our focus on the goal of producing legislation
that is grounded in sound educational and fiscal policy to provides
maximum benefits to students. That is the ultimate purpose of the Higher
Education Act.

This letter and its attachment highlight the issues in the HEA
reauthorization that are of particular importance to the Administration.
They include issues such as: ensuring that the bill is fully paid for and
there is no risk of a government-wide sequester; ensuring that there are
adequate funds available to administer effectively both the Federal Family
Education Loan Program and the Federal Direct Student Loan Program;
maintaining a key aspect of the nationD,s commitment to raising the
quality of teaching and learning -- the ability of the National Board for
Professional Teaching Standards to continue to test teachers against
tough, high standards by continuing to offer master teacher certification;
offering borrowers the same low interest rate on consolidation loans in
FFEL and FDSL; and others.  I am confident that the issues presented by
the bills now in conference can be resolved to our mutual satisfaction.   I
must inform you, however, that if the Conference approach to these issues
does not serve students well, and if the Conference should incorporate
other provisions that are unfavorable to students, then [the PresidentD,s
senior advisers?] [I?] would not be able to recommend that the President
sign HR 6.
