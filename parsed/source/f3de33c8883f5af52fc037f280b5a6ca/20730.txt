     TEXT:
     This is the latest version of the Vacancies letter with a senior advisers
     veto recommendation to be signed by Erskine Bowles. WHLA plans to send
     the letter c.o.b. today.  please provide comments/clearance no later than
     4pm today.  Thank you.

     Dear Senators Lott and Daschle:

             I would like to take this opportunity to express the
     AdministrationD,s views on S. 2176, the D&Federal Vacancies Reform Act of
     1998". The Administration cannot support this legislation in its present
     form.  If the bill is not amended to address the AdministrationD,s
     concerns, the PresidentD,s senior advisers would recommend that he veto
     the bill.

             We believe that there are genuine differences of op~n~on about the
     applicability of the Vacancies Act, but some of the changes proposed in
     the legislation are acceptable. For example, we would agree to making it
     generally the exclusive governing statute. We believe that this change
     alone largely addresses the concerns raised most cogently by Senator Byrd.

             Other aspects of this legislation, however, are extremely
     problematic. Let me articulate a few examples of what we see as very
     serious problems.


              First, the legislation too narrowly limits who can serve in an
    ·O&acting08 capacity.   Limiting the acting officer to O&the first
     assistantC8 or another D&PAS08 appointee will only result in leaving many
     positions vacant, since many first assistant slots may also be vacant and
     because of the impracticality of one PAS performing the duties of another,
     in addition to or in lieu of (thus creating another vacancy) his own.
    Given the constrained time period of the Act, this provision is too
     narrowly drawn.   This legislation could actually prohibit a President or
    agency head from appointing the most qualified person to the acting
    position. For example, if the most qualified and appropriate person to
     serve in an acting capacity is a career employee with vast experience at
     the agency, then this bill would prevent the career employee from acting
     in the position.

            Second, this legislation could allow seriously harmful
    situations. After 150 days, the bill requires that the position in
    question be vacant, until a nomination is made.  For a position involving
    critical duties pertaining to national security, criminal law enforcement,
    public health and safety, or stability of financial markets, such a
    vacancy could have perilous effects. The complicated procedures in the
    bill that absolutely disable particular positions from taking binding
    legal actions would have seriously disruptive effects on the functioning
    of the Government.  Some workable safety valve should be provided so the
    smooth functioning and effective continuity of government is assured.

             Third, experience teaches us that at the beginning of an
    administration, longer time periods than those provided for in the bill
    are needed to fill the positions of the government. Without this change,
    it could be extremely difficult for future administrations to get up and
    running.

            Finally, let me make one additional and serious point.  It is
    impossible to evaluate fully the merits of this legislation without
    considering the larger context of the nominations process.  It is
    troubling that the Senate would so severely restrict the AdministrationO,s
    ability to fill vacant positions and do the peopleD,s business while at
    the same time confirming the PresidentD,s nominees at an astonishingly
    meager pace. This President has made every effort to accommodate Senators
    who have strong views about particular positions and nominees, and, in
    addition, this President has used his constitutional authority to make
    recess appointments much less frequently than his predecessors.
    Nevertheless, a number of Senators have engaged in an unprecedented degree
    of politics in delaying even our most qualified and needed nominees.
    Nominations are routinely held O&hostageD8 for reasons totally unrelated
    to a nomineeD,s qualifications.  In addition, undue delays are caused in
    the nominations vetting process when Senators sometimes late in the
    process voice opposition to a proposed nominee or support a previously
    unconsidered candidate.  It is important that Senators consider this
    larger context in evaluating the merits of S. 2176.

            We understand the genuine interest   in passing legislation in this
    area and we would be willing to support a    fair and workable bill. We
    cannot, however, support a bill that would   have a severe and damaging
    impact on the ability of the government to   do the peopleD,s business.

                                                      Respectfully,


                                                      Erskine Bowles
