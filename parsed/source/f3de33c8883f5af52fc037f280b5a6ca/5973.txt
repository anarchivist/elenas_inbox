Clinton Seeks to Boost Education

                            By Robert Greene
                            AP Education Writer
                            Tuesday, January 13, 1998; 3:54 p.m. EST

                            WASHINGTON (AP) -- Emphasizing education for the
                            second straight year, President Clinton will seek
billions of
                            dollars to hire tens of thousands of new teachers
and build or
                            repair schools, with a focus on poor and rural
areas.

                            The school construction proposal would cost at
least $5 billion
                            and the teacher proposal easily in excess of
that. Clinton also
                            will request at least $200 million to boost
spending for bilingual
                            education, education aid for migrant children and
colleges with
                            high enrollments of Hispanic students. The
numbers for
                            programs over the next five years come from cong
ressional and
                            administration sources.

                            Congressional Republicans, while recognizing the
need for new
                            teachers because of growing enrollments, are
already
                            concerned about the cost.

                            --This is quite a list, "   said Jay Diskey,
spokesman for the
                            House Education and Workforce Committee.   --How
are they
                            going to pay for it? And how are they going to
fight for it? ...
                            You will see us join with him on some but also
have a message


                         of,   'Where's this money going to come from?'"

                         There are questions about the size of future
budget surpluses
                         and how much will money, if any, might be
available from a
                         proposed settlement with the tobacco industry
over smoking
                         related health-care costs.

                         A Senate Democratic aide, speaking on condition of
                         anonymity, said the administration was aiming for
100,000
                         teachers a year over five years. But the aide
said it was unclear
                         how they would be paid for.

                         Congressional Republicans and Democrats already
started
                         taking up the issue late last year with
legislative proposals.

                         In a National Press Club speech last month, Sen.
Edward M.
                         Kennedy, D-Mass., proposed recruiting 100,000 new
                         teachers a year for 10 years. A bill offered last
week by Rep.
                         Bill Paxon, R-N.Y., calls for hiring 100,000 new
teachers over
                         five years. However, it would pay the $8 billion
cost by taking
                         money from Clinton's prized Americorps, an
education
                         program known as Goals 2000 and the National
Endowment
                         for the Arts. Paxon's bill also calls for denying
teachers a
                         chance a tenure, something teacher unions would
oppose.

                         Trying to keep a 1996 campaign promise, the
administration
                         will propose at least $5 billion on school repair
and
                         construction. A proposal last year to spend that
much to
                         stimulate $20 billion worth of construction over
two years was
                         shelved during balanced-budget talks, angering
many urban
                         Democrats.

                         The administration has been debating how to use
that money to
                         help school districts. One possibility would be
to defray the
                         cost of borrowing money for construction
projects. Another
                         possibility, contained in legislation proposed by
Sens. Carol


                       Moseley-Braun, D-Ill., and Kennedy, would provide
$1 billion
                       a year in tax credits for companies doing the
construction
                       projects so they would charge the local school
districts less for
                       the work.

                       The Hispanic aid proposal is politically
significant because
                       Democrats and Republicans are courting Latinos in
the 1998
                       congressional elections.

                       Among other proposals:

                       --The administration wants support beyond the $40
million
                       provided this year for after-school learning
centers in rural and
                       inner-city public schools. The so-called 21st
Century
                       Community Learning Centers provide tutoring and
other help,
                       as well as a safe place for children to be after
school and
                       before parents return home from work.

                       --On another front,    the administration plans to
support the
                       creation of even more charter schools,
experimental public
                       schools that operate independently of usual
regulations.
                       Bipartisan legislation provided $80 million this
year for the
                       schools, an increase from $51 million the
previous year.

                       Republicans support charter schools, but have
tried to link
                       support for them with support for vouchers,
subsidies for
                       private and church-run schools.

                       The administration adamantly opposes vouchers.

                       --Clinton already has said he wants to spend $350
million for
                       scholarships and other aid to colleges for 35,000
new teachers
                       willing to serve in poor urban and rural
classrooms.

                       --The president also has announced plans for
--education
                       opportunity zones. "    Financial incentives would
go to 15 to 25
                       poor school districts that adopt dramatic reforms
such as


                        closing bad schools and firing bad teachers.
