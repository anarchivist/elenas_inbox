TEXT:
Elena,

I spoke with Ellen Vargyas from the EEOC.  She is concerned that those who
oppose the use of "testers" (both in the employment and other contexts)
have started putting out paid ads in both national and local papers (like
the one that appeared in the NYT yesterday) -- likely with the hope that
some conservative columnist will pick up the issue.   Should we consider
whether to solicit an op-ed (from an academic, private sector or think
tank type) to endorse the use of testers as an appropriate tool in cr enfo
rcement? If so, who within the White House is the appropriate contact to
move forward with this? Thanks.

Julie
