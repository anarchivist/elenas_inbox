TEXT:
This meeting will take place tomorrow, Tuesday, 10/7, at 11:00am in
Mickey's office (unless I get a conference room!) .. We're pretty shy on
space, so invitees include: M. Echaveste, J. Hilley, A. Lewis, Goody M.,
B. Reed, G. Sperling, L. Cutler, E. Kagan, M. Cohen, and Don Gips.   If we
decide to move forward with a public schools conference, we will certainly
open up future meetings to a broader group of participants.

please have someone let me know if you will not be'able to attend
tomorrow.  Thanks.

Subject:         Mtg. Re: Proposed USCM Public Schools Summit

At the suggestion of Mayor Richard Daley (D-Chicago, IL), Mayor Tom Menino
(D-Boston, MA), Mayor Dannel Malloy (D-Stamford, CT), and Mayor Beverly
O'Neill (D-Long Beach, CAl, the leadership of the u.S. Conference of
Mayors (USCM) recently voted to formally request a "White House/Mayors
Conference on Public Schools," similar to last year's White House
conference on drug control. Mickey Ibarra has asked me to set up a
meeting this week to discuss this request.

If a consensus is reached that a White House conference is a positive
idea, the upcoming USCM/Council of Great City Schools joint meeting in
Detroit (October 15 - IS) may provide the appropriate opportunity to
formally announce our intention to sponsor a public schools conference.



Would you please ask someone to contact me regarding your availability for
a preliminary meeting on this proposal? I'm considering Tuesday, October
7, at llam or 4pm.  Thanks.
