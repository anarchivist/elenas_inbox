TEXT:
Recognizing that perhaps we need to add something to the Arizona letter
that reflects our real reservations about privatization, I just suggested
the following questions to USDA.  Let me know if you see any problems with
them asap.

What evidence does the state have that privatizing these functions will
lead to lower costs? What evidence does it have that it will not lead to
a diminution of client service or increased error rates?
