TEXT:
Sorry to bug you, but I didn't get a response back from you on the
following.  My last day will be next Tuesday and I need to do something
with all of the women's issues files I have, especially the late term
abortion files that date back to the beginning of the debate.  I can
archive everything, but you might want them. Alos, on the other women
issues, is somebody goong to take them over, or should I archive all of
that too?
