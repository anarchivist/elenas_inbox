TEXT:
So -- Joe is okay with leaking the report Saturday for Sunday and is okay
with giving it to the NYT.   I presume Treasury would then release the
report Sunday afternoon so we can put people on the news Sunday night.

Can Neschis go ahead and pitch Holder or Johnson for Sunday night
networks? Or do we ened to wait until Sunday? thanks, everyone.
