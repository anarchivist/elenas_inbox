The parties respect the Home Rule Charter as the fundamental basis for governance in the
District. The purpose of this memorandum is to strengthen Home Rule and to agree to work
toward the revitalization of the District of Columbia. By providing for additional District
government functions. the Federal government will enable the District to tocus its resources on
the functions that remain. In some cases, however, this memorandum provides for Federal
assumption of not only funding for celiain government functions, but Federal assumption of
management of those functions as well. While' this is appropriate in limited circumstances, the
pmiies generally favor the principle of local management over District government functions.
regardless of the source of funding for those programs.

This memorandum is intended only to improve the management of, and the relationship between,
the District of Columbia and the Federal government, and is not intended to and does not create
any right, benefit, trust or responsibility, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or equity
by a party against the United States or the District of Columbia, its agencies, its officers, or any
person.

The parties recognize the effectiveness of PL 104-8 and dedicate themselves to the cooperative
implementation of its provisions. Among these provisions:

Finance.

·      For each Fiscal Year for which the District is in a control period, the Mayor shall develop
       and submit to the Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Authority (the
       "Authority") and District Council a Budget and Financial Plan for the applicable Fiscal
       Year and the next three Fiscal Years.

       not exceed revenues for that Fiscal Year.

·      During Fiscal Years 1996, 1997, and 1998, the District government shall make
       continuous, substantial progress toward equalizing its expenditures and revenues.

·      The District may not borrow money during a control year unless the Authority provides
       prior certification that the borrowing is consistent with the financial plan and budget for
       the year.

·      For the Secretary of the Treasury to make a short-term advance to the District, an
       Authority-approved Budget and Financial Plan must be in place, the Mayor must submit a
       requisition for an advance including a schedule for timing and amounts for advances, the

     access on reasonable terms, and that the Treasury has reasonable assurance of being
     reimbursed.

     Revenue.

·    An Office of the Inspector General will be established in the Executive Branch of the
     District government.

·    During the control period, the Mayor shall submit proposed contracts and leases to the
     Authority for review, and cannot enter into a contract or a lease unless the Authority
     determines it is consistent with the Budget and Financial Plan.

SECTION IV. SUBMISSION OF LEGISLATION &                             FEDERALLY ASSUMED
FUNCTIONS

        As Chair of the President's District of Columbia Task Force, the Director of the Office of
Management and Budget intends to recommend the submission of legislation to the Congress
that is consistent with the National Capital Revitalization and Self Government Improvement
Plan (the "Plan") announced by the President on January 14, 1997.

        Once implemented, the Plan will provide the District substantial relief from its operating
expenditures, relief which will grow over time. It will also invest considerable resources to
improve the District's criminal justice systems and capital infrastructure. If this legislation is
enacted, the Federal government will undertake the functions described below. The Federal
government will not undertake a function until the District government meets the conditions for
that function, described in Section V.

1.     Medicaid. The Federal government will increase its share of the District's Medicaid
       payments to 70 percent, thereby reducing the District's share to 30 percent. The
       Department of Health and Human Services will continue to provide more intensive


                                                5

                              Hex.Dump Conversion
     program.

2.   Pensions. The Federal government will take financial and administrative
     responsibility for virtually all pension benefits accrued under the plans for all active
     and retired police and firefighters, and teachers, and will take full responsibility for
     the pensions of judges. The bulk of the assets of the retirement plans will be
     transferred to the Federal government and placed with a third party Trustee chosen by the
     Secretary of the Treasury. A significant amount of assets will be left with the District of
     Columbia to fund the benefits of participants in the District's plans and to reduce the
     District's annual contribution. The Trustee will invest funds, manage the existing
     plans, and make payments on behalf of beneficiaries. The Federal government will
     pledge its full faith and credit to meet its responsibilities to pay these benefits. Current
     retirees will have all their benefits paid by the Federal government. Retirement, death,
     and some disability benefits payable by the Federal government to current employees will
     be based on service earned as of the date the legislation is introduced. While the Federal
     government will not be responsible for benefits earned during future years of service by
     members of the current retirement programs (other than judges), these members will get
     the benefit of pay increases on the frozen benefits. Frozen benefits will continue to be
     subject to cost-of-Iiving adjustments under the terms of the existing programs. All future
     employee contributions (except for judges) will be paid into the new plans.

3.   Treasury Loans to Eliminate the Deficit. The United States Treasury will provide loans
     of up to IS-year terms to assist the District to eliminate its accumulated fund balance·
     deficit and to manage its liquidity position. The combined amount of the Treasury loans
     may not exceed $500 million. The Treasury loans will have an interest rate equal to the
     prevailing yield on outstanding Treasury marketable securities of comparable maturity
     plus 1/8th of one percent. The Treasury may also provide intra-year loans for the
     purposes of seasonal cash-flow management.

4.   Criminal Justice.      The Federal and District governments will develop and
     implement a transition plan which transfers responsibility over a three-to-five-year
     period for incarcerating felons. The Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) will house
     adult felons convicted of D.C. Code violations and designated in the same manner as
     Federal inmates in correctional institutions operated or contracted by the BOP.
     This will occur after BOP's capacity has been increased through new construction
     at Lorton and other locations selected by BOP, and through renovation of existing
     facilities at Lorton, Virginia. After October 1, 2001, the BOP will also designate to
     Federal correctional institutions sentenced D.C. felons in the custody of the D.C.
     Department of Corrections, as the Director of BOP deems appropriate, in
     accordance with available capacity, until they have all been designated to Federal
     institutions. The BOP will accept employment applications from persons currently
     employed by the D.C. Department of Corrections for existing BOP vacancies, and
     will process such applications in accordance with existing Federal procedures and
     standards.

                          Hex'Dwnp Conversion
     Council, and the Chair of the D.C. Financial Responsibility and Management
     Assistance Authority, a Trustee to oversee operations of the D.C. Department of
     Corrections until the BOP assumes responsibility for all incarcerated District felons.

     The Federal and District governments will develop and implement a framework for
     changes to the D.C. sentencing system, including the abolition of parole, institution of
     detenninate guideline sentencing and the enactment of the new mandatory minimum drug
     sentences, which are a prerequisite for the Federal government accepting responsibility
     for the incarceration of felons convicted of D.C. Code violations. The sentencing system
     will be enacted within 24 months, or the Federal government will not be required to
     obligate any funds appropriated for the purpose of incarcerating D.C. Code felons and
     will have no responsibility for housing such persons.

     Consulting with representatives of the Federal and District judiciary, the Federal
     and District governments will also develop and implement a transition plan
     transferring responsibility for D.C. Code violation offender pretrial, public defender,
     parole, probation, and post-adjudication/post-conviction adult offender supervision
     from the District government to the Federal government over a three-to-five-year
     period.    The United States Parole Commission will continue to assume
     responsibility for all D.C. felons housed in Federal Correctional Institutions who
     have sentences subject to provisions of parole.

     The Federal government will take direct responsibility (in consultation with the
     D.C. judiciary) for funding the D.C. court system and related services (including
     plans relating to retirement benefits and other personnel matters), and establishing
     an independent budgetary, financial oversight, and administrative support system for the
     D.G courts. The Courts will remain self-managed.

5.   Econof!lic Development. The Federal government will assist the economic development
     of the District of Columbia in three ways:

     First, a new economic development corporation (EDC) will be established as a public
     authority of the District of Columbia, with the mission of revitalizing the nation's capital
     city and benefitting the District's residents and businesses. The EDC will be governed
     by a board of directors consisting of nine voting members. Six of the board members
     will be appointed by the President in consultation with the Congress. Of those six, four
     will be selected from the for-profit business community, and two will be selected from
     community-based organizations. All six of the appointed board members will be persons
     who either maintain a primary residence or have a primary place of business in the
     District. The remaining three board members will be ex officio members, one chosen by
     the President from the Federal government, a second chosen by the Mayor from the
     District government, and a third chosen by the Council from the District government.
     The EDC will be run by a Chief Executive Officer and served by a professional staff.



                                              7
                            Automated Records MD1l1lgement System
                            Hex-Dump Conversion
     consideration to applications for financial assistance for projects contemplated by existing
     plans that the EDC adopts. The EDC will establish a comprehensive strategic plan for
     economic development and will consult with the rest of the District government in doing
     so. The EDC will provide financial assistance for economic development projects,
     directly or in participation with other sources of financing, by making loans, equity
     investments, and grants, but not guarantees; by leasing or conveying land; by allocating
     tax credits for qualified equity investments and loans; by issuing tax-exempt private
     activity bonds for certified qualified projects; and by issuing project revenue obligations
     for any economic development project that it approves. The EDC will have the power
     limited powers to acquire property through condemnation by eminent domain.

     Second, the Federal government will provide $250 million in tax incentives to encourage
     business investment both downtown and in distressed communities, and to help
     businesses increase employment of residents of the District. There will be a new 40
     percent tax credit on the first $10,000 of eligible wages in the first year of employment
     for employers in the District that hire certain residents of the District. Businesses that
     have a significant portion of their activities in higher poverty areas of the District and that
     have a work force at least 35 percent of which is made up of District residents will be
     eligible for expensing (rather than capitalizing) an additional $20,000 of business
     equipment and machinery acquired each year. The EDC will be authorized to issue
     tax-exempt private activity bonds to finance a broader range of business property than
     under existing District law if the business is located in a higher poverty area of the
     District and has a work force at least 35 percent of which is made up of District residents.
      The EDC will be authorized to allocate $95 million in tax credits for investors in, or
     lenders to, District businesses for up to 25 percent of the amount invested or loaned.

     Third, the District government's borrowing authority will be improved by removing
     impediments in its borrowing statutes so that the District government will have the same
     legal capacity to finance projects similar jurisdictions have.

     These provisions will be undertaken in a manner consistent with a legislative outline
     being developed with the District.

6.   Infrastructure. The Department of Transportation will assume responsibility for the
     funding and oversight of certain National Highway System (NHS) capital projects
     (including roads, bridges, and transit) and NHS operations and maintenance
     projects (excluding police authority, National Park Service roads, and transit) in
     consultation with the District. The District will select the NHS projects to be
     funded and the Secretary of Transportation will review the District's project
     selections in accordance with Title 23 planning procedures.              Contract
     administration will be performed by the Federal Highway Administration. In
     addition, eligibility for Surface Transportation Program (STP) funds will be
     expanded to include local public roads. To support NHS projects, the National
     Capital Infrastructure Fund (NCIF) will be established in FY1998 with $108 million
     for road, bridge, and transit capital projects. An additional $17 million will be

                                               8

                           Hex·1)Ump Convllrslon
         for the District's NBS, Interstate Maintenance, and Bridge programs will be
         transferred to the NCIF in FY1998-03. The Administration also proposes that the
         NCIF be authorized to accept contributions from other sources.

I 7.     Personal Income Tax Collection. At the request of, and at no cost to, the District, the
         Internal Revenue Service will assume responsibility from the District of Columbia for
         administering and/or enforcing D.C. individual income 8:fid payroll taxes. This wel:lld
         petentially inell:lde the preeessing ef these taxes paid by individl:lals, as well as the
         payment ef related ernpleyment 8:fid payrell taxes. The District government will
         maintain processing and collection responsibility for all other taxes.

          Upon enactment of the legislation to implement the Plan, the parties to the MOU will
  review the legislation and confer on whether any revisions to the MOU are necessary to ensure
  its consistency with the legislation.

 4,       Criminal Justice. This subsection of the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)
 between the Federal government and the District of Columbia government (D.C.) outlines the
 offer of the Federal government, conditioned wholly on appropriations and D.C.'s acceptance and
 satisfaction of all other conditions and predicates identified and described herein, to assist D.C. by
 assuming responsibility for certain traditionally State responsibilities and the conditions that D.C.
 must agree to and fulfill should it choose to accept that offer as it relates to criminal justice
 functions, including, but not limited to, certain defendant and offender services, corrections and
 the judiciary. The MOU sets forth the expectations and responsibilities relating to proposed
 changes and reforms in the D.C. criminal justice and judicial system and the procedures
 (including new statutory and regulatory provisions) the Federal government and D.C. will use to
 implement the MOU. In particular, the MOU is designed to:

 4.i.    provide a framework for changes to the D.C. sentencing system, including the abolition
         of parole, institution of determinate guideline sentencing and the enactment of the new
         mandatory minimum drug sentences, which are a prerequisite for the Federal government
         accepting responsibility for the incarceration of felons convicted of D.C. Code violations.

          appropriated for the purpose of incarcerating D.C. Code 'felons and will have no
          responsibility for housing such persons.

4.iii.   ensure an appropriate transfer and transition of responsibility from D.C. to the Federal
         government for pretrial, public defender, parole, probation, and post-conviction
         supervision and services for adult D.C. Code defendants and offenders.

4.iv.    ensure an appropriate transfer of responsibility from D.C. to the Federal government for
         the incarceration of sentenced felons convicted of D.C. Code violations, assuming
         sufficient resources are provided by Congress to develop necessary bed space to
         accommodate the resulting increase in the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) population
         and D.C. Code violators are designated in the same manner as Federal inmates.

4.v.     provide the basis for establishing an independent budgetary, financial oversight, and
         administrative support system for the D.C. courts.

4.vi.    define the respective roles of the D.C. and Federal Governments in relation to lawsuits
         and resulting liability, as they may be affected by the reforms agreed to in this MOU.

4.vii.   ensure the development by D.C. and the Federal Governments of transition plans

         ·4.vii.a. (in consultation with the Federal and D.C. judiciaries) for transferring
                         responsibility for pretrial, public defender, parole, probation, and
                         post-conviction supervision and services for adult D.C. Code defendants
                         and offenders over a transition period of one to three years from the
                         enactment of the federal implementing legislation.

         4.vii.b. for transferring responsibility for incarcerating sentenced felons convicted of D.C.
                          code violations over a period of approximately three to five years.

         4.vii.c. (in consultation with the D.C. judiciary) for transferring responsibility for funding
                         the D.C. court system and related services, including plans relating to
                         retirement benefits and other personnel matters.

         4.vii.d. for transferring control of the property at Lorton, Virginia to the Federal
                         Government.

4.2.1. Federal Government Responsibilities

        4.2.1.1. The Federal government will take administrative control of the nine parcels of
                       land; collectively located at or in the vicinity of Lorton, Virginia ("the
                       Lorton property"), and other appropriate sites. Mter the BOP's capacity
                       has been increased through renovation of existing facilities and new
                       construction at the corrections complex in Lorton and other locations
                       selected by BOP, BOP will house felons who were convicted of D.C.
                       Code violations and sentenced to terms of imprisonment. (A recently
                       completed Congressionally mandated study of the D.C. Department of
                       Corrections revealed that most of the institutions at Lorton have exceeded
                       their useful lifespan and need major renovations or demolition.)

       4.2.1.2. BOP will conduct a thorough preliminary assessment of the Lorton property
                     to determine its environmental condition, including a study of the
                     contamination on the property and an estimation of the costs
                     associated with bringing the property into compliance with
                     environmental and other applicable regulations.           Based on
                     preliminary information gathered pursuant to a review of the
                     environmental conditions of a portion of the Lorton property, BOP
                     could begin planning for renovation and construction immediately;
                     actual physical renovations would not begin until Fiscal Year 1998.
                     The estimated date for the completion of the preliminary
                     environmental assessment process is March 21, 1998.

       4.2.1.3.       BOP will oversee the operation of community corrections centers in
                      D.C. as necessary to provide an appropriate transition for inmates
                      who are nearing release from Federal prisons, including those
                      convicted of D.C. Code violations. BOP intends to use existing
                      community corrections centers in D.C. to the extent practicable and
                      will work with D.C. officials to identify prospective sites, as needed to
                      establish new community corrections facilities.

           facilities operated by BOP in Lorton, Virginia and elsewhere. Every
           effort will be made to house D.C. felons at facilities as close to D.C. as
           permitted by inmate program and security needs and BOP population
           management requirements. D.C. felons will be designated in the
           same manner as Federal inmates, and ordinarily initially assigned to
           institutions located within a SOO-mile radius of their release residence.
            BOP anticipates that many of the initial designations for D.C.
           offenders will be within a significantly closer radius. BOP also will
           work with D.C. officials to identify sites for possible Federal,
           correctional facility construction within D.C.

4.2.1.S.   During the transition period, based upon assurances from D.C. that
           felons convicted of violating the D.C. Code will, in the future, receive
           sentences similar to those received by comparable offenders convicted
           of comparable Federal offenses, BOP will house those sentenced D.C.
           felons in the custody of the D.C. Department of Corrections as the
           Director of the BOP deems appropriate in accordance with available
           capacity. If such a new structure for sentencing under the D.C. Code
           is in place as of October 1, 2001, BOP will accept D.C. felons
           sentenced under the new sentencing structure in accordance with the
           capacity of BOP. By October 1, 2002, and assuming fulfillment of all
           requisite conditions, BOP will have assumed responsibility for
           incarcerating all sentenced D.C. felons.

4.2.1.6.   BOP will accept employment applications from persons currently
           employed by the D.C. Department of Corrections for BOP vacancies
           and will make hiring selections in accordance with existing Federal
           procedures and standards. Qualified, experienced personnel will
           receive priOl'itv consideration. Positions for new BOP facilities will
           be advertised prior to hiring to assure notice to all interested D.C.
           agencv personnel.

4.2.1.7.   After consultation with the Mayor, representatives of the D.C.
           Council, the Chair of the Financial Authority, members of the
           judiciary and others, the Attorney General will select a Corrections
           Trustee to oversee expenditures of the D.C. Department of
           Corrections relating to sentenced, incarcerated felons, until BOP
           assumes responsibility for all incarcerated sentenced D.C. felons.

4.2.1.8.   To the extent authorized by law, the Federal government will provide
           funds for the incarceration of sentenced D.C. felons through the
           Trustee to the D.C. Department of Corrections. The head of any
           Federal department or agency may provide on a reimbursable basis

                     the Trustee's duties.

       4.2.1.9.      Of the Federal funds received by the Trustee, the Trustee will
                     reimburse BOP for those funds identified by Congress to be used for
                     the construction of new facilities and the major renovation of existing
                     facilities. BOP will be responsible and accountable for determining
                     how these funds will be used, including the type, security level, and
                     location of new facilities.

       4.2.1.10.     During the transition period, the employees of and appropriations
                     allocated to the Trustee and the agencies for which the Trustee is
                     responsible shall not be scored or counted against the personnel and
                     budget ceilings imposed on D.C. by the Financial Authority or
                     Congress.

4.2.2. District of Columbia Responsibilities

       4.2.2.1.      Offenders convicted of D.C. Code violations will be sentenced
                     pursuant to a new D.C. sentencing system, described below. BOP
                     shall not be required to obligate any funds appropriated for the
                     absorption of D.C. Code felons into the Federal prison system and will
                     have no responsibility to house any persons convicted of felony
                     offenses, if the new sentencing system is not enacted within 24 months
                     ofthe authorizing legislation's enactment.

       4.2.2.2.      D.C. will continue to house felons sentenced to terms of imprisonment
                     by the Superior Court for the District of Columbia until such persons
                     have been designated by BOP. To the extent beds are available, D.C.
                     will continue to house felons sentenced to terms of imprisonment by

                  three years from the enactment of the Federal authorizing legislation will be made
                  according to the Federal requirements.

  4.3.3.          Congress will establish a new D.C. Board of Criminal Sentences (the Board) as an
                  independent body within the D.C. Government. All persons convided of D.C.

                  enactment of the Federal authorizing legislation.

  4.3.4.          The Board will develop a sentencing system which shall include binding
                  guidelines and may include such amendments or repeals of provisions in the D.C.

              guidelines, amendments and repeals will become effective unless disapproved in its
              entirety by an Act of a majority of the Council. If disapprO'red by the Council,

              those that would be imposed upon comparable offenders in the Federal system.

4.3.8.        The Board will not have the authority to provide for capital punishment under any
              law applicable exclusively in D.C.

              among other things:

       4.3.13.1.          will result in sentences for those convicted of D.C. felony offenses similar
                          to those that would be imposed upon comparable offenders convicted of
                          comparable offenses in the Federal system;

       4.3.13:2.          will result in sentences that refled the seriousness of the offense and
                          provide for just punishment, afford adequate deterrence to potential future
                          criminal condud of the offender and others, and provide the defendant
                          with needed educational or vocational training, medical care, and other
                          correctional treatment;

                          avoiding unwarranted sentencing disparities among similar defendants,
                          while maintaining sufficient flexibility to permit individualized sentences;

       4.3.13.4.          will take into account the high volume of sentencing proceedings in the
                          D.C. Superior Court as bearing upon the degree of complexity of the
                          sentencing system; and

       4.3.13.5.          will ensure that the system is neutral as to the race, sex, marital status,
                          ethnic origin, religious affiliation, national origin, creed, socioeconomic
                          status, and sexual orientation of offenders, if not related to the commission
                          of the offense. .

4.3.14. As part of the sentencing system, the Board will develop binding guidelines for use in
               determining the sentence to be imposed upon convicted felons. The guidelines
               will specify:

       4.3.14.1.          when to impose a sentence of probation, a fine, or a term of imprisonment
                          and the appropriate amount or length, thereof, as well as intermediate
                          sanctions;

               There will be established a successor, Federally funded agency to amend the
               guidelines as necessary to achieve the purposes of the Act. The D.C. Council
               may recommend to Congress whether or not these amendments should be

               successor agencv shall be available to advise the Council regarding
               sentencing-related matters but will have no powers to revise the D.C. Code. The
               successor agency will recommend to the C'Aluncil such changes to the D.C. Code
               as may be necessary to further the purpose of the Act. The D.C. Council will
               continue to have authority to enact D.C. Code revisions independent of the
               recommendations of the successor agency. The successor agency also may
               recommend to the D.C. Council amendments to the D.C. sentencing guidelines as
               necessary to achieve the purposes of the Act. Such amendments shall articulate
               sentencing adjustments or new guidelines subject to maximum sentences or ranges
               established bv the D.C. Council in D.C. Code. Guideline amendments that
               pertain to established D.C. Code provisions will take eHect unless disapproved by
               an Act of the Council that is in turn affillned by the Congress. Guideline
               provisions related to proposed changes in the D.C. Code will ani), take effect
               under this procedure if the Code change is first adopted by the Council.

4.3.16. The Superior Court for the Distrid of Columbia, D.C. Department of Corrections, and
              any other agency will submit information about convided felons as required by
              the Board and the U.S. Department of Justice. This would permit an assessment
              of the extent to which sentences imposed by the Superior Court of the Distrid of
              Columbia are similar to those imposed for comparable offenders in the Federal
              system. The results of this assessment would be used by the Board in developing
              the new sentencing system for D.C.

4.3.17. Four years after the enadment of the new sentencing system, there will be an evaluation
               to determine the extent to which the sentencing system has succeeded in
               accomplishing the goals set forth in the Ad.

        Columbia's Department of Public Works shall guide the assistance.

6.2.   District of Columbia Responsibilities. The District of Columbia agrees that:

6.2.1. The District of Columbia shall retain its current responsibilities under Title 23,
       United States Code, for NBS project selection.

6.2.2. The District of Columbia shall continue to be responsible for providing police
       services on NBS highways (including, but not limited to civil police functions, crime
       prevention, investigations including traffic and accident investigation, and
       emergency traffic direction). The District shall continue to own the right-of-way of
       NBS highways that are located within the District of Columbia.

       funded with Federal-aid highway funds. Surface Transportation Program (STP)

       highways, and roadways (except alleys).       This authority does not relieve the
       District of Columbia of the responsibility for the non-Federal matching share for
       STP funds. The use of other Federal-aid highway apportioned funds by the
       District of Columbia, other than as provided herein, also requires
       a non-Federal matching share.

       under this Act. The relief from providing the non-Federal match shall not include
       those projects that were approved by FBW A prior to October 1, 1997 for which
       Federal-aid highway funds have been obligated. The District of Columbia is
       responsible for providing the non-Federal match, the Federal-aid funds, and any
       obligation authority for any such projects transferred to the Secretary for project
       administration, oversight, or contracting.

6.2.6. The District of Columbia shall continue to be responsible for any liability incurred
       on the basis of the activities of the District of Columbia, its agencies, or personnel as
       a result of any acts or omissions in carrying out this Act. The United States, its
       agencies, and personnel will not incur any liability for any such acts or omissions.
