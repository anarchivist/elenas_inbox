TEXT:
Slater's office is asking for a copy of the radio address.  I hadn't sent
it over yet because of the problems with leaks that we have had with folks
at Transportation.  In addition, the radio address doesn't mention their
safety conference, but Ann Lewis told them again this morning that it will
not be mentioned.   I was going to fax over a copy of the speech for the
Secretary's briefing unless you had a problem with it. Thanks, Mary
     "
