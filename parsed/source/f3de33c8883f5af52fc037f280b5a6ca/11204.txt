TEXT:
I left you copies of the NEC paper on the applicability of Davis-Bacon to
our school modernization proposal.

In addition to comments on the paper itself, Sally Katzen has asked
ED/Treasury/WH offices to indicate a preferred option by c.o.b. Wednesday
(decide Davis-Bacon is not applicable; remain silent until bill starts to
move; add Davis-Bacon to current proposal; change proposal to add a grant
component and, thus, trigger Davis-Bacon) .
