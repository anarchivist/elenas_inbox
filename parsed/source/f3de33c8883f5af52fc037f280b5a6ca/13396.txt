TEXT:
good point, although I'd be careful with it. The easy rebuttal is
that the rider specifies the criteria for replacement timber in a
way that ensures satisfaction for the purchaser, while the
Hatfield/Gorton language being offered to "fix" the rider waives
those specifications upon agreement by the purcahser.   In other
words, it is unfortunately not the case that under the current
rider we have unilateral authority to deviate from the very rigid
terms in k(3} and as you know, we're struggling withe issue of
legal authority for mutually agreed replacement timber.
