TEXT:
Mark Greenberg from the Center for Law and Social Policy called me and
would like to come talk to us about FLSA.  I have worked a lot with Mark
-- he is a very smart lawyer who knows a lot about welfare and in my
experience he can be trusted to work confidentially. He is a pragmatic
liberal who will work on improvements (i.e., he was the MOE godfather
despite hating block grants) .

I thought it might be useful to hear his views before our 2:00 meeting
tomorrow. At a minimum he will clue us into every possible way others
will try to weaken the work rates to soften the FLSA burden. He may have
some suggestions more up our alley too.

Shall we meet with him sometime before 2:00 tomorrow?
