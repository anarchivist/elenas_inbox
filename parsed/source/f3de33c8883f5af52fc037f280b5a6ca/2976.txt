                                         ~onday,June16,1997


            SATURDAY: PRESIDENT LAUNCHES MAJOR INITIATIVE ON RACE

           This Saturday, in a commencement address at the University of California at San
    Diego, President Clinton launched a major initiative on race, to meet America's greatest
    challenge and greatest opportunity: building One America in the 21st Century:

    ·      President Clinton has worked to prepare America for the 21 st century with a strategy of
           opportunity for all, responsibility from all, and an American community of all our
           citizens. To succeed in each of these areas, we must deal with the realities and the
           perceptions affecting all racial groups:

    ·      First, we must continue to expand opportunity, including a growing economy, and access·
           to education. Affirmative action still has an important role as well. President Clinton
           said, "When used the right way, [affirmative action] has worked ... At the very time when
           we need to do a better job ofliving and learning together, we should not stop trying to
           equalize economic opportunity ... and we should never be thought unwilling to work with
           those who disagree with us to find new ways to lift people up and bring people together.

    ·      Second, we must demand responsibility from every American -- which means having all
           our citizens respect the law, but also ensuring that the law respects all our citizens. That
           applies to the enforcement of our civil rights laws. It is imperative that Congress --
           especially those who say they're for civil rights but against affirmative action -- provide
           the resources to fully enforce the nation's civil rights laws.

    ·      Third, we must build one American community based on respect for one another and our
           shared val ues. We must begin with a candid conversation on the state of race relations
           today. Over the coming year, President Clinton will lead the American people in an
           far-ranging and constructive conversation about race.

    ·      With the help of an advisory panel of seven distinguished Americans, President Clinton
           will help educate Americans about the facts surrounding issues of race; promote a
           dialogue to work through these issues; recruit and encourage leadership at all levels to
           help breach racial divides, and find and develop concrete solutions to our problems. The
           President said: "If ten years from now people can look back and see that this year of
           honest dialogue and concerted action helped to lift the heavy burden ofrace from our
           children's future, we will have given a precious gift to America.

            President Clinton: "Will we become ... many Americas, separate, unequal and isolated?
    Or will we draw strength/rom all our people and our ancient/aith in the quality a/human
    dignity, to become the world's first truly multi-racial democracy? That is the unfinished work 0/
    our time, to lift the burden a/race and redeem the promise a/America. "

                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion

 TEXT:
 As you are aware, earlier this afternoon, I circulated a draft OMB letter
 to the Senate Finance Committee for comment by 2:30 p.m. today.   The
 letter addresses the Committee's mark up of welfare-related reconciliation
 language.

 The following paragraphs have been proposed for insert into the draft OMB
 letter.  Please provide me with comments on the insert, as well as the
 rest of the letter, by today's 2:30 p.m. deadline.

 Thank you for your assistance.




  Proposed Insert:


         The Administration understands that amendments may be offered during
 Committee consideration, the purpose of which is to prevent costs from
 increasing in Food Stamps and Medicaid due to cost-shifting for common
 functions from the TANF block grant, which places a cap on TANF


 administrative costs, We understand the CBO baseline includes costs of
 over $5 billion in FYs 98-02 because CBO assumes administrative cots
 shifting from TANF to Food Stamps and Medicaid.  This proposal would
 reduce the extent of the cost-shift to the Food Stamp and Medicaid
 Programs, yielding substantial savings against eBOD,s baseline. While the
 Administration is generally supportive of this effort -- to prevent States
 from changing cost allocation plans in order to shift greater
 administrative costs from the capped TANF block grant to the open-ended
 Food Stamp and Medicaid administrative costs that are matched by the
 Federal government -- we would need to carefully re~iew the specific
 mechanism proposed.  In particular, we would have serious reservations
 about proposals that would cap Food stamps and Medicaid administrative
 costs.

 The budget negotiators discussed changes to the Food Stamp and Medicaid
 Programs at considerable length.  An amendment further reducing these
 programs and directing savings to other programs was neither raised nor
 included in the Budget Agreement. The Administration has very strong
 reservations about such an approach.
