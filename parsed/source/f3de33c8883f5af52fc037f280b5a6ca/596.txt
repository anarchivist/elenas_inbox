TEXT:
TO:                DIRECTOR FRANK RAINES
                   DEPUTY DIRECTOR JACK LEW
                   DEPUTY DIRECTOR JOHN KOSKINEN

FROM:      OMB LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS

DATE:      JANUARY 22, 1997

SUBJECT:           LEGISLATIVE REPORT


Yesterday, the Balanced Budget Amendment (BBA) was introduced in the


Senate as
S.J.Res. 1, with 62 sponsors -- all 55 Senate Republicans, plus Democrats
Baucus, Breaux, Bryan, Graham, Kohl, Moseley-Braun, and Robb.  The
Amendment does not include the Nunn language from last year, which
retained CongressO, authority to determine the extent that courts can get
involved in enforcement. Lott's likely intention is to add the Nunn
language on the Floor if it is required to lock down a vote. The language
of S.J.Res. 1 is identical to the House resolution.

Also on Tuesday, the Senate passed H.J.Res 25, Technical Amendments to the
Omnibus Appropriations Act, by Unanimous Consent.  In addition, Senators
Murkowsi and Craig reintroduced the Yucca Mountain Nuclear Waste
legislation.

Hearings:
Today, the Senate Judiciary Committee held their second hearing on the
Balanced Budget Constitutional Amendment.  Witnesses included Senators
Craig, Conrad, Dorgan, Lautenberg, Bryan, and Graham, former Senator Paul
Simon, and former AARP President Gene Lehrman.

Tomorrow, Jack Lew will testify before the Senate Budget Committee on the
AdministrationO,s Medicare Plan.

Director Raines will testify on the PresidentO,s Budget before the
following committees:
Friday, 2/7 Senate Budget Committee
Tuesday, 2/11 House Budget Committee
Wednesday, 2/26 Joint Economic Committee


CONGRESS TODAY (1/22)

SENATE:
The Senate today confirmed Madeline Albright as Secretary of State by a
vote of 99-0, and confirmed William Cohen as Secretary of Defense, also by
a vote of 99 -0.

HOUSE:

CONGRESS TOMORROW (1/23)

SENATE:
The Senate will be in session on Thursday to allow Members to make remarks
on nominations and to offer legislation. There will not be any votes.


CONGRESS -- LONG TERM SCHEDULE:

SENATE:
The Senate will be out of session on Friday, January 24th, but will return
on Monday for a pro forma session. The week of January 27th, the Senate
will continue its consideration of nominations. The Balanced Budget
Amendment is expected to be on the floor most of February.

Week of January 27
Consider Nominations
Specific schedule to be determined

Week of   February 3


 Begin consideration of the Balanced Budget Amendment. The Senate
 Republican Leadership plans to vote on its passage after PresidentD,s Day
 Recess in order to use the time to build public support.

  February 14-23
  PresidentD,s Day Recess

 March 22 - April 6
 Easter Recess


 HOUSE:
 The House returns on february 4th, for the PresidentD,s State of the Union
 address. They plan to be in session on the 4th, 5th, and 6th, but do not
 plan to have any major votes. The agenda will likely include a list of
 suspension bills, yet to be named.

 During the week of February 10th and throughout the month, the House will
 likely consider the following four major items:
 1       Term limits legislation -- Though this bill originally was placed
 first on calendar,       Republicans now do not want to consider the
 legislation first because they do not    want their first vote to be
 a loss.
 2       Balanced Budget Constitutional Amendment -- The House will take
 up the bill     after it         is considered in the Senate.
 3       UN Population Control Reauthorization bill
 4       Comp Time legislation

 February 14 - February 24
