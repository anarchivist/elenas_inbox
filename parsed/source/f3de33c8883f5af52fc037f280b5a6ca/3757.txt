TEXT:
You probably already know this and were involved in it, but yesterday the
subsidized jobs problem with the EITC workfare exemption got fixed,
through an enrolling resolution. The word I got was that Center on Budget
apparently pushed it very hard, and Gene got involved, as did Karl Scholtz
at Treasury. The Republicans got some minor airlines thing in exchange.
