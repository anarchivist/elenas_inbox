TEXT:
See note below. Joan and Olivia were so aghast that I was not aware of
their data on results that I asked my staff to call over and get it. They
were told by HHS that the best approach would be a conference call, which
is set for tomorrow.  I'm perfectly happy to be shown that there is good
data demonstrating higher measureable outcomes of some important sort for
kids in Head Start as a result of the "quality" investments -- we have,
after all, been spending a great deal of money on them.   If any of you
have time and want to listen in, contact Friedman for logistics.
Otherwise, be assured, we'll send you a summary of what we learn.

Subject:         Head Start Conference Call tomorrow at 10 am

Jessica has arranged for us to have a conference call tomorrow with HHS at
10 am to discuss outcome measures from the Head Start FACES study (which
Olivia and Joan were touting at today's child care meeting).  I'm not sure
who will be on the call, as Jessica and I have been playing phone tag, but
I presume it will include people from ASMB, HS Bureau, Craig Turner and
maybe child care folks.
