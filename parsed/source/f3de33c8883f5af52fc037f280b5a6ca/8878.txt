TEXT:
I got a call today from Martha Hertzberg who represents Peter, Paul &
Mary. They heard about the School Violence Conference and want to help in
whatever way we deem appropriate. Last year, they did a powerful PSA with
a 1-800 number. The theme of their PSA was "Where have all the children
gone". They're now working on a new recording that boys and girls clubs
will use ... Don't laugh at us - don't get your pleasure from my pain ...

If you're interested, call Martha Hertzberg at 310-399-5001
