                   President Clinton: Deterring and Reducing Gun Crime
                                      March 20, 1999

In weekly radio address, President Clinton will direct the Secretary of the Treasury and Attorney
General to develop a national strategy to increase gun prosecutions and further reduce gun
violence. Among other things, the strategy will specifically call for: the intensive investigation
and prosecution of gun criminals; expanded efforts to identify illegal gun markets and gun "hot
spots"; and improved coordination with state and local law enforcement and other
community-based efforts. The President will also release a new Justice Department report
highlighting 60 promising strategies that have helped reduce gun violence throughout the
country.

Stepping Up the Fight Against Gun Violence

Gun crimes down, but still too high. Since 1993, the nation's crime rate has dropped by more
than 20 percent, and to its lowest level in a generation. During this period gun-related crime has
dropped even more: gun murders are down by 33 percent, and crimes committed with firearms
are down by 27 percent. But gun-related crime and violence remain serious problems. In 1996,
more than 34,000 people died from gunfire -- about 14,000 of which were homicides. And the
youth gun murder rate remains especially high -- nearly twice what it was just 15 years ago.

Taking the fight against gun violence nationwide. To continue to reduce gun crime and
violence, President Clinton will direct the Secretary of the Treasury and Attorney General --
working with U.S. Attorneys, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF), and all of
state and local law enforcement -- to develop a comprehensive national strategy to prosecute
more gun criminals and further reduce gun violence by building on the successful efforts already
in place throughout the country.

Prosecuting more gun criminals. The President will ask that U.S. Attorneys and ATF to
work with state and local law enforcement to investigate and prosecute more gun criminals
by expanding efforts such as Project Exile in Richmond, VA. As part of Project Exile, the
Richmond U.S. Attorney -- working closely with other state, local and federal law
enforcement authorities -- targeted gun-carrying felons and other armed criminals for
immediate federal prosecution and stiff mandatory sentences in federal prison. Law
enforcement authorities also reached out to the business community and launched an extensive
media campaign to educate Richmond's residents about the lengthy, mandatory prison sentences
associated with gun crimes. Gun-related homicides in Richmond fell by 41 percent after Project
Exile was implemented.

Targeting illegal gun markets. The President will also ask law enforcement authorities to
target illegal gun markets and gun "hot spots," as is done in Boston. Through the Boston Gun
Project, every gun recovered by Boston police at a crime scene is traced through ATF's National
Tracing Center to its source. The Boston Police Department and ATF then work together to
disrupt illegal gun markets by investigating illegal gun trafficking and referring cases for swift
prosecution by both federal and state prosecutors. As a result of these and other youth violence
                                  Hex-Dump Conversion

prevention efforts, youth homicides in Boston have dropped 75 percent since 1995.
Coordinating our strategy with state and local efforts. Today's directive also calls for the
Treasury and Justice Departments to develop a strategy that builds on the many successful
strategies already in place around the country. To help communities learn more about such
programs, the President will release a new Justice Department report -- Promising Strategies to
Reduce Gun Violence. Designed as a "toolbox" for communities, the report details 60
successful strategies to reduce gun violence that were reviewed and recommended by more than
40 national experts, including: coordinated enforcement of all local, state, and federal gun laws
and regulations; closer, tougher supervision of gun criminals on parole or probation; and
increased efforts to keep guns out of the hands of juveniles. The report will be distributed to
communities throughout the country next week.

New Resources for Firearms Enfo'rcement

The President's FY 2000 budget includes new resources to help implement the national strategy
called for today. In particular, his budget includes:

       $5 million for more than 40 additional federal prosecutors to conduct intensive firearms
       prosecution projects targeting violent felons who possess guns, armed drug traffickers,
       and illegal gun markets;

       $23.8 million for more than 120 new ATF agents to support firearms investigations,
       arrest violent criminals and gun traffickers, and crack down on illegal gun sales; and

       $1.3 billion for a 21 st Century Policing Initiative to help communities hire more police
       and prosecutors, and to allow them to target gun crime and other public safety priorities.
