    As Erskine gets up to speed on the wide range of issues we all deal with,
    he has asked me to ask each of you to please make sure that you 'cc' him
    on all policy / issue memos going to the President.  Just as FYI for his
    information.

    Materials can be forwarded to me at 1fl/ww.

    All materials you think Erskine must read for the next day, should get to
    me by 6pm the night before (this has been working very well with most
    everyone) .

    Thanks again.


    Jason
