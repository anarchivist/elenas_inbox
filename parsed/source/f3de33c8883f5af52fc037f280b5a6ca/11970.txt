·ALL TOO HUMAN: A POLITICAL EDUCATION
                              BY GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS
                              LITTLE BROWN AND COMPANY
                              NONFICTION, 456 PAGES

                                BY JAKE TAPPER I The dish immediately takes on
                                the tone of a spurned lover: "It was how I
felt
                                around him: uniquely known and needed ...
                                Clinton spoke to the me yearning to be singled
                                out." Soon, however, the president turns out
to
                                be a cad, so his confidences are betrayed, on
                                page after page, with an air of
righteousness. The
                                betrayer comes across as shallow, deluded,
naive,
                                appallingly star struck and disgustingly
ambitious
                                -- qualities that, combined with all the
stress the
                                roguish Clinton causes, eventually necessitate
                                therapy and psychotropic drugs.

                               NO, this isn't "Monica's Story" -- it's former
                               presidential aide George Stephanopoulos'
                               456-page, $27.95 tour de force of
self-loathing
                                and self-promotion,   "All Too Human: A
Political
                               Education." A poorly written fable about an
                               arrogant young Greek who flies too close to
the
                                sun and crashes to the ground -- call it the
                                tragedy of Prickarus -- it's recommended
mainly
                               to those who already loathe Stephanopoulos and
                               desire more evidence to back their feelings
up.



                    If only the Clintons had provided as much
                    documentation on Whitewater! Exhibit A
relates,
                    obviously, to the inevitable question of
whether
                    Stephanopoulos should have written the book at
                    all -- especially while his former boss still
sits in
                    the "Oval," as he smugly refers to the Oval
                    Office. His treachery would be more
forgivable if
                    his gossip were interesting or insightful or
even
                    well-rendered. But most of the back-room
scenes
                    Stephanopoulos offers have been divulged
                    before, and better, by Washington Post
reporters
                    Bob Woodward and David Maraniss, and the
                    qualities that make Clinton a fascinating
                    psychological study were conjured far more
                    vividly by Joe Klein in the first half of
"primary
                    Colors." Oddly, instead of the ultimate
insider's
                    look at a president who was last seen in the
Starr
                    Report masturbating into a sink, we're
treated to
                    only a few new details. There's little actual
news
                    in the book beyond its having been written at
all.

                    Why not? Well, the tone suggests that even
                    though "All Too Human" disses the president,
                    Stephanopoulos believes, or at least hopes,
that
                    he may someday return to Clinton's forgiving
                    arms. Not unlike Monica Lewinsky, he seems to
                    bear more than a touch of unrequited love for
the
                    man who now refuses to let aides mention his
                    name in his presence. However pathetic that
                    seems, it's actually one of Stephanopoulos'
more
                    endearing qualities.

                    According to the flap copy, the book offers "a
                    candid, sometimes merciless self-portrait of
the
                    author, whose drives, vanities, and
insecurities,
                    along with everyone else's, peppered the
playing
                    field of the biggest game in town." That's not
                    inaccurate, though I wonder if he realizes
what a
                    little shit he comes across as. Yes, he


heartily
                    'fesses up to some foibles of his own -- he
                    condemns himself for craving "power and
                    celebrity," yet he does so in the pursuit of
power
                    and celebrity. It'd be a neat trick if he
could pull it
                    off, but the flaws he acknowledges get in the
way
                    of his story.

                    His greatest curse is his short-sightedness.
It isn't
                    his fault that he became a star-fucking
                    Machiavelli: "The power and celebrity I had
                    craved were ... exacting their price." Those
damn
                    gods of Power and Celebrity! Even while he's
                    calling himself on his ambition, he's still
excusing
                    his misdeeds. "My    motive may have been
                    unassailable, but    my judgment was dead wrong,"
                    he says about his    horrendous advice that the
                    president refrain    from taking responsibility
for the
                    carnage in Waco.

                    His cluelessness is captured in a passage
                    describing a TelePrompTer mishap during
                    Clinton's health-care address to Congress:
"The
                    thought of the president trying to
concentrate on
                    his delivery as gobbledygook whirred by his
eyes
                    made me sick with worry -- for him and me.
This
                    screwup might not have been my fault, but it
was
                    my responsibility.    'This is the worst thing
that's
                    ever happened,' I muttered. 'I dunno,' replied
                    Mike Feldman, the vice president's aide, 'the
                    Holocaust was pretty bad.' Very funny."

                    I know how Feldman must have felt. Even after
                    Stephanopoulos has downed his weight in
Zoloft,
                    a haze of self-aggrandizement continues to
cloud
                    his view of the White House and of the world.
                    He had no perspective then, and he still
doesn't.
                    Another revealing tic is his fixation on the
stature
                    of others -- the "little" Ross Perot, the
"short .. "
                    Klein, the "small" Dick Morris. I've seen
                    Stephanopoulos in the gym, and he has no
                    business pointing out the homunculoid status



of
                             others. And his attempts to settle scores by
                             lambasting the back-stabbing loathsomeness of
                             Morris, former Rep. Dave McCurdy, Al Gore
                             and Leon Panetta are really calling the kettle
                             black. Nice try, shorty.

Stephanopoulos writes some pretty shallow prose
                             for a Rhodes Scholar. He leans on show-biz
                             analogies, alluding at various points to "The
                             Sting," "Dr. No," "Dragnet," "The Graduate,"
                             "Gone With the Wind," "Deliverance," "The Odd
                             Couple," "Rain Man" and the Life cereal
                             commercial featuring Mikey. Just because he's
                             dark doesn't mean he's deep. He seems
                             completely unaware, for instance, that Clinton
                             didn't just give him the opportunity of a
lifetime
                             -- he made him. You cou1.d pave the streets
with
                             former high-ranking congressional staffers;
it was
                             Clinton's ill-conceived dedication to
                             Stephanopoulos that got him the "power and
                             celebrity" he so lusted after. (The same goes
for
                             James Carville, Mandy Grunwald, Paul Begala
                             and Dee Dee Myers, of course, except that none
                             of them have betrayed the man who plucked
                             them from obscurity.)

                            It's tough to figure out why, with all the
former
                            Clintonistas left for dead in the president's
wake,
                            Stephanopoulos survived -- especially given
the
                            many examples he cites of his incompetence,
his
                            White House-damaging egotism and his political
                            tone-deafness. As he falls asleep at the wheel
                            while Travelgate unfolds, supplies Woodward
                            with dirt for his book "The Agenda," complains
                            to a Treasury Department aide about the
                            appointment of a conservative judge to
                            investigate Whitewater -- I could go on -- you
                            can't help wondering why he wasn't fired years
                            ago.

                            His dark efficiency -- or plain brutality
is what
                            must have helped him retain his job. In an
                            attempt at complexity, he points to the "two
                            George Stephanopouloses -- Dr. Jekyll and Mr.
                            Hyde." He recalls a '92 incident when a former
                            campaign driver tried to get back at then-Gov.
                            Clinton after Stephanopoulos "forgot about" a
                            promise he'd made the driver to help out a
local
                            charity: "While the driver had a final word


    with
                        the [Nashua Telegraph] editorial board, his
                        daughter -- who couldn't have been older than
                        eight or nine -- waited for him in the lobby

                        Frayed from a month of crises, I approached
    the
                        driver's daughter on our way out:   'Your
    father,'    I
                        said, looking at her as if she were to blame
    for all
                        our troubles,   'is a really bad man.' I felt
    ashamed
                        the second the words escaped my mouth, but it
                        was too late. The girl just stared back at the
                        brutal zealot I'd become, and I couldn't argue
                        with her, or change the subject, or even spin
                        myself."

                        Here Stephanopoulos owns up to the Mr. Hyde
                        that his dedication to Clinton and his own
    ego had
                        turned him into. But he lets himself off too
    easy.
                        Telling an 8-year-old that her daddy (whom
                        Stephanopoulos had lied to about helping out a
                        charity, no less) is a "really bad man"
    doesn't
                        make him a "brutal zealot"; it makes him a
                        bullying asshole. I hope he doesn't think his
                        therapy is complete.

                        Insofar as Stephanopoulos reaches for
                        redemption through self-criticism, "All Too
                        Human" is galling in its insincerity. Before
    he
                        concludes Chapter 2, he has already made it
    clear
                        that by 1992 he'd accepted the necessity of
                        setting aside his liberal values and his
    altar-boy
                        morality to get a Democrat into the White
    House
                        and himself into power. Since he compromised
                        his own values seven years ago, his incessant
                        whining about Clinton's character now -- "if
    only
                        this good president had been a better man,"
    the
                        book concludes -- comes across as wussish,
                        immature and disingenuous. Only 53 pages into
                        the book, it hit me that the point of "All Too
                        Human" isn't "a political education" or
    personal
                        disillusionment or even treachery and
    tragedy. It's
                        money and marketing. Stephanopoulos, with his
                        reported $2.75 million book contract, is
    exploiting
                        the country's disgust and disappointment in


our
                     president as a career move.

                     As opportunistic, exploitative and phony as
                     Clinton can be at his lip-biting, tear-faking
worst,
                     at least he's managed to enact some effective
                     policies. Stephanopoulos is just trying to
make
                     money. The title "All Too Human" is purposely
                     ambiguous: Does it refer to Clinton or
                     Stephanopoulos? Either one of them has some
                     nerve lumping himself in with the rest of us
                     higher primates. "Better than a fly on the
wall,"
                     Little Brown's promotional materials promise,
                     attempting to whet our appetite for
                     Stephanopoulos' dish. I don't know about the
                     "better," but the insect part sounds about
right.
