BR/EK:

Don't know if these items merit a mention or heads up for tomorrow's
meeting, but I thought I'd mention them anyway.

(I) Crime Budget Hearing.  Ann Harkins called tonight to say that Senator
Hatch is pushing very hard for a DOJ budget oversight hearing the week of
3/22. This means that Bruce's suggestion for a month-long build-up of
crime events/leaks must be a priority for March.  We should think about
raising this at Senior Staff as soon as possible.

 (2) Cyber-stalking. In addition to the previously discussed announcements
for tomorrow's VAWA event, the VP will be directing DOJ to study
cyber-stalking and report back with some recommendations.  Folks asked me
late tonight for my "sign off" on this proposal.  I expressed that I was
fine withem doing it and didn't want to hold up their event, but that I
would not personally recommend getting out in front of this issue -- and
committing to a policy fix in the near-term -- without a clear sense of
what the recommendations would be. So, although I chose not to veto this
proposal, I wouldn't give it my seal of policy approval either. Mary and
I had both recommended to the VP's folks that they focus tomorrow's event
on VAWA II, not cyber-stalking, and helped them clear the Administration's
position in support of Biden's bill.  I only raise this because I know
you've had some exchanges w/Pat on DPC clearance, and because her staff
asked that I send you two an e-mail saying I was okay with the proposal.
Well, take this is as my last-minute, qualified okay to their proposed
study.
