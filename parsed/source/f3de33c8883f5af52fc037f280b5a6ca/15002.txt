TEXT:
Ken will be out of the office this afternoon and tomorrow & friday.   He
asked me to send you both a note regarding resolving a few issues by the
end of the week so that Stacy can give him an update early Monday.  I
believe the issue is food stamps-- WA State & voluntary workfare.

Stacy is flexible and will meet when you're free.  Elena -- I'm not sure
if you actaully need / want to sit in? or if this can be done between just
Stacy & Diana.

In any case, Ken's office will be available if you want to use it for the
meeting.
