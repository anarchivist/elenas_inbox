·   The White House Conference on School Safety. Although schools are generally safer
    today than they were just a few years ago -- and statistics show that students are safer
    sitting in a classroom than walking down a street -- there is still much more that we can
    do to improve school safety and security. In particular, the multiple shootings that took
    place in schools in Pearl, MS, Paducah, KY, Jonesboro, AK, and Springfield, OR, serve
    as painful reminders that no community is immune from senseless violence -- and that all
    communities must do their best to prevent such tragedies from ever occurring. The
    White House Conference on School Safety provides an opportunity for Americans to
    learn more about how they can make their own schools and communities safer.

·   Unveiling the First Annual Report on School Safety. At the conference, the President
    will unveil the first Annual Report on School Safety -- a report intended to give parents,
    principals and policy makers an accurate, yearly snapshot of the school crime, as well as
    to provide information on what practical steps they can take to make their schools safer.

    Major Findings of the Report:

           Students less likely to be victimized but more likely to feel unsafe. Although
           the number of multiple homicide events at schools has increased since 1993 (from
           2 to 6 -- and with 4 times as many victims), the overall school crime rate has
           actually dropped (from 164 crimes per 1,000 students in 1993 to about 128 such
           crimes in 1996). However, the percentage of students reporting that they felt
           unsafe at or on their way to school has increased.

           Most schools safer than community at large. While the overall level of school
           and non-school crime is about the same (about 3 million crimes in each setting),
           students are more than twice as likely to experience serious violent crime while
           out of school. And the very worst violent victimizations -- murders and suicides
           -- rarely occur in or near schools. Fewer than 1% of the 7,357 thousand children
           who were murdered in 1992-93 -- or 63 -- were killed at school.

           Serious crime and violence concentrated in a small percentage of schools.
           Only about 10% of public schools report serious or violent crimes to their local
           police departments. Nearly half -- or 47% -- of schools report less serious or
           non-violent crimes to police, and 43% report absolutely no crimes at all.

           Violence more likely in larger, urban schools and with older students. One
           third oflarge schools (1,000+ students) report serious violent crimes to police,
           compared with less than one tenth of small schools. Also urban schools are twice
           as likely as rural schools to report serious violent crimes, and middle and high
           schools are 4 times more likely than elementary schools to report such crimes.

           fights without weapons are the crimes most often reported to police by middle and
           high schools. Theft is the most common school crime overall. In 1996, less
           than 10% of crimes against students were of a serious or violent nature.

    Other Important Findings:

           Fewer weapons in schools. About 6% of high school seniors --less than in
           recent years -- are carrying firearms and other weapons to schools. Also, the
           percentage of seniors intentionally injured -- with or without weapons -- has not
           changed significantly over the past 20 years.

           Gang presence nearly doubled. Between 1989 and 1995, the percentage of
           students reporting the presence of street gangs in their schools increased from
           15% to 28% -- including large increases at urban, suburban and rural schools.

           Violence and drugs linked. Students who reported being the victims of violent
           crimes at schools were more likely to report the availability of drugs at school.
           The presence of gangs and guns is also related to school crime and the
           victimization of students.

           Teachers often crime victims. On average, 3% of teachers are the victims of
           violent crimes, and nearly 5% are the victims of theft at school.

·   The President's Call to Action. During a panel discussion with a group of recognized
    school safety advocates and youth violence experts, the President will announce a series
    of new initiatives that address many of the problems identified in the Annual Report on
    School Safety. Specifically, he will propose:

           (1) A New Federal Response for Violent Deaths in Schools. President Clinton
           will propose a $12 million School Emergency Response to Violence -- or Project
           SERV -- to help schools and local communities respond to school-related violent
           deaths, such as those that occurred last year in Jonesboro, Arkansas; Paducah,
           Kentucky; Pearl, Mississippi; and Springfield, Oregon. Developed with input
           from local officials and educators in these and other communities, Project SERV
           will enable the federal government to assist local communities in much the same
           way FEMA assists in response to natural disasters.

           (2) Targeted Resources for Schools with Serious Crime Problems. To help
           give the estimated 10% of schools with serious crime problems the tools they
           need to put the security of our children first, the President will announce a new
           $65 million initiative to hire 2,000 community police and School Resource
           Officers to work in schools -- and to train police, educators and other members of
           the community to help recognize the early warning signs of violence.

                                                      Helt,Dwnp Conversion
President Clinton will announce his plan for a significant overhaul of the nearly
$600 million Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Program. Under
the President's proposal, schools will be required to adopt rigorous,
comprehensive school safety plans that include: tough, but fair, discipline policies;
safe passage to and from schools; effective drug and violence policies; annual
school safety report cards; links to after school programs; efforts to involve
parents; and crisis management plans.

(4) A Community-Wide Response to School Safety and Youth Violence. To
help communities throughout the country promote a coordinated, comprehensive
response to school safety, the President will launch a new Safe Schools -- Safe
Communities initiative designed to help 10 cities develop and implement
community-wide school safety plans. A minimum of $25 million in discretionary
grants from the Departments of Education, Justice and Health and Human
Services -- or $1-3 million per site -- will be made available for this initiative.

The President will announce a partnership with MTV to engage youth in solutions
to violence. He will announce that MTV, beginning in 1999, will launch a
year-long media campaign -- "Fight For Your Rights: Take A Stand Against
Youth Violence" -- designed to give young adults a voice in the national debate on
school and youth violence. Working with the Departments of Education and
Justice, and the National Endowment for the Arts, MTV will distribute a Youth
Action Guide that aims to engage youth in mentoring and other positive solutions
to violence. The guide will be made available through a 1-800 number at the
Justice Department and through MTV.
