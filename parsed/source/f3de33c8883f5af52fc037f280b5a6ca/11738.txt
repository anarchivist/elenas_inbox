TEXT:
Here's info on one of the questions you asked re:definition of assistance.
We're working on others.  We're also checking w/ HHS whether there is
anything more up to date on the info below. In the meantime, bottom line
is there's very little subsidized employment going on, though a
significant amount of workfare (with about 1/3 of it concentrated in NY) .

How much subsidized employment is happening?
FY 1997 TANF data (the latest available) shows that of the 520,000 total
participants counting toward the work rates, 68% (354,000) were in
unsubsized employment, 1% (5,200) were in private or public subsidized
employment, and 17% (90,000) were in work experience or community
service.   The remainder were in job search, education or training.  The
major users of subsidized employment--which we would exclude from
assistance-- were NY (1,483), MO (663), and OR (462).  The major users of
work experience/community service--which we would include in assistance--
were NY (28,000), NJ (11,000), NC (ll,OOO), OH (8,812), MA (3,000), and WI
(3,000) .
