Here are some event possibilities for Dec-Jan. :

Title IX -- Same description as before.    Can be ready at any time.

After-school/social promotion -- We could preview this budget announcement.

Child Care/families -- We could preview the entire initiative.

Kids Aging Out of Foster Care -- We had hoped the First Lady would do an
event announcing the new budget initiatives on independent
living/transitional living/Medicaid for children aging out of the foster
care system. We could do the event with the President.
