 Message Creation Date was at 11-MAR-1997 21:23:00

 TO:   DIRECTOR FRANK RAINES
   DEPUTY DIRECTOR JACK LEW
   DEPUTY DIRECTOR JOHN KOSKINEN

 FROM: OMB LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS

 DATE: MARCH 11, 1997

 SUBJECT:   LEGISLATIVE REPORT


 The House Rules Committee today took up ,H.Res. 89, sponsored by Reps Sununu
 (R-NH) and Granger (R-TX) and Pitts (R-PA).   The Resolution would require the
 President to submit a budget by April 7th that is based on CBO economic and
 technical assumptions, does not sunset the tax cuts, cuts a "significant"
 proportion of the total savings in the first three years, and extends the
 Medicare Trust fund for a "substantial" period. The Committee adopted a closed
 rule (no amendments), allowing 2 hours debate the resolution and one motion to
 recommit.

 The House will consider H.Res. 89 tomorrow.   The Republican leadership blocked
 efforts by Democratic Coalition members (Mr. Minge D-MN and Mr. Stenholm D-TX)
 to offer an amendment which would also require the Congress to submit a
 budget.  Tauscher, Stenhom and Minge are, however, circulating a O&Dear
 ColleagueOS letter to Chairman Kasich for DemocratsO, signature, asking
 Republicans to submit their own balanced budget proposal.   The resolution is
 expected to pass, possibly with a handful of Democratic votes -- mostly
 moderate Democrats.   (Please call our office at 5-4790 if you need a copy of
 the Resolution or the Coalition MembersO, proposed amendment.)

 The House Budget Committee held a hearing today on the President's FY 1998
 Budget.  Secretary Rubin testified on behalf of the Administration, and OMB
 Deputy Jack Lew accompanied him.  Chairman Kasich continued to hit the
 Administration on the $24 billion increase in the deficit in FY 1998, the $69
 billion deficit in 2002, and the 98% backloading of the cuts.  He also touted
 the historical accuracy of the CBO's economic assumption vs. the OMBO,s and
 reiterated CBOO,s claim that they have been more accurate than OMB seven of the


 last 10 times . . The Chairman again stated that the shift of certain home health
 services to Part B will put an increased burden on the nation's children.
 Secretary Rubin explained that, of the $24 billion difference in estimates betw
 een CBO and OMB in FY 1998, $15 billion is due to technical differences and $10
 billion is due to policy estimate differences.    The Republicans continued to
 cast the Administration's economic assumptions as "rosy" because they are less
 conservative than the CBOD,s. Mr. Spratt focused on the difference between the
 CBO and OMB in estimating profit shares, which Secretary Rubin said was
 approximately 2/3rds of the difference between the two estimates. Mr.
 McDermott and other Committee Democrats noted that there are only 13
 legislative days before the April 15th deadline for a budget resolution.

 The Senate Budget Committee held a hearing today on the House Coalition Budget.
 Chairman Domenici announced that the Committee will begin marking up the bill
 next Wednesday, March 18th, but will not hold votes.  Both sides generally
 praised the CoalitionD,s budget as credible and as serving as a catalyst to
 move the budget process forward.

 The House/Senate DC Appropriations/Authorization Subcommittee held a joint
 hearing today with five mayors from cities that had financial problems to
 determine what lessons could be applied the the financial situation in the
 District.

 Director Raines testified today before the House AppropriationsD, Treasury,
 Postal Service, and General Government Subcommittee on the Budget ..
