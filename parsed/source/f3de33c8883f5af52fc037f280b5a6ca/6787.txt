                                       March 23, 1998                    Hex-Dump Conversion


Question:       The Administration has pointed to the decline in welfare caseloads as a sign
                that welfare reform is working, yet a story in today's Washington Post says
                one of the main reasons people are leaving the rolls is that they are being
                sanctioned. Do you consider this a success? '

Answer:         One of the principles of the welfare reform law enacted in August 1996 is
                personal responsibility. Establishing fair, firm and credible consequences if
                people fail to follow the rules is an important part of the new approach. Different
                people react differently to sanctions. For some people, sanctioning may be a step
                                                         I
                along the way to work. Data from several state studies finds that after being
                sanctioned, about half the people are working and approximately 40 percent have
                an increase in their income. Several states also found that one-quarter to
                one-third of those sanctioned returned to the rolls, presumably after complying
                with the requirements.

                While some states do appear to be increasing their u~e of sanctions, it is too early
                to confirm this trend on a national basis. HHS is still compiling state data under
                the new welfare reform reporting system. According to HHS, in 1993 and 1995
                33% and 32% of cases were closed for failure to comply with procedural
                requirements and the preliminary figure for October 1996 to June 1997 was 38%.

Question:       The Post article cited a women in Tennessee who was sanctioned even though
                she had back problems. Isn't it unfair to require someone like that to work?

                Federal law requires states to put 30 percent of recipients to work this year (a
                figure which rises to 50 percent by the year 2002) and gives states considerable
                flexibility in how they apply these work rules. According to a recent survey by
                the American Public Welfare Association, most states waive sanctions when a
                person has good cause for not complying, with disability, incapacity or illness the
                most frequently cited reason for good cause (by 31 states). In addition, low
                income individuals whose disabilities prevent them from working can receive
            "
                assistance under the federal SSI program, for which the work rules do not apply.


Question:       Today's New York Times cites evidence in New York that only one-third of
                those leaving the rolls are actually working. Are you disappointed by these
                results?

Answer:         While we haven't seen this preliminary New York State data, we do know
                that a number of other states have had much better results, finding between
                between 50% and 60% of those leaving the rolls were working. In an effort
                to give states strong incentives to help as many recipients go to work as
                possible, HHS recently released formal guidance on the High Performance
                Bonus that will award $200 million a year to the states who have the most success
                in placing people in jobs and ensuring that welfare recipients succeed in jobs once
                they get them, by remaining employed and seeing their earnings climb over time.

                                                                                                       /
                                                                                                       (-
