TEXT:
Groups rep. who have been involved in our discussions on public charge
have requested that we consult with them prior to publication of the
public charge proposed regulation and INS field guidance.     In light our
our legal constraints, we consulted with OIRA and they advised us that it
would appropriate for a group to meet with INS to review the draft INS
field guidance. The INS meeting would be followed with a meeting with WH
and OMB staff to hear from the group reps their .comments on the draft
public charge guidance.   This meeting would be a very small group of
people who have met previously on this issue.     The meetings will likely
take place next week. I will let you know when they are scheduled.
