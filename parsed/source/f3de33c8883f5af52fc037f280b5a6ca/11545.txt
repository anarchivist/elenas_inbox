          TEXT:
          I wanted to let you both know that I have submitted the attached
          scheduling proposal for the President to participate in a bipartisan event
          on Patients' Bill of Rights before Congress adjourns for the Easter Recess
           (Mar. 26).

          I wanted to ask you both about the several events we have pending, and
          what our priority order is for those events. My understanding is that the
          following message slots are open for March:

          March 12                  Radio Address    Taping
          March 19                  Message Event
                                    Radio Address    Taping
          March   23                Message Event    (T)
          March   25                Message Event,    Cincinnati, OH
          March   26                Radio Address    Taping
          March   31                Message Event

          These are the events I believe we have pending and/or are time sensitive:

          Gun Directive (possibly next week's radio address?)
          Unveil 21st Century Crime Bill (aim for w/o March 29 -- hopefully the open
          March 31st spot)

          We also have the two requests in that need to be done at about the same
          time.  Do either of you have a strong feeling about which one is a higher
          priority for us?
          Bipartisan Congressional Event on PBOR (we talked about doing this before
          Congress adjourns on March 26)
          Release DoEd's Guide to Ending Social Promotions (I understand that
          Education needs to get this out in the first part of March unless we
          schedule an event)

          Please also let me know if there are other announcements out there that
          are high priority for us.

          Thanks!==================== ATTACHMENT        1 ====================

SCHEDULING PROPOSAL                                  TODAY'S DATE: 3/2/99



      _ _ _ACCEPT     _ _ _REGRET                    _ _ _P.ENDING



TO:                   Stephanie Streett
                      Assistant to the President
                      Director of Presidential Scheduling

FROM:                 Bruce Reed
                      Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy and
                      Director of the Domestic Policy Council

                      Chris Jennings
                      Deputy Assistant to the President for Health Policy

REQUEST:              Patients' Bill of Rights Event with Members of Congress to
                      highlight bipartisan support for a comprehensive strong
                      patients' bill ofrights.

PURPOSE:              To demonstrate the bipartisan support for a strong
                      comprehensive Patients' Bill of Rights. This event would
                      underscore the many similar patient protections that are
                      contained in some of the Republican and Democratic
                      PBOR bills under consideration in the Congress. It would
                      also highlight that there is bipartisan support for a
                      comprehensive approach, rather than the piecemeal
                      approach that some Republicans on the Hill have been
                      advocating.

                      This cvent would also highlight that many of the consumer
                      and provider groups that might be thought to be supportive
                      of a piecemeal approach in fact advocate a comprehensive
                      bill. For example, the emergency physicians and ob-gyns
                      could underscore that they do not want to see a bill that has
                      their specific provisions, but rather a strong comprehensive
                      bill.

BACKGROUND:           Last year the President consistently urged the Congress to
                      pass a strong enforceable Patients' Bill of Rights through
                      numerous events and speeches. Several versions PBOR
                      legislation have been introduced on the Hill this year,
                                                                           Automated Records Management System
                                                                                   Hex-Dump Conve;:;ion


                                      including bills by Dingell-Kennedy, Congressman Ganske,
                                      and Senators Chafee and Graham. These bills contain many
                                      similar patient protections and illustrates that there is
                                      bipartisan support to pass a strong enforceable Patients'
                                      Bill of Rights.
