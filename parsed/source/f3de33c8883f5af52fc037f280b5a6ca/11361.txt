Subject:         Further revised ed-flex SAP

The version below has been reviewed by Barbara Chow. While there are
still some questions, please provide your comments on this version. Given
the uncertain timing, our goal is to reach agreement on the text Wed.
morning to allow time for final OMB policy level and White House
clearance.  If there is still a lack of clarity about the manager's
amendment, OMB recommends using option #1.  Please respond asap on Wed.
Thanks.

DRAFT       NOT FOR RELEASE
           February 23, 1999
           (Senate)

S. 280 - Education Flexibility Partnership Act of 1999
(Sen. Frist (R) TN and 33 others)

The Administration has long supported the concept of expanding ed-flex
demonstration authority to permit all States to waive certain statutory
and regulatory requirements of Federal education.
[ OPTION #1 The Administration will support S. 280 as long as
accountability provisions of the bill are strengthened to ensure that
State waivers of Federal requirements enhance childrenD,s educational
achievement. 1

   OPTION #2 The Administration supports Senate passage of S. 280 only if
the Senate adopts the pending manager's substitute that would strengthen
the accountability provisions of the bill, to ensure that children's
educational achievement is enhanced by State waivers of Federal


requirements. ]

The Administration also urges adoption of an amendment that would [
terminate State plans automatically at the time of implementation of the
reauthorized Elementary and Secondary Education Act ] [sunset ed-flex
once ESEA is (reauthorized?) to ensure consistency between ed flex waiver
provisions and ESEA provisions stressing accountability] [ED: please
help draft something appropriate     [note: this sentence has not yet been
approved by ED or DPC.]

S. 280 is [ generally] consistent with the President's call for expansion
of Ed-Flex in a manner that will promote high standards and accountability
for results, coupled with increased flexibility for States and local
school districts to achieve those results.

The Administration strongly supports an amendment that is expected to be
offered to S. 280 that would implement the President's proposal for a
long-term extension of the one-year authority to help school districts
reduce class size in the early grades, which the Congress approved last
year on a bipartisan basis.  In order to hire qualified teachers, arrange
for additional classrooms, and take other steps that are necessary to
reduce class size, school districts need to know, as soon as possible,
that the Congress intends to support this initiative for more than one
year.
