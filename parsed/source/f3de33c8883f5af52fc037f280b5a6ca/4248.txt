TEXT:
The meeting for Gil and Erskine is scheduled for this Friday at 2pm.
Erskine needs a memo tonight on why he's doing this meeting (it is ok if a
more detailed comes to him.) We can probably just turn in the old memo.
If you would like to add a cover note, it could say something like the
following:
"Gil just recently won re-election as National President of the FOP.   It
was a very tight race for him, and he received a lot of criticism for his
close relationship with the White House.  He asked for a meeting with the
President to discuss the collective bargaining issue because it remains
one of the FOP's highest priorities and he feels the President has not
followed through on his commitment to get it done.  Because this is still
a pending issue, we felt it would be better for you to meet with Gil inste
ad of the President. "
