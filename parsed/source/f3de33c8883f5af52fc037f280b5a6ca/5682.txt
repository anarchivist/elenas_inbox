TEXT:
BR:

Pursuant to your question last week as to whether or not we need to do
more on COPS, I've changed my mind. We should take the lead in pulling
together the new Associate AG, OMB and others and pushing them to
aggressively resolve whatever issues we have. We shouldn't wait for them
to come up w/answers. DOJ and OMB have already made clear that their
interests are much narrower than ours here -- and we need to instill a
little COPS religion into them again. I'll work w/John Hart in setting up
a meeting for just after the New Year.

I heard that the new Associate AG met w/Rahm recently, and -- based on
DOJ's "settle for 70,000 cops" attitude -- suggested that he was ready to
work w/Rahm on an "exit strategy" for the 100,000 cops.  You can imagine
Rahm's response.  Our meeting will give the new Associate AG an
opportunity to redeem himself.

Jose'
