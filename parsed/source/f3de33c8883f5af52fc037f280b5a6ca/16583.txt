 TEXT:
 Memo from Sylvia Mathews & Judy Winston:

 We will hold a brainstorming session Saturday morning, August 9, at the
 White House in room 180 OEOB from 8:30 - 10:30 a.m.  Why Saturday?
 Saturday will give us an opportunity to be unencumbered by pagers, phones
 and faxes and will offer a time when we are a bit fresh so that our brains
 can storm. Why a brainstorming session? As we enter the third month of
 this.year-long process, we need to focus on the following goals:

   helping to generate ideas, define a clear message and develop measures
 of success for a work plan; and

  discussing the processes that will maximize resources and cooperation
 between White House staff and Race Initiative staff.

 This meeting will also give the Race Initiative Staff and the White House
 staff a chance to start working together.

 Maria and Minyon are working on a plan to reach out to people who have
 previously offered their input on the race initiative. During this week,
 we will work to reach out to these folks for their ideas, which could be
 incorporated into our Saturday session.

 Prior to the Saturday, we will provide you with paper to help you do a
 little pre-brainstorming on your own.  We will also devise a framework so
 that the Saturday morning discussion is a fruitful one.
