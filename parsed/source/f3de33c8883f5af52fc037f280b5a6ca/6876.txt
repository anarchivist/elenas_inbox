Peter Jacoby said that he has reserved 6 .seats for the markup      tomorrow for
Adminsitration officials.   He is presuming that Elena will go,      and some
combination of representatives from HHS/FDA and Treasury. He        also
suggested Cynthia Rice.   Do you have any preference as to who      should go?
