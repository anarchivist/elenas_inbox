TEXT:
I've been touching base with Attorneys General other than Moore/Greggiore
and wanted you to know that most don't care that we've worked the tobacco
spending issues with the Govs - and most are grateful the package is more
state friendly than the June 20 agreement.

please remember that while Mike has a profile and singular importance (and
willingness to stay totally engaged), he doesn't speak for even a majority
of his colleagues on most of these issues. We have to and should deal
with him as the prinipal AG negotiator - but he overplays his hand.
