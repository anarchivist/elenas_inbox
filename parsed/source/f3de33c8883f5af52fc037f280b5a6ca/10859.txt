HERE YOU GO ELENA.   I THINK JOHN P. WOULD WANT MOST OF THIS, BUT I DEFER
TO YOU;

Update on Senator BreauxD,s new Medicare restructuring proposal. On
Friday, Senator Breaux released his draft working plan on Medicare
reform. Although the 6-page outline has some positive or potentially
positive concepts, it has infuriated most Democrats, largely because of
its weak guarantee of defined benefits, its increase in the eligibility
age (without any commensurate policy to guard against an increase in the
uninsured population), and its lack of
a prescription drug benefit. This has led to an almost uncontrollable
sense of mistrust of the Senator, who had promised Democrats more input
into the document prior to any release.
The Democrats perceive much of the Breaux plan to be little more than the
approach that is being advocated by Congressman Thomas.  In addition,
because we have not openly criticized Senator BreauxD,s plan, there is a
growing feeling amongst the Democrats that the Administration may be
sending (implicit or explicit) signals that we find his package to be
acceptable. Moreover, many Democrats (wrongly) fear that Laura Tyson and
Stuart Altman would support BreauxD,s current proposal.  Because of the
DemocratsD, reaction, Senator Breaux is now publicly saying that he
personally would like to see that the program has a prescription drug
benefit. Although this will be generally welcomed by the Democrats, they
will likely take a D&we will believe it when we see itD8 position.   With
each new conflict with the Democrats, Senator Breaux can be expected to
request our assistance to both develop a more viable policy for him and to
help attract Democratic support for the CommissionD,s recommendation.   We
will need to make a determination with you as to the best way to respond
to the potentially conflicting desires of Senator Breaux and the base
Democrats, as well as to decide whether it is in our interest to use the
Commission to provide cover for some potentially controversial ideas for
Medicare reform.

Stem cell update.   On January 19th, Dr. Varmus testified that the General
Counsel for the Department of Health and Human Services ruled that the
Congressional ban on human embryo research does not apply to stem cell
research, since the cells cannot be considered embryos as they do not have
the capacity to deyelop into a human being. This ruling, which means that
Federally financed researchers will soon be able to work on human
embryonic stem cells, was well received by Congressional Democrats, the
scientific community, and advocates for the aging, who are intrigued by
the potential this research has to provide cures for diseases like


diabetes and AlzheimerD,s. The only opposition came from expected sources
-- the Catholic Bishops, who fear this new research will create incentives
for additional abortions, and the American Society for Reproductive
Medicine, who was critical that we did not take the position of repealing
the ban on fetal research altogether.  We believe that the roll-out went
as planned and that you are positioned on this issue in a way that avoids
controversy and allows for continued scientific advance in these critical
areas.
