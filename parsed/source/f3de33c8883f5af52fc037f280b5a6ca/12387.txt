          TEXT:
          Here are the remaining issues that either    Tanya, Bethany, and I have been
          pushing with Education that have not been    agreed-to, or that we need to
          confirm. We dropped other concerns that      they opposed because they just
          weren't a big enough deal.  If you are Ok    with these, we'd like to raise
          at today's 2pm.

          1) Troops to Teachers:

          a) The Name of the program. We suggested that the name of the program be
          changed from "Transition to Teaching" to "Troops to Teachers: Transition
          to Teaching". Education reponded that they would rather not, and Mike
          reiterated that in last week's meeting, stating that this is primarily
          about other mid-career professionals not troops. This is NOT consistent
          with agreements we worked out with ann O'Leary and other ED staff that
          about half of these $ would be used for Troops.

          b) Who gets the $ for Troops. Currently, it is not clear to whom the $
          for the expanded Troops program -- including the stipends and other
          support -- would be given. Right now, the language only appears to
          envision a $1 million contract from Education to Defense and no mechanism
          or language for providing the larger amount needed, to expand the program.

          2) Title II and Title I. --permitting alternative certification like Teach
          for America,high quality alternative certification programs . Right now,
          the bill would say that states need to get within 4 years 95% of their
          teachers in public schools a) certified, or b) have a college degree and
          are enrolled in a program (including an alternative certification program)
          leading to full certification in their field within two years) .

          This will be problematic for teach for America and high-quality
          alternative certification programs that do not lead to certification
          within 2 years.   We recommended saying teachers could be considered
          "qualified" if they have a college degree and are in alternative
          certification programs determined by the state or school district to
          provide qualified teachers with the training and support needed to succed
          in the classroom.    Education said no to this.


          3)Report cards.   We suggested changing language to require comparisons of
r


    progress made by the school in improving the achievement of its students.
    These demonstrated gains are often a more accurat reflection of the
    school's improvement thatn a straight comparison of overall performance to
    other schools. Education initially said no, though Ann O"Leary seemed to
    be OK with it i


    4) Safe and Drug-Free Schools. - Alternative placements. Are we ok with
    requiring schools to provide alternative education placements for students
    suspended under the Gun-Free schools act?

    5) Tobacco. Make sure that OMB/ED have fix on the tobacco issue suggested
    by Cythina Rice that Elena ok'd. i.e. requiring that schools and school
    events be tobacco, drug and alcohol free.

    6) Bilingual -- OMB has raised two concerns about the implementation of
    the three-year goal in Title VII that we share. Moreover, make sure that
    Education put in langauge reflecting our agreement about the use of
    english-language tests.
