    I guess the time is finally here when we need to confront how to
    handle the veto of HR1833.
    We expect the House to pass the Senate version of the bill on
    Wednesday or Thursday. Depending on how fast the bill is enrolled
    and forwarded from the Hill, we will have to veto it most likely
    some time in the next two weeks.
    The decision as to how to veto will obviously be sensitive, and
    numerous people will have opinions on time, place and manner.   Do
    you want to ask Alexis if she wants to call a meeting this week to
    discuss.  I think Don Baer, Todd Stern, Counsel's office among


others need to be involved in the conversation. Harold should
probably be consulted as well.
Please let me know what you and Alexis discuss.
