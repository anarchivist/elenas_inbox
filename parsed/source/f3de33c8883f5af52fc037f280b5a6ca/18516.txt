Here's a draft answer back to McCain. McCain's letter stressed the need
for specific Administration legislation. This is a general answer with an
explanation of the core elements approach that Tarplin is fine with.
Tarplin asked that we not specify that it is Donna we would send up to the
hearings just commit to a representative.==================== ATTACHMENT   1 =======

Dear Senator McCain,

        Thank you for your letter regarding the need for tobacco legislation to improve the health
of our nation's youth. I believe comprehensive tobacco legislation offers a unique opportunity
to impose a system of controls on tobacco companies and limit the devastating effects of
cigarettes on our nation.

         I agree with you that building a consensus will be critical if we are to enact legislation
that is in the best interest of the nation. The effort to protect the health of America's youth is not
a Democratic or Republican issue, but a public health issue, and one of our country's highest
priorities. I am glad that you have scheduled hearings on this important issue, and I can assure
you that my Administration will cooperate to the fullest extent possible. I will make appropriate
representatives of my Administration available for your hearings and to answer any questions you
might have.

        As you may know, when I announced my plan for comprehensive tobacco legislation, I
noted five key elements that I said must be at the heart of any national tobacco legislation. I
took this approach because I wanted to identify the elements that I believe must be at the core of
the legislation, and then to work closely with you and the rest of Congress to develop bipartisan
legislation that incorporates these elements. I have told my staff that they should be available to
meet anytime and anywhere to discuss this issue and provide whatever assistance is useful to
work with you in reducing teen smoking. I am confident that together we will avoid
counterproductive partisan disputes and, as you note in your letter, build a vital consensus on this
issue.

        Again, thank you for your commitment to this legislation. I look forward to working
closely with you. Together, I believe we will be able to enact comprehensive bipartisan tobacco
legislation this year.


                                               Sincerely
