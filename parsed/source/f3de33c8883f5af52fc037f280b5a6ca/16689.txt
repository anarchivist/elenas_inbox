TEXT:
Per Bruce, I spoke with Dan Gerstein (sp?) with Sen. Lieberman's staff
this week regarding the Senator's interest in getting the administration's
full request of $100 M for charter schools in the Labor H bill.   He said
that Lieberman is fully committed on this and is going to do it, although
finding offsets "will be tough" and they will need help.  He has started
checking around with other offices, thinks they might get help from Kerrey
(I presume Bob), Gorton, and Coats; don't think he has gotten a read from
Specter or Harkin's people yet ....

We agreed that someone from here should talk with him the last week of
August.

-- Bill
