TEXT:
The meeting went ok; it sounds like the meeting with members of Congress
will be structured to respond to concerns they specifically raise. The
law enforcement issue is not likely to get raised on the short list of
their concerns.   Erskine seemed a bit hesitant ·to independently raise the
directive until he sees it and before it gets signed.

I will provide the TPs and a Q&A on the law enforcement issue which can
be included if they think it is useful. Thanks.
