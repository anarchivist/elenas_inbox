MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

SUBJECT:               Auto Choice

Overview

        The purpose of the memorandum is to provide you with information on auto-insurance
reform and the "Auto Choice" legislation introduced last April by a bipartisan coalition of
Members of Congress. Over the last several months, a NEC-DPC inter-agency working group
has spent considerable time analyzing the Auto Choice proposal and reviewing other
auto-insurance reform options. It is the strong view of the working group that the benefits of
the various Auto Choice proposals considered by the working group do not justify the cost.

        Despite the claims by proponents of Auto Choice that it will reduce insurance
premiums by approximately $250 per year for the average driver, the working group found little
support that no-fault insurance would lead to lower rates. The three states that currently mandate
insurance companies to offer no-fault insurance plans (New Jersey, Kentucky, and Pennsylvania),
have some of the highest rates in the country. Auto Choice will also benefit bad drivers at the
cost of good drivers. In addition, economists argue that if Auto Choice does induce some
reduced premiums, more people will drive leading to more accidents, increased environmental
degradation, and greater strain on our infrastructure.

Background

          "No-fault" insurance, in its broadest sense, is defined as any auto insurance program that
_allows policyholders to recover financial losses from their own insurance company, regardless of
 fault. In its strictest form, no-fault applies only to state laws that both provide for the payment
  of no-fault first-party benefits and restrict the right to sue. "Pure" no-fault proposals go one step
  further, abolishing the right to sue in the majority of cases.

       Under current state-level no-fault laws, motorists may sue for severe injuries and for pain
and suffering only if the case meets certain conditions. These conditions, known as a
"threshold," relate to the severity of injury. They may be expressed in verbal terms (a
descriptive or verbal threshold) or in dollar amounts of medical bills (a monetary threshold).
Some laws also include the days of disability incurred as a result of the accident.

AnaJysis

         The working group has considered three options. The first is the Auto Choice
legislation introduced by Senators McConnell and Moynihan and Representative Arrney, Under
this proposal,drivers in states who accept the new federal legislation have a choice between the
existing system in their state and a strict no-fault plan (called 'personal protection insurance'
(PPI). A driver who chooses the PPI option gets first-party coverage for economic damages
(mostly medical and lost wages), without regard to fault; a PPI driver can sue or be sued for
economic damages above policy limits. PPI drivers cannot sue or be sued for non-economic
damages ('pain and suffering'), although exceptions are m(jde for accidents involving drug or
alcohol abuse. A driver who opts to stay in the state's current tort system must purchase tort
maintenance coverage (TMC) to cover accidents with PPI drivers.

        The second proposal was developed by CEA to achieve the same ends as Auto Choice --
lower premiums -- but to do so while reducing environmental and human costs. The CEA
proposal would amend the Auto Choice to require insurance companies to offer premiums on a
per-mile basis. Per-mile premiums would be charged based on an estimate of miles, with a
rebate or surcharge issued every year aftenm odometer reading. Odometers could be read at
existing emissions or safety inspections or by firms under contract with insurance companies.
Insurance companies would compete in their per-mile premium, subject to current regulations;
premiums would consequently vary with region, driving record, type of car, and safety features,
much as premiums vary now.

        The third proposal would attack the major reason for high insurance costs, fraud. Under
this proposal, we would announce support for legislation that would 1) increase penalties on
lawyers and doctors who participate in auto insurance fraud claims, including possibly taking
away licenses to practice law or medicine; 2) encourage insurance companies to install V-Chips
into odometers so they could check the mileage of drivers at random and reduce premiums for
those who drive less and increase premiums for those who drive more.

        One problem with all three proposals is that none of them guarantee that insurance
companies will pass on savings to consumers. In many states that currently have no-fault
insurance systems, there is little evidence that over the long-tenrt consumers saved compared to
the period when no-fault was not mandated. In addition, the Per-Mile Premium and V-Chip
proposals could be perceived as big government intervention into insurance regulation while the
Auto Choice and Per-Mile Premium proposals represent Federal involvement in an area that
traditionally has been the responsibility of states governments.

        The McConnell-Armey legislation will be strongly opposed by the trial lawyers, and
possibly State governments. We expect environmentalists and auto safety groups to also oppose
this legislation. Opponents may attack the legislation for creating a national auto insurance
system like New Jersey's (with the highest rates in the country). Proponents of the legislation
will argue the legislation will give every driver a $200 break on their auto insurance rates.

Recommendation

      The NEC, DPC, Office of White House Counsel, and the Office of the Vice President
recommend you withhold (oppose ?) support for Auto Choice legislation.
