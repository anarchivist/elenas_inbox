     I'd be glad to talk to him about tobacco.  If you want, I can do the
     health care bill of rights too, but chris jennings would be better.

     David is an editorial writer for the Oregonian and will be in town the
     first week of march.  He is a really good guy.  He wants to talk with
     either one of you about HMO-Health Care Bill of Rights & tobacco.  He met
     with Bruce a few years ago (I think).  Pls let me know if you're available


    or whom I should work with in your shop to schedule something with him and
    either one of you.   Thanks!
