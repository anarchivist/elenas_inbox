TEXT:
With the cloture vote Monday at 5pm, we are trying to see if we can get
time on the VP's schedule to come out and make a statement on the
importance of the vote sometime on Monday.   While Pat Ewing and I are
checking on these issues within OVP, I wanted to make sure you 1) still
agree that this makes sense, and 2) see if you had a view on which option
makes the most sense:

a) The VP could make a statement somewhere in the White House-- Pat Ewing
was musing about the idea of him going to the briefing room.

b) The VP could go to the hill.  Kennedy, Murray, and Daschle are meeting
with the education groups at 1:30pm, and Murray's office raised the idea
with Broderick of the VP going to this meeting. The debate on the class
size amendment would then begin at 3pm.   Before proceeding down this
path, Broderick would want to check with Daschle's people, and I'd want to
check with Ron on feasibility and desirability for the VP.
