TEXT:
FYI, I hear Steve Goodin has called a meeting tomorrow on MLK Day and the
race initiative in his new role working for Sylvia. Race initiative staff
will be there.  I will go, and hope Julie can, too, but thought you would
want to know about it.

The President's comment on our weekly said we should look into the "more
creative" ideas that Steve Waldman suggested -- black and white churches
working together on drug addiction, or Hispanic and non-Hispanic high
schools. working on low-income housing renovation.    I've asked the
Corporation to think about this. He also asks about involving Powell; to
do so, we'd probably need a child focus of some sort.
