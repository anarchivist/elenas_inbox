    MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

    FROM:         Elena Kagan, Katie McGinty, and Kathleen Wallman

    SUBJECT:      Executive Order to Protect Children
                  from Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks


            This memorandum responds to questions and concerns that you raised in
    generally approving the proposed Executive Order directing agencies to enhance their
    efforts to protect children from environmental health and safety risks. The Executive
    Order currently is scheduled for announcement by the Vice President on Monday, April
    21.

            We have attached a copy of the page containing your notes. First, you
    suggested changes to Section 5 of the order, which requires agencies to consider risks
    to children in the analysis supporting their major regulations, to make this provision less
    burdensome. White House agencies revised the language according to your
    suggestion, and the revised portion of the text is attached with changes indicated. You
    should know that your changes were extremely well-received by the agencies, and have
    helped assuage remaining concerns about implementation of this proVision.

           Second, you asked whether the Vice President's office had reviewed and is
    supporting the order. We are happy to report that the Vice President strongly supports
    the order and is currently planning to be part of its announcement.

          If the proposed changes are satisfactory to you, we will proceed with issuance of
    the Executive Order.
