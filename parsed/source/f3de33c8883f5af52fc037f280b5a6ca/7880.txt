Subject:         The Lugar "compromise"

The Lugar compromise is not really a compromise, and I meant to send it to
you, but I will type it here in its entirity and word for word:

" * Three years of Title XV payments at Lugar levels -- Short delay in
its implementation
    *    Some additional community development money after buyout is
complete
      * End program"
I'm not sure there is much to work with'there, I don't think they are
really serious.
