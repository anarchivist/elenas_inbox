  Kris --

  Thanks for forwarding me this info, Kris.      Let me know if there is anything
  we should do in anticipation of an event.

  Also, as some of you know, the Black and Hispanic Caucuses have raised
  major
  concerns with the President's ideas on social promotion.  I understand
  there's a meeting over there on it today and people from ED will be there
  to
  express our, and particularly, my concerns.  Remember that we did not
  adequately address similar concerns raised by these groups on the national
  test ?nd we not only didn't get their support, but their lack of support
  was
  unhelpful in trying to get it through.  You'll all remember, I believe,
  that


       the majority used the fact the POTUS' own base wasn't supporting the test
       to
       help defeat it. Already, there have been editorials and articles in
       newspapers around the country on how ending social promotion will
       disparately and disproportionally affect minority children. Whatever the
       merits are or are not of those arguments, we cannot dismiss the groups'
       concerns. We learned the hard way last time that the Black Caucuses'
       votes,
       particularly, ended up counting much higher than their actual number.

       Anyway, for what it's worth -- that's my two cents.

       Leslie Thornton

       FYI.  In our Cabinet report this week, POTUS noted that he "should probably
       do an event on ending social promotion - good to raise profile".
