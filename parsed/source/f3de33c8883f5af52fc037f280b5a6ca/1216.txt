NORA members began the meeting by thanking the Administration and the
President for their leadership on AIDS issues in the first term, citing
funding increases, Presidential leadership , and unprecedented access to
the White House and Federal Agencies. They then presented us with a
rundown of the current t state of the epidemic and a series of public
opinion polls showing support for further action in the areas of AIDS
treatment, Vaccine development,  Needle Exchange Programs (NEP) , and
Pediatric drug development.

Specific Points of Interest:

*       They strongly encouraged the Administration to lift the ban on
use of Federal funds for        needle exchange programs. NASTAD
mentioned that there are NEPs in 28 states.     Podesta asked about
ARMS                                                                        Page 2 of2


the National Governors' Association position on NEPs. While      NGA does not
have a position on NEPs the u.s. Conference of Mayors and the National
         Conference of Black States Legislators are on record in support of
NEPs   (as well as       the AMA, GAO, 10M Committee, American Nurses
Association) .

*      . While pleased that the President has requested increased funding
for AIDS programs,       they believe there is a much greater need.  In
particular, they mentioned the AIDS Drug         Assistance Programs
(ADAP) in title II of the Ryan White CARE Act (RWCA).

*       NORA would like to see the subject of HIV/AIDS addressed in the
public service
        announcements being developed by ONDCP and NIDA (HHS).

*       Pregnant women and children have impaired access to protease
inhibitors and many     other drugs because they are not approved for
use in those groups, nor have there
        been dosing studies done on pediatric populations.

*       They are concerned about the office of National AIDS Policy not
having the staffing     support needed to play a strong role in
orchestrating a national effort to fight the            epidemic on
all fronts.  They also felt the coordinating ability across Agencies in
HHS     was not supported in the AIDS office atHHS.

*       They are unhappy with eh proposed Medicaid per capita cap.

*       They continue to support the Adm support of the Office of AIDS
Research at NIH

*       They want more AIDS expertise in the Domestic Policy Council,
the Office of Legislative      Affairs and other parts of the White
House.
