TO:            Poverty Measurement Working Group

FROM:          Rebecca Blank

Because I thought there were still some misunderstandings in our meeting last Tuesday, I want to
provide a little background information and make a suggestion about how OMB should proceed
as it puts together some simulations of program effects.

Let me start with two comments that I believe might need clarifying:

(1) The primary way in which changes in the poverty measurement will affe<?t program spending
is through changes in the Guidelines, the simplified poverty thresholds published by HHS. In
fact, most programs (and ALL the big programs) that are tied in any way to poverty measurement
are tied to the Guidelines. Since the Guidelines are NOT the same as the poverty thresholds
used by Census to calculate the actual poverty rate, but are tabulated by HHS and include a
variety of changes to those thresholds, it is impossible to simulate the program effects ofa
change in poverty measurement without making some assumptions about what sort of Guidelines
HHS would issue under an alternative measure ofpoverty.

(2) There is no consistency across programs in how family income and eligibility is calculated.
In fact, it's quite amazing how very inconsistent even quite similar programs are. Programs
have dealt with the fact that they care about different income levels and concepts in part by using
different multiples of the poverty guidelines as part of their eligibility determination -- some
programs use 100%, some use 135%, some use 185%, etc. This means that conceptually it
really doesn't matter what the guidelines are because programs can always use whatever multiple
they find most convenient. Of course, in the real world, programs have specifically enacted
legislation that commits them to (say) setting the upper level of eligibility at households whose
countable income for that specific program is below 135% of the Guidelines. These specific
program rules are hard to change in the short run.

However, most programs use a measure offamily income that is much closer to "cash income"
than to the "full income" measure proposed by the NRC for an improved measure ofpoverty.

(3) Programs are currently designed to use the existing Guidelines which assume family income
is defined as cash income. This suggests that at least one simulation we want to do is the
following "What are the program effects of a change in the poverty measure, if we translate the
alternative poverty thresholds (based on full income) into poverty thresholds that are closer to the
cash income concept utilized by the programs and use this "cash equivalent threshold" to
establish the Guidelines?" This essentially means recalculating the alternative thresholds to
"back out" the concepts not included in cash income. Specifically, one would take the
alternative thresholds (designed to be compared to "full income") and add back in average child
care and work expenses, MOOP., and taxes and subtract off average in-kind benefits. This gives
you the cash-equivalent threshold implied by the alternative threshold.
                                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion

Now comes a key point that I felt wasn't understood in Tuesday's meeting: One of the Pros of
utilizing a benchmarked poverty rate is that the cash equivalent value of the alternative
thresholds under benchmarking must of necessity be very close to the current Guidelines. This
is because of the way benchmarking works -- the thresholds are the residual calculation once you
use a specific definition offami1y income and set an aggregate poverty rate. Essentially, the
thresholds under benchmarking are the poverty line that, given a definition of "full income",
results in the current poverty rate. If! were to ask "what is the cash equivalent to those
thresholds that provides the same poverty rate?" this must result in an answer very closer to the
current Guidelines since the current poverty line is a cash income threshold that results in the
current poverty rate. There's no funny business here. It must be true mathematically that, if we
say "We want the cash equivalent threshold implied by the alternative thresholds being used in
our new measure of poverty" and if those thresholds are coming from a benchmarked alternative
measure, then the cash equivalent thresholds will be very close to current poverty lines.

This suggests there are probably four program simulations that OMB wants to focus on:

1. Take the thresholds that result from a benchmarked alternative poverty measure and assume
they are blindly turned into Guidelines and calculate the program effects absent any other
program changes.

2. Take the thresholds that result from a benchmarked alternative poverty measure and assume
they are translated into their cash equivalent values and these cash equivalent values are used to
set the Guidelines (i.e., we try to produce Guidelines that reflect current program needs.)

3. Take the thresholds that result from a non-benchmarked alternative poverty measure (i.e., the
18% poverty rate calculated as the NRC alternative, or something close to it) and assume they are
blindly turned into Guidelines and calculate the program effects absent any other program
changes.

4. Take the thresholds that result from a non-benchmarked alternative poverty measure and
assume they are translated into their cash equivalent values and these cash equivalent values are
used to set the Guidelines (i.e., we try to produce Guidelines that reflect current program needs.)

Final note: Both procedures 2 and 3 are going to result in new Guidelines very close to the
current Guidelines and hence lead to quite small program changes, even in the absence ofany
change in program rules or regulations. (This is true for procedure 3 only because -- quite by
accident -- the "full-income' thresholds that result from the alternative NRC poverty calculation
are very close to the current poverty line.) I think procedure 2 is much more defensible than
procedure 3, but leaving arguments over the merit aside this does suggest that there are quite
feasible calculations that are very conceptually defensible and that will result in only small
program changes and may require no adjustments to the program rules. Without prejudging at
all what our future recommendations might be, this is an important piece of information.

(All of this ignores changes in the composition of the poor that will result in changes in the
distribution of benefits across groups regardless of how the Guidelines are defined -- This is
obviously also a very important issue, but separable from the Guidelines issue discussed above.)
