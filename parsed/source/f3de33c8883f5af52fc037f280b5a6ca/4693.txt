Hi,
Thanks for coming to our meeting and talking about the policy piece. I
also wanted to talk about this meeting with DOJ on Thursday. It's at
10:30am at DOJ. What I know so far is that Eileen Mayer, Lisa Winston and
Isabel Pinzler are supposed to attend. What are your thoughts on possible
items we could talk about? Are you available/interested in coming?
