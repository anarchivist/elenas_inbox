TEXT:
Neither of you reacted much to Mike Smith's discussion of Riley's plan to
announce our Unz position at the Press Club next Tuesday.  Are you really
ok with this, or did you not'want to deal with it then?

 I hadn't known about it before then, and was somewhat surprised.   While
,the Department's approach has the advantage of getting the job done and
 protecting us from a charge that we waited until too late to weigh in, it
 also presumes we want to get as much press coverage in California for this
 as possible.   While I think any approach we take will make news, there
 are lower key alternatives, especially if Riley is not going to CA, such
 as releasing a statement, doing an interview with only one paper, or even
 targeting the Latino press.

If we're going to let them go ahead, I want to make sure that this is
rolled out well, with Hill and group briefings, etc.  But I don't want to
start'on that if you'd rather back them off.

I'll be out Friday.  If you want to discuss this or want me to put this on
hold, please give me a call at home tonight if you can. Otherwise, we can
pull this on Monday if we need to, but it will be harder then.
