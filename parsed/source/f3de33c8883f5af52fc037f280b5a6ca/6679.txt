 TEXT:
 Elena asked me about our response to a GAO report that was released at the
 end of this week.  The GAO study confirmed a Robert Pear article from a
 few months ago which reported that insurance agents were discriminating
 against individuals with preexisting conditions who are attempting to
 purchase insurance under the new Kassebaum-Kennedy law.

 Over the last several months, we have been trying to get HCFA to develop a
 ruling that explicitly instructs states that these types of practices are
 unlawful under Kassebaum-Kennedy.  Today, Nancy-Ann informed me that such
 a ruling may well be available for release next week.  Since we have moved
 the Medicare buy-in event to Tuesday, one option might be to integrate
 this in the President's departure statement on Wedsnesday. We will be
 getting paper on what might be available on Monday morning.  As soon as we
 know more we will inform you.

 It would be helpful to know whether we should make this a     pr~ority   or not.
