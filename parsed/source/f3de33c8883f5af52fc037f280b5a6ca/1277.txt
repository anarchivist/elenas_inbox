TEXT:
1. To move forward with the technology CEOs endorsement, we need to be
able to give them some language -- essentially tell them specifically what
we would like them to endorse. This can be very minimal, even a bullet or
two.  Is there a specific goal or language you want them to sign on to?

2.  Can I get any information on what Easton will be saying? That way I
can make sure that the our industry supporters are on board.
