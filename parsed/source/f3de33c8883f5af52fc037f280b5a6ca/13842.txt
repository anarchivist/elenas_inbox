While I have no comments on the specifics of the directive, my concerns remain
general:
(1) When we last met in T.J. 's office, I was looking for a rough percentage of
how much timber, yet to be cut, would be affected by this directive.   In other
words, whether accurately or not, could the press say that, as a result of this
directive, the administration is cutting back on it's goal of 4.3 billion board
feet of timber by what%? Dinah had informed me that the percentage was roughly
15 - 20%. Does that still hold in light of the changes made to the directive
over the past few days?
(2)   I'm still unclear as to why we would not want to take advantage of our key
surrogates on this issue -- Babbitt, Glickman, McGinty -- being out in the
Northwest and "spinning" this to the administration's advantage.   If we wait
until next week, won't we have less control over what the regional press will
say/write about this issue? Haven't we been working, over the past several
weeks, towards making this announcement specifically when Sec. Glickman was to
be in the Northwest?
(3)   Finally, I just want to be sure that we have touched base with all relevant
groups and people -- congressional (which it sounds like we have already done),
labor and to a certain extent, constituencies. For example, have we considered


       quietly speaking to someone over at the Sierra Club to see what reaction they
       will have to this directive?
       Those are my initial concerns.
       Thanks.
