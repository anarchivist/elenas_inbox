TEXT:
I just spoke with INS and they have had a change in heart on the rollout:
they now would like for the Administration to be more visible on our plan
leading up to Doris' testimony on March 31.
INS has already started to quietly speak to the leadership of some of the
immigration groups on the plan and are getting good feedback.  The groups
have opined that a strong rollout would be useful in helping to sell our
reform package.   In addition, the Carnegie Foundation will be unveiling
their own recommendations for INS reform next Wednesday.

Some of INS' ideas to increase visibility include building editorial board
support, possibly giving an advance to the NYT, and scheduling an AG press
briefing -- all next week.

This heads in a different direction than we were talking about at Monday's
meeting.  I would defer in particular to Elena and Peter about our
communications and legislative strategy.

Please let me know what you think and let me know if we need to set up a
conference call to make sure everyone is on the same page.

Thanks,
Leanne
