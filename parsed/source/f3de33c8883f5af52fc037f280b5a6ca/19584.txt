Q_   What are your thoughts on the recent court decision involving a Mikwalkee
     women's health clinic and RICO (NOW v_ Scheidler)?

A.   I was pleased with last week's court decision that found protesters who used violence to
     close down women's health clinics guilty under the federal ani-racketeering statute
     known as RICO. This sends a strong message to organizers across this nation who are
     considering using intimidation, violence, or threats of violence to prevent women from
     seeking reproductive health services. I believe that this court decision offers some badly
     needed protection for women and their doctors.
