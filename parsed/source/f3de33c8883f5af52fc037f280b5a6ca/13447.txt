TEXT:
PRINTER FONT 10 - POINT- COURIER
Unless I hear otherwise by 5:00 P.M. today, Monsday, March, 25, I will assume
you have no objection to 3876 (dated 3/22), which requested comments on a
draft State Department letter concerning S. 735, the counter terrorism bill.
The letter is addressed to the conferees and describes problems with the two
versions of the bill. The letter will be signed by the Secretary of State.
If you need another copy of the LRM or have provided comments that I may have
overlooked, please let me know by answering this fax/E
o
-mail.

Thanks,

Ron Jones
