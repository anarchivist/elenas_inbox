                                   Question and Answer
                                     February 4, 1999


Q.   Today, the Washington Post reported that the INS is considering a plan to release
     criminal aliens -- including drug offenders, and aliens smugglers -- into the
     community due to lack of detention space. Is this true?

A.   Recent changes in the law has caused the number of people that INS must detain to
     skyrocket -- and despite the fact that this Administration has dramatically increased the
     number of criminal aliens removed to their country of origin, and increased detention
     space --- serious problems have arisen with INS' capacity to hold criminal aliens. The
     INS has worked with the Congress to find an acceptable answer to this problem but has
     not yet been able to come up with a satisfactory solution. As a result, INS is exploring a
     variety of options to solve this problem.

     It should be clear that INS' primary concern for any plan is the impact on public safety.
     Among the options being considered are removing additional people to their country of
     origin, and alternatives for detention for those who do not pose a threat to the community.
      In addition, the INS is looking into separate plans for each local facility to detain the
     highest risk aliens and release those that present the lowest risk to the community. This
     plan is still being developed and is not final. Reports of releasing criminals is premature.
      INS is focused on protecting the community as its first priority and satisfying the
     requirements set out in the law.
