        I commend the Sentencing Commission for moving forward with recommendations to
Congress to reduce the disparity between crack and powder cocaine penalties. My
Administration will give them very serious consideration. I have asked Director McCaffrey and
Attorney General Reno to review the recommendations and to report back to me in 45 days. I
look forward to working with the Congress on this issue.

       In October 1995, I signed legislation disapproving the Sentencing Commission's
recommendation to equalize penalties for crack and powder cocaine distribution by dramatically
reducing the penalties for crack. I believe it was the wrong approach then, and would be the
wrong approach now.

        Current law creates a substantial disparity between sentences for crack and powder
cocaine. I have stated before that some adjustment to this penalty structure is warranted as a
matter of sound criminal justice policy. Federal prosecutors should target mid- and high-level
drug traffickers, rather than low-level drug offenders. An adjustment to the penalty scheme will
help ensure this allocation of resources and make our federal efforts in fighting drugs more
effective. [At the same time, an adjustment will reduce the disparate racial impact of the CUiTent
sentencing scheme.] That is why the legislation I signed directed the Sentencing Commission to
undertake additional review of these issues and to report back with new recommendations.

        The sentencing laws must continue to reflect that crack cocaine is a more harmful fonn of
cocaine. The Sentencing Commission's new recommendations do so. Trafficking in crack, and
the violence it fosters, has a devastating impact on communities across America, especially
inner-city communities. Any change in penalties must ensure that more dangerous offcndcrs
receive tougher sentences.

       I am also pleased that the Sentencing Commission has incrcased penalties for
methamphetamine offenses pursuant to the legislation which I signed into law last ycar. This
law asked the Commission to toughen penaltics on this emerging drug to prevent the kind of
epidemic we saw in the 1980's with eoe:tinc usc. We will c:trcfully study these new pemlltics.

        My Administration has fought to stop drug abuse and its destructive consequences.
Overall, drug use in the United States has fallen dmmatically -- by half in 15 YC:lrs. And cocaine
use h:ts dramatically decreased since thc high point in 1985 -- the number of curr':llt cOGlinc
users is down by 74% over the last decade. While these are encouraging figures, I am fully
