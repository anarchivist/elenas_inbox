TEXT:
ED has just learned that Buck McKeon will be holding a hearing on the
national tests in Granada Hills (outside of San Diego, they think) on Jan.
21. Here is the friendly line-up they are trying to arrange:

Panel 1: Maxine Waters and xavier Becera
Panel 2:  Pete Wilson
Panel 3:  Some other state officials including, most likely, Wilson
appointees to the State Board of Education
Panel 4: MALDEF

At a minimum, it would probably be good if we could get Waters and Becera
not to testify.  ANy other ideas?
