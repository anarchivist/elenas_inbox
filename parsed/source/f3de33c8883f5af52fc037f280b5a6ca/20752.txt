    Dear Steny:

          I am writing to express my concern over the Congress' plans
    to override my veto of H.R. 1122, a bill banning so-called partial
    birth abortions.   In this vote, Congress is once again opting for
    partisanship over progress; it is turning the painful debate over
    this issue into an opportunity to score political points, rather
    than to pass legislation restricting this procedure.

         The procedure addressed in H.R. 1122 poses a difficult and
    disturbing issue.   I strongly believe that we generally should
    prohibit the use of this procedure.   I have insisted, however, on
    exempting those few but tragic cases in which this procedure is
    necessary to save a woman's life or to protect her against serious
    injury.  I again call upon Congress to add such a narrow, tightly
    drawn exception to this bill, so that I can sign the legislation
    and put an end to all other uses of this procedure.

         The legislation that you have sponsored with Representative
    Greenwood -- which prohibits all late-term abortions, except those
    necessary to save the life o~woman or prevent serious harm to
    her health -- is also consistent with my principles. As you know,
    I have long opposed late-term abortions, and as Governor of Arkansas,
    I signed into law a bill that banned them, with an appropriate
    exception for life or health.   If Congress were to pass your bill,
    I would sign it immediately.

         Congress's refusal to consider such constructive proposals --
    proposals that would put an end to inappropriate abortions while
    protecting women from death or serious injury -- prevents us from
    resolving these issues and moving forward.   Similarly, Congress's
    recent votes restricting safe medical choices and access to family
    planning information and services stand in the way of progress on
    these issues.  I urge Congress once again to move beyond ideology
    and political maneuvering and to protect the lives and health of
    women.

                                 Sincerely,




    The Honorable Steny Hoyer
