TEXT:
Kohl's folks made some calls to DOJ today. and here's where things stand:

DOJ says it could live with a letter that says they support the goals of
the Kohl bill. but need some refinements.  Apparently. Kohl's folks
thought this was worth having.  DOJ is going to draft something. They
think an AGs letter would take too long to get out of the Department. so
they are now suggesting it should be a WH letter.  I should have draft
language tonight we could look at first thing tomorrow.
