TEXT:
As you requested, the following is a brief list of event ideas.     I will
continue to beat the bushes for other ideas.

1. Asian American and Pacific Islander Executive Order - signing
ceremony or some event during Asian Pacific American heritage month (May)
announcing this EO.  This Order is still in the process of being cleared
but should be cleared by May.

2.  Public Charge Regulation Roll-out - this is good news but the timing
is unclear.    This event could take place in a state with a high
immigration population such as California.

3. Race Book Roll-out - a process has already begun to develop roll-out
ideas but the timing is unclear.

please let me know if you have any questions or need more information
about these proposals.

Thanks.
