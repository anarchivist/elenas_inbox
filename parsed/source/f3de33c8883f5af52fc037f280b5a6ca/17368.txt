TEXT:


Maria, Bruce and I will be meeting with the leadership of the National
Coalition of (Gay and Lesbian) Anti -Violence Projects on Monday. October
20, 1997 at 12 noon in room 472 OEOB to discuss the issue of hate crimes
against gays and lesbians. The Coalition represents the leadership of all
the gay and lesbian anti violence groups across the country. They are
here for the twice yearly board meeting and will be meeting with Deputy
Attorney General Eric Holder later in the day on Monday. They had
originally requested to meet with the Vice President. As the Hate Crimes
Conference approaches, this is obviously an important issue. You are
invited to attend.
