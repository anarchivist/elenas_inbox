 TEXT:
 We need to also send a tobacco letter to Senator Kerry - draft below.
 Also attached is the latest draft of the McCain letter.  Please call me at
 5-4790 as soon as possible with clearance. Thank you.

 The Honorable John F. Kerry
 United States Senate
 Washington, D.C. 20510

 Dear Senator Kerry:

         You requested our views on amendments to the tobacco legislation
 proposed by Senator Gramm and others that would eliminate any restrictions
 on uses of funds in the State Litigation Settlement Account.  The
 Administration strongly opposes such amendments because they would
 eliminate the requirement that states use part of tobacco funds for


 programs that improve public health and support children.  The current
 structure of the State Litigation Account reflects a careful balance
 between the interests of the states in flexible use of tobacco receipts
 and the Federal interest that their use be accountable and contribute to
 public health.

         We believe that additional changes to this carefully constructed
 agreement would harm the goal of passing historic comprehensive,
 bipartisan tobacco legislation.

         We thank you for your support, ,and look forward to continuing
 working with you and your colleagues to enact comprehensive, bipartisan
 tobacco legislation.

 Sincerely,
 Jacob J. Lew
 Acting Director


 cc:     Honorable John McCain

 REVISED MCCAIN LETTER:

 The Honorable John McCain
 Chairman
 Committee on Commerce, Science & Transportation
 United States Senate
 Washington, D.C. 20510

 Dear Mr. Chairman:

         You asked for our views on a series of possible amendments that
 may be offered to S. 1415 that would undermine the present structure
 and/or uses of, the State Litigation Settlement Account. In its current
 form, S. 1415 represents a careful balancing between the states and the
 Federal government, advancing the public health and other goals we share.

         The Administration opposes changes to this agreement that would
 harm the goal of passing historic comprehensive, bipartisan tobacco
 legislation. States efforts have been central to the development of this
 legislation and they deserve recognition of their efforts through
 protection against amendments that further reduce the amount that states
 receive in the Account.

         We also recognize the importance of the carefully constructed
 balance between restricted and unrestricted funds, and the menu of uses
 that would be supported by the former.  It is for this reason that we also
 oppose additional amendments that would change the parameters for or uses
 of the restricted funds.

         Minimizing additional changes to the State Litigation Settlement
 Account is important to assure that the bill represents a fair balance
 between flexibility and accountability, and helps protect the statesD,
 very legitimate interest in this legislation. As always, we look forward
 to continuing working with you to produce a bill that will make a major
 contribution to public health, our children and our nation.

                                                         Sincerely,




                                             Jacob J. Lew
                                             Acting Director
