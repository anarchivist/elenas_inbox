MEMORANDUM FOR THE CHIEF OF STAFF

FROM:         Bruce Reed

SUBJECT:      Tobacco Settlement Review Process

This memo sets forth the process we will use to evaluate the proposed tobacco settlement and to
present recommendations to the President. Our goal is to prepare a memo for the President by
late July that defines our public health and public interest objectives; weighs the settlement's
strengths and weaknesses against those objectives; summarizes the views of the public health
community, Congress, and other affected parties; and lays out positions the President could take
on the settlement proposal.

Interagency Review

The review will be carried out by four major workgroups which have already begun to meet:

I.     Regulatory Issues (chaired by Elena Kagan). This group will look at: (a) FDA
       regulation of product content, including nicotine; (b) FDA regulation of access,
       advertising, and labeling; and (c) restrictions on environmental tobacco smoke in public
       buildings and workplace settings. Participating White House offices are DPC, OMB,
       OVP, NEC, and OSTP. Participating agencies are HHS, DOJ, DOL, GSA, EPA, and
       Treasury.

II.    Program and Budget Issues (chaired by Chris Jennings). This group will examine
       proposed uses o(settlement funds, including programs to reduce smoking and expand
       children's health care coverage. In particular, the group will consider: (a) the use of
       Medicaid funds for children's health care; (b) education efforts (including grass roots
       programs); (c) smoking cessation programs; and (d) investments in health research,
       including nicotine research. White House offices are DPC, OMB, NEC, OVP, and OSTP.
        Participating agencies are HHS, Treasury, DOL, USDA, Interior, VA, and DOD.

III.   Legal Issues (Chaired by Elena Kagan). This group will review the settlement's
       provisions on liability, damages, and document disclosure, and will consider
       constitutional, antitrust, and other legal issues raised by the settlement. White House
       offices are DPC, OVP, NEC, and Counsel. Participating agencies are DOJ, HHS,
       Treasury, and Interior.

IV.    Industry Performance and Accountability (chaired by Bruce Reed). This group will
       analyze economic and international issues. The group will assess: (a) the economics of
       the industry and the settlement's effects on industry performance, federal revenues,
       consumers, farmers, etc.; and (b) the set of incentives and penalties in the settlement to


                                                          Automated Records Management System
                                                          Hex-Dump Conversion


            reduce tobacco use, especially by children. The group also will consider Administration
            policy on tobacco-related trade and international issues, which the settlement does not
            directly address. White House offices are DPC, NEC, CEA, OVP, OMB, OSTP;
            participating agencies are: HHS, Treasury, DOL, USDA, USTR, State, DOD.

     Public Outreach

     We will work with OPL and HHS on a tightly focused public outreach effort designed to
     demonstrate that the President is conducting a thoughtful, thorough review focused on the public
     health. Many groups covering a wide range of interests are affected by the proposed settlement.
     We will emphasize the President's focus on health by hosting 6-8 highly visible White House
     meetings with small, select groups of health experts. Working with OPL, we will encourage other
     interested groups (children'S advocates; women's organizations, farmers) to share their views
     through written comments and, where appropriate, meetings with agency and White House staff.

     Donna and I will host the White House meetings over the next three weeks. We will convene
     experts from national health organizations; Koop-Kessler advisory group participants; experts on
     nicotine addiction; local grass-roots advocates; state and local tobacco control officials; and
     children's health advocates.

     The first meeting will take place on [Monday, June 30]. We will invite in Dr. Kessler and
     several members of the Koop-Kessler advisory group, including the American Cancer Society,
     American Medical Association, and American Heart Association. (Koop is not available.) The
     committee will not have finished its report, but it can validate the Administration's review
     process and praise the President for expressing concern earlier this week over the proposal's
     handling of nicotine regulation. Future meetings will include: Action on Smoking and Health;
     American Academy of Pediatrics; American Public Health Association; Americans for
     Nonsmokers' Rights; and National Center for Tobacco-Free Kids, Joe Califano, and leading
     academics ..

     Congressional Outreach

     If the Administration decides to support some kind of settlement, we will need broad
     Congressional support. Multiple committees in both the House and Senate would have
     jurisdiction over legislation enacting an agreement. The goal of our Congressional outreach
     process will be to strengthen relationships on the issue with key members and to keep the debate
     bipartisan and balanced. We will consult with the leadership, anti-tobacco advocates, and
     representatives of tobacco states. Today and tomorrow HHS is making calls to key Republican
     and Democratic members to seek their input on how best to consult with the Hill in the coming
     weeks. We are working with Legislative Affairs and HHS on a detailed list of Congressional
     meetings to begin the week of July 7. There are many critical members, including Senators Lott,
     Daschle, Hatch, Kennedy, Lautenberg, Ford, and Durbin; and Congressmen Gephardt, Gingrich,
     Bliley, Waxman, Dingell, Hansen, Meehan, Gordon and others.

     Press Plan
organizations have assigned entire teams to cover the tobacco settlement. After devoting so
much coverage to the negotiations, the networks are determined to keep this issue alive. We
should take advantage of that heightened interest to advance our public health message.

On Friday, Donna and I are prepared to brief the White House press corps on how we will
conduct this review, who will be involved from within the administration, and what groups and
outside experts we plan to consult. As noted above, on [Monday] we will meet with David
Kessler and other members of the Koop-Kessler advisory group to discuss their efforts.

During the week of July 7, while the President is away, Donna and I will conduct the public
health and Congressional meetings described above. This will give the press something to write
about, and show that we are running an open process. During the week of July 14, we will
continue public health and Congressional meetings and bring in two groups of attorneys general
-- the enthusiasts and the skeptics. The Vice President is willing to hold a public hearing with us
in mid-July if we need one. (We prefer to leave this question open right now.)

Schedule

We have planned the following schedule. HHS does not believe the review can be completed
within 30 days, as the President suggested. But we will work as quickly as possible to preserve
that option and ensure a decision by early August at the latest.

     Week of June 23:      DC convenes work groups and assigns analytic tasks to members.
                           Donna and Bruce brief press on process and conduct.
     Week of June 30:      Groups provide preliminary assessments of key issues.
                           [First outreach meeting.]
     Week of July 7:       Groups develop options for key issues.
                           Bruce, Donna and others hold further meetings with public health
                           groups and begin meetings with members of Congress.
     Week of July 14:      Principals review workgroup assessments and meet to discuss options.
                           Possible public hearing with the Vice President.
     Week of July 21:      Initial meeting with the President.
     Late July/
           early August:              Presidential decision and announcement.
