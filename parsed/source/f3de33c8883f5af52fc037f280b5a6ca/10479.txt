TEXT:
The following issues have been raised as concerns regarding the proposed
Livable & Clean Community Bonds (LCCBs) -- more commonly known as "green
bonds." (Yes, we are surveying what is the best name for these new bonds).

ISSUE #1:    Some have raised concerns about who should run the
competition for this program -- These individuals believe that Secretary
~'.



      Babbit and the Department of the Interior would be the best poster child
      for the bond program because they argue the agency is relatively
      non-controversial and that their discretionary budget will include a large
      chunk of livable communities money.

      Others have suggested that EPA should be responsible for running the bond
      competition for the following reasons:   1) The activities for which the
      bonds can be used fit better with EPA's mission;   2) EPA has a direct
      relationship with the mayors of our largest cities and many of the suburbs
      who will be most positively affected by this program.   This relationship
      is built upon EPA's 228 brownfield sites and other activities.   Interior
      does not have this kind of relationship nor with the types of regions where
       we want to promote metropolitan-wide planning;   3) EPA's FY2000 budget is
      currently $600 million below last year's enacted level. Giving EPA the
      authority to run the LCCB competition will help relieve some of the
      criticism that will come from sectors of the environmental and public
      health community. These folks will not view the increase in Interior's
      budget as compensation for the drastic cut in ~PA's budget for 2000.
      LCCBs, on the. other hand, will provide some compensation; 4)   Because of
      their experience with the "brownfields expensing provision"
      specifically their role in working with State Environmental Departments in
      certifying IRS compliance, EPA is more fluent in tax policy matters than
      Interior; 5) EPA has playea a lead role in developing this proposal,
      Interior is not familiar with the idea; 6)   The activities that the bonds
      are to be used for are most suited to EPA's current policy mandate.

      Staff at OMB and NEC have indicated support for EPA, OMB's argument based
      mainly on the issue of EPA's budget problems.   OVP has indicated interest
      in Interior. While we recognize the validity of arguments on both sides,
      DPC would favor EPA as well.

      However, I believe the following compromise would assuage some of the
      political concerns raised about EPA runni~g the bond program. Under this
      proposal, EPA would chair a subgroup of the Community Empowerment Board
      (CEB).  The subgroup would include Treasury, Interior, HUD, FEMA (?), and
      USDA.  EPA would consult with each of these agencies, all of which have
      relevant expertise related to the bond program, and then the Administrator
      would allocate the bonds to the winners of the competition. By making this
       a subgroup of the CEB, we insure that the VP is the name most associated
      with this program and that distressed communities will get fair treatment
      (an issue raised by Treasury).  In addition, by requiring consultation
      with other agencies, we broaden the message and the audience for the
      proposal, reinforce that this is an administration-wide initiative, and
      strengthen the regionalism and planning aspects of the program. Finally,
      by placing EPA in charge of the selection process, we effectively deal
      with the issues raised in paragraph three of this email.

      ISSUE #2: Do we include Brownfields commercial redevelopment as one of the
      eligible activities for the bonds?

      There has been some concern expressed regarding allowing some of those
      brownfields in urban areas to be redeveloped for commercial purposes and
      not solely for open spacesould reduce open spaces and parks.  Several of
      us, NEC, CEQ, EPA, and DPC believe that we should allow some development
      of brownfields in urban, distressed areas for commercial purposes because
      1) it will reduce sprawl by drawing development back to urban centers and
      away from suburban and rural outlying areas; 2) promote job and business
      creation, which is a core component of this proposal and which is
      essential to building support on the Hill among Democrats and Republicans
      who will oppose this idea if it is just seen as a enviro idea; 3) will


help target the proposal towards distressed commmunities, since bro
wnfields are predominantly located in low-income neighborhoods.
