TEXT:
I haven't forgotten about getting you that Headwaters memo--I'm
missing a page (a key one at that) and am trying to get it from
the originator, so I should get it to you by this afternoon.
I'd like to reiterate that we very much would like your
involvement in this. We're setting up a meeting with John
Garamendi again, which hopefully you'll be able to attend.   I know
Katie wants to meet with you as well before that meeting, which
Rob will set up as soon as I pull together what events have taken
place in the last week or so--should be in the next couple days.
Thanks!
