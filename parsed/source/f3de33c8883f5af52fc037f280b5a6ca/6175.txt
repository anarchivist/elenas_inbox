TEXT:
DOL has to approve state plans in order for the PICs in those states to
get the welfare to work formula funds.  DOL has received 12 plans, and is
ready to approve five of them (Michigan, Illinois, Louisiana, Nebraska,
and Nevada) totalling $122 million for FY 1999.

I was having DOL hold these for a Blair welfare to work event, but since
that's not going to happen, I was planning to let Herman announce them
tomorrow in her speech to the US Conference of Mayors.  There was a flurry
this morning that perhaps the President should make the Illinois
annoucement in Illinois, but that died quickly.

The President is apparently also speaking to the US Conferece on Friday,
and I've now been invited to a message meeting regarding that event today
at 3:00.  If Lyn Cutler and others who arranged the President's appearance
want him to make these announcements, I think that should be fine with us
   but I assume they have a bigger and more comprehensive agenda they want
to discuss with the mayors. Any thoughts?
