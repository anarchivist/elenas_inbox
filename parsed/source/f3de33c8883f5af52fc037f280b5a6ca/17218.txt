TEXT:
Great press on the announcement.    The President even had the NYTs on his
side. I'm impressed.

I have heard second hand that staff from USDA and HHS, at a food safety
meeting convened today, spent a 1/2 hour discussing FDA's belief that the
agencies needed to issue a Federal Register notice in the next 90 days.
The FR notice would be in addition to the report due in 90 days and seemed
to be related to the guidance. What are the next steps that you are
expecting?
