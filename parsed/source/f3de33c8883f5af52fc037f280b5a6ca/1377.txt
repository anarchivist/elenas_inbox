Subject:         Megan's Law Guidelines -- Another potential announcement

Justice just told me that they are finalizing the guidelines for Megan's
Law -- which would tell communities exactly what would constitute adequate
"community notification" under the law.  This would be good to go along w/
the National Sex Offender Registry announcement (or maybe even alone) .
