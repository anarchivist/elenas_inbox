Inside the Beltway
                        Political tidbits and other shenanigans
                        from around the nation's capital

                        By John McCaslin
                        THE WASHINGTON TIMES


                                     McCaffrey move


                             After three years as White House drug policy
chief, Barry R.
                        McCaffrey plans to leave the Office of National
Drug Control
                        policy and replace Elizabeth Dole as president of
the American
                        Red Cross.
                             So reveals an official close to the ONDCP,
speaking on the
                        condition of anonymity.
                             "Word is that he will be on the job at the Red
Cross by the
                        first of June," the official tells Inside the
Beltway. "[Office of
                        Personnel Management]   is actively searching for
McCaffrey's
                        replacement as we speak."
                             A retired Army four-star general, Mr.
McCaffrey, 56, was in
                        charge of the u.S. military's Southern Command in
Panama
                        when President Clinton tapped him to become the
nation's
                        anti-drug crusader.
                             But it was just days after Mr. Clinton first
took office that
                        Mr. McCaffrey, then an assistant to Gen. Colin
Powell,
                        chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, found
himself at the center
                        of a storm after he was snubbed by a young Clinton
aide upon
                        entering the White House.
                             The female aide answered the general's "Good
morning" with
                        the retort "I don't talk to the military."
                             Shortly thereafter, Mr. Clinton was seen
jogging with the
                        general, and then promoted him to director of
long-range
                        planning for the Joint Staff, before eventually
naming him to the
                        drug policy job.
                             Mr. McCaffrey was on official travel in South
Florida
                        Thursday, although our source said he's "not ready"


to announce
                       his future plans. The American Red Cross helm has
been vacant
                       since Mrs. Dole announced her plans to seek the GOP
                       nomination for president in 2000.
                            Two weeks ago, this column confirmed that Mr.
McCaffrey
                       was "deputized" by the U.S. Marshals Service,
becoming one of
                       only three government officials outside of law
enforcement
                       allowed to carry a concealed weapon.
