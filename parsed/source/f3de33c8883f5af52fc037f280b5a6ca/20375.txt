    PRESIDENT CLINTON AND VICE PRESIDENT GORE ANNOUNCE NEW INITIATIVES
      TO IMPROVE HEALTH FOR CHILDREN AND OLDER AMERICANS AT FAMILY
        REUNION CONFERENCE HOSTED BY VICE PRESIDENT AND MRS. GORE
                                 June 22, 1998

Today, at the seventh Family Reunion Conference in Tennessee hosted by Vice President and Mrs.
Gore, the President and Vice President announced a series of new initiatives to improve health for
older Americans and children, and to make the health care system more responsive to the needs of
families.

Children: issued an Executive Memorandum that directs eight Federal agencies to implement over 150
new initiatives to help enroll the millions of uninsured children eligible but not enrolled in health
insurance programs, illustrating how a responsive, flexible government can meet the evolving needs of
families; Older Americans: developed a multi-faceted national health initiative for older Americans,
which includes: new preventive benefits for Medicare beneficiaries; more usable infofl!lation to help
make critical health care choices; and a new nationwide public/private Medicare council with over 80
organizations to ensure older Americans have the information they need to select health plans and
encourage prevention and wellness; Families: renewed the call on Congress to pass a patients' bill of
rights.

CHILDREN: SIGNED EXECUTIVE MEMORANDUM TO IMPLEMENT OVER 100 NEW·
FEDERAL COMMITMENTS TO ENROLL ELIGIBLE BUT UNINSURED CHILDREN.
Over 4 million uninsured children are eligible for Medicaid but are not enrolled, and as the new
Children's Health Insurance Program is implemented, even more families will have children who are
eligible for StatelFederal health insurance programs. Today, the President signed an Executive
Memorandum that cuts across jurisdiction and traditional agency inflexibility by directing eight Federal
agencies -- ranging from HUD to SSA to the Education Department -- to implement over 100 new
Federal initiatives to help sign up the millions of uninsured children eligible but not enrolled in health
insurance programs. This illustrates how a responsive flexible government can meet the evolving
needs of families. These initiatives include:

·      Sending letters to 350,000 Federal workers, including Head Start teachers, school nurses,
       child support workers, and community health center directors asking them to ensure that
       all of the families they work with whose children are eligible for Medicaid or CHIP are enrolled
       in these programs.

·      Working With National Organizations and Programs That Reach Millions of Families to
       Help Enroll Children in Health Insurance Programs, including educating grandparents
       through the Medicare program, holding a conference with Historically Black Colleges to
       identify new strategies, and ensuring that sites, including 15,000 public housing projects, 400
       IRS walk-in centers, and 113 job centers, have information for families about how to enroll
       children in health insurance.
                                                                                Automated Records Management Systerr
                                                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion
     ·      Releasing a New Guide to Help Child Care Workers Enroll Uninsured Children. Child
            care centers are one family friendly setting where parents can learn about how insurance
          . programs they may be eligible for. There are already many efforts underway to link child care
            centers with the health ne.eds for the millions of children in child care. Today, the Department
            of Health and Human Services is releasing a new child care handbook "Child Care and
            Medicaid: Partners for Healthy Children" to ensure that child care workers understand how to
            identify and enroll families with uninsured children.

     OLDER AMERICANS: ANNOUNCED NEW NATIONAL CAMPAIGN TO IMPROVE
     HEALTH OF OLDER AMERICANS. One of the greatest concerns for families is the health of
     older family members. Today, the President and Vice President:

     ·     Implemented Historic New Preventive Benefits for Medicare Beneficiaries. The President
           and Vice President announced that starting July 1st, for the first time, Medicare will cover two
           critical preventive benefits -- bone mass measurement tests to detect osteoporosis and diabetes
           education. The President enacted these new benefits, as well as a series preventive screening
           benefits to detect cancer, implemented earlier this year, as part of the historic Balanced Budget
           Act of 1997. These benefits underscore how Medicare is trying to encourage better health
           outcomes for families.

     ·     Unveiled New Nationwide Public Service Announcement on Osteoporosis Featuring the
           First Lady and Mrs. Gore. One in two women will have osteoporosis fracture during her
           lifetime. However, millions of these women are not aware they are at risk until they have a
           fracture or broken bone. The Vice President unveiled a new public service announcement
           featuring the First Lady and Mrs. Gore to inform women about the new osteoporosis Medicare
           benefit and to ensure that all women, particularly older women, get bone mass measurement
           tests to detect osteoporosis.

     ·     Launched a New Internet Site for Medicare Beneficiaries. Families need good information
           to help make the best health care decisions for older family members. Today, the President
           and Vice President launched a new nationwide Internet site (Medicare.gov) so that families can
           understand the options and services Medicare provides. This information will be even more
           critical as the historic changes the President enacted as part of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997
           are implemented this fall. These reforms give beneficiaries new plan choiCes that could
           improve care for older Americans but also have the potential to cause confusion.

     ·     Created a Nationwide Public/Private Medicare Education Council, Including over 80
           National Organizations to ensure families receive good care. The President and Vice
           President announced that over 80 organizations, including the AFL-CIO, American Association
           of Retired Persons, the Older Women's League, National Rural Health Association, and the
           American Association of Family Physicians, are joining with the Health Care Financing
           Administration, the Administration on Aging, and the National Institutes of Health to launch a
           new National Medicare Education Program that will work to ensure that families have the
           information they need to make critical health decisions including: assuring that Medicare
           beneficiaries are aware of the new preventive benefits and other prevention and wellness
           strategies; understand new plan options so they can select the health plan that best meets their
           needs; and know the consumer protections available under Medicare.
                                                                           Automated Records Management SyslelT·

    FAMILIES: MAKING THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM MORE RESPONSIVE TO THE
    NEEDS OF FAMILIES

    ·   Renewing Call on Congress to Pass a Patients' Bill of Rights. The President also urged
        Congress to stop delaying and pass a patients' bill of rights that would ensure that all families
        have the patient protections they need in a rapidly changing health care system. This patients'
        bill of rights should contain a range of protections, including guaranteed access to needed
        health care specialists, access to emergency room services when and where the need arises, an
        assurance that medical records are confidential, and access to a meaningful internal and
        external appeals process for consumers to resolve their differences with their health plans
        and health care providers.
