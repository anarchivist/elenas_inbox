TEXT:
I don't remember the specifics of that part of the conversation
although I remember the meeting. We were primarily talking about
expansions when we talked about states being able to expand.
However, let me strongly state I think it is wrong to go with all
or nothing.  The stories that could come out in the newspapers in
the states are as bad as Chris indicates and worse.  Financially
many states will not be able to cover all without making some very
serious cuts in other parts of medicaid or other parts of state
budgets and with the public climate such as it is about immigrants
I can assure you states will be politically forced to cut all if
that is their only choice from the federal government.
Thanks for the update.
