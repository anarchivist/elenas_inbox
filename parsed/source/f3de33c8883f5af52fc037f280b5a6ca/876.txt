TEXT:
Let me know if you want me to be at the 1:30 meeting.  I expect the Kids
Health E.O. will come up,  Here is a summary of where we are:

We are going to circulate another draft late next week or early the'
following week.  We have made good progress in setting up the committee as
we talked about last Thusday, there is enthusiasm for doing it this way
among the agencies.

The analytical requirements are still giving some discomfort to individual
agencies.  Therefore I am convening discussions individually (and as
informally as possible) with policy leadership at HHS and Labor to talk
through implementation issues. My goal is to determine whether the agency
discomfort is based on serious policy problems or whether it stems more
from inertia.  I hope that these meetings will happen late next week.

OMB is interested in bringing into this E.O. the idea of a statistical
look at the status of families.

I have not yet sat down with the First Lady's office, because of
conflicting schedules.  They have a draft of the order and know that we
are trying to brief them on it.
