TEXT:
Chris, Elena -- At 8:00 a.m. this morning, we spoke with Rachel Levinson,
who is at the NBAC meeting in Miami. She reports that the Commission will
discuss the draft of their response to the President on the stem cell
issue this morning; she expects to fax a copy to us very shortly --
perhaps by 10:00 a.m. As soon as we have something in hand, we'll pass it
along to you right away.  Should you need to reach Rachel in the meantime,
her pager number is 800-617-5674.
