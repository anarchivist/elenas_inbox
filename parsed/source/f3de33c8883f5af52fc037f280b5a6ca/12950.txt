             TEXT:
             Here are Q&A on gambling and media violence:

             Q:      Does your Administration support the expected findings --
             including a moratorium on gambling expansion, a prohibition on Internet
             gambling, and more regulation of Indian gaming -- of the National Gambling
             Impact Study Commission?

             A:      Since the study has not yet been forwarded to the Administration
             it would be premature tocomment. We look forward to receiving the study
             and giving it careful consideration.  It should be noted, however, that
             any regulation of content on the Internet raises many significant issues,
             including international issues, and we will need to examine those issues
             closely once we receive the study.


             Q:      What have you done to curb the amount of media violence
             children are exposed to, and what can we do about this problem?

             A.      I believe that all of us must work together and accept
             responsibility for the safety of our children in our schools and our
             communities -- if we are to solve this problem. That means there is more
             for each of us to do at home and at school, in Hollywood and in the
             heartland and here in Washington.

                    First and most fundamentally, we must help parents fulfill
            their most important responsibilities -- those to their children.   Parents
            need to turn off the television or use the V-Chip to block inappropriate
            programming.  The V-Chip will be in every new television by the end of the
            year and at my Strategy Session on Children, Violence and Responsibility I
            announced a public/private partnership to educate parents about how to use
            the V-Chip. After that Strategy Session a number of groups have also
            volunteered to help build a grassroots coalition to prevent youth
            violence, and I am heartened because I believe that is the way we will
            move forward on this issue, together. We also need to do a number of
            specific things like encourage parents to use the new tools that the Vice
            President has worked on to help parents keep an eye on the computer
            screen;  and parents need to refuse to buy products that glorify violence.

                        I've called on the media and entertainment industries for their
G




    participation as
            well.  Studies indicate that there is an adverse impact on our
    culture and our children if there is too much violence coming out of what
    they see and experience.   So ID,ve challenged the people who produce these
    things to consider the consequences of them -- whether it's a violent
    movie, a CD, a video game.   First,  I challenged theater and video store
    owners to enforce more strictly the rating systems on the movies they
    show, rent, and sell -- a challenge that the theatre owners accepted this
    week and they will now require photo 1.0. for "R" rated movies.   Second,
    ID,ve challenged the whole industry to stop showing guns in any ads or
    previews children might see.   Thirdly, ID,ve challenged the movie industry
    to reevaluate its entire ratings systems, especially the PG-13 rating, to
    determine whether it is allowing too much gratuitous violence in movies
    approved for viewing by children. Finally, as many of you know, ID,ve
    called on the FTC and the Justice Department to study the marketing of
    violence to children.
