                              Background on H-IB Visas and Legislation
                                            May 1, 1998

     H·1B visas are temporary work visas that allow "highly skilled" immigrants (with a BA or
     equivalent) to work in this country for up to six years. Under current law, the number ofH-1B
     visas is capped at 65,000 per year. Last year, this cap was reached for the first time. The
     information technology (IT) industry strongly supports raising the annual cap to address what
     they maintain is a shortage of U.S. workers with IT skills. Others, including the Department of
     Labor, challenge the industry's conclusions about a shortage and are concerned that the current
     H·1B program does not target its use to employers who are experiencing skills shortages.

     Though the Administration has never before squarely addressed the issue of the cap, we have
     consistently emphasized training and re·training U.S. workers to enable them to move into jobs
     within the high·tech industry. Also, since 1993 we have sought reforms to the H·IB program
     that would target their use to industries with genuine short·term skill shortages.

     Thus, while it may be necessary in the short·term to increase the number of visas for temporary
     foreign workers, this must be done only in conjunction with:

     ·       Increased efforts by various stakeholders, including industry, to increase the skill level of
            U.S. workers.

     ·      Improvements in the temporary visa program to require employers to "recruit and retain"
            U.S. workers before hiring temporary foreign workers and prohibiting lay-offs of U.S.
            workers to replace them with temporary foreign workers. It is important to emphasize
            that these reforms would target the visa program's use to employers (like many of those
            in the IT industry) experiencing genuine skills shortages.

     On April 2, 1998, the Administration (Secretaries Daley and Herman and Attorney General
     Reno) sent a letter to Congress that opposed Senator Abraham's bill (that provided for a large,
     temporary increase in the cap and the expansion of an existing scholarship program for
     low-income students, but did not provide meaningful reform of the H-IB program) and endorsed
     the approach advocated by Senator Kennedy (that would effect a temporary increase in the cap,
     but also included reform to the H-1B program and increased training for U.S. workers).

     On April 30, 1998, the Administration sent a letter to Congress supporting Representative Lamar
     Smith's bill (which includes targetted reforms to the H-IB program) !fit is modified to include
     meaningful training provisions and a more modest increase in the cap.

     A Note about Rep. Lofgren

     Rep. Zoe Lofgren supports increasing the cap, but she has not endorsed our H-1B reforms. She
     is likely to raise two issues:

     ·      Neither Sen. Abraham nor Rep. Smith include an application fee for each H-1B visa in
                                                  Hex-Dump Conversiofl
    their bill. Rep. Lofi'en advocates charging such a fee to raise money for training and
    enforcement of the H-IB program. The Administration also strongly supports this fee.

·   Rep. Lofi'en would also like the final bill to include a training provision. She has
    promoted a program called the Mathematics, Engineering, and Science Achievement
    (MESA) project. It is important for you to know that MESA is very similar to the
    Administration's High Hopes initiative (the major difference is that MESA focuses on
    math, science, and engineering while High Hopes can be broader). In fact, MESA was
    one of the prototypes used to develop High Hopes and many current MESA projects
    would be eligible to apply for a High Hopes grant if we succeed in getting it enacted.
    MESA is also similar to the middle school math and science strategy that the Department
    of Education and NSF are heading.

    High Hopes will pass with the Higher Education Reauthorization Act in the House next
    week. It is not yet in the Senate version. We should emphasize working together to get
    High Hopes passed and to highlight the Department of Education/NSF middle school
    strategy.
