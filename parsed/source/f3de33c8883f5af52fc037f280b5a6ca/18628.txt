    Dr. Satcher's Confirmation Vote. Next Tuesday, the Senate is scheduled to vote on Dr.
    Satcher's nomination to become Surgeon General. Our current vote count is 66 votes and we
    believe that we may get more than 70. Should Dr. Satcher be confirmed, this would fill an
    approximately three year void in the Surgeon General position. We are currently considering
    recommending a picture of you and/or the Vice President swearing Dr. Satcher in for this post.

    Congressman John Dingell Update. Following up on your conversation with John Dingell,
    Larry Stein, Bruce Reed and Chris Jennings met with the Congressman on Thursday to discuss
    prospects of and strategy for the consumer protections legislative debate and Mr. Dingell's role
    on the Medicare Commission. It was agreed that the Administration would continue to give
    technical assistance to the House Democratic Caucus consumer protections bill as well as to
    make positive statements about it without giving an all out endorsement. The current bill goes
    farther than is likely to be passed in the Congress and may well be vulnerable to criticisms from
    the business community about excessive costs and regulations. As of yet, we have avoided
    having to take a position on most of the controversial positions in Dingell's bill. We informed
    Dingell about our concerns of an overly costly bill. He said he appreciated the feedback on the
    strengths and weaknesses of the bill and was pleased we would say positive things about his
    efforts in this area.
