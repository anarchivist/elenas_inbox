TEXT:
Many staff continue to raise with me the issue of why they cannot get
copies of the weekly report that is sent into the President.  Several
months ago we discussed this issue and I believed at the time that we
agreed to provide the Team Leaders with copies of the completed weeklies
(I also think it would be useful for Christa to receive a copy because it
often covers events). However, Team Leaders are not receiving copies and
I am having trouble explaining our policy, especially given that Cabinet
distributes their weekly to all DPC staffers.

I strongly recommend that we start giving out copies of the weekly at the
next Team Leaders meeting.

Please advise.
