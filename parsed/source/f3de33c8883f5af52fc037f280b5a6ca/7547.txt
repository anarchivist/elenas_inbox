TEXT:
Sandy Newman, the ED of this organization is a good friend --- he wants to
help us on tobacco expecially regarding the "increased crime--black
market" republican push back -- he has 250 law enforcement officials ---
from police chiefs to states' attorneys in his organiztion -- i know yo
have a meeting --or cynthia has set up a meeting w/ treas. today at 4:30
--- sandy thinks that he can issue a strong report that will commend the
Administration for our strong fight against crime -- but he also thinks
that if we can target more funds for child care that crime will actually
decrease --
so, i hope he can be helpful --- just wanted you to have this on your
radar screen and also wanted to validate sandy --- he does very good
work.  thanks
