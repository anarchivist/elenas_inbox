TEXT:
Lisa Kountoupes called with a quick request for some words to deal with
Tanner language reportedly to be accepted by W&M for welfare to work,
concerning performance measures and performance bonuses. The'language she
had did not appear to make any connection between WTW funds and TANF.

As before, my concern is with establishing a way of ensuring that what is
achieved with WTW money is additive to what will be achieved with TANF
money, and not paying off twice for the same placement. The language in
the e-mail below is an effort to give whomever she is talking with
something to work with on these points.

These sentences are consistent with the what's been said at the meetings
we've had with Haskins and with the Senate Ds, and with what I told you I
said to Chad Jenkins and to Ed Lorenzen last week.

Subject:            Performance language

Lisa: Here are some sentences that could help make the WTW performance
langauge more effective. Without the texts of the base Tanner, we can't
know for sure where they go, but if you send this up and make our point
clear, they should be able to fit it in.  Its also attached below:


Performance goals for each applicant for Welfare to Work funds     (formula


 and competitive} shall be increments to the performance levels that will
 be achieved with TANF funds, based on documentation provided by the
 applicant.

 Performance bonuses shall only be provided based on documented performance
 that exceeds the performance expected under TANF.

 Once performance measures are established for the TANF Performance Fund,
 the Secretary may modify performance measures and bonus standards for
 Welfare to Work to be consistent with those TANF Performance Fund measures.
