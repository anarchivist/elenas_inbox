TEXT:
I called, e-mailed and paged Barbra Chow who just called back to say she
wanted to still talk about it with Deich and Gottbaum could she tell us
tomorrow morning? I said if there is a problem they should tell us, at
this point we have Treasury, Commerce, Labor, SBA, DOJ, CEA,   Leg Affairs,
OPL, Counsels Office, and VP agreeing to this.  She said she understood.
I raised the EEOC money issue -- EEOC would prefer a specific dollar
authorization (they want $8 million but will settle for $2 million) and
she thought OMB might prefer to put to a dollar on it too.   She said her
only reaction was that it was "vague" but she understood the utility of
that.
