TEXT:
Elena/Sally:

B. Smith legislation?
According to DOL, some Republicans (including Lamar Smith) intend to
replace the Wyden-Graham H2A amendment with the Bob Smith guestworker
pilot bill. When that bill was marked up last march, we send a letter
with a Secy of Labor veto threat.   USDA had not heard this, but they are
going to try to gather some intelligence. DOJ is also going to find out
what they can (from their Judiciary committee contacts) .

This afternoon's meeting
We agreed that our framework for discussing recruitment should have three
parts: (1) the role of the government; (2) the role of the growers; and
(3) the role of the private sector intermediaries (farm labor
contractors). Al French (from USDA) would still like to see the registry
replace the grower's obligation to recruit, but Linda Delgado said that
the agency favors a continued requirement of positive recruitment by the
growers as well as an enhanced effort by the government to assist in this
recruitment.

There continue to be fundamental differences within the group on a basic
question that affects recruitment;   i.e., whether there exists an adequate
legal domestic workforce to meet the needs of growers.   USDA does not
think that there are adequate legal U.S. workers to meet the needs of
growers; DOL asserts that the supply would be adequate if growers would
offer fair wages and decent working conditions. Thus, DOL wants growers
to have to try harder to recruit domestically, while USDA wants growers to
have to meet certain minimums recruitment obligations and then have easy
(and cheap) access to the H-2A program.

One thing we all agree on is that there needs to be a way for growers to
verify whether a given worker is authorized to work in the U.S.  This is
the key to the success of any domestic recruitment effort.

The following reform ideas were floated:

Use of community based organizations to help link migrant workers to
employers. This could involve the federal government offering grants to
CBOs to perform this task.



More effective regulation of farm labor contractors (FLCs). The idea is
to ensure that FLCs operate fairly and effectively to provide legal
workers to growers. There are criticisms now that FLCs both provide
illegal workers and skim wages/fees from workers.

Consider what other entities (private or govt.) could assist growers in
finding workers and vice versa (grower associations; state employment
agencies; CBOs, etc.)

Require participation in the INS's employment verification pilot program
for growers who want to participate in the H-2A program. Are there other
(better?) ways to verify eligibility to work?

Build on America's Job Bank.

Agreement between the federal government and the growers that if the
grower uses the state employment service to verify all of its workers,    the
growers will not be subject to an INS enforcement action.

We asked USDA and DOL to think of other creative ideas on how to address
these three areas (role of the grower, government and intermediaries) and
get them to us by the end of the day tomorrow.
