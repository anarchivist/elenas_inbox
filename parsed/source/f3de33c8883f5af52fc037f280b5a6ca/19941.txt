        Dear Senator Ford,

                Last September, when I announced my plan for comprehensive tobacco legislation,
        made protecting tobacco fanners and their communities one of the five key elements that must be
        at the heart of any national tobacco legislation. Tobacco legislation must reduce youth smoking,
        it must not devastate our tobacco fanners and their communities.

                The tobacco program has made it possible for fanners, their families, and communities to
        enjoy a measure of economic stability. If the program is abolished, many fanners, particularly
        small and minority fanners, will be left in jeopardy and many will be put out of business.
        Senator Ford, your proposal, which is included in Senator McCain's comprehensive tobacco
        legislation, includes vital protections for fanners and their communities including continuing a
        tobacco control and price program. Your proposal satisfies the principle I laid out in September
        1997, demanding that any legislation meet the test of protecting tobacco fanners and their
        communities.

               It is possible to protect tobacco fanners and their communities, at the same time that we
        dramatically reduce youth smoking. Indeed, maintenance of the tobacco program makes it
        possible to control the amount of tobacco grown in the United States. I am confident that with the
        inclusion of your provision in comprehensive tobacco legislation, we will meet the goals of
        advancing public health interests and protecting fanners and their communities.

               Thank you for your important work in this area.


                                             Sincerely,
