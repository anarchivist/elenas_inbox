    TEXT:
    FYI, just in case you have not all heard this, the AMA left a message
    advising me that the House is planning on bringing up one of their
    "partial birth" initiatives for a vote sometime on or around this
    Wednesday.  Soon after resolution on this issue, they will bring up their
    version of the Patients' Bill of Rights -- probably no later than Friday.
    I am, of course, focusing on the latter issue because Newt Gingrich is
    planning on meeting with Nancy Dickey, the President of the AMA, on these
    and other issues this week.

    As you will recall, the AMA was and is taking the opposite position we are
    vis a vis the late-term abortion issue.  I am trying to make sure they do
    not get soft on us re the Patients' Bill of Rights.
