      TEXT:
      FYI, the House Judiciary Committee did not mark up H.R. 3206 this morning
      as scheduled. HUD and Justice were holding their letters to see if the
      Committee would take up H.R. 3206, so the letters never went to the
      Committee.

      In all likelihood, the Committee will take the bill up shortly after April
      recess.  Canady made some further changes to his substitute amendment late
      last night, so HUD and Justice will probably submit revised letters for
      clearance sometime over the next couple of weeks.
