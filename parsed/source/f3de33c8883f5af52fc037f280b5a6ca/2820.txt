                         PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
                     ANNOUNCEMENT OF CLONING LEGISLATION
                               THE ROSE GARDEN
                                  JUNE 9,1997

      Acknowledgments: Vice President Gore; Secretary Shalala; Dr. Harold Varmus, Dir.,
NIH; Dr. Jack Gibbons, the President's Advisor on Science and Technology; President's
Committee of Advisors of Science and Technology.

       I want to express my deep gratitude to Dr. Shapiro and the National Bioethics Advisory
Commission for preparing this report. As Dr. Shapiro described, the time was short, the topic
was difficult, and the area of inquiry was wide. I thank each of you for your commitment and
your courage to break new ground in public policy making.

        As the remarkable breakthrough in cloning we are here to address makes so clear, we are
living in a breathtaking era of scientific discovery. More and more, America's future -- and the
world's future -- depend on science and technology. And more and more, the scientific
community can influence the course of that future, and the lives our children will lead in the 21 st
century. As I said in my commencement address at Morgan State University last month, our
scientific explorations must be guided by our commitment to human values, the good of society,
and our basic sense of right and wrong.

        Nothing makes the necessity of that moral obligation more clear than the troubling
possibility that these new animal cloning techniques could be used to create a child. That is why
I acted quickly in March to ban the use of federal funds for cloning human beings -- and to urge
the private sector to observe this ban voluntarily -- while we initiated a national dialogue on the
risks and responsibilities of such a possibility. And that is why I asked the National Bioethics
Advisory Commission to prepare this report.

        For three months, the Commission has rigorously explored the scientific, moral and .
spiritual dimensions of human cloning. You have talked to leading scientists and religious
leaders; philosophers and concerned families; patient advocates and the general public. And
from many opinions and beliefs, one unanimous conclusion has emerged: attempting to clone a
human being is unacceptably dangerous to the child and is morally unacceptable to society.

        I believe strongly that this conclusion reflects a national consensus ... and I believe
 personally that itis right. Today, I am sending legislation to Congress that prohibits anyone -- in
either the private or the public sector -- from using these techniques to create a child [for the next
five years]. Until the day I sign that legislation into law, the ban on federal funding I declared in
March will remain in effect. And once again, I call on the private sector to refrain voluntarily
 from using this technology to attempt to clone a human being --it is untested, it is unsafe, and it
is wrong.


                                                  1
         I want to make clear that there is nothing inherently immoral or wrong MritllilltI!t~&eJlilewion
 techniques if they are used for proper purposes. In fact, these techniques hold out the promise of
 revolutionary new medical treatments and life-saving cures to diseases like cystic fibrosis,
 diabetes, and cancer; of better crops and stronger livestock. That is why this legislation will not
 prohibit the use of these techniques to clone DNA and cells, and it will not ban the cloning of
 animals.

         What this legislation will do is reaffirm our most cherished beliefs about the miracle of
 human life, and the God-given individuality that each person possesses. It will ensure that we
 do not fall prey to the temptation to replicate ourselves at the expense of those beliefs ... and the
 lives of the innocent children we would produce. Finally, this legislation will ensure that we
 continue the national dialogue we began three months ago.

         To make sure that all of our voices are heard as we explore the morality of human
 cloning, this legislation specifically requires the National Bioethics Advisory Commission to
 continue its study, and report back to me within four-and-a-halfyears. At that time, based on all
 of the available information, we will decide how to proceed.

          Banning human cloning reflects our humanity; it is the right thing to do. Creating a
  child through this new method calls into question our most fundamental beliefs about what it
  means to be human. It has the potential to threaten the sacred family bonds that are at the very
. core of our ideals. And at its worst, this technology could lead to misguided and even
  malevolent attempts to select certain traits and create certain kinds of children.

         We are still a long way from understanding all of the implications of this discovery. But it
 is our moral obligation to confront the issues it raises, and to act now to prevent its abuse. Once
 again, I thank the National Bioethics Advisory Commission for the work you have done and will
 continue to do in the coming years.

         Thank you and God bless you.
