TEXT:
Hi Elena,

Thanks for your help with this.  Following is the draft FYI -- as you'll
see it doesn't mention the case (I doubt our response will go out before
12/20) .

Thank you for writing to me.   I appreciate your words of support
  and encouragement, and I understand your concerns about support
  for the National Endowment for the Arts.  I have shared your
  letter with my staff in the Office of Management and Budget and
  the Office of Strategic Planning and Communications.

 While I am determined to reduce government spending, be assured
 that I remain dedicated to the preservation of American artistic
 and cultural expression. My Administration strongly supports the
 work of the National Endowment for the Arts, as well as the
 National Endowment for the Humanities, and the Institute of
 Museum Services. As you well know, these agencies enrich our
 national life and give needed support to artists, performers, and
 thinkers who enliven our spirits, challenge our minds, and touch
 our hearts.
