TEXT:
Kris and I spoke yesterday about the Cabinet. Cabinet Affairs has 10
slots for cabinet, but some could be one person in the am and one in the
pm. Here is what we discussed. This is 11 so one would need to be cut:

Reno
Browner or her designee
Glickman
Shalala
Varmus
Duane Alexander
Henry Foster
Riley
Rasco
Secy Cohen (we plan to add a DOD military parent to second panel)
Carolyn Becraft

I would bet both Varmus and Alexander would only be interested in panel 1
and lunch. Their slots could be filled by Joan Lombardi or another HHS
person (Rosewater?) or Wofford.

Are you okay with this? You and Bruce may get an earful from certain
people at HHS and elsewhere.

Kris, Carrie Filak has list of interagency task force members if you want
it for the possible reception.
