        TEXT:
        Elena--

        You had asked us to look into the issue that Nancy Zirkin with AAUW called
        about regardingTitle IV State Educational Agencies. Basically, this is an
        appropriations issue. When funded, this ED-run program (which name of
        which refers to Title IV of the Civil Rights Act) provides money to state
        educational agencies which in turn give schools guidance and technical
        assistance on providing equal opportunities to traditionally underserved
        students, including minorities and females (for example, assisting with T
        it Ie IX compliance) .

        The appropriation for 1997 was $7.3 million for all Title IV activities.
        This amount funded only
        10 regional desegregation centers, which provide technical assistance to
        districts on issues of race,
         sex, and national origin; no funds were provided for State Title IV
        offices which had been
        funded in 1995 and earlier years. The ED's budget proposal notes that in
        the absence
        of funding in 1996 and 1997, "20 states closed their Title IV offices and
        many others were forced to
        significantly reduce their operations and staffing."

        In the Administration's 1998 request, ED asked for $14.3 million to
        provide $7 million for the State
        agency desegregation efforts. Neither the House nor the Senate
        Appropriations Committee
        included the extra $7 million. Both limited funding to $7.3 million for
        the regional centers.  ED is not
        aware of specific reasons why the appropriators limited funds, other than
        their use of "same as
        1997" funding for hundreds of line items.  The AAUW and the Council of
        Chief State School
        Officers are seen as the biggest proponents of restoring the state
        funding.  ED is not very
        optimistic on this one given that it wasn't included in either approps
        bill.

        The Department notes that AAUW and other groups are more pleased with the
        results
        thus far on appropriations for WEEA (Women's Educational Equity). WEEA
        promotes educational
·

equity for girls and women through grants to public agencies, private
nonprofits, and
individuals--about 2/3 for local implementation of gender equity pOlicies
(like teacher training)
with the rest supporting a national publishing center and R&D. We
proposed to double
this program to $4 million, and thus far the Senate has gone along.

Given this background, and competing priorities, do you feel this is
something ED needs to be
making a special push on?
