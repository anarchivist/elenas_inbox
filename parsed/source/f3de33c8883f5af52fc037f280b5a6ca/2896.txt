Chairman
Committee on Agriculture
United States House of Representatives
Washington, DC 20515


Dear Mr. Chairman:

        As you know, the Administration and the bipartisan congressional leadership recently
reached agreement on an historic plan to balance the budget by 2002 while investing in the
future. The plan is good for America, its people, and its future, and we are committed to
working with Congress to see it enacted.

       The bipartisan budget agreement includes $1.5 billion in additional funding for the Food
Stamp Program to increase support for work and provide States with flexibility to exempt
individuals from the Food Stamp time limits due to hardship. I am writing to express the
Administration's deep concerns with the Committee's plans to implement the agreement's Food
Stamp provisions and to provide our viewpoint on two amendments which may be offered during
mark-up.

        We appreciate that the Committee's draft language to implement the 15 percent hardship
exemption, which is consistent with the Administration's approach. However, we have deep
reservations about the Committee's proposal for employment and training (E&T) funds for
able-bodied childless adults aged 18-50. The agreement specifically states that existing Food
Stamp E&T funds will be redirected and new capped mandatory funding added "to create
additional work slots for individuals subject to the time limits." The agreement provided $1
billion for this purpose. The Administration's legislative proposal would create 350,000
additional work slots over five years for individuals that want to work and would otherwise lose
benefits if a work opportunity were not available. The Committee's planned approach does not
achieve this end; it would create fewer than one-half the additional work opportunities for
individuals facing the time limit.

       The Committee proposal is seriously flawed for the following reasons:

o      The proposal lacks performance standards and accountability to ensure that the
       new Federal funding creates additional work slots. The Committee proposal gives
       States hundreds of millions of dollars without any meaningful provisions to ensure that
       they put forth additional efforts to provide work opportunities for persons facing the time
       limit. Without such performance measures, States can absorb the additional funds by
       changing cost allocation schemes among current employment and training activities or
       increasing the average cost of a slot.


                                                                      Automated Records Management System
                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion
       Federal money to significantly reduce their spending on E&T. Adequate
       maintenance of efforts provisions are necessary to ensure that the legislation provides
       maximum work opportunities. In FY 1996 States provided $73 million to fund E&T
       services for food stamp recipients. These existing State contributions are matched dollar
       for dollar at the Federal level. With the structure of the Committee's proposal for the
       new 100 percent Federal money, States could simply replace their funds with the new
       Federal money.

o      The proposal funds work slots that don't meet the welfare reform statute's tough
       work requirements for food stamp recipients. The Committee provisions allow States
       to spend unlimited amounts of the new 100 percent Federal money on work activities that
       don't create workfare slots or provide 20 hours of employment. The Administration's
       proposal targets funds to work activities that meet the tough standards for 18 - 50s -- . and
       provide opportunities for individuals willing to work.

o      The provisions are out of line with performance requirements for other Federal
       work programs for welfare recipients. The new Temporary Assistance for Needy
       Families block grant includes explicit participation targets to ensure that States use block
       grant money to create work opportunities. States that don't achieve participation targets
       forfeit a portion of their grant. The Administration's proposal is consistent with this
       approach, the Committee proposal is not.


         The Administration's proposal addresses accountability concems, while giving States
wide flexibility. It permits States to use 100 percent Federal funds to support work activities for
individuals in areas waived from the time limits due to high unemployment or too few jobs. It
also would fund activities, such as job search. The Administration proposal, however, includes
measures to ensure that the 100 percent Federal funding for these activities reimburses States at a
rate that reflects the lower cost of providing these services. Better targeting of reimbursement
rates, as well as the Administration's more accountable maintenance-of-effort requirements or
measures with equivalent results are essential to ensure that additional Federal funding for work
slots yields additional opportunities rather than just supplanting State spending.

        We understand that an amendment may be offered in the Committee mark-up
which maintains the current approach to Federal reimbursement for State costs to
administer the Food Stamps Program. We understand the purpose of this proposal is to
prevent costs from increasing in Food Stamps due to cost-shifting for common functions
from the new TANF block grant, which places a cap on T ANF administrative costs. We
understand the CRO baseline includes costs of over $6 billion in FYs 97-02 because CRO
assumes administrative cost shifting from T ANF to Food Stamps and Medicaid. This
proposal would reduce the extent of the cost-shift to Food Stamps, saving approximately
$1-$2 billion, although it would not prevent cost-shifting to Medicaid. While the
Administration is generally supportive of this effort -- to prevent States from changing cost
allocation plans in order to shift greater administrative costs from the capped T ANF block



     grant to the open-ended Food Stamp and Medicaid administrative costs that are matched
     by the Federal government -- we would need to carefully review the specific mechanism
     proposed.

            The budget negotiators discussed the Food Stamp Program at considerable length
     and agreed to a $1.5 billion restoration in funding. An amendment reducing Food Stamps
     and directing savings to other programs was neither raised nor included in the budget
     agreement. The Administration has strong reservations about such an approach.

             The Administration understands that amendments may be offered which would allow
     food stamp operations to be privatized. While certain program functions, such as computer
     systems, can currently be contracted out to private entities, the certification of eligibility for
     benefits and related operations (such as obtaining and verifying information about income and
     other eligibility factors) should remain public functions. The Administration believes that
     changes to current law would not be in the best interest of program beneficiaries and would
     strongly oppose such amendments.

            The budget agreement reflects compromise on many important and controversial issues,
     and challenges the leaders on both sides of the aisle to achieve consensus under difficult
     circumstances. We must do so on a bipartisan basis.

            I look forward to working with you to implement the historic budget agreement.

                                                   Sincerely,




                                                   Franklin D. Raines
                                                   Director
