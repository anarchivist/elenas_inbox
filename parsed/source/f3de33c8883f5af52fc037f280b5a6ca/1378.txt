TEXT:
Bruce, on Friday you asked me to turn my attention to our strategy for
bipartisan discussions regarding welfare to work.  I will che'ck in with
all my Hill sources.  I also would like to pull together a meeting this
week with Lyn, Ken and his staff, and Anne Lewis (NEC) to discuss the
principles we can agree upon and request paper and information we need to
push our position. Afterwards we'll see if we have a plan you and Gene
can agree upon.  How does that sound?
