                                           2/26/98




Q:   Do you have any comment on the news that the Liggett tobacco company is
     negotiating a settlement with the Justice Department? How would this change the
     Administration's legislative strategy re: tobacco?

A:   This matter is an ongoing Justice Department criminal inquiry, and we're referring all
     questions about it to the Department. The tobacco legislation now being discussed on
     the Hill would not in any way affect these kind of criminal investigations.

Q:   Does the Administration support the legislation proposed today by members of
     Congress to improve international control of tobacco products?

A:   The President has made clear that one of the elements of any comprehensive bipartisan
     tobacco legislation must be the strengthening of international efforts to control tobacco.
     Just this month the Clinton Administration issued guidance to its diplomatic posts that
     provides that posts should not promote the sale or export of tobacco or tobacco products
     and that posts are encouraged to assist and promote tobacco-control efforts in host
     countries. The Administration supports efforts to address the health risks associated
     with tobacco use at an international level by funding multilateral and bilateral efforts, but
     we have to review all proposals in light of our trade obligations. The Administration
     looks forward to working with members of Congress of both parties in crafting
     comprehensive tobacco legislation that contains international tobacco-control provisions.


Q:   I understand that in your responses to a letter from Senator McCain, you said that
     there are constitutional concerns with some aspects of the tobacco settlement. Does
     that mean you need the consent of the industry to impose advertising restrictions?

A:   It is absolutely clear that certain advertising restrictions can be put in place with or
     without the agreement of the industry. We strongly believe, as the Department of Justice
     has explained at length in the FDA litigation, that the FDA's regulations restricting the
     advertising of tobacco products are consistent with the First Amendment. As our
     response to Senator McCain notes, there may be constitutional issues with more
     far-reaching provisions. We have not concluded that they are unconstitutional, but we
     have indicated that we would like to work with Senator McCain and others to create
     restrictions that are as far reaching as possible while minimizing constitutional
     difficulties. As we have said before, we challenge the industry to put in place voluntary
     restrictions to restrict advertising -- since young people are not legally allowed to
     purchase tobacco products, we think the industry should be willing to restrict the
     advertising that targets young people.
