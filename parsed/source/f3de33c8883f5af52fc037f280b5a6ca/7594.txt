TEXT:
On Thursday, Patty Murray and Bill Clay will introduce our class size
bill.  Patty Murray wants to also offer it as an amendment to the McCain
tobacco bill when it comes to the floor, and has asked for our guidance.
I'm asking for yours.

From an education perspective, I think we should encourage Murray to go
ahead, if we can get Daschle's support to keep the Democrats united on
this.  Though our ultimate goal is the more modest one of getting class
size included on a list of things states on which states can spend $, I
assume it will take some considerable pressure for the R's to agree even
to that.

A fight over this amendment would help generate the attention to create
the pressure.   We'd have to get the education groups geared up for this
to work--and in order to do this we'd have to at least appear willing to
fight hard for class size 'in the final bill. I think that Riley can carry
most of the water on this, but we may also need to bring the groups over
here and have Bruce do another pep talk,

Is there a similar effort underway to introduce our chilq care package?
If so, can we coordinate these efforts, with respect to message and
perhaps by putting them in a single amendment?

Let me know what you think, so we can send Murray clear signals.
