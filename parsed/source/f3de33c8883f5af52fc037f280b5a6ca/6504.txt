MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF TRANSPORTATION

SUBJECT:       Standards to Prevent Drinking and Driving

We have made progress in improving highway safety during our Admiriistration. Our
progress has been accomplished through a variety of innovative and aggressive initiatives,
including our "Buckle Up America" Campaign to vastly increase safety belt usage and
improve child passenger safety, and the formation of a ground-breaking pUblic-private
partnership on airbags. We have also taken important steps to reduce the deaths and
injuries brought about by alcohol use and driving by signing a law to require states to
adopt "Zero Alcohol Tolerance" laws for young people who operate motor vehicles by
October 1998. To date, 46 states and the District of Columbia have enacted "zero tolerance"
laws for youth.

However, drunk driving remains a serious highway safety problem. Over 40 percent of all
motor vehicle deaths in 1996 -- 17,126-- were alcohol-related. More than 2,300 of these
fatalities were youths. Moreover, alcohol-related crashes cost society $45 billion every year, not
including the pain and suffering endured by its victims.

We can do more to prevent the many tragic and unnecessary alcohol-related deaths and
injuries which occur on the Nation's roads. That is why my Administration has called on
Congress to set .08 blood alcohol content (BAC) as the illegal per se limit nationwide. Research
shows that, at a BAC level of .08, drivers are impaired with regard to critical driving tasks, such
as braking, steering, lane changing, and judgment. The risk of being involved in a crash
increases substantially when drivers are at a BAC level of .08 or above. In fact, the relative risk
of a driver being killed in a single vehicle crash at .08 BAC has been shown to be 11 times higher
than it is with drivers who have no alcohol in their system.

Despite this elevated risk, in 33 states and the District of Columbia, their illegal impaired driving
limit is still at the higher level of .10 BAC. It is estimated that, if all states were to lower their
limits to .08 BAC, there could be 600 fewer alcohol-related traffic deaths every year.

I hope the Congress will enact this legislation as soon as p0ssible to encourage state passage of
.08 BAC laws. Even before the Congress acts, however, we can take action to promote .08 BAC
as the appropriate standard across the country, including on federalproperty.

I therefore direct you, working with appropriate Felleral agencies, Congress, the States,
safety groups and other concerned Americans, to report back to me in 45 days with a plan
to promote the adoption of a .08 BAC illegal per se limit. Among other things, the plan
should consider:

                                                                      Automated Records Management System
                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion


    (1)     setting a.08 BAC standard on federal property, including on national parks and
            Department of Defense installations, and working with local law enforcement in the
            enforcement of this standard;

    (2)     encouraging tribal governments to adopt and enforce a .08 BAC standard on
            highways in Indian Country that are subject to their jurisdiction; and

    (3) .   developing an education campaign to help the public understand the risks
            associated with alcohol consumption and driving.




                                                                     Automated Records Management System
                                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion
