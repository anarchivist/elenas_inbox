Draft 5/19/98 10 p.m.
                        PRESIDENT WILLIAM J_ CLINTON
               REMARKS FOR TOBACCO-FREE KIDS CAMPAIGN RALLY
                              THE WHITE HOUSE
                                MAY 20, 1998

         Nearly 35 years ago -- some two decades before most of the children here were even
born -- the Surgeon General of the United States sounded an alarm that has only grown louder,
clearer and more difficult to ignore with every passing year. The warning: Smoking kills.

        And for more than a generation, Americans of all ages and all walks of life have
answered that alarm -- fighting tirelessly to conquer this deadly threat and protect the health of
our people. In the face of some very powerful opposition, our nation has won victories both
large and small -- requiring all cigarette packages to carry warning labels ... prohibiting cigarette
advertising on the airwaves ... banning smoking on domestic flights.
                                                                                                         /
        Today, we stand on the verge of passing legislation that will do more than ever before to
stop the scourge of youth smoking.

         This week, the Senate is considering historic comprehensive, bipartisan tobacco
legislation, proposed by Senator McCain and Senator Hollings. Over the past few weeks, my
administration has worked with Senators in both parties to strengthen this bill -- protecting
Americans from the dangers of secondhand smoke in public buildings, dramatically increasing
health research and funding a nationwide advertising campaign to tell young people not to
smoke, and toughening lookback surcharges to make reducing youth smoking the tobacco
companies' bottom line.

       This bill includes a significant price increase to discourage youth smoking and affirms the
FDA's authority to regulate tobacco products. And I hope that in the next few days, the Senate
will make sure we do everything we possibly can to protect tobacco farmers and their
communities.

         This bill includes another provision -- an $8 billion annual liability cap that is available.
only to companies that agree to make sweeping restrictions in youth advertising, achieve
dramatic reductions in youth smoking, and comply with this legislation instead of tying it up in
court. This provision is controversial to some, but it is there to help achieve our goal, which is
to stop kids from smoking in the first place. Everybody knows that tobacco advertising lures
young people to start smoking, but the First Amendment limits what we can do to stop these
harmful practices. Everybody knows that we can pass the toughest law in the world, but we
won't achieve our goal of reducing teen smoking and saving millions of lives unless the tobacco
companies cooperate in this effort instead of fighting us in court every step of the way. If an $8
billion annual cap that doesn't prevent anybody from suing the companies and getting whatever
damages a jury awards will get tobacco companies to.change the way they do business and join
this historic effort to stop teen smoking, it is well worth it for the American people.

                                                   1

       I believe this bill is America's best chance to protect the health of our children, to keep
them from ever getting hooked on cigarettes in the first place. It is a good, strong bill, and
Congress should pass it without delay.

       I congratulate every child here for taking responsibility for your own health, for saYing
"no" to tobacco and "yes" to brighter futures. I wish you well as you make your voices heard on
Capitol Hill. Now it is time for America's elected leaders to do our part.

        Today, here on the South Lawn, stand America's future. For years, the tobacco
companies have looked upon these children and seen the "replacement smokers" ofthe 21st
Century. But I see more than 1,000 unique children who cannot be replaced. I see the scientists
and artists; the teachers and Olympic champions; the engineers and leaders of the 21 st Century.
Everyone of us has the responsibility to make sure these and all children across America have the
opportunity to live out their dreams and fulfill their greatest, God-given potential. That is why
we must pass this bill.

        Today, across America, 3,000 other young people of your generation will take up this
deadly habit, and 1,000 young people -- about the number here this morning -- will die early as a
result. So when you leave here and go up to Capitol Hill, remind every member of Congress
what this legislation is all about. Let this Congress be the Congress that saves those children's
lives.
