Subject:         Brownfields Action Agenda


Before I left for NYC last week, I talked with Peter Robertson, chief of
staff of EPA, regarding their action-agenda. As you are aware, the
Admininstration currently has a three-pronged agenda regarding
brownfields.

1. Tax Incentives -- the key component is the establishment of a new tax
incentive (immediate expensing to cover the cost of the cleanup) to
promote the cleanup and economic development of brownfields.  Treasury and
EPA are the leads on this legislative initiative.

2. Grants Program    EPA and HUD are seeking the creation of a two new
grant programs. One at EPA that would expand the existing site assessment
program and the other at HUD, which would provide grants and loans for
economic development at these sites.

3. Brownfields National Partnership -- This is EPA's 10 brownfield
demonstration cities pilot. EPA is already funding $125 million for site
assessment, cleanup, and State voluntary cleanup programs. They have had
good cooperation from HUD and Commerce, who are funding more than $500
million for local economic redevelopment efforts. However EPA wants more
assistance from some other agencies, particularly those departments who
have concerns about liability or other issues. These include Justice,
Transportation, SBA, OCC, and FDIC.

EPA would like for DPC to convene a principals meeting on Brownfields.
The agenda items would include:

1.Timing of announcement of Action Agenda;

2. Asking agencies for additional cooperation.   Particularly Justice,
Transportation, SBA, OCC, and FDIC;


3. Discuss communications strategy.

4. Legislative Strategy on tax and grants program.

Agencies to be invited to principals meeting would include

EPA
HUD
Commerce
Justice
DOE
DOI
USDA
HHS
Treasury
OCC
White House Communications
White House Legislative Affairs
NEC
OMB
CEQ
OVP
COS

Recommendation:

        In cooperation with the NEC, direct Elena, Diane Regas, and myself
to work on setting up the principals meeting and putting together an
agenda.
