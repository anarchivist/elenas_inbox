Subject:         Weekly Reports

Mickey asked me to find out if it would be possible to receive a copy of
your office's weekly report each week after you have submitted it to the
Staff Secretary. We can send someone to you to come copy it each Monday
if that would help.  Please let me know what you think.  Thanks!
