TEXT:
Although I consulted with OMB when I wrote my NGA resolution comments,
they only just sent Lyn and me some comments on our writeups that arguably
call on us to modify our commentary/positions on a couple of items.
Should I just forward these to Emily at this point?

Here's how OMB differed from me on the welfare resolution:

(1) they say we should oppose more flexibility to transfer from TANF to
SSBG; I had said no position.  I would tend to defer to them.
(2) on whether to exempt states from penalties if they make good faith
efforts, they thought my "do not support" position was too strong, since
the law permits HHS to consider good faith.

(They also thought my position of "do not support" on allowing additional
weeks of job search to count toward the work requirement was arguably too
strong, since we once supported NGA's position; but I have told them I
don't think we're in the business of endorsing looser work requirements in
any guise, no matter what our previous positions have been.)
