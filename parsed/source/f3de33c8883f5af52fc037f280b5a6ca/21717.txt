TEXT:
As I mentioned to Bruce Lindsey this morning,   I would be happy to help
out on tobacco/FDA legislation.   I have a long history as a food-and-drug
lawyer, know a fair amount about the 4th Circuit case (and have even
written about it), and have lots of experience dealing with our friend
Bill Schultz.    And, unlike some in the Counsel's office, I am not
conflicted out!
