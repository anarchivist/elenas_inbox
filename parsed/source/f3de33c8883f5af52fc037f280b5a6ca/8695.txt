TEXT:
Unfortunately, Stokes amendment to double level of vouchers on House
floor failed 215-201, but this still represents pretty solid support going
into conference.  Wellstone amendment to increase vouchers on Senate floor
did not happen.  So, we're going into conference with $40 M on Senate
side, most of which is earmarked, and $100 M on House side which is not
earmarked.  The House language is virtually identical to our proposal and
would set up a competitive, collaborative process. Senate does not have
such language.
