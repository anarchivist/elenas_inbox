TEXT:
the version I saw last night had a reference to the amendments' (offered by
Sen. Gorton) that are very problematic for Indian country.  I have had
many calls on this--it is Gorton's way of attacking sovereignty.   Some of
the tribes are trying to work on a price parity compromise, but it is not
good for this President to appear in any way condoning what the Gorton
taxation amendment provides.  I would hope that the line that was in the
letter last night could be restored.
