subject:         Re: Higher Education Commission

The Higher Education Commission was created by Congress (if I remember
correctly, as part of the supplemental approps bill).  It has six members
appointed by Congressional Republican leaders, four by Congressional
Democrats, and one by Riley. Riley appointed Barry Munitz, chancellor of
the California State University System.  The Democratic appointments are
walter Massey, president of Morehouse College, and Blanche Touhill,
chancellor of U of Missouri/St. Louis (Gephardt appointees), Clare Cotton,
president of the assoc. of independent colleges and universities in Mass.,
and Robert Burns, professor at S. Dakota State (Daschle appointees) .

The purpose of the commission is to study the rising cost of attending
college.  It is scheduled to report 4 months after its first meeting, in
time for having an impact on reauthorization of the Higher Education Act.

When originially proposed by Buck McKeon, we suspected the purpose was to
produce a report arguing that HOPE would lead to tuition increases.  I no
longer expect it to take that focus.
