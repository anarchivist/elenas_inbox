TEXT:
The Dems have invited OSHA to testify on enviro smoke at Jefford's 2/24
hearing. OSHA is ok with testifying -- they generally like the direction
of the Conrad bill.  Their cautions are that we might be negiotiating
something and don't want to get pinned down on a position prematurely or
that they will get asked about Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) regulations
generally.   OSHA doesn't expect the R's to invite them, so if we tell the
Ds not to, it probably wouldn't be missed according to Emily.
