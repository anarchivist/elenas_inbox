               Subject:         Rep. Harman's Request

               Karen:

               Here's where we are on Rep. Harman's request that the WH/President "
               intervene and direct the FCC to act expeditiously to award much-needed
               frequencies to LA's law enforcement and emergency response agencies":

                 1.  I reviewed the Congresswoman's request for the WH to intervene and
                 direct the FCC to award 8 previously vacant frequencies -- which were
                 instead awarded last year to a private paging company -- to LA law
                 enforcement and emergency response agencies. Rep. Harman points out that,
               . under a provision that she added to the Balance Budget Act, the FCC is
                 required to make such frequencies available to law enforcement in
                 broadcast-congested areas.

               2.  Since the request involved the FCC, an independent agency, I checked
               with Rob Weiner of WH Counsel on the appropriateness of calling the FCC.
               Rob explained that under no circumstances could I call the FCC directly on
               this matter, and that only the WH Counsel's Office could put a call into
               the FCC to get a status check. Even then, the WH could not direct the FCC
               to take any action.

               3.  I still met with the group of CA Chiefs visiting the WHo   Rep.
               Berman's office has asked me to do this meeting weeks ago.   We discussed a
               whole series of issues -- COPS funding, Methamphetamine Strategy,
               technology, asset forfeiture, encryption, and public safety spectrum.
       0'
....
       When the spectrum issue came up, I made clear to the Chiefs that I could
       not intervene in the matter.

       4.  Today, I spoke w/Rep. Harman's Chief of Staff.  I explained to him my
       inability to call the FCC on his concerns, but that I had still had a
       constructive meeting withe CA Chiefs he wanted the WH to meet with. He
       insisted that I should be able to at least call the FCC to determine a
       time by which they would address Rep. Harman and the Chiefs concerns.  I
       explained to him that I couldn't, but that I would speak to WH Counsel
       again.

       5. Rob Weiner reiterated that I was prohibited from calling the FCC on
       this matter, and that I could share WH Counsel's memorandum on this with
       Rep. Harman's Chief of Staff.  I then forwarded a copy of my file on this
       to Rob at WH Counsel.

       I hope this answers your questions.
       Jose'
