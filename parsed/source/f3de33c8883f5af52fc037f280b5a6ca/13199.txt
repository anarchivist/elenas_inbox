SENATE CONFIRMS CONFEREES ON SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM BILL
After weeks of delay, the Senate Nov. 17 approved conferees for the
House-Senate conference on the proposed' 'Private Securities Litigation Reform
Act of 1995"   (HR 1058).
The appointment of Senate conferees followed shortly after the Securities
and Exchange Commission Nov. 15--in a letter to Senate Banking Committee
Chairman Alfonse D'Amato (R-NY)--expressed measured support for the Nov. 9
compromise version of the bill's safe harbor provisions.
The Nov. 9 version of the major securities litigation reform bill, which
includes a safe harbor to protect some forward-looking corporate statements
from liability under the securities laws. The safe harbor is the chief aspect
of the bill that would affect high technology companies, Bruce Vanyo, a
partner at Wilson, Sonsini, Goodrich & Rosati, Palo Alto, Calif., told BNA
Nov. 20.
The Nov. 9 draft bill reflects changes that were requested by the SEC. The
high technology sector remains fully supportive of the bill, Vanyo maintained.
The SEC's concerns extend, to some extent, to areas beyond the scope of the
legislation that might also be affected by it, the litigator noted. Vanyo said
Nov. 20 that he expects the bill to go "as it stands today"    to the
conference committee.
The appointment of Senate conferees was delayed by in late October when
Sen. Richard Bryan (D-Nev), who was opposed to elements of the draft bill,
temporarily placed a "hold" on their appointment. This means that he
indicated to other senators in advance that he would not give his consent to
the appointment of any conferees, so they therefore did not request Senate
confirmation. The appointment of conferees requires unanimous consent of the
chamber appointing them.
The conference committee is expected to convene sometime during the week
of Nov. 27, a Senate Banking Committee staff member told BNA.
'Hotly Contested'


     In some quarters the bill is still viewed as controversial and "hotly
     contested, " a source told BNA Nov. 20. Other aspects of the bill--such as its
     failure to extend the current statute of limitations for private fraud
     suits--would prevent adequate investor protection, the source argued. Further,
     the SEC has endorsed the safe harbor provisions, but has not' 'flatly
     endorsed"   the measure, according to the source, who opposes the bill.
     The original House and Senate (S 240) measures--each designed to curb
     frivolous securities litigation--differed significantly, impeding the
     reconciliation process. Following an Oct. 23 draft compromise, SEC Chairman
     Arthur Levitt told a legal gathering he had' 'profound reservations"
     regarding some aspects of the draft bill, particularly about what the safe
     harbor for corporate forward-looking statements implied for investor
     protection.
     The Nov. 9 draft bill's safe harbor for corporate forward-looking
     statements incorporates the judicially fashioned "bespeaks caution"     doctrine
     under which forward-looking statements are not fraudulent if they are
     accompanied by, in this case, "meaningful cautionary statements. " Such
     statements must identify' 'important factors that could cause actual results
     to differ materially from those in the foward-Iooking statement." The use of
     the term' 'important" was requested by the SEC in lieu of the word
     "substantive, " Vanyo explained.
     In addition, the Nov. 9 draft of the bill incorporates other diverse
     changes to the safe harbor provisions. Among a dozen or so discrete changes,
     some concern clarifying the nature of forward looking statements that may be
     made by an underwriter; including a definition of "person acting on behalf of
     an issuer' '; and changing certain' 'boilerplate"  language borrowed from 1934
     Securities and Exchange Act Rule 10b-S to "false and misleading," as part of
     a standard of proof for plaintiffs.
     Conferees
     The appointees to the conference committee confirmed by the Senate Nov.
     17 are as follows: D'Amato, Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Texas), Sen. Robert Bennett
     (R-Utah), Sen. Rod Grams (R-Minn), Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman
     Peter Domenici (R-NM) , Banking Committee ranking minority member Sen. Paul
     Sarbannes (D-Md), Sen. Christopher Dodd (D-Conn), Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass),
     and Sen. Richard Bryan (D-Nev).
     Despite the confidence of some that the bill is in good shape to be taken
     up by the conference committee, sources indicated to BNA Nov. 20 that pending
     the convening of the committee, negotiators may still make changes to the
     bill. However, those opposed to the bill are not getting much access to the
     process, one source stated.
     Groups that have opposed the measure include: the National League of
     Cities, National Association of Counties, the Municipal Treasurers'
     Association, the Conference of Mayors, the Government Finance Officers
     Association, and the National Association of Securities and Commercial Law
     Attorneys.
     Strong proponents of the reform measure are the American Electronics
     Association, which has served as the leader for high technology firms who
     favor it; the National Association of Investors Corp.; and the' 'Big Six"
     accounting firms.
     Text of the safe harbor provision contained in the Nov. 9 draft is in
     section M.
