In addition to our Eli event and our conference and the release of
case load stats: I noticed on something Christa sent over that the
President is scheduled to speak to the NGA on July 28.  Is this right? Is
there a topic? And if not, wouldn't this be a great place for the
take-it-to-the-states kind of speech we've talked about before on welfare
policies?
