TEXT:
FYI, the scientists that created "Dolly" the sheep will be in the audience
at the President's Science speech in Philadelphia on Friday.   They will
not be addressing the group, nor will they have the opportunity to see the
President. Nevertheless, I thought everyone would want to now they would
be around.

Earlier, we had thought that the doctor who advocating human cloning would
also be in attendance. We have since learn that he will not be there.
