Subject: Bauer asks Congress to repeal Clinton executive order

Bauer Calls on Congress to Rescind 'Outrageous' Clinton Order Dictating
Affirmative Action for Homosexuals

WASHINGTON, May 29 /PRNewswire/    "President Clinton's order mandating
affirmative action on the basis of homosexuality should be rescinded by an
act
of Congress," said Family Research Council President Gary L. Bauer.  "It
discriminates against people with traditional views of sexual morality, and
lends the prestige of the u.S. Government to promotion of homosexuality.

"This will affect not only all federal employees but possibly anyone who
receives a federal grant or contract with the federal government.  In other
words, it will force a special preference for homosexuality into government
and private workplaces," said Bauer.



The executive order signed by Bill Clinton on May 28 adds "sexual
orientation"
to an earlier executive order, No. 11478, which mandates affirmative action
programs for federal employees. "By choosing to amend an affirmative action
order, the President is tipping his hand to the real agenda, which is to
use
government power to force acceptance of homosexuality on everyone,
regardless
of their most deeply held beliefs," continued Bauer. "This creates a
special
advantage in employment for people who are defined solely by engaging in
behavior that most people and all major religions declare to be immoral and
destructive. This outrageous power grab should be swiftly dealt with by
Congress.

"Homosexuality is not a civil right.  It's not like skin color, or
ethnicity
or place of birth.  It is defined by conduct, which is subject to moral
concerns," said Bauer.

"Perhaps we should not be surprised that this president is passionate about
crippling the ability of employers -- in this case, the taxpayers -- to
take
character into account in personnel matters.  This same President tore up
President Reagan's executive order on the family. Now he is demanding that
all federal employees pretend that personal conduct is meaningless, that
character is irrelevant, and that homosexuality is a plus for getting a
job,   II

said Bauer.
