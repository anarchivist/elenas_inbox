     Subject: Food safety continued

           Off the top of my head, and without having been personally involved in
     the
           work on food safety to any great extent, here is what I know:

        Food safety responsibilities are scattered, so there will be serious
        federal territory issues, as there was in 1993 when we proposed that
     food
        safety be consolidated in FDA. The turmoil that recommendation caused
     is
        one of the main reasons that the HHS accompanying report, which
     contained
        the recommendation, never came out.

        The 2 proposals being considered call for either a stand alone agency,
     or a
        new agency under the HHS umbrella. OMB is not considering
     consolidation in
        USDA.

        The big player is the meat and poultry industry and they would strongly
        oppose any consolidation into HHS--they've grown comfortable with the
     USDA
        oversight, and would expect massive change in the inspection system if
     food
        safety was under the HHS umbrella.


           Therefore   I would expect that USDA would find it more palatable to h
     ave
           food safety relocated into a stand alone agency, rather than in either
     an


     existing or new agency under HHS.

     Consumer groups would,applaud the single food agency concept, wherever
it
     was placed.

   While some may say this is an example of government growing, it's
really
   not--it's a consolidation of existing functions; nothing is being
expanded,
   there's really nothing new here.

     I'll keep poking around and keep you posted.
