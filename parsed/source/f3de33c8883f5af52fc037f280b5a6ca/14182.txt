TEXT:
FYI - Justice responded to our request for views on H.R. 3874
 (Civil Rights Commission of 1996) with a "no comment" or "no
objection."
From a legal perspective, Justice did not have problems with the
subpoenas or the staff director removal sections.
From a policy perspective, the civil Rights Division thought the
lack of program authorization was more problematic than these two
provisions. According to the Division, the Commission already
spends a great deal of time deciding who will testify at the
hearings.
Elena -- does the OGC concur in this position?
