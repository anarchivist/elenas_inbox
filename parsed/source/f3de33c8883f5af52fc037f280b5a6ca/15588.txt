TEXT:
Bruce, Elena, Rahm:

After reviewing the draft Meth and drug testing, here are my reactions:

1. Meth report shows our strategy is working.   Substantive and newsworthy
items include: (1) preliminary '96 data show that meth use is down from 7
to 52 percent in most cities; (2) clandestine lab seizures have increased
170% (from 326 in '95 to 879 in '96), and '97 seizures are escalating; (3)
increased meth penalties recently released by Sentencing Commission and
will take effect on 11/1/97; and (4) good, recent anecdotes on successful
prosecutions -- including life for meth dealers -- and lab seizures.

The report also discusses state and local cooperation, law enforcement
training, treatment, meth awareness campaign, improved efforts from Mexico
(1 ton of precursor chemicals seized last year), and precursor chemicals.

2. Update on Operation Drug TEST not ready.   The report on drug testing
still needs considerable work.  Problems include: (1) more than a year
later, not all 25 cities have program running (only 19); (2) no
numbers/impact to report; (3) mostly a re-hash of original EO and proposed
guidelines -- essentially no anecdotes; and (4) does not address issue of
treatment -- to what extent are we treating offenders that test positive?

Rec:  Play up the meth report and Treasury's GTO; hold the drug testing
report. Also, get with DOJ on improving the criminal justice drug
testing/treatment report.   It's too important an anti-drug and crime
initiative to get such short shrift.   Here are some initial thoughts on
improving the report: (1) Focus on cost-benefit of testing/treatmeqt,
along the lines of new RAND report; (2) broaden to include state and local
efforts, like crime bill-funded "drug courts"; and (3) included new
actions with reports -- Drug Testing Czar (in Dennis memo)?
Directive/guidelines for states to adopt comprehensive testing/treatment?
Push for testing/treatment dollars in juvie bill? Release of drug court
funds? I follow-up on these and check DB's files for more.    I know he was
talking to Mark Kleiman about some ideas.
