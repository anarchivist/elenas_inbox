Subject:         Etheridge update

Glickman and I are doing everything we can to give Etheridge what he
wants. Glickman thinks we've worked out Etheridge's peanut problem. On
tobacco, we can meet most of his concerns, and we're looking for a way to
meet all of them.  The major hurdle is whether we can commit to eliminate
something called the duty drawback program, which makes it possible for US
tobacco companies to get back the duty they pay on imported tobacco they
put into cigarettes for export. Etheridge wants to eliminate this program
as part of fast track. Glickman'thinks we can agree to cap the program,
but that eliminating it altogether might cause problems with other
tobacco-state members who represent manufacturers.   (USTR shares this
concern. )

Glickman's tobacco people and I will meet with Etheridge this afternoon to
see if we can work it out. Etheridge tells me he has a group of members
he might be able to swing with this decision (about half a dozen
Democratic members from tobacco country are uncommitted), but he won't
tell us who they are, because he doesn't want to jeopardize other deals
those members may be cutting as well:
