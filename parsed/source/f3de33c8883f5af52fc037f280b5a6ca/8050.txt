  FROM:   OMB LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS



DATE:      JUNE 9, 1998

SUBJECT:           LEGISLATIVE REPORT

Lott on tax cuts: Last month Lott secured the votes of Ashcroft and four
other Senate conservatives to pass the Domenici budget resolution, by
promising to move toward the House tax cut number.   Yesterday Lott said
that could mean a conference agreement O&in the range of $60 to $70
billionOS although some of the conservatives are claiming he committed to
accepting the House level without change.   (The Senate-passed resolution
suggests $30b of gross tax cuts, but has no net tax cuts; the House has
net tax cuts of $100 billion.)

Tax Conferences:    Conferees are reportedly close to agreement on H;R.
2646, a bill to expand tax-favored education savings accounts to cover
primary and. secondary school expenses.    The IRS Reform conference is
continuing; Members will have a public meeting of the conferees tomorrow
at 4pm; staff expect the IRS conference to be wrapped up by the July 4
recess.

Tobacco: Senate failed to invoke cloture today 42-56 -- 18 votes short of
the required 60. The vote was party line except for Ford and Robb who
voted against cloture.   (Inouye and Specter didn't vote.)   A second
cloture vote will occur on Wednesday, and a third on Thursday.   Daschle
is pursuing a strategy of attempting to keep the Senate on tobacco through
cloture votes and opposing any attempts to move to other legislation.

TEA-21 Corrections:   Rockefeller is continuing to object to consideration
of the highway corrections bill unless he is permitted to offer an
amendment reversing the VA/Tobacco provisions.  LottO,s response has been
that he will insert the corrections in another bill O&where (he) canO,t
touch it.OS   This probably means a conference report, since conference
reports cannot be amended. A likely candidate would be the IRS Reform
conference report due to its broad support and virtual certainty of
passage before the recess.

CONGRESS -- TODAY (6/9):
SENATE:
