TEXT:
As you know, the President's Task Force on Employment of People with
Disabilities has prepared a six.month report and would like to have an
event with the President in December. We've given the Task Force lots of
edits on its report, but one outstanding issue remains.  Tony Coehlo is a
bit dug in on this, and needs to hear from you or Gene in order to move
forward.  Tony can be reached through his office at 682-7430.

The report makes about 8 recommendations to the President, and we've made
sure they are all things we like and are general enough to leave us room
to fill in the details.  See below for some examples.  The issue of
dispute is whether a series of detailed recommendations from theTask Force
workgroups to the Task Force be included in the appendix to the report.
These workgroup reports contain dozens of unvetted recommendations not
endorsed by the Task Force. We have argued strenously that these should
be removed from the report to the President (and published or distributed
separately if they so choose) because including them:

        1) Detracts from the key recommendations the Task Force is making
to the President

        2) will expose the President, Sect. Herman,and Tony Coehlo to
premature questions    from the press and others -- about our views on
these matters.

The Executive Order required these Task Force workgroups to report to the
Task Force by 11/15 but did not require the Task Force to include the
recommendations in its report to the President. The EO simply requires
the Task Force to report to the President by 11/15 on "the actions taken
by, and progress of, each member of the Task Force in carrying out this
order. "



    Coehlo thinks that the caveats currently in the report saying these ideas
    are not endorsed by the Task Force are adequate, and that omitting these
    work group reports would be viewed as suppressing the work these groups
    have done.  I think they should publish them separately, get public views,
    and then in a later report to the President endorse the ones they want to
    endorse.

    Sorry to drag you into this.


    Sample Task Force recommendations to the President (that we would keep in
    the report)

    The President continue to work with Congress to pass the Patients' Bill of
    Rights.

    The President directs the Department of Health and Human Services, Social
    Security
     Administration and other appropriate Administration representatives to
    continue their
    work with Senators Jeffords, Kennedy and other Members of Congress to pass
    affordable, feasible legislation that helps people with disabilities
    maintain their health care coverage and return to work.

    The President propose program to increase the employment rate of adults
    with disabilities by fostering interdisciplinary consortia of and service
    integration by providers of services to adults with disabilities at the
    state and local level.

    The President direct the agencies and departments to implement a model
    plan to be developed by the Office of Personnel Management to increase
    the representation of adults with disabilities in the federal workforce.
