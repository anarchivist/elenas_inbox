     Q:   What was the announcement today by tobacco farmers and public health groups?

     A:   A coalition of public health groups and tobacco producers announced a set of core
          principles for national tobacco legislation. Among the organizations agreeing to the
          principles are the Burley Tobacco Growers Cooperative, the Flue-Cured Tobacco
          Stabilization Corporation, the American Heart Association, the American Cancer Society,
          and the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids. The principles are geared toward reducing
          disease caused by tobacco products while simultaneously ensuring the future prosperity of
          tobacco farmers and their communities. The principles discuss subjects such as FDA
          authority, limits on tobacco advertising to children, and providing fair and equitable
          compensation for tobacco farmers and their communities.

     Q:   Does the President support this effort?

     A:   The President strongly supports the effort to build a coalition between farmers and public
          health groups, and in his statement today the President congratulated the coalition for its
          work thus far. The President has made protecting farmers and their communities one of
          the five key elements that must be part of any comprehensive tobacco legislation he will
          sign. The coalition's effort and principles are an approach that is consistent with the
          President's policy on comprehensive tobacco legislation and he looks forward to working
          with these groups in the future.

     Q:   What is the significance of this announcement for the future of tobacco legislation?

     A:   The agreement between tobacco producers and public health groups demonstrates the
          potential to craft bipartisan comprehensive solutions that meet the goals of both the
          public health and tobacco farming communities. The Administration believes that it will
          be possible to form a similar consensus in Congress, and that the announcement today is
          another important step in enacting comprehensive legislation this year.

            STATEMENT OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
                             MARCH 16, 1998


I congratulate th'e public health and tobacco producer communities for working together to
promote bipartisan, comprehensive tobacco legislation that dramatically reduces youth
smoking and protects American farmers and their communities. I am firmly committed
that tobacco legislation protect farmers and their communities, and have made this
commitment one of the five key elements that I will insist upon before signing tobacco
legislation. I hope you will continue your efforts to expand your coalition and to enact
comprehensive tobacco legislation this year that protects our Nation's children.
