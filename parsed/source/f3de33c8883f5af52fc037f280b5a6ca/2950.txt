TEXT:
There are essentially two sponsors of the Education PSAs:

I. Education Excellence Partnership:   Business Roundtable. National
Alliance of Business"  NGA"  AFT, US Dept of Education, Chamber of
Commerce, and NEA.

II. Major League Baseball - Owners, Players Association (Don Feir)


Speakers in the program could be as follows (in order of priority)
- POTUS
- Major League Baseball Acting Commissioner
- Orioles Player (Ripkin, Mike Musina, Brooks Johnson?)
- Norm Augustine, CEO Lockheed-Martin, Pres. of Business Roundtable
Education     Task Force
- Governor
- Teacher

NOTE:  To do this announcement on the field immediately prior to the game
would probably mean that only the President and a baseball rep. would
speak BRIEFLY and then they'd show the PSA.  We would recommend, however,
that in order to present a full unveiling of the PSAs to the press and
allow the other key folks a chance to speak that there should be an
off-field event at the Wearhouse building at Cambden Yards before the
President goes out onto the field.

Players who have taped PSAs that will be showed continually through the
game are:
Tom Glavin, Atlanta Braves
Brettt Butle, LA Dodgers
Tony Gwynn, San Diego Padres

"The game is at 3:05pm on July 2nd.
