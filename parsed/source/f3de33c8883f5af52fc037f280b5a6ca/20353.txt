TEXT:
Elena,
FYI.   I attended a meeting yesterday with Maria and OMB (Michael Deich and
Steve Mertens) re: naturalization. Maria is interested in developing a
"good government" plan to reform the naturalization process (as you know,
there is now an almost 2 year backlog on naturalization applications).   In
the past, INS has asked for more appropriated funds for naturalization,
but has been unable to come up with a plan for how to spend the $ and how
that spending would reduce the backlog or improve efficiency.   Deich s
uggested that Maria ask us and OMB to work with INS over the next several
weeks on a plan for moving forward with goals, steps and a timetable.
Maria will likely call a meeting soon with INS, OMB and us to suggest this.

Julie
