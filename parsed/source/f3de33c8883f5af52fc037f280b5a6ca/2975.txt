TEXT:
Is there someone at the WH charged with tracking citizen responses to
the President's speech?    My law school classmate who was
instrumental in starting our discussion group on race is now
working with a client (the Rosewood Justice Center--named for the FL
community that the recent movie was about) to finalize plans for a
multi-cultural youth summit in St. Petersburg on June 28th. He tells me
the
byline for the program currently reads:   "St. PetersburgYouth Answer
President Clinton's Call For Open and Candid Dialogue
About American Race Relations."   I think they would be open to
Administration involvement; if nothing else, they would probably
welcome acknowledgement ....
