Budget Signing and Implementation. We were quite pleased with the outcome ofthe
Medicare, Medicaid and children's health reforms in the final budget agreement. Because of
your statement about the importance of a strong benefits package at the National Governor's
Association, we were able to secure a good benefits package which guarantees that States will be
able to choose from any of four benefits packages: (1) the FEHBP model; (2) the benefits
package ofthe most popular state HMO; (3) the state employee plan; and (4) the actuarial
equivalent of anyone of the three benefit packages stated above provided they cover an
equivalent level prescription drugs, vision, hearing, and mental health services_ We have found
that in the overwhelming percent of states, all three of the first options include the four benefits
you emphasize, so the states choosing the actuarial value option also will have to include these
meaningful benefits. We were also able to get a number of important provisions in at the end of
negotiations that will ensure that states use this money for uninsured children rather than
supplant existing funding. We also ended up getting in a Medicaid disproportionate share
formula that does not provide too much pain to anyone state, as both the House and the Senate
proposal would have done.

We are now beginning to develop our implementation strategy. In particular, we are discussing
ways in which we can work with the states to ensure that the new children's health investment is
used to cover as many uninsured children as possible.


Diabetes Announcement. Next Friday, you will announce (we hope with Speaker Gingrich)
the new investments in the budget which, according to the American Diabetes Association
(ADA), is the most significant development for diabetes since insulin was discovered in the
1920s. These investments include: $150 million over five years for Type I diabetes research
(most common in children); $150 million for prevention, treatment, and research for diabetes in
the Indian population (diabetes is nearly 3 times more cornmon in the Native American
population than in the entire population); and a new Medicare preventive diabetes benefit. You
are also announcing a new collaborative effort between HCFA, ADA, and the National
Committee on Quality Assurance to develop new standards of care for diabetes. This type of
collaborative effort is unprecedented in almost any disease, and diabetes experts believe it will
significantly help improve care for diabetics.

Fraud and Abuse. Next week we are preparing for the release a host of new initiatives you are
taking to respond to a recent HHS report which stated that the Medicare program lost $23 billion
last year due to overpayments and fraud and abuse. We hope to be able to announce that HCFA
is immediately halting payments to many of the providers identified as fraudulent in the HHS
report and conducting a comprehensive audit on other additional providers identified as
potentially defrauding the government. We have also achieved a commitment between HHS
and Justice to submit to a quarterly report on all fines, decertifications and ongoing investigations
on fraud and abuse and announce a new award for state and local governments and other
organizations who have demonstrated outstanding efforts to eliminate fraud and abuse. Lastly,
but probably most importantly, we will suggest that when signing the balanced budget into law,
you highlight all of the fraud and abuse enforcement provisions that you called on Congress to
pass that are included in it
                                                                         Hex-Dump Conversion


Pediatric Labeling. August II th, you and the Vice President will announce a new pediatric
labeling regulation from the FDA that will ensure that drug companies test their products
specifically on children who may need different doses and have different reactions_ Children
suffer from most of the same diseases as adults, however, most drugs have not been tested to
understand their unique impact on children_ The children's groups as well as the AIDS groups
(there has been little testing on the impact of protease inhibitors on children) are excited about
this regulation and event
