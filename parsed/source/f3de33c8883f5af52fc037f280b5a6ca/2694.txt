TEXT:
Can you give me a call sometime soon? I need your help in figuring out
how to move on the scheduling request we submitted for the President to
participate in the release of PSA's on education standards that the
business roundtable and other partners are doing with Major League
Baseball. We want POTUS to be at Camden Yards for the July 2 event.

Also, I want you to know that the weekly report will be ready later today,
and will include the following items (1) report of a meeting Riley and I
had with NGA exec. committee gov's on the testing initiative; (2) ED's
best estimate of how many school systems have kids from more than 100
language backgrounds; (3) an alert that ED's Voc. Ed Bill which will be
transmitted to Congress next week, along with a brief overview of the bill.
