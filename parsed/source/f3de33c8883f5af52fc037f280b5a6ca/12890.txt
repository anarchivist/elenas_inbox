By the way, it is a make or break issue for NEA to have their name
mentioned first -- they keep emphasizing how they have done all the work
and that we are just tagging along.  Thanks, Mary

                       PRESIDENT ANNOUNCES NATIONAL
                      SCHOOL SAFETY TRAINING PROGRAM
                  FOR TEACHERS AND EDUCATIONAL PERSONNEL
                                 .June 7, 1999

       Today, as part of the White House Conference on Mental Health, the President will
announce a national school safety training program for teachers and school personnel
launched by the National Education Association (NEA), EchoStar, and other partners.
This major nationwide public/private partnership, which includes the Departments of
Education, Justice, and Health and Human Services, to improve school safety, includes: (1)
a national school safety network of satellite dishes in at least 1,000 school districts; and (2)
a comprehensive year-long instructional effort for teachers, schools, and communities,
including how to identify and help troubled children and other important safety issues.
The goal of the campaign is to get teachers and school personnel the school safety training
they need for the coming school year.

A New School Safety Network

In order to make sure school districts have the technology to receive the new materials, the
satellite company EchoStar, which is based in Littleton, Colorado, is donating satellite
dishes to at least 1000 school districts, and its partner Future View, is donating 40 hours of
free time for programming. President Clinton will challenge other members of the
business community, including cable companies, public television stations, and other media
outlets, to donate resources so that every school district will be able to receive the materials.


Instructional Program for School and Community Personnel

The Departments of Education, Justice, and Health and Human Services will participate in
this public-private partnership by providing funding and other resources to develop at
least three training sessions; assisting in the distribution of any materials; providing
technical assistance in developing lesson plans; making government experts available for
training sessions; and working with NEA, EchoStar, and the other partners to make sure
that the resources and the goals of this initiative are coordinated in order to facilitate
outreach to schools.

In creating the lesson plans for the training sessions, the NEA has launched this program
with members of the Learning First Alliance, including the American Federation of
Teachers, the National Association of State Boards of Education, the National Parent
Teachers Association, along with other national education organizations as well as the
Fraternal Order of Police and the American Psychological Association. The Harvard
School of Public Health will also participate. The partnership plans to transmit the training
to school districts that will then be able to distribute the material by videotape to local
schools and hold hands-on training sessions with teachers, educational personnel, and
                                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion

community participants, including law enforcement.

In its first event in October of this year, the partnership will host a training session at
which teachers and school personnel can learn about identifying warning signs of troubled
kids and what resources they have to help those children. The training sessions will be
transmitted with donated satellites and through other means.

In addition to the first session focusing on helping troubled children, topics for future
meetings include discussion of common sense school security measures; school mental
health services; programs addressed to isolated and stigmatized students; comprehensive
safe school plans; developing partnerships between schools and the broader community,
including law enforcement, mental health authorities, and other local organizations; and
outreach to parents.
                                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion

                  Q&A on National School Safety Training Program
                   for Teachers and Educational Personnel
                                    June 4,1999

Q:   What did the President announce with respect to school safety?

A:   Today, as part of the White House Conference on Mental Health, the President will

Q:   How many training sessions will there be, and what are their topics?

A:   Beginning in October of this year, there will be at least 10 training sessions. In its
     first event in October of this year, the partnership will host a training session at
     which teachers and school personnel can learn about identifying warning signs of
     troubled kids and what resources they have to help those children. In addition to the

      this initiative are coordinated in order to facilitate outreach to schools.

Q:    How does this fit in with other efforts the Administration has made in the area of
      school safety?

A:    This proposal builds on other efforts the President has made in the area of school safety.
      The Administration's revamped Safe and Drug-Free Schools proposal contains a number
      of new initiatives to help keep our schools safer, more disciplined, and drug-free. The
      safe schools proposal will require counseling for students who bring guns and bombs
      to school, promote programs that educate students on the risks associated with
      firearms, provide more school counselors to help deal with troubled youth, and
      inform parents when guns are brought to school. This proposal also promotes more
      orderly and disciplined classrooms by allowing more education funds to be spent on
      alternative schools for disruptive youth, and character education to help instill
      common sense values in our young people.

       The Safe and Drug-Free Schools proposal also provides more effective prevention
       programs for the reduction of drugs and violence in schools, more accountability for
       results, and better targeting to those schools that need the most assistance. Under
       the revamped program, school districts will be expected to develop plans that:
       require schools to adopt comprehensive school safety plans, use proven anti-drug and
       violence prevention programs, establish security procedures for schools, and give parents
     . an annual school report of incidents of drug use and violence. In addition, the
       Administration's safe schools initiative would create Project SER V--the School Emergency
       Response to Violence --to dispatch a coordinated FEMA-like response if a school tragedy
       should occur.

      But whole communities need to get involved with keeping our schools safe. That is
      why the Administration created a new $380 million program, the Safe Schools- Healthy
      Students initiative, to establish community-wide responses to school safety. Our initiative
      will give communities funds to provide comprehensive services for our young people,
      such as mental health services, school resource officers, mentoring, and after school
      programs.

      Youth violence is a problem that government cannot solve alone. That is why the
      Administration called for the creation of a national campaign to reduce youth violence.
      This campaign will work at the grass-roots level with all sectors of our society - the
      media, education groups, parents, religious leaders, and young people - to focus on this

problem, find what is working, and spread it to new communities.
