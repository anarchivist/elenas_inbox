                            PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
                            RADIO ADDRESS ON HATE CRIMES
                                  Saturday, June 7, 1997

       This morning, I want to talk about one of America's greatest challenges, and also one of
our greatest opportunities: remaining strong as one America, and showing that we can live
together, and move forward together, across all kinds of differences.

        America is the world's most diverse democracy -- a nation of widely divergent
backgrounds and beliefs, bound together by our common values. The earliest settlers came to
our shores seeking freedom from religious persecution. And we cherish and uphold that same
freedom today: if you believe in the basic dignity of every American's life and liberty -- if you
live by our laws and live up to your responsibilities -- then you can share in the full promise of
the greatest nation on God's earth.

         Especially as we move into the 21 st Century and a global economy, our diversity is a
powerful strength. We are stronger as a nation because we harness the full potential of all our
people -- regardless of race or religious faith, national origin or sexual orientation, gender or
disability. People across the world see in America the reflection of their own great potential --
and they always will, as long as we give all our citizens, whatever their background, an
opportunity to achieve their own greatness.

        We're not there yet. We still see evidence of abiding bigotry and intolerance -- in ugly
words and awful violence, in burned churches and bombed buildings. For all the progress we
have made in civil rights and in human rights, these vicious acts of hatred remind us that we still
have a long way to go.

        In a predominantly white suburb of Atlanta, Georgia last month, an African-American
couple was greeted with racial epithets as they moved into their new home. One week later,
their home was sprayed with gunfire in the middle of the night. In a recent incident here in
Washington D.C., three men accosted a gay man in a park, forced him at gunpoint to go under a
bridge, and beat him viciously while using anti-gay epithets. Last fall in Los Angeles, a Jewish
student's dormitory room was bombed with a quarter-stick of dynamite, and a swastika was
drawn near the door.

        There is never an excuse for violence against innocent citizens. But these kinds of
hateful, senseless attacks -- committed solely because the victims have a different skin color, or
practice a different faith, or are gays or lesbians -- threaten America's most cherished ideals.
Each time one of these brutal acts of bigotry is committed, it is an act of violence against
America itself, making all of us less free to pursue our own beliefs; less safe to walk on any street
and shop in any store; less able to build a stronger, more united community in which to raise our
children.

        As a nation, it is time for us to mount an all-out assault on hate crimes -- to punish them
swiftly and severely, and to prevent them from happening in the first place. And we must begin
with a deeper understanding of the problem itself. That is why I am convening a special White

                                                                   Automated Records Management System
                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion
victims of hate crimes and their families -- to understand why the impact of these hateful acts is
so much deeper than the crimes themselves. We will bring together law enforcement experts
and leading officials from Congress and the Justice Department -- to take a serious look at the
existing laws against hate crimes, and consider ways to strengthen them. We will bring together
community and religious leaders -- to talk about the solutions that are already making a
difference in communities across the country.

        In preparation for this conference, I have asked Attorney-General Janet Reno to conduct a
through review of the laws concerning hate crimes, and the ways in which the federal
government can make a difference. Her report will help us build a plan of action to fight back
against the scourge of hate crimes.

        Of course, the fight against hatred and intolerance must be waged not just through our
laws, but in our hearts as well. A child born today does not know how to hate or stereotype
another human being. Together, we must make sure that child never learns how. Intolerance
does not generally begin with criminal acts, it begins with quiet acts of indignity. The bigoted
remark. The gay or lesbian who is denied ajob. The African-American who is followed
around the grocery store by a suspicious clerk. To truly move forward as one community, it is
not enough to prevent acts of violence to our bodies. We must prevent acts of violence to our
souls as well.

        By convening the very first White House Conference on Hate Crimes this
November, we will focus America's attention on the scourge of hatred and intolerance, and
new ways to punish and prevent it. We will take a serious look at the laws and remedies
that make a real difference in preventing hate crimes. And we will continue the frank and
open dialogue we must have to truly build one America, across all our difference and
diversity.

         For more than 220 years, America has been a shining beacon for the world -- of
democracy, of liberty, of creativity. Now let us be the world's beacon of harmony -- through the
unforgiving rule oflaw, and through the forgiving grace of the human spirit. For that is the only
way we can remain one nation under God -- indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. Thanks
for listening.
