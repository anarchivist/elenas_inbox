TEXT:
I've accepted an invitation originally extended to Bruce to appear on a
panel organized by the California Leadership Forum on "From Welfare
Dependency to the Work Ethic" with two members of the California
legislature and some think tank types.

I leave Thursday afternoon    by then I'll give you info on how to reach
me (I'll take a Skypager this time). Be back first thing Monday.
