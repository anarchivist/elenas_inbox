TEXT:
You asked about the status of the MOUs between the Department of Labor and
the EEOC that were announced at the Equal Pay event on April 2 by the Vice
President.  The "damages" MOU (that permits the Office of Federal
Contractor Compliance to serve as EEOC's agent for purposes of seeking
damages within the context of their conciliation efforts) is almost
completed.  This is the MOU that the women's groups are mostly concerned
with.

However, last May, Rep. Fawell sent letters to both the EEOC and OFCCP
indicating that he thought the "damages" MOU would radically increase
OFCCP's authority.  Both EEOC and OFCCP have responded to Fawell, either·
orally or in writing, and explained that the change would be narrow in
scope and would further the efficient resolution of these cases.

  In order for the damages MOU to move forward, we need three things to
  happen: (1) the EEOC and OFCCP need to send the final version of the
  document to OMB for clearance (we understand that it is near completion);
  (2) for the agencies to make sure that Rep. Fawell has all of the
  information that he needs, to make sure that he understands the nature of
. the agreement; and (3) for us to be comfortable that the release of the
  MOU will not jeopardize either the EEOC or OFCCP appropriations process.

I talked to Ellen Varygas about the timing tonight, and she agrees with
the three things that still need to be done.  I am waiting to hear back
from the Department of Labor regarding their sense of timing in order not
to jeopardize the appropriations process.  However, both EEOC (Ellen
Vargyas) and Labor agree that we could not do this before the middle of
August at the earliest.
