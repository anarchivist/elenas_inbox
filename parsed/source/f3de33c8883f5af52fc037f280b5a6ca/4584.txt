         Comments about Start ofthe State Children's Health Insurance Program


Before starting, I want to point out that today marks the first effective day of the new Children's
Health Insurance Program -- a $24 billion initiative that could not have been fully funded without
the tobacco tax we enacted into law in August. Not only does the tobacco provision help fund
the children's health initiative, but the increase in the price of cigarettes will help prevent
children from smoking in the first place. I thank many of the Congressional leaders here today
who have made this much-needed investment possible.

Starting today, the Federal and state governments will begin a partnership to help provide
affordable coverage for millions of uninsured children. On Monday, we learned from the
Census Bureau that the problem is even greater than we thought. . Nearly 11 million American
children now have no insurance, an 800,000 increase.

I am gratified to learn that many Governors and state legislators, as well as consumer advocates,
business leaders, health care providers and insurers are working hard to establish new health
insurance programs for children. But much more needs to be done. Today, I call for a
redoubling of our efforts to ensure that we never receive another report that the numbers of
uninsured children are increasing. And just as the new children's health initiative improves the
health of our nation's children, the next step we must take to is to pass a national tobacco
agreement that discourages our children from smoking.
