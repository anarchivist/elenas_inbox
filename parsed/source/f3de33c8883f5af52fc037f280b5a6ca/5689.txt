TEXT:
BR/EK:

The green eye shades at OMB called to make sure the new $50 million "OMB
Add On" in the budget was our community prosecutors/justice initiative,
and that we would settle for that amount.  I told them yes, and that I
thought BR had actually suggested that funding level as a compromise.

Hope I'm right. Hope we got/get the money. Hope the crime rates keep
coming down. Hope the Veep will appreciate what we're doing for him now
on this issue.

Jose'
