            announces a new program for the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American
            Relief Act (NACARA) beneficiaries?

Answer:     When the President was in Central America in March, he directed the Attorney
            General to seek under current law to provide parity in relief to certain nationals
            covered under the NACARA. Consistent with that request, the INS establishes
            a program that allows certain Salvadorans, Guatemalans, and former Soviet Bloc
            nationals to apply for relief from deportation under a simplified process in a way
            that recognizes their common hardship, deep roots in our society and
            contributions to our community.

Question:   During the President's recent trip to Central America, the President committed to
            submit legislation if parity could not be achieved for NACARA beneficiaries
            under current law. Does the President plan to submit legislation to address the
            inequities that remain under NACARA consistent with his commitment in Central
            America?

Answer:     Yes. While the President commends Attorney General and INS Commissioner
            Meissner for establishing this new simplified program, the constraints of the
            current law does not allow for complete parity for all NACARA beneficiaries.
            Therefore, the President plans to submit legislation to Congress that seeks to
            establish fair treatment for all NACARA beneficiaries.
