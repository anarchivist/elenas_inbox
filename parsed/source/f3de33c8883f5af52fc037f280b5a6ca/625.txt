TEXT:
Meeting with People for American Way/ACLU/religious groups went fine;
counsel's office and leg affairs were there; OMB didn't make it.   None of
us knew much about this, so we did our best. Groups say Ashcroft will
get excited (negatively) when he hears about our technical correction, and
that this is a major crusade of his.   He also wants to add the language in
the welfare law to every other program's authorization/appropriation, so
this issue could be getting bigger. So they want to be ready.    I told the
groups 'that support from the states would improve their/our chances on
prevailing on this.   They are also going to talk to the leg shops at HHS
and DOJ.

If you have a point of view on how hard we should be pushing this, let me
know.
