TEXT:
I would like to put together a DPC Planning Calendar.  My hope is to
create a calendar that we can all use as reference for anticipating and
planning events we would like to end up on the President's schedule.  I
would like to include the following information on the calendar:

                -anniversary dates (ie, anniversary of significant POTUS
bill signings, milestone                        anniversaries on issues
we cover)
                -conference dates (if we know a Cabinet Agency will be
holding a conference or                         if a group will be in town
for their legislative conferences, etc.)
                -annual events (ie, Kick Butts Day, etc.)
                -anything else you think we should be aware of!

please send me suggestions for this    calendar.  I would like to put it
together in the couple of weeks, so    if I could get information from you by
Friday, March 5th (end of next week)    that would be great!  I will put the
calendar together and distribute it    regularly.

Also, this is something I will constantly update, so if something comes
across your desk that you think we should know about, please pass it on.

Thank you and feel free to call me with any questions.
