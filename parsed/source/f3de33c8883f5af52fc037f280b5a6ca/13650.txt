TEXT:
As I understand it, would convert the entire auto liability system into a
first-party pay system, in which you would buy the level of coverage you want
from your own insurer, who would pay even if YOU won the tort case????? The
catch, apparently, is no compensation at all for pain and suffering. This
sounds nutty, but it's probably because the description I read is wrong, or I
just don't understand.  In any event, if it is this crazy, there should be
plenty of room to be in favor of no fault without being in favor of this bill.
Ellen
