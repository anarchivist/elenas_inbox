TEXT:
POTUS is holding a press conference next Tuesday, March 4. We've been
asked to get the briefing book in to staff secretary by tomorrow night.

Please email me your TPs by tomorrow at 3pm so I can get them to staff
secretary by their 4pm deadline.

CONTACT SUBJECT
Horwitz           Economic
Panareli          Int'l Economics
Goldberg          Counsel's
Millsap           Legislative
Lavery            political
Kagan             DPC

We can use the TPs from yesterday's press conference briefing book
let me know what we can just reuse and I cna just slip i t in. But I'm
sure we'll need some updates. We also should add "don't ask, don't tell"
and abortion (is that DPC for both, Elena?)

And Leg affairs should work with DPC to come up with camapign finance
(last time we had 2 sets). Thanks - - I am at 62712.
