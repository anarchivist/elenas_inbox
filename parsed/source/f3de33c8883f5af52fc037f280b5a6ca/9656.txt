TEXT:
INS (Alan Erenbaum) just reported that Senator Lott told CJS Chairman
Rogers last night that INS restructuring was a "no go" this year because
of Senate authorizer claims to this issue.

As a follow-up, Chairman Rogers called Senator Hatch to see if he could
work out a deal.  Hatch's COS said Hatch would call Rogers' back and hold
firm (no action until next year) it that is what the INS and
Administration plans to do.

I confirmed that our position remains that this issue should be addressed
next session by the authorizers.  He will call back after he hears from
Hatch's staff.
