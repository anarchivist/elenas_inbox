TEXT:


Next Friday, October 10, a plan for the race initiative will be presented
to Erskine Bowles.  Yesterday, a planning meeting was held to prepare for
the EBB meeting in which we began to identify specific goals and a process
for achieving those goals.

At yesterdayO,s meeting, we developed WH-PIR working groups to prepare for
the EBB meeting and develop a process for achieving the race initiative
goals (e.g., recruiting leaders) and conducting the necessary functions of
the race initiative (e.g., communications). (See lists below.) These
groups do not represent the definitive or complete working groups.  They
are a starting point for this process.

This Monday, we will hold a large-group meeting to discuss the development
of the particular areas. After the Monday meeting, each of the groups
will be expected to meet individually and flesh out their area. On
Wednesday or Thursday, another large-group meeting will be held to review
the working groupsO, plans and develop a more formal, overall presentation
for the Friday EBB meeting.

If you have questions, give me a ring 6-7492.

Thanks.
