TEXT:
I just spoke to Harriet, who confirmed that she and HHS are now passionate
that it is critical that we do at least option 2, i.e., that we file.
If the existing stay expires tomorrow and they have to go running to the
plaintiffs for a deal or the District Court for relief, she fears disaster
will result.    And any flak we would get from filing for cert (even with
the state action argument) wiould, she says, be exceeded by the flak we
would get if we're bback in District Court arguing anew against some of
the requirements of the District Court's existing injunction -- at the
same time as we are pushing for the patients 'bill of rights.  And HCFA,
of course, is totally unprepared to comply with the
injunction.

She is also persuaded that we need to at least modestly explain why the
decision below on state action is wrong and will create problems. And,
she believes, we can explain to the advocate community why we needed to
do this.
Harriet is p-lanning to call you, Elena.
