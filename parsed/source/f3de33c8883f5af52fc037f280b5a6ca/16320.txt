TEXT:
The repubs are meeting with themselves over the weekend. We should
expect "real" meetings with the Administration to begin as early as
Monday.  the Republican leadership is supposed to be meeting with the
various committees today to tell them to get moving.  Lack of action next
week will be more likely to result in the budgeteers jumping in.
(although they have threatened this before ... )

I will keep you posted if I hear anything different.  Besides getting
prepared for a tough week I do not think we will be needed this weekend,
but Barry I will need to be able to get in touch with you and you should
be able to get in touch with everyone else.

On immigrants -- yesterday at the budgeteers level the discussion focused
on a strict interpretation of "only doing what is in the agreement and
nothing more"  this extended to the immigrant provisions.    I think this
is the attempt of the republican leadership to get back in control in some
way of this proces where they have been loosing ground publicly and have
been unable to guide the work of the authorizing committees.   Stay tuned.
