TEXT:
Here is what I was able to learn about the FDA and USDA food safety
passbacks. USDA and HHS together asked for a $170M increase over the FY98
food safety level -- $61M for USDA and $109M for HHS.  USDA received about
half of its request in its passback. FDA received none in its passback.
The reason for this disparity is the different situations the two PADs, TJ
and Josh, were in. Josh, overall, had to dig himself out of an almost
$2B hole just to reach last year's level of spending, and then food safety
had to compete against some heavyweight programs including NIH, CDC, and
Ryan White. TJ had the flexibility to increase USDA's budget.

As you may know, the situation changes when the food safety budget is sent
to Congress. At the White House, USDA and FDA compete for funds from
different allocations. In Congress, USDA and FDA are in the same
allocation -- the agriculture appropriations subcommittees. OMB, however,
does expect the disparity will be straightened out before the budget is
sent to the Hill through the Presidential priorities process.·
