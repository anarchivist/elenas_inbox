Hey -- Gov. Shaheen wants us to do a Health Care for employees of Small
Businesses event in NH on Feb. 18    (in Dover) -- do we have anything to
say? Is there anything we can say that comes close to fitting this
theme? I doubt we have anything specific that fits this these, however,
we want to make the Gov. happy so it would be great if we could find
something that is somewhat related.

Thanks

Forbes
