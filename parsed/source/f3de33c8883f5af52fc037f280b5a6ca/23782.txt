They are requesting that Potus be their last speaker which would close
their program. They say that the sanctimony of the program is very
important to them to uphold and that their keynote speaker always speaks
at this time in the program. This would mean of course, that he would
have to sit through the distribution of diplomas.  They approximate that
the program with him speaking last would be 2 hours (I say 2 1/2 hours
given his probable speech length). Thoughts?
