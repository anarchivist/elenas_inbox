Re:            White House/HHS Response to the NGA Position On Child Care


Note:HHS has not taken a formal position against any of the NGA resolutions because they
      represent the opinions of only one organization. However, HHS has comments on each
      of the following NGA resolutions.

22.2, Adequate Funding

We agree that both discretionary and mandatory funds should be funded at full authorization
levels and that funding for the Social Service Block Grant should be maintained.

22.2.1, Seamless Child Care

We agree that states should have flexibility to run a seamless child care system.

22.2.2, Increased State Flexibility to Set Payment Rates

We recognize that states want maximum flexibility in setting payment rates. HHS is in the
process of developing regulations on these and other issues and will take these recommendations
into consideration.

22.2.3, Improved Program Administration

We recognize that states want maximum flexibility in defining administrative costs. HHS is in
the process of developing regulations on these and other issues and will take these
recommendations into consideration.

22.2.4, State Standards

(There is much controversy over this issue. HHS agrees with the law as passed and would not
like to see the NGA suggested modifications enacted.)

The statute allows states to set child care standards for all types of providers. However, the new
law does require states to ensure that standards are set in three key areas for all providers funded
with CCDBG money: minimum health and safety training appropriate to the provider's setting;
the prevention and control of infectious diseases (including immunizations) and building and
premises safety. HHS supports the law as passed. This provision continues to allow states to
set the actual standards, while at the same time ensuring that some level of standards are required
for all providers in these key areas which are critical to protecting the health and safety for
children in care.
