Attached is a revised version of the HR 2977 (ADR) SAP. HR 2977 is scheduled
for House floor action under suspension of the rules on Tuesday, June 4th.
At the request of OFPP (Kelman) we added a paragraph to the SAP on the Scanwell
court jurisdiction issue and at the request of Justice (Smith) we added the
bullet on binding arbitration.
Please let me know by 3pm today if you have any comments on the revised SAP.
Thanks,
Ingrid



DRAFT - NOT FOR RELEASE

                                                June 3, 1996
        (House)

H.R. 2977 - Administrative Dispute Resolution Act


(Gekas (R) Pennsylvania and Reed (D) Rhode Island)

        The Administration strongly supports House passage of
H.R. 2977, which would permanently reauthorize the Administrative
Dispute Resolution Act and make several improvements to the Act.

        The Administration will seek Senate amendments that reflect
the confidentiality and binding arbitration provisions in the
Senate companion bill (S. 1224) as reported by the Senate
Governmental Affairs Committee, which would:
?       Specifically exempt from disclosure under the Freedom
of Information Act (FOIA) records generated by an
agency and records provided to an agency in dispute
resolution proceedings.  Confidentiality of dispute
resolution communications is crucial to the success of
alternative dispute resolution.   Providing a clear FOIA
exemption will allow agencies to expand appropriate use
of alternative dispute resolution.
?       Authorize the use of binding arbitration by Federal
agencies when appropriate.
        The Administration will also seek a Senate amendment to
divest district courts of jurisdiction over government contract
bid protests and to vest this authority exclusively in the Court
of Federal Claims, thereby eliminating disparate bodies of law
and incentives for excessive litigation. with nationwide
jurisdiction, contract expertise, and the ability to hold
hearings at a venue convenient to litigants (including small
businesses) the Court of Federal Claims could establish a
consistent body of precedent governing bid protests.
