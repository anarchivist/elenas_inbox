    Delaine Eastin and John Doerr (who is heading up the CEO effort) met
    together with the VP in California on Thursday (Elaine was included in a
    dinner with Doerr and other technology CEOs that we already had
    scheduled), and both confirmed their support for the event.     Doerr is
    moving forward with gathering the industry endorsements.

  I spoke with Delaine Eastin this evening and confirmed that she is still
  commited to endorsing our testing proposal and expressing her intent for
  California to participate in it.  She is prepared for an event, with high
  tech ceo's on the 24th.  She has suggested a few schools in Union City
  --diverse, working class community 45 minutes from SF, with excellent
  schools that are involved in her challenge to adopt challenging academic
  standards, great public support, and cutting-edge technology initiatives
  -- as a possible site for the event.

  I don't know if this works logistically, and told her we'd get back to
  her.  The good news is we have the confirmation we need to proceed.
