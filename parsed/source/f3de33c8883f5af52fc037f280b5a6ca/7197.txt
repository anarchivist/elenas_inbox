TEXT:
Elena,
Peter is setting up a meeting between himself, you, Sally and
Representatives Lamar Smith, Mel Watt and Zoe Lofgren to discuss what the
Administration wants to be included in H1B visa legislation. They are not
interested in getting specific language from us; rather, they want. our
positions on (1) size and duration of the increase in the cap; (2)
training; (3) H1B reforms; and (4) the application fee.  This meeting will
likely take place on Thursday. Once the date/time is firm, Peter will
call Laura to coordinate with your schedule.

  As you know, our objective is to get strong reform language in the House
  bill. With the exception of the Department of Commerce, all of the
  agencies have agreed on both recruit & retain and no lay-off language.   In
  general, Commerce is uncomfortable with too much discretion being given to
  the Secretary of Labor to "second-guess" the recruitment and the lay-off
  decisions of employers. We are working with Labor and Commerce on a
. compromise.

Attached is a version of where we are with the language as of today. As
you will see, we include a proposa.1 for a new visa category that applies
only to very highly skilled science, engineering and math grads. All
agreed that this is an alternative that we could present.   I will update
you on the rest as we go. Thanks.

Julie

non-immigrant whose services are being sought will be employed. Such steps shall include
good faith recruitment in the United States using procedures that are standard practice within the
industry (e.g., wide-spread advertising of all job openings (such as through America's Job Bank,
the Internet, general circulation publications, professional journals and magazines, or job fairs),
or providing meaningful monetary incentives (such as paying above the prevailing wage or
paying bonuses and training subsidies not included in the base compensation package», and
offering compensation as required by subparagraph (A) and such good faith recruitment must be
unsuccessful.

        (ii) The recruitment requirements of this subparagraph shall not apply to aliens with

of more than 100 U.S. employees lays-off more than 10% of its U.S. workforce or 500 people
(whichever is fewer), the employer will not be eligible to apply for H-1B workers unless it
demonstrates to the Department of Labor that it is not seeking employees through the H-1B
program in the same specialty occupation(s) as those U.S. workers laid-off.

                   FY2000, and a maximum of 15,000 visas for FY2001.

                   year constitutes no greater than one-half of their U.S. based workforce are
                   eligible to apply.

                   math, science, or engineering are eligible for an H-1C visa.

                   additional 3 years.

            ·      AU ofthe requirements of the "H-1C" visa program would be the same as
