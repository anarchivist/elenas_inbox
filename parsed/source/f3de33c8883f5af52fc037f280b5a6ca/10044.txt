        Massachusetts HMO Drug Benefit Update. On Tuesday, HHS met with representatives of
        the four HMOs in Massachusetts that participate in the Medicare program to unveil a one-week
        opportunity to modify their benefit packages as an incentive to stay in the program. ill the
        absence of this action, at least one HMO -- which was providing the state's most comprehensive
        drug benefit to thousands of Medicare beneficiaries -- had indicated it would have to withdraw
        from the program. The HHS offer, which was coordinated with Senator Kennedy's office, was
        extremely well received by both the Governors' office, the plans, beneficiaries, and the state
        press. This was the case because it gave the political establishment the opportunity to pressure
        the health plans to not only stay in the program, but to also lobby the HMOs to offer equally
        substantial drug benefits. So far, three of the four plans have agreed to offer comprehensive
        drug benefits, as long as the fourth HMO (Harvard Community Health Plan) does so as well.
        (The plans believe that they will not be subjected to disproportionate adverse selection if all
        HMOs offer the similar drug benefits.) We will know by next Tuesday if the Governor and
        Senator Kennedy was successful in convincing Harvard Community to be responsive. If they
        are not, the other plans will likely submit alternative plans that protect them against adverse
        selection -- no doubt with much lesser drug benefits. If this occurs, Senator Kennedy's office
        believes that we (and they) are well positioned to blame the plans, and not HHS, for this
        situation.
