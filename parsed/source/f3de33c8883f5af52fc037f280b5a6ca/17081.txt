TEXT:
The Scheduling Office is looking at scheduling the 1998 State of the Union
on: Tuesday, January 27, 1998 or Wednesday, January 28, 1998.
We should let them asap if there are any conflicts or issues that could
interfere with those dates.

Also, right now there are open message event slots on Oct. 2 and possibly
Oct. 7 (if the fast track event falls through) .
