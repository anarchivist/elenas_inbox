TEXT:
Here's the latest on the conference:

Instead of sanctioning states for failing to enact .08 laws, the bill will
provide $500 million in incentive grants for states that have .08 laws and
other safety laws.  The incentive grants can be used for highway
construction.

On other alcohol-related provisions (open containers and repeat offenders)
the bill will contain a soft sanction for states that fail to pass
conforming laws states. Up to 3% of highway construction funds can be
diverted to highway safety construction (e.g., guard rails).

Re .08 message/statement: the leg and OMB folks want to say that the
conference agreement does not go far enough on drunk driving-- and that we
should have passed .08 as it came out of the Senate -- but we hope states
take advantage of the incentive program and pass .08 laws.  OMB is still
hedging on whether we'll veto over spending levels.  They want to wait
until the conference is closer to conclusion so they can be sure of the
final numbers.
