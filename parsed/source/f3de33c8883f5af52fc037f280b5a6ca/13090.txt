O?OOMEMORANDUM TO JUDGE MIKVA

FROM'              JEFF CONNAUGHTON, ELENA KAGAN

O?OSUBJECTO'               Hypothetical #2: Speech in Public Schools

The second hypothetical concerns·a school principal's policy to ban "controvers
ial or offensive buttons, Tshirts or itemsworn by students," The items cited
as "controversial oroffensive" constitute political speech.

O?OOOSUMMARY OF COURT DOCTRINEO

Students in public schools do not "shed their constitutionalrights to freedom
of speech or expression at the schoolhousegate, " Tinker v. Des Moines Indep,
Community school Dist"  393U.S. 503 (1969).  "They cannot be punished merely f
or expressingtheir personal views on the school premises . . , unless schoola
uthorities have reason to believe that such expression will'substantially inte
rfere with the work of the school or impingeupon the rights of other students.
'" Hazelwood School Dist. v.Kuhlmeier, 484 U.S. 260 (1988), quoting Tinker, 3
93 U.S. at 509.
The First Amendment rights of public school students "arenot automatically coe
xtensive with the rights of adults in othersettings." Bethel School Dist. No.
 403 v. Fraser, 478 U.S. 675(1986). Student preparation for adult experiences
 does notnecessarily ensure adult experiences on the school campus. Forexamp
Ie, schools need not tolerate student speech that is inconsistent with the scho
ol's "basic education mission." Id. at685. Despite the fact that the suppres
sion of speech has obviousFirst Amendment implications, courts are not necessa
rily in thebest position to decide whether speech restrictions areappropriate
   "The determination of what manner of speech in theclassroom or in school as


sembly is inappropriate properly restswith the school board,"   and not with th
e federal courts. SeeFraser, 478 U.S. at 683.

 Three Areas of Student Speech

Courts have discerned three distinct areas of student speechfrom the Supreme C
ourt's school precedents:  (1) vulgar, lewd, obscene, and plainly offensive spe
ech, (2) schoolsponsoredspeech, and (3) speech that falls into neither of thes
ecategories.

The standard for reviewing the suppression of vulgar, lewd,obscene, and plainl
y offensive speech is governed by Fraser, 478U.S. at 68385.  Fraser involved a
 speech given by a student at ah)O*O*O*high school assembly.  The speech contai
ned sexual innuendo andmetaphor. The Court held that the school district acte
d entirelywithin its permissible authority in imposing sanctions uponFraser i
n response to his offensively lewd and indecent speech. Unlike the sanctions i
mposed on the students in Tinker, thepenalties imposed in Fraser were unrelate
d to any politicalviewpoint.  "The First Amendment does not prevent the school
officials from determining that to permit a vulgar and lewdspeech such as Fra
ser's would undermine the school's basiceducational mission.     . Accordingly
, it was perfectlyappropriate for the school to disassociate itself to make th
epoint to the pupils that vulgar speech and lewd conduct is whollyinconsisten
t with the 'fundamental values' of public schooleducation." Chandler v. McMin
nville Sch. Dist., 978 F.2d 524(9th Cir. 1992).

The standard for reviewing the suppression of school sponsored speech is governe
d by Hazelwood, 484 U.S. at 273. Hazelwood involved a dispute over the deletio
n of two pages of anissue of a school newspaper. The principal deleted the pa
gesbecause they contained an article addressing students'experiences with pre
gnancy, and another article describing theimpact of divorce on students at the
 school. The newspaper waswritten and edited by students in a journalism clas
s as part of the school's curriculum. The Court declined to appy Tinker,holdi
ng instead that "the standard articulated in Tinker fordetermining when a scho
01 may punish student expression need notalso be the standard for determining
when a school may refuse tolend its name and resources to the dissemination of
 studentexpression." Hazelwood at 27273. The Court then validateddiscretion
ary editorial control by school officials over theschoolsponsored newspaper "s
o long as their actions arereasonably related to legitimate pedagogical concer
ns." Id. at273.

The standard for reviewing all other speech is governed byTinker, 393 U.S. at
51314.  In Tinker, junior high school students were suspended for wearing black
 armbands in protest of the Vietnam War.  The Court held that display of the ar
mbands wasa "silent, passive expression of opinion, unaccompanied by anydisor
der or disturbance" and that there was "no evidence whateverof interference, a
ctual or nascent, with the school's work or of collision with the rights of oth
er students to be secure and tobe let alone." Tinker, 393 U.S. at 508. The C
ourt explainedthat "where there is no finding and no showing that engaging in
the forbidden conduct would materially and substantiallyinterfere with the req
uirements of appropriate discipline in theoperation of the school, the prohibi
tion cannot be sustained. "Id. at 509.

D?'DDBRIEF ANALYSISD

The tshirts and buttons at issue cannot be considered perse vulgar, lewd, obsc
ene, or plainly offensive within the meaningh)O*O*O*of Fraser.   (As an aside, t
he Court in Fraser distinguished Cohenv. California, 403 U.S. 15 (1971). In C
ohen, the Court held thata man could not be criminally prosecuted for wearing
a jacketbearing an obscene statement disapproving the draft.   The Courtpointe
d out that students have "the classroom right to wearTinker's armband, but not


    Cohen's jacket."   Fraser, 478 U.S. at682.)

Neither would a court view the wearing of tshirts orbuttons by students as spe
ech bearing the imprimatur of theschool.  The buttons and tshirts expressed th
e personal opinionof the students wearing them, and they were displayed in a m
annercommonly used to convey silently an idea, message, or politicalopinion t
o the community.

A court, therefore, would likely turn to the third categoryof school speech an
d its standard: whether the buttons and tshirts were properly suppressed becau
se the school officialreasonably forecasted that they would substantially disr
upt, ormaterially interfere with, school activities.   Tinker, 393 U.S.at 514.
  The "reasonable forecast" test is a factual inquiry.

The hypothetical states that "[s)o far, these forms of student expression have
not resulted in any physicalconfrontations, but have led to some heated verbal
 exchangesbetween students." It also states the principal decided to issueth
e new school policy to "head off any possible problems." In myview, this reco
rd "does not demonstrate any facts which mightreasonably have led school autho
rities to forecast substantialdisruption of or material interferences with sch
001 activities,and no disturbances or disorders on the school premises in fact
occurred." Tinker, 393 U.S. at 514. Accordingly, I believe thestudents coul
d successfully challenge the school's policy on therecord before you.

One could argue that the appearance of racially chargedbuttons or tshirts in a
 "diverse, metropolitan" high school formed the basis of the school principal's
 "reasonable forecast"that escalated racial tensions and future disturbances m
ight soonresult and interfere with school activities. While the facts inthe
hypothetical seem too thin at this stage to support thatargument, some judges
might be more deferential than others tothe school principal regarding such a
judgment.

D?' "DDOTHER POINTSD

The hypothetical raises some interesting issues:

,   "ContentN~utral?


Putting aside the school setting of the hypothetical, youmight consider how th
e Court would treat the ban undertraditional First Amendment doctrine. For in
stance, would acourt consider a ban on "controversial and offensive" speechh)O
*O*O*"contentbased" and therefore deserving of greater scrutiny? Onemight arg
ue that the policy bans messages on both sides of allcontroversial issues, and
 therefore that it is not a viewpointbased restriction.  Contrasted with a ban
on all button and alltshirt messages, however, a ban only on "controversial an
doffensive" buttons and tshirts certainly is more problematic.

  This school's ban operates only on the speech that makes us feel uncomfortabl
e, or that is troublesome or contentious. Forthat reason, perhaps the ban tar
gets a category of speech that isespecially deserving of First Amendment prote
ction.  In theschool setting, it has been said that Tinker places a "thumb on
the scales" in favor of the state's interest in the FirstAmendment balance. E
ven so, however, "the schoolroom prepares children for citizenship, and the pro
per exercise of the FirstAmendment is a hallmark of citizenship in our country
." Chandler, 978 F.2d at 527. Students arguably should not be shielded from t
his type of speech in the interest maintaininggreater serenity.   "Courts have
a First Amendment responsibilityto insure that rhobust rhetoric.     . is not s
uppressed byprudish failures to distinguish the vigorous from the vulgar." Th
omas v. Board of Educ., Granville Cent. School Dist., 607 F.2dl043 (2d Cir. 19
79) .



%Overbroad?

You might note that even a student who wore an obscene tshirt to school and who
 was disciplined under this policy might challenge it successfully because it i
s overbroad. Under Fraser,the school could ban the "lewd, vulgar, obscene, an
d plainlyoffensive .. " But not with an overbroad policy such as that whichis i
n the hypothetical.
