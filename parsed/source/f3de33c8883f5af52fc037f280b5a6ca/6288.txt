TEXT:
What I'm hearing from folks is that becuase we have a great budget on
research by remaining silent it makes us look silly. Need to get someone
Klausner or Varmus to speak out on this. Groups are ok with
Feinstein/Kennedy bill. All the research community are anti the
republican bill, even the biotech community.
