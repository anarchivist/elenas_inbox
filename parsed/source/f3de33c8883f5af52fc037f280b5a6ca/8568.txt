TEXT:
DOL is ready to release California's Welfare-to-Work formula grant, which
is $190 M.  It doesn't look like either POTUS or VPOTUS will be in
California in the near future and DOL wants to get the grant out by the
end of July so the program can get up and running.  The VP's office has
expressed interest in doing some kind of announcement, probably before he
leaves for Russia.  One suggestion from DOL was to announce it at weekly
Wednesday meeting of California Dem delegation, but they don't think they
could pull this off for 7/15, 7/22 would be after VPOTUS is gone, so this
leaves 7/29. Other possibilities would be some kind of statement or
release, and a phone call to key members/electeds. Does anyone have any
other ideas for either POTUS or VPOTUS involvement?

There is an outstanding FLSA issue in CA's TANF program, but it's my
understanding that DOL is satisfied with the assurances CA has made in its
WTW Plan.
