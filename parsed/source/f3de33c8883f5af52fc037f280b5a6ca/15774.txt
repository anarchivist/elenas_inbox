TEXT:
In case you haven't seen it --

        The National Immigration Forum blast faxed today a piece
criticizing Shaw and praising the budget agreement, saying in part
"Proposal Candy Coats the Poison pill of New Restrictions by Pretending to
Offer Coverage to More Elderly" and "The Shaw proposal is a ruse designed
J



to obfuscate the fact that the most vulnerable will have no assistance in
the future."

        The fax also attaches a letter from the Leadership Council of
Aging Organizations signed by 20 groups including the AARP which says the
budget agreement represents "significant progress," urges the Committee to
locate additional resources, and says "We will not, however, support any
reductions in benefits to immigrants with disabilities in order to provide
them to otehr groups of·immigrants."

        Copies are available on my conference table in OEOB 212R.
