TEXT:
A statement I worked out with Dallas. We talked to the flue cured guy and
he thought it sounded fine. Burely is still out of pocket.

While complete information is not yet available, the Administration
supports the effort announced today to provide needed resources to tobacco
farmers.  The Administration has repeatedly stated its commitment to
protecting tobacco farmers and their communities, a commitment the
President affirmed last night in his State of the Union address.   We look
forward to working with all parties as this process continues, including
Members of Congress, to ensure the financial well-being of tobacco
farmers, their families, and their communities.  Farmers who never
marketed cigarettes to children and worked hard to sell a legal crop
should be protected.
