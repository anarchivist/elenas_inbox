    TEXT:
    I wanted to reiterate my earlier invitation to stop by my open house this
    evening. My use of "y'all" may have been misunderstood for those of you
    who are fluent in southern! Hope to see you later, or better said, I hope
    to be able to see you later!

    Assuming that I have not been tarred and feathered by then, we are going
    to host an open house for the members of the President's Council on
    HIV/AIDS on Tuesday evening from 6:30-7:30 in room 470 of the OEOB. We
    would greatly appreciate it if you would stop by. A little show of support
    would go a long way in helping to manage some of the dynamics of this
    group.

    Thanks much!

    Sandy
