Jen and I just finished conference calls with 8 Governors Offices: Almond,
Voinovich, Edgar, Whitman, Chiles, Hunt, Romer, Carper. For what its
worth, here's what I think-
Anything other than adding more money to the block grant opens up all the
old fights and will be opposed by a significant portion of states (no
matter what policy you choose). States mainly think the block grant is
working and don't want more complicated funding streams. There is always
a split on quality and serving more kids (as there was today and not on
party lines)--and I think we should stay out of that. Lastly, it seems
like a big looser to me to pick a particular age group-each state has
their own view of where the need is.  I can't attend the Deputies meeting
this week but I look forward to future confrontations with HHS!
