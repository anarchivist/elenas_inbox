I know we have a great accomplishments piece on the web page. But when
Joe briefs at noon today, he is likely to get the Susan Page question,
which is wasn't last year a bust in terms of accomplishing things proposed
in the SOTU.   Has anybody done a list just of the things mentioned in the
SOTU last year      foreign, domestic, whatever -- that were accomplished?
If not, perhaps we can do it through this process right now:


Saving Social Security
First and most important stage of 100,000 teachers
NATO enlargement
Bosnia mission funding
After-school portion of child care

Was IMF in the SOTU??

Anything from climate change??

Anything on drugs??

What else??
