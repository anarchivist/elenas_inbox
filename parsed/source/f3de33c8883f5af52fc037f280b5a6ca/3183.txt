  Subject:         Tobacco & Food Safety Funding

          I've been advised that though FDA was only given a $19 million BA
  increase over the FY 1997 enacted level, for a FY 1998 level of $907
  million, the Ag Approps Subcommittee directed FDA to spend +$24 million on
  food safety (+$14 million) and tobacco (+$10 million) ,* consistent with
  what Tim Sanders advised you of earlier this week.

          Since the Subcommittee only provided a total $19 million BA
  increase, the Subcommittee directed that other program activities within
  FDA (like the Commissioner's Office) be reduced by a total of $5 million,
  in order to provide the $24 million increase for the food safety & tobacco
  initiatives.

        * FDA already had $5 million in tobacco funds in their base budget
        authority.  The Subcommittee's $10 million increase for tobacco would thus
        bring FDA's total tobacco funding in FY 1998 to $15 million.
