TEXT:
This is just to clarify that we did talk to Jim O'Hara about the letter
earlier this week, and he had confirmed with me for a second time
yesterday that they were all set and understood what they had to do.   DOJ
 (Phil Bartz and Gene Thioroff) also confirmed to me that they understood
what questions they had to answer and they were all fine with it.   But in
order to clarify any possible lingering confusion, we have faxed out today
a list indicating which agencies should have primary responsibility for
specific questions.   Regards, Mary
