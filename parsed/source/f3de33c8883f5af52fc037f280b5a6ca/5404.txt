Race Initiative

 1.     I have been working with the Town Hall people (Ann Lewis and Minyon heading the
effort) on questions for the President and the moderator to use in Akron.

2.     Also today, Tanya and I met with folks from the PIR and Bob Shireman to discuss the
agenda for the December 17th Board Meeting. The topic is K-12 education. The proposed
themes of the day are equity and excellence in primary and secondary education. They envision
a more chatty format, with panelists taking questions from the audience and the Board. The
proposed panelists include education experts (those who have promoted various models of
school reform), students, parents and teachers from urban, suburban and rural school districts.
These panelists would be expected to discuss the varying experiences of public education and the
challenges that still exist (racial isolation; low expectations; etc.). Though they would take
questions from the audience, they talked of scripting some questions or at least getting
submissions from the group, and screening for interesting and relevant ones.

        They envision the second session as including a discussion of "promising practices" --
 programs where schools or school districts have been successful in overcoming racial divides (in
 resources; expectations; racial segregation; etc.) This panel would include people who are
 involved in programs that bridge racial divides and education experts with different views on
 how best to achieve equality of opportunity for kids.

       This is all still very rough, but we are hoping to seem more concrete stuff (including
 names of potential panelists) over the next several days.

 3.     I met today with John Goering (PIR) and Lisa Ross (DOL) re: the January 13th Board
 meeting on employment. It is in its very early formative stages .


. Immigration

 1.      We (NSC, WHC, Maria) had a meeting with the INS· and Justice this afternoon re: the
 implementation of the suspension of deportation provisions of the new law as applied to
 Guatemalans, Salvadorans and Eastern Europeans covered by the new law. The advocacy
 groups have asked (1) for a regulation that provides for a presumption of "extreme hardship" for
 all central Americans covered by the legislation; (2) an additional provision that provides for a
 presumption of "good moral character" for the same group; and (3) that the process be handled by
 asylum officers (w/in INS; an administrative process) rather than immigration judges (EOIR).
 The INS and DOJ are very opposed to doing a reg., but have proposed a new administrative
 scheme that would permit asylum officers to determine suspension of deportation claims. This
 would expedite the process for applicants, be cheaper (no lawyers), but would still allow
 immigration review (de novo) if the applicant is denied by the asylum officer. It also seerns to
 make sense because the ABC class members (who make up the bulk ofthose covered by the
 legislation) are entitled to an asylum adjudication anyway, and the suspension process could be
 incorporated into that proceeding. The INS is going to give us an outline of their proposal,
                                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion .

which will include an explanation of how different groups covered by the legislation (i.e., those
who have been through the asylum process already; those who have dates scheduled before
EOIR, those not in the system, etc.) would be affected by this administrative change. We should
have that by the end of the week.

2.     Last Wednesday, Steve Mertens from OMB let us know that he was including a reform
proposal in his passback to INS. Though INS had seen an earlier version ofOMB's thinking a
couple of weeks ago, we were concemed that INS not think that the OMB proposal was any kind
of benchmark for our review, or that it in any way had the imprimatur of the EOP. We voiced
these concems to Mertens at that time. According to Scott Busby at NSC, Commissioner
Meissner was displeased that OMB included a reform proposal in their passback, outside of the
DPC process, and without further consultation with them. We spoke with Mertens today, and he
informed us that Commissioner Meissner had informed the DOJthat it is inappropriate for them
to comment on the OMB proposal while the DPC review is happening.

3.       Leanne and I have one more INS reform meeting to go. On Thursday, we are meeting
wIth the second group of advocates (arranged by Maria) to talk about services (the other was on
enforcement). By the end of the week, we will have a summary for you on the meetings that we
have had. Our next step, we think, is a White House meeting on the reform (trying to get a sense
of where people are intemally) where we would also discuss how much we think we need to have
done by the middle to end of December (thinking about whether we want something to be part of
the President's budget proposal). We would next want to meet with INS on their own, to
discuss options. DOJ has told us that the sooner we can make some broad decisions (whether
the restructUre within INS, within DOJ, pull some functions out, etc.) the better they would be
able to tailor the Booze Allen (management consultants) review that they are about to start.

4.      You had asked me to follow up on a letter that we received from the Carnegie
Endowment re: employment verification pilot programs administered by the INS. Carnegie, et
al was concerned about whether these pilots were be,ng conducted with the appropriate concem
for civil rights and privacy. I spoke with Bob Bach who informed me that INS has a RFP out to
get bids on performing the evaluative function of the pilots. They will have chosen a winner by
early Winter, with the hope of having the evaluation begin by March or April. The groups are
concemed that pilots are running now without evaluation. However, according to Bob, only one
pilot (of 5) is operating now, and they are moving with the evaluation process as fast as they can.
 Bob has not been able to give the groups any more information on this effort, for fear of creating
the appearance of impropriety in the bidding (i.e., the same groups that are asking for information
on the process are bidding in response to the RFP; thus, ifhe gives too much information to one
group on how they want the evaluations to be structured, they could be opening themselves up to
a challenge on the fairness of their process)

5.       As far as I know, we have not reached closure on the Haitian issue. Is there something
else I should know or should be doing?

6.     Leanne has been following up with Alan Erenbach re: battered women and 245(i).
