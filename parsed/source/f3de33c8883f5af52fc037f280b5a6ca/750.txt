TEXT:
Yes, I meant if you heard something more from DOJ after this week -- not
for these events.

Both Reiner and Levine said they had discussed with the NGA creating a
"flexible fund" for states to use, if they wanted to apply for it, for
child care, health care, parenting skills, and home interventions for at
risk mothers.  I'm sure they are thinking billions, not millions, and I
would think it would take the governors and some on the Hill less than a
nanosecond to turn this into a multibillion dollar block grant by block
granting WIC, Head Start, Child care, our parents as First Teachers
proposal, etc.

Perhaps we can discuss this tomorrow -- I think we need to quickly put
together a 3-4 page document on Clinton Administration efforts in these
areas (Head Start 55% increase, WIC over 25% increase, health care
coverage expansion proposal, Parents as Teachers, HIPPY, etc.) for both
Reiner and Newsweek so that they know the Clinton record, particularly if
Newsweek is going to have a policy focus.
