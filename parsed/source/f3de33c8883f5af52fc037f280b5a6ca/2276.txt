TEXT:
Barry Toiv asked for a Q&A on the GAO welfare study described in today's
Post. Here's a shot at it:

Question:       DoesnD,t the latest GAO study reinforce the fact that, while we
know caseloads are dropping, we donD,t know what happens to these people
after they leave welfare, and that is essential to judging whether welfare
reform is a success or not?

Answer: This study is further evidence that states are taking
action to ensure that welfare becomes a second chance, not a way of life.
Like last weekD,s report by the Council of Economic Advisers demonstrating
that state welfare waivers are part of the reason caseloads are declining,
the GAO report does not analyze what happens to recipients who leave the
welfare rolls after they refuse work.  (It does note that one-third of the
families initially dropped returned to the rolls after agreeing to comply
with work requirements.)  It is important to note that state efforts to
move people from welfare to work will be helped tremendously by the fact
that the welfare lawD,s payments to states are based on caseloads at their
peaks. States will have more money per welfare recipient than they have
ever had, and will be in a position to invest these funds in welfare to
work efforts.

There are still many important questions to be answered, but the welfare
law will undoubtedly be the most studied piece of social policy
legislation in a generation, with analysis both by government agencies and
outside groups.
