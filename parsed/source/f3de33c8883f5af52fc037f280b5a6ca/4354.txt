TEXT:
Erskine wanted some background so he knew the dispute before he called
Leslie Bryne back. Below is something one of us could send or call Carol
Parmalee with ....


Background:
The Office of Consumer Affairs is very small, with a staff of only 13
currently, and is structurally affiliated with both HHS and the White
House.   The Director of the Office is Leslie Bryne, a former member of
Congress, also has the title of Special Assistant to the President. The
Office of Consumer Affairs has its budget administered by HHS even though
it has a separate appropriation.

Current Situation:
The United States Office Of Consumer Affairs was not included in either
the House or Senate VA-HUD Independent Agencies Appropriations bills for
FY 1998. The OMB proposed budget is very small, $1.8 million. The Office
was included on the Administration "add "back" list for FY '98
appropriations.    Director Bryne reports HHS is anxious to dismantle the
Office and has proposed relocating employees as soon as this week. She
would like Administration support for adding the $1.8 million in
conference, if possible, and likely hopes the Chief of Staff will
intervene to stop the relocation or riffiing of her employees by HHS.
(Director Bryne was also the subject of items in two recent "In the Loop"
columns for taking a trip to Paris for an international consumer
conf erence . )

Political and policy Implications:
The Director points out that dismantling the Office of Consumer Affairs is
not consistent with this President's strong sta"nd for consumers and sends
the wrong symbolic message to observers.  She argues that Leon Panetta
intervened in past budget disputes to avoid sending the incorrect signal
that the President does not care about consumers.

The Office has potential as a policy advisor to the President on consumer
affairs and coordinator of federal policy on consumers.

There are structural inconsistencies with the way consumer issues are
handled, and elimination of the Office would end the structural conflict
with HHS.   That is clearly HHS's position.

An alternative long-term solution would reconstitute the Office under a
--
     new executive order, clarifying its role and affiliation with the white
     House. A temporary funding solution would allow for that outcome.
