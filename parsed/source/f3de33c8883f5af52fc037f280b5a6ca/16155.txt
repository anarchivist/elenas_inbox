TEXT:
The House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution is scheduled to
markup H.R. 1909 - The Civil Rights Act of 1997 - tomorrow, July 9th at
2pm.

H.R. 1909 would ban the government from considering race and gender as
factors in hiring and awarding contracts.  H.R. 1909 is similar to the
104th Congress bill H.R. 2128/S. 1085. Justice (Deval Patrick) testified
in opposition to H.R. 2128 and the testimony stated that if H.R. 2128 were
presented to the President the Attorney General would have recommended
that the President veto the bill.

OMB just received a Justice letter to the Subcommittee on H.R. 1909 which
 .,                                                                         Page 3 of3


states that "the President has indicated that he would accept my [the
Attorney General's] recommendation and veto the bill." We have circulated
this letter with a 4pm, today, deadline for comments.  In addition, we
expect to receive for clearance, later today, a Labor letter for the
Subcommittee markup tomorrow.
