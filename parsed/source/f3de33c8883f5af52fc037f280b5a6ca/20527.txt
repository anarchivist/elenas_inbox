    TEXT:
    The House Judiciary subcommittee marked up this week HR 3789, the Class
    Action Jurisdiction Act of 1998. They have made significant modifications
    to address some of the concerns in the DoJ letter opposing the bill.
    Nancy Miller at DoJ's OLP is preparing a summary of the bill as revised.
    The bill should be considered in the context of the securities litigation
    class action bill (although securities class actions are carved out) and
    to tobacco, since tobacco class actions appear to be covered.

    We thought it would be helpful to pull together interested folks to talk
    about substance and strategy.    (DoJ, Fran Allegra and Nancy Miller; DoC,
    Josh Pinkus or Eric Biel; NEC, DPC, OMB, WH Leg Affairs, OVP, others??)

    Leg Affairs    please identify who will participate and will be working on
    this bill.

    Elena -- Who should represent DPC?

    Ingrid -- Who from the program side of OMB should be included?



Charles/David -- Who from OVP?

Sonyia Matthews will call on Monday to set something up for July 7th or
8th, after the 4th of July holiday.
