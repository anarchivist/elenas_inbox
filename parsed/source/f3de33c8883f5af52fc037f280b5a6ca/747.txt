                       GAMBLING IMPACT STUDY COMMISSION
                                                                     February 6, 1997


BACKGROUND
Fueled by concerns about the growing gambling industry, the 104th Congress passed the
Gambling Impact Study Commission Act. The Act establishes a Gambling Impact Study
Commission ("Commission") to study the impact of gambling on states, localities and Native
American "tribes, The Commission must submit a report to the President in August 1998
containing recommendations for legislation and administrative actions based on their findings.

ISSUE
The selection of members to the Commission has come under recent scrutiny. William Saffire
and a 2-2-97 Washington Post editorial complain that nearly all the nominees have close ties to
the gaming industry which will impact their final recommendations. They further suggest that
the selection of appointees is directly linked to financial contributions made by gaming interests,

SELECTION OF MEMBERS TO THE COMMISSION
The selection of the 9 members of the Commission is as follows: 3 members appointed by the
President, 3 members appointed by the Senate (2 Republican appointments, 1 Democrat), and
3 members appointed by the House of Representatives (2 Republican appointments, 1
Democrat). This formula gives Democrats 5 appointments and the Republicans 4 appointments.
 The list of named appointees is as follows:

House Speaker Gingrich:
1. J. Terrence Lanni, Chairman and CEO ofMGM Grand Inc,
2, Kay Coles James, Dean of the Robertson School of Govemment at Regent University

Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott:
1. Dr. Paul Moore, radiologist from Mississippi
2. Dr. James Dobson, Focus on the Family

Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle:
Leo McCarthy, former Lt. Governor of California

Minority Leader Gephardt and the President have not yet named their appointees. The list of
possible appointees leaked to the press is as follows:  '

House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt:
John Sweeney of AFL-CIO, or John Wilhelm ofthe Culinary Union

President Clinton:
1. Bill Bible, Nevada Gaming Control Board
2, Minnesota Native American
3, A "split the difference think tanker"
appointees the week of January 20. Presidential Personnel will not specifically name the
individuals they submitted nor will they say if the President has approved their list. They expect
to make an announcement later this week.

COMMENT
If the Commission is comprised of the above-listed appointments (including those not yet
named), there is evidence that 5 appointments would be pro-gaming, 2 would be anti-gaming
(both Republican nominees), with 2 unknowns remaining. It is likely that at least one of the
unknowns. will side with the pro-gaming wing of the Commission. This will be unsatisfactory to
those who argued for the need to establish the Commission.

Assuming Bill Bible is not viewed as an anti-gaming regulator but as a member with pro-gaming
industry interests (a likely scenario), the current list of Presidential appointments is tilted to the
pro-gaming side 2-1 and may ultimately end up 3-0. It should also be noted neither of the
Congressional Democratic appointments is likely to side with the anti-gaming interests.

RECOMMENDATION
In order for the Commission to have credibility, it would probably require at least one or more
appointments that is viewed as anti-gaming (e.g., appointee from religious community, or
possibly sports industry). If the list of Presidential appointments is revisited, it must be done
quickly since the appointments are already due to Congress.
