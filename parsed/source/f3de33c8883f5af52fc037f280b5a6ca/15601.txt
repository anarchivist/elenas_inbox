TEXT:
The Post lawyer argues that under FACA we have an obligation to get
materials out BEFORE meetings, hence the urgency:  "it is the commission's
legal duty to provide this material immediately and without delay. The
FACA requires that access to material covered under section 10(b) be
provided to requesting parties, at a minimum, "before or at the meeting at
which the materials are used and discussed." Rick Weiss of the Post
requested the material from the Commission May 15.

Do you want to talk to HHS general counsel to explore further?
