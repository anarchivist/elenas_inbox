TEXT:
thanks for including me in today's meeting.    I hope to be over there
soon, and will look forward to continuing the discussion begun today --
and I'll have more information once I'm there.   For now, though, let me
mention a couple of areas in which I think DOE can play an important role.
In many cases, that will be a supporting role, and in all cases, I expect
it to be a collaborative one with a number of other agencies.

The Economy
Domestically, its high profile focus next year will probably be on
electricity restructuring, to make the industry more competitive and to
increase choices and reduce costs for industrial, commercial and
residential customers
with our "heavy industries" (steel, chemicals, autos, etc.) DOE has active
partnerships focused on jointly developing "technologies for the 21st
century", many of which are new, more efficient manufacturing processes
and products

International Economic Development --
One of our most active areas of international business activity,
especially in the developing world, is energy projects.  Our U.S.
companies are engaged in numerous international projects, especially joint
projects in developing countries, where we are using our expertise and
capital to help develop the basic energy infrastructure in areas such as
South Africa, China, India, and Latin America
Our joint R&D with U.S. industries on increasing energy efficiency of
manufacturing and products is also helping to keep those industries
competitive in the world market.
oil imports continue to be our number 1 balance of payments problem.   We
need to continue the dual tracks of improving our domestic energy supply
sector, especially oil and gas, and of increasing the efficiency and
conservation programs so we get the most out of the energy we do use.

Urban Development and Sprawl --
As urban areas are being redeveloped, we need to encourage the use of the
most energy efficient buildings, transportation systems, municipal
lighting and other technologies, and DOE already has some significant


success stories

Environment --
In the climate change area, DOE has the most active, widely supported set
of initiatives of any agency.   The industry cooperative projects and
pilots on technology development and use offer an opportunity to draw in a
wide base of indu'stry support.

National Security ("a safer world")
Russian cooperation centers on DOE in areas such as the safeguarding of
nuclear weapons material and the conversion of such material to peaceful,
commercial uses (eg, uranium to commercial power plant fuel rods),
including the initiatives the President announced on his August trip, such
as the nuclear cities initiative
Strengthening our domestic energy sector (as described above) lessens the
threat of potential disruption of our energy supplies, which are becoming
ever more dependent on foreign sources

R&D, Science, and Education at the University Level --
DOE is the nation's primary sponsor of high energy physics research
facilities and research projects, including numerous linear accelerators,
and the Spallation Source which is being designed to be built at Oak
Ridge, Tennessee and will be used by researchers around the country in
physics and health research
the leading edge of high performance computing is being sponsored by DOE,
and has impressive statistics on computer speeds and size (its primary
focus at DOE is to certify our nuclear weapons stockpile in the absence of
testing)
