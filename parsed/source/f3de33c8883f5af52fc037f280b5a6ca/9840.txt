The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA) established a scheme under which
certain aliens unlawfully present in the United States could apply for permanent residence. An
applicant must have resided continuously in the United States in an unlawful status since at least
January 1, 1982; must have been physically present in the United States continuously since
November 6,1986 (IRCA's enactment date); and must have been otherwise admissible as an
immigrant. In order to be eligible for this benefit, the applicant must have applied during the
12-month period beginning on May 5,1987.

On May 1, 1987, INS promulgated several regulations related to eligibility that were later found
by the courts to be inconsistent with the statute. Two of the regulations dealt with an alien's
travel outside the U.S. during the application period. Another indicated that receipt of any form
of public benefit (even for citizen children) would cause the alien to be ineligible for legalization.
 Because ofthese regulations, many individuals who were likely eligible for legalization were
turned away from INS offices and otherwise discouraged from applying. The CSS and LULAC
class action lawsuits challenged the INS travel regulations in federal court. The Zambrano class
action challenged the benefit regulation.

The district court in all three cases held that the travel and benefit regulations violated the statute,
ordered the INS to extend the application period to November 30, 1988 for class members who
were deterred from applying for legalization because of knowledge of INS's unlawful
regulation(s),-and issued an injunction requiring the INS to withhold deportation and provide
work authorization to these class members pending resolution of their claims. The DOJ
appealed all three orders to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, arguing that the federal courts had
no authority to extend the deadline for any discreet group of aliens. The 9th Circuit affirmed the
district courts' orders to extend the deadline in all three cases. I

DOJ appealed these rulings to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court rejected the DOl's
position that the lower federal courts did not have jurisdiction to change the application deadline
for a discreet group, but held that the district courts had erred by not determining whether the
claims of class members were "ripe." The Court explained that a plaintiffs claim challenging the
INS's legalization procedure was only "ripe" once that plaintiff took the necessary affirmative
steps in the application process prior to INS's application of the erroneous regulation to him.
Thus, if an alien was "front-desked" -- i.e., presented a completed application to the INS and had
his application rejected prior to its being filed (based on a determination by someone at the "front
desk" that one of the regulations made the alien ineligible) -- his claim was ripe for
adjudication. In addition, in a footnote, the Court indicated that a plaintiff could also have a ripe
claim if the front-desking policy was a "substantial cause" ofthe alien's failure to apply for
legalization. The Court remanded these cases to the district courts and ordered the courts to
conduct ripeness analyses regarding the various discreet groups.

On remand, the district courts all held that an applicant who was told by the INS that they were
ineligible because of the application of one of the erroneous regulations had a ripe claim and was

enjoying (stays of deportation and work authorization). The DOJ appealed these rulings to the
9th Circuit in early 1996, arguing that the district courts had misinterpreted the Supreme Court's
remand.

During the pendency of this appeal, Congress enacted Section 377 ofthe Illegal Immigration
Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRlRA), which retroactively stripped the federal
courts of jurisdiction over any claim under the legalization program, unless the applicant filed a
completed application (including an application fee) with the INS within the original statutory
window. 2 After IIRlRA was enacted, the DOJ moved to have the CSS, Newman, and
Zambrano suits dismissed. On January 16, 1998, the 9th Circuit ordered the district court to
dismiss all ofthe plaintiffs' claims in CSS for lack of jurisdiction. The district court had a
hearing, dismissed the case, and invited the plaintiffs to file a new cause of action. On May 8,
1998, because of the 9th Circuit's interpretation of Section 377 in the CSS case, the district court
dismissed the claims in the Zambrano case.

The CSS and Newman classes total approximately 300,000 people. These classes were open to
new members as late as 1996. The Zambrano class was closed at the end of the 5-month
extension period ordered by the district courts (November 30, 1988). This class includes
approximately 9,000 people.

Since the dismissal of these suits, DOJ has determined that class members are no longer entitled
to work authorization, stays of removal, or any immigration benefit on the basis of class
membership. According to INS, approximately 80,000 class member received work
authorization and stays of removal during the pendency of these cases. All of these people
(many of whom have lived and worked in the U.S. for more than 10 years) will lose their
authorization to work in the coming months. In addition, because class members were not
subject to deportation during the pendency of the litigation, most did not apply for suspension of
deportation under the old rules (you must have a final order of deportation prior to being eligible
to apply for suspension). Now, the rules have changed. The standard for "cancellation of
removal" (the new terminology) is much stricter and presents a significant bar.

         2 Section 377 ofIIRIRA reads in relevant part: U(C) JURISDICTION OF THE COURTS --
Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no court shall have jurisdiction of any cause of action or claim by or on
behalf of any person asserting an interest under this section unless such person in fact filed an application under this
section within the period specified by subsection (a)(l), or attempted to file a complete application and application
fee with an authorized legalization officer of the Service but had the application and fee refused by that office.
