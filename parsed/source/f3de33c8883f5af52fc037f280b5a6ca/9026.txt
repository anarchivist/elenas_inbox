            ob Reiner Pushes Ballot Initiative

                                 By Michelle Locke
                                 Associated Press Writer
                                 Sunday, August 9, 1998; 12:56 p.m. EDT

                                 BEVERLY HILLS, Calif.     (AP)     Rob Reiner is on the phone
            with an
                                 Oscar-winning friend, tucking the receiver to his ear
            with the practiced
                                 ease of a virtuoso shouldering his fiddle.

                                 First, the overture.

                              "Hey, how are you? What's happening?"    he says,
            beginning a gossipy
                              exchange that leads to a throaty guffaw.

                                 Then,   smooth as silk, the main performance.

                              "Anyway, I'm calling you about this ballot
            initiative, " he says, going on to
                              describe Proposition 10, his November ballot measure
            that would raise
                              cigarette taxes to pay for programs for young children.

                                 His voice gains intensity as he explains how the measure
            could "jump start
                              the rest of the country' ,           and his concern that
            tobacco interests will
                              spend millions to stop it.

                                 "Send me some DOUGH, "      he clamors cheerfully. " I f you
            got 10, I'll
                                 take 10. Whatever you got,       I'll take it."

                                 She's got it. He takes it. He hangs up, smiling.

                                Then it's back to business          more fund-raising calls, a
            quick drive to
                                 Santa Monica to shoot a cover photo for a magazine, and,
            finally, a stint


                     on a late-night talk show.

                     Reiner, who was Meathead on "All in the Family"     and
has directed films
                  including "When Harry Met Sally, "     seeks similar
success on the political
                  stage.

                  "This is not a question of his lending his name to
something and moving
                  on, " says Michael Melmed of Zero to Three, a nonprofit
group that
                  focuses on the importance of the early years in
children's lives. "He really
                  is committed.' ,

                   Proposition 10, the California Children and Families
First Initiative, would
                   raise cigarette taxes by 50 cents a pack to generate an
estimated $700
                   million a year. The money would fund services for fami
lies with children
                   under age 5, including prenatal care, stop-smoking
programs and
                   domestic violence prevention.

                     The measure is opposed by the Committee Against Unfair
Taxes, whose
                     sponsors include a number of tobacco companies.

                     "Mr. Reiner's cause may be very worthwhile, but if it's
that worthwhile
                    then all California adults should pay for it, not just
smokers, "   said Tom
                    Lauria of the Tobacco Institute in Washington, D.C.

                  A San Francisco Examiner poll last month found 54
percent support for
                  the measure, with 32 percent clearly opposed. The survey
of 832
                  registered voters had a margin of error of 4 percentage
points.

                  To further his cause in recent years, Reiner has
launched a foundation, the
                  " I Am Your Child Campaign, " directed a Tom
Hanks-hosted TV special
                  and traveled the country to make speaking engagements.

                  Now the 51-year-old father of three is pushing the
ballot initiative via
                  telephone like it's a Hollywood movie pitch, pacing the
length of the phone
                  cord, one hand slicing the air for emphasis.

                  The initiative would be "the largest investment in
young children in the
                  history of the country,"  he says. It has bipartisan
support and passage
                  would "send a very loud message to the rest of the cou


ntry. ' ,

                      Some prospects donated a lot, others not so much, but
the enthusiasm in
                      Reiner's voice didn't waver.

                      The Hollywood veteran is well aware that some take a
jaundiced view of
                  celebrities and social causes, but they "see very
quickly that I'm serious
                  about it. I've spent a lot of time on this."

                  His motivation is the "immutable truth"   -- that
providing young children
                  with healthy, secure attachments can have a dramatic
effect on crime, teen
                  pregnancy, drug abuse and other social ills.

                      "That's what compels me, "     Reiner says. " I know that
this is the way to
                  change social outcomes.' ,
