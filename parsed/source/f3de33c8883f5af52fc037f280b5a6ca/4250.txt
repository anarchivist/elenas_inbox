                    Meeting with Disability Advocates 9110/97 - Summary

ADA: Fred Fay spoke about the importance ofthe ADA, including funding for enforcement.
The President responded that he needs the disability community to help convince Congress that
the funding increases we have sought for DO] and EEOC enforcement are needed. The
President also commented that he should talk more about people with disabilities in public
settings, and that he did so a lot during prior years' budget fights.

Children's SSI: Paul Marchand ofthe Arc said the new standard was too strict; that appeal rates
are only 44%, which is too low; that the cutoffs are unfairly targeted at kids with mental
disorders (85% of the 135,000); that the advocates have good communications with SSA, but
SSA should institute a moratorium on further reviews. He cited an anecdote of a child with an
IQ of 46 being denied. He noted the variation among states, from Mississippi's denial rate of
over 80% to DC's denial rate of under 30%. He noted Arkansas' low rate. He said there is
evidence ofSSA employees "intimidating" families and threatening the loss of wages if they
appeal and lose.

The President responded that he is concerned about the variations among states, and said it raised
the question if the differences reflect "political preferences" among states rather than the severity
of the disabilities .. He said that SSA stated it was legally not possible to do what
Daschle/Chafee/etc. wanted -- i.e., recreate the old law via regulation. He said that he has asked
SSA to report back to him in 30 days about the concerns Marchand was raising. It was pretty
clear that this would focus on the reevaluation process, and not on the standard.

Personal Assistance Services: Gina MacDonald of the National Council of Independent Living
spoke about the need for policy changes to make it possible for people to have personal
assistants, such as a tax credit. Bob Kafka of ADAPT said political leaders always say they
support home and community-based services (HCBS), but that they don't really do so "when the
rubber hits the road," and nursing homes continue to eat up 80% of the dollars. He complained
that last year in our arguments against the Republican Medicaid proposal, we continually referred
to maintaining nursing home protections without referring to the alternative of home and
community-based services. He raised our concern about the "woodwork effect" of CAS A-type
approaches, and said that" where there is the political will, solutions can be found, referring to
child health and tobacco. He said they were seeking our "endorsement of the principles of
CASA."

Mike Oxford of ADAPT said that HCFA has written some good letters to the states on this issue
lately, but that always giving states the option was a problem. He said Kansas is quite
progressive on HCBS, while Missouri is not and has a long waiting list, and therefore people
cross the border to get services. He referred to the "Helen L" Supreme Court case on the "right
to services in the most integrated setting," and said we should use that case to move to a "date
certain" policy administratively, while CASA is being debated. (Not sure of details on Helen L
case; I think it was an ADA case that the Supreme Court chose not to hear.)

The President asked which states are better than others on HCBS. People mentioned Kansas,
                                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion

                                                 2

Colorado, Massachusetts, Illinois, and Pennsylvania, and said they weren't seeking a single
model among the states. The President said he believed in this issue, and that the problem is
that the dollars don't follow the person, since the entitlement is attached to the services rather
than the person. He said that this is not a "human answer" to a person in a nursing home, and
that "I'd be furious" if that answer were given to him ifhe were in that situation, but as President
he has a responsibility to live within the budget and deal with CBO scoring of this issue. He
said the Administration has been pleading with states to take advantage of options, but they have
not responded (by this, 1 believe he meant our efforts to get congressional approval to turn the
HCBS waiver into a state plan amendment). He said he was pleased that the Speaker introduced
CASA so that we could have a dialogue. The President said that if some states are successful in
moving people from nursing homes to the community in a cost-effective manner, we should get
them to- tell us how they make it work from a cost perspective.

Bruce Vladeck noted that the HCFA actuaries are talking to ADAPT to learn about state data on
cost savings; he noted the regulatory review that HCFA has begun to identify where the
institutional biases are; and he said HHS would be seeking sites to test the "date certain" concept,
including ensuring consumer protections, saying HHS would work with ADAPT on this "right
away." Kafka said ADAPT has a credibility problem in convincing people that this can be done,
and noted they need help with NGA in particular. Judy Heumann of the Dept. of Education
noted that costlbenefit analyses need to take account of dollars outside of Medicaid, noting that
someone who can't get a job because they don't have a personal assistant might go on SSVSSDI.
 The President said that if we can show this can be done in a cost effective manner (I think via
demonstrations), then we can convince everyone to do this (states, Congress, etc.). Paul
Marchand ofthe Arc noted that only 2 out of6 New England states still have institutions for the
mentally retarded, and that it would be very useful if we could tout this fact, to show there is no
need for institutions and that this policy can work. The President said this was a good idea.
The President did not mention sending Gingrich a letter or any timetable for the work group. In
the briefing prior to th~ meeting, the President expressed frustration that we didn't have more
progress to show on this issue.

IDEA: Nancy Diehl ofthe Parent Network thanked the President for all he has done on IDEA,
but asked him to show his leadership on the budget issue by making it a priority. The President
said that disabled children will benefit from America Reads and his other education proposals as
much as or more than other children, and noted that funding for IDEA has increased 36% since
he has been President. He silid that prior to last year he had always asked for more IDEA
funding than Congress and that the Republicans are simply trying to put him in a political bind
by underfunding Goals 2000 and America Reads and giving the money to IDEA. He said he
would do "the best 1 can by IDEA," but urged the group not to "let them take advantage of us" on
this issue. Paul Marchand noted that the disability groups are on record with the Hill as saying
they don't want money for IDEA that is taken from other programs, and the President thanked
him for that.
                                                                              Automateo '!\'icords Management System
                                                                                      Hex.Dump ConversIon
                                                       3

     Employment: Tony Coelho noted that people with disabilities have a very low rate of
     unemployment and high dependence on SSIISSDI; and that the cost of these programs puts a
     major burden on the federal budget. He said that 50% of those on SSA's rolls are capable of
     substantial gainful employment (a statistic I have never heard before). Coelho said that all the
     welfare-to-work incentives we are instituting may hurt the employment prospects of people with
     disabilities. Coelho praised the Administration for taking the "small but significant" steps of the
     Medicaid buy-in and the SSA ticket, but said we must "keep it moving" through the executive
     order on this topic that is now under consideration within the Administration. (Prior to the
     meeting, I had asked him not to raise the E.O. since it is still being debated internally; he said the
     community is well aware of the issue, and that he planned to raise it.)

     Paul Edwards of the American Council of the Blind spoke about 4 issues: strengthening Section
     508 of the Rehab Act; his concern that the FCC has not yet taken action on regulations to
     implement the accessibility requirements of the Telecommunications Act, and he can't get an
     explanation on when they will do so or why there is a delay; we must ensure that in the ISTEA
     reauthorization there is increased funding for public transit; and that the federal govermnent must
     do a better job as a model employer of people with disabilities. In that regard, Edwards said that
     the executive order is crucial, and that he had some data that suggested that the employment rate
     of people with disabilities in the federal government may be dropping rather than rising. Coelho
     then said we must all be vigilant in making sure that the ISTEA reauthorization does not include
     any weakening of ADA transportation requirements.

     The President said there will be more money for transportation, but it would not necessarily be
     for mass transit; and so people had to be ready for that fight. He also noted the opportunities
     that technology is opening up for people to work at home. The President also said the corporate
     America should take a look at these issues, and that the issues are so complex that maybe ''we
     need to have your committee," referring, I think, to the executive order. He said that ifthe
     economy is to continue to perfonn so positively we need to involve more those outside the
     mainstream -- the poor and the disabled.

     Bob Williams ofHHS said many people on TANF are disabled, and Susan Daniels ofSSA
     echoes his concern that it would be bad if welfare refonn simply shifted funds from welfare to
     SSI. The President said he had never made the connection before in his mind between our
     TANF welfare to work efforts and putting people with disabilities to work. The Vice President
     said he would follow up aggressively on the infonnation superhighway issue that Edwards raised.

     Conclusion: At the end, Marca Bristo of the National Council on Disability praised the
     President's efforts as being far more than those of his predecessors, and said we "desperately
     need more from your office." The President said it was a great meeting, and that he valued it
     because it is so easy for him to get isolated from issues and people; and that he wanted to work
     with their team and be part of their movement.
