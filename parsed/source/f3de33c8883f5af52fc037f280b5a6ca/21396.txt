Background

A key to the effectiveness of a fann labor program is matching fannworkers to growers in an
effective and efficient manner. Currently, most fannworkers find jobs through use of a
kinship/friendship network. Less than 5% of fannworkers found their job through the
employment service or labor union; 10% found employment through employer recruitment
(including through fann labor contractors). Under the current system, the DOL approves over
90% of grower requests for H-2A workers.

In addition, growers are concerned that workers that they recruit domestically (either through the
DOL employment service or through their own positive recruitment efforts) are not authorized to
work, and thus their employ leaves the grower vulnerable to INS enforcement (and losing their
workers because of a raid).

Discussion

I.     How do we make recruitment more effective (matching U.S. workers to fannworkers)?

       a.      Role of growers

       b.      Role of intennediaries (fann labor contractors)

       c.      Role of government

II.    How do we make verification work?
