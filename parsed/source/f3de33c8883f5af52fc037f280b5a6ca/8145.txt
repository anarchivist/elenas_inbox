TEXT:
For Elena's review, here is a draft Q&A on Shaw's Fatherhood bill for use
by the VP and Kevin Thurm who are both speaking at the National Fatherhood
Summit on Monday (see background below).  I'd like to get a final version
to them by COB today if possible.


Background
Monday is National Fatherhood Initiative's fatherhood summit here at the
Marriott. VP is the keynote speaker at lunch, Judge Ross is chairing one
of the public policy sector meetings in the afternoon, Kevin Thurm is on
the closing panel, and I believe Secretary Riley is also speaking.
Several Governors (Ridge and Carper) and members of Congress also invited.

VP is going to present a Hammer award to the federal interagency forum on
child and family statistics, which formed in response to the 6/95 Exec.
Memorandum which, among other things, directed agencies to incorporate
fathers into research efforts on family and children issues.  He is also
going to strongly emphasize the Administration's history and commitment to
fatherhood issues.

Apparently the producers of a Ford, Casey, and Work/Families Institute
documentary coming out next week on fatherhood failed to include the
Administration -- Bill Bradley is doing the voice over-- so VP's office is
upset and is looking to remind people of our record on this. The VP will
probably highlight a few of the agency initiatives implemented in response
to the Exec Memo. (15 agencies have submitted responses to VP memo asking
them to submit accomplishments, contact person, and new ideas in preparatio
n for the PMC meeting discussion on fatherhood t,hat Kevin chaired last
week.)  I've suggested he also highlight the WTW $ going to non-custodial
parents and have passed along info on both the formula and competitive
grants.  Tom Rosshirt is working on the speech and I'm supposed to see it
on Sunday. At this point, there are, no plans for VP to make any other
announcements.

It's not clear how much play the Republican fatherhood block grant bill
will get.  So far, the bill has been stalled due to concerns among


Republicans, but the summit may generate more momentum and interest.

                       Question and Answer on Fathers Count Act
                                     June 12, 1998

Question:    Does the Administration support HR 3314, the Fathers Count Act of 1998?

Answer:      We certainly support the general goal of encouraging states and communities to
             help fathers become more involved in their children's lives and share the concerns
             about working families, both mothers and fathers. The Administration has
             always placed a high priority on supporting strong and healthy two parent families
             and the role offathers. This track record includes: family friendly policies such
             as the Family and Medical Leave Act, expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit
             and the new Child Tax Credit; initiatives to promote father involvement in child
             health immunization and early education; demonstration projects to promote
             responsible fatherhood; and employment programs for non-custodial parents of
             children on welfare so they can help support their children. We remain ready to
             work with Congress on initiatives that will help hard pressed families meet their
             needs, including child care.

            We would be glad to work with Congress on the specific provisions of the Fathers
            Count Act at an appropriate time. Funding for the initiative would need to be
            considered within the context of other priorities and within the context of the
            balanced budget.

              Background
              The bill was introduced by Clay Shaw on March 3 and now has 7 Republican
              co-sponsors. It would authorize $2 billion over five years for block grants to states
            . for projects to encourage fathers to become better parents. Funding levels grow
              from $200 M in 2000 to $500 M in 2004. The funds would be distributed by HHS
              to states based on their share of total population, and would be targeted to private
              organizations (75 percent) and to fathers below the state or local average income
              of male earners (80 percent). The bill specifically declares religious
              organizations eligible to receive funds under the act.

            Funds could be used to: 1) encourage unmarried or prospective fathers to get
            married, and encourage better parenting both by fathers who are living with their
            children and those who are not and 2) help fathers obtain gainful employment or
            increase their skills in order to qualify for higher paying jobs. The bill also
            specifies that a state who receives a Fathers grant may use Welfare-to-Work and
            Title:XX (Social Services Block Grant) funds for the same purpose. Up to $10
            million annually is earmarked for research and evaluation, with another $10
            million annually earmarked for technical assistance.

            While the bill has not moved to date, it is possible that the National Fatherhood
            summit on June 15th may generate new momentum.
