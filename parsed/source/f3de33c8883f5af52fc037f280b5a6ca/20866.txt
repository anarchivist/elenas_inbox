TEXT:
Today, the Senate passed the "Quality Child Care for Federal Employees
Act" (sponsored by Senators Jeffords, Landrieu, and Dodd) as an amendment
to the Treasury-Postal Appropriations bill. The Gilman-Maloney companion
bill in the House awaits vote under suspension (we hope it is considered
and passed next week) .

Unless you disagree, Jen and I think we should wait to put a Presidential
statement until the bill passes the House.
