TEXT:
  The Doggett Amendment basically seeks to ban export promotion for
tobacco and stop State from fighting prejudical tobacco bans. His
amendment was attached to state/commerce approps. in the House version and
is not in Senate version, Some reports have the issue being taken up in
Conference as early as this week. NSC says that is unlikely.

Substance: This Administration effectively banned export promotion, so
this is not far from where we apparently already are.  Problems: 1. while
we don't promote cigs anymore, USDA seems to help tobacco (and therefore
farmers).  Doggett is not attached to the ago approps. but his amendment
does mention both tobacco and tobaco products. We're talking to USDA
about this late today.  2. Doggett has called evidently asking for
support.  Should the Adminstration position be not to endorse specific
tobacco bills yet?
