MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:                     Bruce Reed
                          Elena Kagan

SUBJECT:                  DPC Weekly Report

        Health Care -- Approval of Wisconsin's BadgerCare Program: On Friday, HHS
approved Wisconsin's BadgerCare program, which is a combined Medicaid waiver and CHIP
plan that expands Medicaid coverage to families with incomes below 185% of the Federal
poverty level. This approval represents closure to a long-standing impasse between HCFA
and Governor Thompson. Wisconsin originally proposed to use their CHIP allotment (and its
higher Federal matching dollars) to cover both children and adults. Such an approach is
inconsistent with the law that restricts CHIP funding to be used only for children (with limited
exceptions) and was vigorously opposed by Congressional Democrats and advocates. The
part of the compromise that was attractive to the Governor was the provision that allows the
State to roll back coverage if it no longer has the financial resources to maintain the coverage
expansion. He agreed to a Medicaid waiver rather than a CHIP waiver because he wanted his
high priority BadgerCare program approved before his State of the State address next week.
This action will likely be well received by Congressmen Barrett and Kletchka, who defended
our opposition to the State's initial proposal but pushed us aggressively to find an acceptable
conclusion. Wisconsin's program, when fully implemented, will provide health insurance
coverage to over 23,000 children and 27,000 adults.

        Health Care -- Dingle Meeting on Medicare and Patients Bill of Rights: At a
Thursday meeting, Mr. Dingle pleaded with us to provide him with a clearer sense of where
we wanted the Medicare Commission to go and to expedite our analysis of the Breaux
Medicare reform concept. We gave him our commitment to do so. In the meantime, we are
in the process of obtaining final estimates from the Medicare actuary and will keep you
appraised of new analysis and developments on this issue. Mr. Dingle also indicated his
desire to work closely with us in developing a strategy to pass a strong Patients Bill of Rights
through the House. Earlier in the week, Congressman Ganske refused to cosponsor Mr.
Dingle's reintroduced bill because he wanted to work out an alternative in the liability /
enforcement section first. This provision of the bill, now even more vulnerable in the face of
a rare $116 million judgement against Aetna Health Plans of California, has appeared to
unsettle some of the Blue Dog Democrats and Republicans who initially cosponsored the
Dingle-Ganske bill. We are reviewing compromises now on liability and enforcement that
will keep our base of supporters for the original legislation while hopefully attracting a few
                                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion.

more Republicans. As we do this, we will be closely consulting with Senator Daschle,
Senator Kennedy, Senator Chafee and others.

           Tobacco -- Tobacco Farmers: The four largest cigarette companies agreed
 Thursday to set up a $5.15 billion trust fund to help tobacco growers who face a shrinking
  market due to the state settlements that raised the price of smoking and is expected to reduce
 demand. The companies had agreed to meet with state officials to discuss the trust fund for
  farmers as part of the $206 billion state settlement last November. There are many details
  still to be worked out, but it was announced the funds would be distributed over 12 years.
  During the fund's first year, the companies would put in $380 million, (Philip Morris has
  already contributed $300 million, the bulk of the payment). The second year, the companies
  would deposit $280 million; the third year, $400 million; years four-lO, $500 million a year;
  the 11th year, $440 million; and the 12th year, $150 million. Gov. Hunt, who helped
  spearhead the effort, said each state will receive a share of the fund equal to the amount of
  tobacco it grows. The eleven participating states are North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina,
  Tennessee, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Virginia and West Virginia.
  News stories quoted Governor Hunt as stating: "We all leave here today winners with a
  positive outlook for a measure of financial assistance for our tobacco farmers." Bruce Reed
. spoke with the Washington Post congratulating Governor Hunt and other state leaders for this
  positive step and reaffirming the Administration's commitment to protecting tobacco farmers
  and their communities. USDA will issue a similar statement. We have also spoken with
. leaders of some of the leading tobacco farmer organizations to explain recent Administration
  proposals and our continued commitment. The farm groups have expressed concern that a
  federal suit and new federal tax will further decrease demand for tobacco, but privately
  acknowledge that the threat of further federal action has thus far probably aided their efforts
  in negotiating the $5 billion trust find.

        Tobacco -- Lawsuit Announcement Reaction: Your announcement that the
 Department of Justice is preparing a plan to take the tobacco companies to court was a
 welcome surprise to our allies. Key member of Congress (Sens. Durbin and Kennedy) and
 public advocates (Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids) vigorously defended the basis and policy
 for such a suit. The announcement seemed to have caught the industry off guard. A joint
 statement by the big three cigarette producers called the plan a "political gesture" the
 continuation of "a witch hunt against a legal industry." Tobacco stocks fell sharply on
 Wednesday and the stock prices of both Philip Morris Inc. and R.I. Reynolds Tobacco Co.
 were down again on Thursday.

         Education -- Legislation Introduced in Senate: This week Senate Democrats
 introduced the Public Schools Excellence Act (S.7), which includes our school
 modernization and class size reduction proposals and an after school initiative which
 incorporates both the 21st Century Learning Program and funds for community-based
 after-school programs through the Child Care and Development Block Grant. The bill
 also includes a Teacher Excellence Act which closely tracks one we have been developing
 as well as relevant aspects of your accountability proposals. The bill would provide
 $1.2 billion to states and local school districts to help raise teacher certification
                                                         Hex-Dump Conversion

                                                                                               3

standards, recruit excellent teacher candidates, retain and support promising beginning
teachers and provide veteran teachers and principals with ongoing professional
development needed to help all children meet high standards. Under this teacher
quality proposal, states and school districts would be accountable for reducing the
number of teachers with emergency credential and out-of-field placement of teachers.

        Senate Republicans also introduced a bill to extend ESEA this week. However,
the bill contains only a statement of themes and principals -- returning control to
parents, supporting exceptional teachers, making schools safe, directing federal dollars
to the classroom, and stressing basic skills and proven practices -- that will eventually be
translated into specific legislative proposals.

        Education -- Ed-Flex: Chairmen Goodling and Jeffords, with strong support
from the Speaker, the Senate Majority Leader and NGA, are planning to mark up
Ed-Flex legislation (which would extend the authority to waive many federal education
requirements to all 50 states, in exchange for a system of standards, school report cards,
and state intervention in low performing schools). as early as next week, with the
intention of moving it on a fast track, separate from the ESEA reauthorization.
Goodling in particular has indicated a desire to work with us to fashion a bipartisan bill,
ostensibly in order to set a bipartisan context for work on ESEA, though we suspect also
to create some tension between us and committee Democrats who last year showed little
interest in this proposal. While we would prefer to take up any Ed-Flex proposal in the
context of ESEA, we believe our support for this proposal last year will make it difficult
for us to oppose speedy action on it now. As we consult with Kennedy, Clay and others
on the hill, our overall strategy will be to (1) emphasize our support for the principles of
more accountability and more flexibility (2) stress our preference to take Ed-Flex up as
part of ESEA reauthorization (3) insist that any Ed-Flex provision that moves in
advance of ESEA be revisited during the reauthorization process, and be drafted so as
to not permit states to waive the new accountability provisions announced in your State
of the Union address.

        Education -- Reaction to your accountability proposals: Overall initial reaction
to your education proposals has generally been positive within the education community
and in the press. The education community is supportive of your proposals,
understands clearly the need to meet the challenges of raising standards, turning around
failing schools, ending social promotions and the use of unqualified teachers. At the
same time, many are worried about their capacity to meet these challenges, and will be
looking to the Administration's budget and ESEA reauthorization proposals for
financial, programmatic and technical support to carry out the needed reforms. Your
proposals have also generated considerable press attention, with several stories this
week in the New York Times, Washington Post, and USA Today. These stories have
focused on the content of your proposals -- particularly on the pro's and con's of ending
social promotion -- and on the threat that states and school systems could lose funding if
                                                            Hex-Dump Conversion

                                                                                                 4

they fail to implement them. There have been a number of favorable editorials,
including one by Diane Ravitch in the Wall Street Journal, NYU education professor
John Zimmerman in the New York Times, and Timothy Noah in Slate magazine.
Criticisms of your proposal have come from David Broder, who charges that your
proposals merely replicate and add a layer of federal bureaucracy to what the states are
already doing, and Lamar Alexander, Checker Finn are quoted in a number of stories
criticizing your proposal as a federal takeover of state and local education systems.
        Welfare Reform -- Welfare-to-Work Event Next Week: Monday's welfare to
work event will give you the opportunity to celebrate the success of welfare reform and
underscore the need for the new welfare-to-work initiatives in your budget. With
welfare caseloads down by nearly half and over 10,000 companies committed to
welfare-to-work, you will announce a new package of initiatives designed to ensure that
those remaining on the welfare rolls make a successful transition from welfare to work,
with a new focus on increasing the employment of low-income fathers so they can
support their children. Your $1 billion Welfare-to-Work initiative will provide a
minimum of $150 million to ensure every state helps fathers fulfill their responsibilities
to their children by working and paying child support. Remaining funds will focus on
those long term welfare recipients with the greatest challenges to employment such as
limited English proficiency, substance abuse problems, and disabilities. You will also
announce that your budget will contain new welfare to work housing vouchers,
transportation funds, and tax credits to help those on welfare get to work and stay
employed. Taken together, these initiatives will provide parents the tools they need to
support their children and succeed in the workforce. Besides highlighting these
initiatives, the event will provide you with the opportunity to recognize the 10,000
businesses of all sizes, industries and regions who have joined the Welfare to Work
Partnership and are learning every day that hiring from the welfare rolls is good
business. Since May, the number of companies in the Partnership has doubled from
5,000 to 10,000.

        Welfare -- Legal Immigrant Benefits: On Monday while in California the Vice
President is going to announce the Administration's new budget proposal which restores
$1.3 billion in health, disability and nutritional assistance programs for legal
immigrants. This proposal builds on this progress we've already made because of your
leadership: the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 restored disability and health benefits to
420,000 legal immigrants who were in this country before welfare reform became law, at
an estimated cost of $11.5 billion, and the Agricultural Research Act of 1998 provided
Food Stamps for 225,000 legal immigrant children, senior citizens, and people with
disabilities who came to the United States by August 22, 1996. The new budget
proposal will 1) restore eligibility for SSI and Medicaid to legal immigrants who enter
the U.S. after the enactment of welfare reform on August 22, 1996, become disabled, and
have been in the U.S. for five years (this costs approximately $930 million and will assist
an estimated 54,000 legal immigrants by 2004, about half of whom will be elderly); 2)
builds on the progress made in the Agricultural Research Act by allowing legal
                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion


                                                                                                   5

immigrants in the United States on August 22,1996 who subsequently reach age 65 to be
eligible for Food Stamps, at cost of $60 million; and 3) provides states the option to
provide health coverage through CHIP or Medicaid to legal immigrant children and
pregnant legal immigrant women who entered the U.S. after August 22, 1996 (costing
$325 million and serving approximately 78,000 women and children).

         Civil Rights -- English Language/Civics Initiative: On Monday January 25th,
while in Los Angeles, the Vice President will announce the English Language/Civics initiative
that is part of your FY 2000 budget. This $70 million initiative is designed to help states and
communities provide expanded access to high quality English language proficiency
instruction, linked to practical instruction in civics and life skills including how to navigate
the workplace, public education system, and other essentials. This initiative will both help
meet the extraordinary demand for English and civics instruction in immigrant communities
and will demonstrate our shared commitment to fully integrating new Americans into our
social and civic life. States, community-based organizations, local education agencies, and
other non-profits will compete for grants to support English proficiency and civics instruction.
 With $70 million, the initiative will be able to provide English language and civics
instruction to approximately 150,000 people in FY 2000.

        Drugs -- Republican Legislation: On Tuesday, Senate Republicans introduced an
omnibus drug bill, the Drug Free Century Act. The bill's major titles cover international
supply reduction, domestic law enforcement and domestic demand reduction. We are
working with the agencies to review the specifics of the proposed bill. Among the bill's key
provisions:

       International Supplv Reduction:       Strengthens punishment for violent crimes
       committed along the border; establishes penalties for exporting contraband; provides
       for extradition in certain instances without a treaty; and expands penalties for and
       reports requirements to deter money laundering.

       Domestic Law Enforcement: Doubles the number of border patrol agents to 15,000
       by FY 2004; increases mandatory penalties for powder cocaine sentencing (from 5
       kilograms to 500 grams for a 1O-year sentence, and from 500 grams to 50 grams for a
       5-year sentence); and enhances penalties for certain drug offenses committed in the
       presence of children.

       Domestic Demand Reduction:         Prohibits federal funding of needle exchange
       programs; authorizes a $10 million drug-free teen drivers incentive grant program; and
       establishes new $5 million DEA drug-free families grant program.

       Funding for Counter-Drug Enforcement Agencies: Increases funding and establishes
       earmarks for specific Customs, Coast Guard, DEA, Treasury and Defense
       countemarcotic operations.
                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion
                                                                                                   6


The bill contains many provisions which were introduced by Congressional Republicans last
year. We also expect Senate Republicans to submit omnibus crime legislation in the coming
week.

        Crime -- Gun Shows: In response to your 11/6/98 directive, the Treasury and Justice
Departments are ready to submit a joint report to you with their recommendations on gun
shows. The report indicates that there were over 4,400 gun shows advertised in 1998, most
of which were promoted by about 175 firearm collector organizations and individuals. While
federally-licensed firearms dealers (FFLs) comprise 50 to 75 percent of the vendors at most
gun shows -- and are required by the Brady Act to conduct background checks on prospective
purchasers -- non-FFL vendors are under no legal obligation to conduct a background check or
keep records on their sales, making it impossible for law enforcement to trace firearms they
sell which are later recovered at crime scenes.
        The report confirms that gun shows provide a forum for illegal firearms sales and
trafficking, and serve as a source for firearms used in crimes. In compiling the report,
Treasury and Justice reviewed 314 gun show-related investigations involving more than
54,000 firearms. The investigations span a wide range of federal firearms violations,
including straw purchases, transactions by FFLs without Brady checks, and the sale of kits to
modify semiautomatic firearms into automatic firearms.            Over 46 percent of the
investigations involving gun shows involved felons buying or selling firearms. In more than
a third of the investigations, the firearms involved were known to have been used in
subsequent crimes, including homicide, assault, robbery, and drug offenses. Many of the
investigations involve numerous firearms: more than a third involved over 50 firearms and
about one-tenth involved over 250 firearms.

       In order to close the gun show "loophole", Secretary Rubin and Attorney General
Reno's key recommendations include:

       (1) Broadly defining "gun shows", to cover not only traditional gun shows but also
       flea markets and other similar venues where firearms are sold.

       (2) Requiring gun show promoters to register with ATF. Promoters would be
       required to provide the time and location of every gun show, a list of vendors (both
       FFLs and non-FFLs), ensure that all vendors are given information about their legal
       obligations, and require vendors to acknowledge receipt of it. Failure to fulfill these
       obligations could result in revocation or suspension of registration or civil or criminal
       penalties.

       (3) Requiring Brady background checks on all firearms transferred at gun
       shows. All firearms would be transferred by, or with the assistance of an FFL. Thus,
       FFLs would conduct a Brady checks and retain records for all sales by a non-FFL.
                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion

                                                                                                 7

       (4) Reporting information to the ATF's National Tracing Center (NTC) on
       firearms sold at gun shows. This would require FFLs to submit certain information
       (~, manufacturer, serial number) on all firearms transferred at gun shows to ATF's
       NTC and retain such information to assist in future firearms trace requests by law
       enforcement.

       (5) Developing an educational campaign, in conjunction with the firearms industry,
       to encourage all firearms owners to take steps to ensure that firearms do not fall into
       the hands of prohibited persons such as criminals or juveniles. '

In addition, the Departments are continuing to review the definition of "engaged in the
business" of selling firearms to make future legislative and regulatory recommendations. The
Gun Control Act requires that those who seek to "engage in the business" of importing,
manufacturing, or dealing in firearms must obtain a Federal firearms license. Engaging in the
business without a license was involved in more than half of the 314 investigations reviewed
by Treasury and Justice.
        The report also recommends committing more resources to combat illegal firearms
sales at gun shows. Your FY 2000 budget includes $24 million in new funds for firearms
enforcement, a portion of which Treasury/ATF will use to bolster their enforcement efforts at
gun shows.
