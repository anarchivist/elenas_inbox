     Republicans Sign Non-Discrimination Policies On Capitol Hill Covering Gays
     And Lesbians

     Conservatives, Freshmen Join in Prohibiting Anti-Gay Discrimination in Hill
     Offices

     (WASHINGTON) Several GOP Members of Congress have confirmed to Log Cabin
     Republicans that, as a matter of policy, they do not permit discrimination
     on the basis of sexual orientation in the hiring, firing or promoting of
     personnel in their Hill offices.

     As one of its top priorities in the 105th Congress, LCR requested written
     clarification of the non-discrimination policies in each Republican
     Member's office, specifically addressing sexual orientation.  Responses to
     LCR's March 3 request have begun arriving at LCR's Washington office,
     including from some Republicans who had not publicly clarified their
     policies in previous years.

     Rep. Mark Neumann (R-WI) was one of several new confirmations received by
     Log Cabin Republicans, including Rep. Charlie Bass (R-NH) , Rep. Joe
     Knollenberg (R-MI), Senator Mike DeWine (R-OH), and newly-elected Senator
     Gordon Smith (R-OR) and Rep. Jim Gibbons (R-NV). All were declaring for
     the first time that the sexual orientation of an individual is not a
     consideration in the hiring, firing or promoting of employees in their
     offices.

     AS of today, a total of 24 GOP Senators and 69 GOP House Members have
     certified in writing that they do not discriminate against gays and
     lesbians in their offices.



"We are finding more doors opening on this issue than ever before," said
Richard Tafel, executive director of Log Cabin Republicans.  "We will
continue to seek meetings with every Republican office on this matter until
we have a full picture of where the Members stand."

Log Cabin Republicans is the nation's largest gay and lesbian Republican
organization, with 50+ chapters nationwide and over 11,000 members.
