 the partnership.  I sent the attached to Michael in the interim.  Since

 Subject: Mentioning welfare to work in the Business Roundtable Speech

 We hear from Eli Segal that 3 of the 6 board members of the Welfare to
 Work Partnership will be in the audience tomorrow.  Bruce thinks it would
 be ungracious not to acknowledge the individuals by name in the remarks.
 We are trying to confirm their names and should have them soon, although
 it's possible it won't be till the a.m.

 Subject: Mentioning welfare to work in the Business Roundtable Speech

 You and Diana spoke yesterday about mentioning welfare to work as well as
 the Summit in the Business Roundtable speech. We think that's a good
 idea. Not knowing the context, how about:




    "r am pleased so many companies here today are accepting the challenge to
    help end welfare as we know it and replace it with a system that offers
    hope, demands responsibility, and rewards work. Already, over 100
    companies -- including many of you represented today -- have accepted the
    welfare to work challenge.  r urge the rest of you to do the same."


    [11 of the 105 companies who had joined the Welfare to Work Partnership
    and committed to hire welfare recipients at our May 20th event with the
    President are members of the Business Roundtable.  They are Ameritech,
    Arco, Harrah's Entertainment, Marriott, Monsanto, Sprint, Time Warner, The
    Travellers Group, UAL Corporation, United Parcel Service, and Xerox.)
