TEXT:
You may be totally in the loop on this, but just in case, since there's an
Erskine meeting on this tomorrow:

Cabinet Affairs told me about an Ann Lewis meeting on race today where 2
scenarios for the first town hall were discussed, one on youth and one on
youth and service. There was a one-pager on each scenario which I'll fax
to you. The service write-up isn't as strong as it could be.   I will work
on how to strengthen it.
