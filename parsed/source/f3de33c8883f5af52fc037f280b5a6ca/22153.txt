    TEXT:
    I'm still waiting to hear back from Justice folks to see if they have any
    additional information on the shooting so I've kept it pretty general.
    According to wire stories, there were two students shot -- one was slain
    and the other is seriously wounded.   Since its been reported that this
    appears to be a murder-suicide or double suicide between a boyfriend and
    girlfriend, the shooting could be of a very different nature than the
    Jonesboro and Paducah incidents.  I've spoken with Jose', and while he is
    fine with the text, he isn't too sure that we should necessarily draw more
    attention to this incident.

    Let me know if you're planning to go forward with the statement.

    Thanks,
    Leanne

                           STATEMENT BY THE PRESIDENT


I was saddened to hear of the tragic shooting involving two high school students this
morning in Carrollton, Georgia. My Department of Education has reached out to the
State of Georgia to offer its assistance to the community regarding this traumatic incident.
While many of the facts surrounding this tragedy are still unanswered, we must redouble
our efforts to ensure that our children are safe from violence, and that guns remain out of
our schools and out of the hands of young people. Hillary and I extend our thoughts and
prayers to the parents and the entire community of Carrollton during this difficult time.
