 TEXT:
 Attached are the options that Elgie and I came up with.  I recommend the
 following process (on which we would seek NEC and CEQ agreement) :
 1. White House discussion of options. The purpose of these discussions
 would be to agree to which are worth putting on the table. One important
 goal of this process would be to identify which (if any) options would
 address OIRA's concerns. Tues/Weds.
 2. Jointly-called (DPC,NEC,CEQ) Deputies meeting to attempt to resolve
 remaining issues.   Friday
 3. Draft memo to President. Monday
 4. Jointly-called Principals meeting to seek resolution or narrow views
 and arguments that will be in a memo. Tues/Weds.
 5.   Send memo to President.

 Subject: Kids EO

 We have agreed to defer announcement of the EO beyond Wednesday in hopes
 of expeditiously resolving outstanding agency disagreements.  The
 interagency meeting to contiune wordsmithing will still take place this
 afternoon at 4pm in room 248, as scheduled, but we anticipate the need for
 additional meetings in the near future to address remaining differences,
 especially those regarding Section 5.  In the meantime, attached are some
 options we can begin to think about within the White House as alternative
 approaces to that section.

                                         Section 5 Alternatives


    1.     Re-write S(b) as follows: "An assessment of potentially effective and reasonably
           feasible alternatives to the covered regulatory action that have been identified by the
           agency or the public. This assessment shall include the relative effectiveness of the
           alternatives in reducing or mitigating risks to children; and"

    Explanation: This option provides agencies with flexibility to explain the spectrum of choices
    they considered instead of highlighting only those options that are more protective of children.
    This spectrum will provide more context to any public debate about the appropriateness of the
    agency's choice. At the same time, this option preserves the goal of openness on the record
    about how agency rulemakings protect children.

    2.     Delete S(c).

    Explanation: This would reduce, but probably not eliminate, the obligation agencies would have
    to explain why their proposed regulatory approach is preferable to an alternative more protective
    of children.

    3.     Delete S(c) and, in S(b), delete the opportunity for members of the public to identify
           reasonably feasible alternatives.

    Explanation: In addition to reducing the burden of explaining why a potentially more protective
    alternative was not adopted, this option would enhance agency discretion by eliminating the
    requirement that they assess alternatives proposed by members of the public.

    4.     Delete section S entirely.
