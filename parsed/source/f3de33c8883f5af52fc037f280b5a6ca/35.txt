TEXT:
A bit more fine-tuning of the item veto language.   In the attached
WP file, I've added two pieces of clarifying language:    (1) the
first clarifies that the amount by which the PAYGO balances are to
be adjusted for canceled direct spending or tax benefits is "the
amount by which cancelled provisions would have INCREASED SPENDING
OR REDUCED REVENUES"-- previously it had said the amt. by which
the deficit increased, which is unclear;   (2) I've added a phrase
to the new section on emergency reserve accounts, as follows:
"provided that this paragraph shall not be deemed to impose an
offset requirement for such emergency legislation" to clarify that
we do not intend to change the current law requirements.    If you
have any comments or concerns, please get back to me by 3pm.    I
plan to take the language to the Hill this afternoon.   Thanks.

I.  DEFINITION OF "CANCEL":   The House offer recommends use of
the word "veto" in applying the new authority to direct spending
and tax benefits. However, the Department of Justice has
indicated constitutional problems inherent in authorizing a
President to "veto" pieces of a bill, following signature of the
,                                                                          Page 3 of4


overall bilL
While use of the word "suspend" is the preferred way of avoiding
a constitutional defect, "cancel" may be another option if it is
appropriately defined.   Following is a definition for use of the
word "cancel" with reference to new direct spending and targeted
tax benefits:
         NEW LANGUAGE TO BE ADDED TO SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS.
 (7) The term "cancel" means--
     (A) with respect to "new direct spending," withholding
the authority to obligate the United States pertaining
thereto, and suspension of legal entitlement to claim any
benefits or payments deriving therefrom; and
     (B) with respect to "targeted tax benefits," the
suspension of legal entitlement to claim any Federal tax
deduction, credit, exclusion, preference or other tax
benefit deriving therefrom.


II.  LOCKBOX:
The lockbox language, in the Senate bill and included in the
House offer, would require the President to: reduce the statutory
discretionary spending caps to reflect rescissions of
discretionary budget authority; and to eliminate from the PAYGO
scorecard any positive balance that would otherwise have accrued
from applying the item veto to new direct spending or tax
benefits.
This is problematic, especially on the discretionary side,
because the automatic lowering of spending caps, would make it
more difficult to accommodate supplementals later in the year.
In addition, the technical drafting of the lockbox language is
unclear.
Suggested improvement in the lockbox mechanism:  Provide that the
rescinded or canceled amounts be placed in an "emergency reserve"
to be available to offset emergency supplementals and other
emergency legislation. Although such "emergency legislation"
does not legally require offsets, the availability of these
emergency reserves might facilitate supplementals and other
emergency legislation when 'needed.

In addition, the following amendments would:    (1) clarify the
amount by which spending caps are to be reduced; and (2) would
delete the application of the discretionary lockbox to the
out years (application of lockbox to the out years would create
complications by changing previously negotiated caps before an
appropriations cycle has even begun) .

FOLLOWING IS THE CURRENT LOCK
o
-BOX LANGUAGE WITH PROPOSED CHANGES:

PRINTER FONT 10 - POINT- COURIER
          (1) IN GENERAL.-
o
-Not later than 45 days of continuous session
after the 'President rescinds an item in an appropriations Act or vetoes
cancels an item in an authorization, revenue, or reconciliation Act, the
President shall--
        (A) with respect to appropriations Acts, reduce the
    discretionary spending limits under section 601 of the
    Congressional Budget Act of 1974 for the budget year' and each


    out year by the amount by which the Act would have increased
    the deficit in each respective year the President reduced budget
authority and outlays pursuant to authority provided under this Act;
and
         (B) with respect to a veto cancellation of direct spending or of
a targeted tax benefit, reduce the balances for the budget year and
each out year under section 252(b) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency
Deficit Control Act of 1985 by the amount by which the Act cancelled
provisions would have increased the deficit spending or reduced
revenues in each respective year.
     (2) EXCEPTIONS.--
         (A) This subsection shall not apply if the rescinded item in an
appropriation Act or the vetoed cancelled item in an authorization,
revenue, or reconciliation Act becomes law, over the objections of the
President effective due to enactment of a disapproval bill, before the
President orders the reduction required by paragraph (1) (A) or (1) (B) .
         (B) If the rescinded item in an appropriation Act or the vetoed
cancelled item in an authorization, revenue, or reconciliation Act
becomes law over the objections of the President effective due to
enactment of a disapproval bill, after the President has ordered the
reductions required by paragraph (1) (A) or (1) (B), then the President
shall restore the discretionary spending limits under section 601 of
the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 or the balances under section
252(b) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of
1985 to reflect the limits and balances existing before the reduction
ordered by the President in compliance with paragraph (1).

     (3) EMERGENCY RESERVE ACCOUNTS.
            (A) Any amount by which the discretionary budget authority and
outlay limits described in paragraph (1) (A) are reduced shall be
credited to a special account to be called "the Section 251 emergency
reserve account," provided that such amounts may be used as provided
in paragraph (C).
            (B) Any amount by which the balances for the budget year and
each       out year under section 252(b) of the Balanced Budget and
Emergency           Deficit Control Act of 1985 have been reduced shall be
credited to a        special account to be called "the Section 252
emergency reserve             account," provided that such amounts may be
used as provided in             paragraph (C).
         (C) When making emergency designations under sections 251 or 252
of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985,

the       President and the Congress shall specify whether the requested
   emergency legislation is to be offset by amounts credited to a
reserve      account established under this paragraph, provided that this
paragraph      shall not be deemed to impose an offset requirement for
such emergency      legislation.
