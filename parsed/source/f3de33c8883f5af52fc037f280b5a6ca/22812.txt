         PRESIDENT CLINTON: EDUCATION INVESTMENTS THAT WORK

                                      February 22, 1999

Today, in an address to the National Governors Association, President Clinton will
reiterate his call for a new era of accountability in American education, and will ask
Congress to pass his agenda to give states the tools they need to provide all children with a
world-class education.

Building on What Works to Strengthen Accountability. In his State of the Union address,
President Clinton announced a package of accountability measures designed to hold
students, teachers, and schools to the high standards that will be the keys to success in the
twenty-first century.     In his remarks to the nation's governors at the White House,
President Clinton will discuss his plan to support state and local school reform efforts
through bold new steps to insure that federal support for education is directed only toward
programs and policies that work to improve student achievement. The President will
shortly send to Congress his Education Accountability Act,which will require states and
school districts that receive federal funds to end social promotion, to insure that all teachers
are qualified; to turn around their lowest-performing schools; to provide parents with
annual report cards on school performance and to institute effective school discipline
policies.

National Leadership in Support of State Reform. President Clinton will also applaud the
efforts that North Carolina, Michigan, Delaware, Pennsylvania, California and other states
are making, under the leadership of committed governors, to implement these
common-sense principles. The President will call on all states to take similar steps to
ensure that all of America's children reap the rewards of strengthened accountability.
While states and school districts have made important progress in instituting rigorous
academic standards, a great deal of work remains to be done to help schools, teachers and
students meet those standards. Only 26 states now require students to pass high school
graduation exams, and far fewer have policies in place to require students to show that
they have mastered the skills necessary to be promoted from grade to grade. Just 19 states
have policies to intervene in low-performing schools and turn them around. And there
are some 50,000 people teaching in America's schools on emergency teaching licenses -
which means that they have not met the standards set by states for beginning teachers.

Investments To Support World-Class Education. The President's effort to support high
academic standards for all children includes an unprecedented commitment of national
resources to help states and local districts improve education. President Clinton's balanced
budget calls for strengthened investments in education to hire 100,000 teachers to reduce
class size in the early grades, modernize up to 6,000 schools, triple funding for
after-school activities, improve the quality of teaching, increase literacy: enhance the use of

    technology in the schools, recruit outstanding teachers in underserved high-poverty rural
    areas and inner cities, and provide new pathways to college for disadvantaged students.

Q&A for NGA Address:

Q.   If states are already implementing accountability measures, why is the
     Administration proposing to make them federal policy?

A.   States and school districts have made great progress in raising academic standards,
     but they are not all taking the steps necessary to ensure that schools, teachers, and
     students meet these high standards. For example, only 26 states require students to
     pass high school graduation exams, and far fewer have policies preventing unprepared
     students from being promoted. Only nineteen states have policies in place to intervene
     in low performing schools, and take responsibility for turning them around. And every
     year, approximately 50,000 individuals teach on "emergency" certificates, which means
     that they do not meet the standards states themselves have set for beginning teachers.

     We need to do better than this. We need to take the education reforms that some
     states and cities have shown produce results --ending social promotion, turning
     around failing schools, phasing out the use of unqualified teachers --and to spread
     those reforms throughout the nation. The President's proposal is designed to
     ensure that all our children benefit from these proven and effective accountability
     measures.


Q.   Will states that decline to adopt these policies lose their share of federal education
     funds?

A.    We fully expect that states will adopt these accountability mechanisms, just as they
     have complied with current law's requirements to adopt academic standards and
     measure student performance. Governors of both parties, state and local school
     superintendents, and other educators know that these reforms work, and many are
     implementing them already. So we do not expect to fac~ compliance problems.
     But if we do, we will take steps to ensure compliance and, in the very last resort, we
     will withhold some or all federal money. We cannot continue to invest in failing
     educational systems. That would be cheating American taxpayers --and cheating
     our children.

Q.    Doesn't this amount to a federal takeover of education?

A.   No. The President believes, as he did when he was a governor, that states and localities
     have primary responsibility for.education and must have the flexibility to decide what to
     teach and how to teach it. But the President also believes that we should hold schools
     accountable for results. For our children's sake, we should invest in what works and not
     in what doesn't. We should put into place the accountability measures that study after
     study shows produce results and increase student achievement. A growing number of
     states, cities, and schools are implementing these reforms. They are, almost without
     exception, the places making the biggest student achievement gains. The President
                             Hex-Dump Conversion

     wants to ensure that all our children reap the rewards of these accountability measures.

Q.   Won't that the requirement to end social promotion will lead to an increase in
     retention rates, especially for minority youngsters?

A.   The President believes that when a "no social promotion" policy is done right, it
     helps all students --particularly minority and disadvantaged students. We have to
     insist on high standards and we have to give students the assistance they need to
     meet these standards --including reduced class size, more training for teachers, and
     extended learning time. The President's FY 2000 budget will help significantly, in
     particular by tripling funding --from $200 to $600 million --for after-school and
     summer-school programs that provide extra help to students who need it.

Q:   What kind of accountability provisions is the President demanding be included in
     an Ed-Flex proposal?

A:   The President believes that we should know whether a waiver is improving student
     performance and make sure we turnaround or drop waivers that are failing to do
     so. He is open to a variety of specific proposals, but Ed-Flex ought to contain a
     mechanism that links waivers to student performance.

Q:   Will the administration support amendments to Ed-Flex that raise unrelated issues,
     such as school construction or class size reduction?

A:   We will support amendments of this kind if members of Congress choose to raise
     them. Ed-Flex is important, but modernizing our schools and reducing class size is
     even more so. If we are having an education debate prior to reauthorizing the
     ESEA, we ought to include these important issues.
