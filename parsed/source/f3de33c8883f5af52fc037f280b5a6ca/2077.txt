1.   FYI. Chafee has a drunk driving car/forfeiture prov~s~on in his NEXTEA
bill so we may have already come out in favor of this, I'm checking it
out.   If not, we may actually be getting this passed right now .... Also,
MADD likes the idea but they want us to know .08 is their priority.

2.    The Times editorialized for the gun running bill today.

3.    I'm upbeat on school takeovers, it seems like there is something
good there ...

Tom
