TEXT:
After reviewing the list of those who were considered, but not invited to
the conference, and speaking with some community folks, we have decided
that a "spillover" room or "watch event" in 450 would not be appropriate


Those who did not get invited to attend the conference are still leaders
in this community Many of them are not "leading experts, " but are the
ones working hands-on in this field with everyday people in their
community. We do not want to give the impression to any of these
folks--be they scientists, activists, program directors or businesses that
they are "second class".

Additionally, many more than expected are not from the Washington area are
it would not be effective to ask them to spend the time and cost to watch
what will already be on C-Span.  It
would probably even be awkward to ask the folks from the area to come in
for 3-4 hours to watch.
Any comments?
