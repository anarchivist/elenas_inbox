TEXT:
This is still a draft, since I need to run it by the Corporation among
others, so I'm not sure it's ready for a close edit.  But I figured you'd
want to see it to see if I'm on the right track.  I still haven't seen a
draft of the radio address. We hope to finish everything by early
afternoon on Wednesday.  The address is being taped at Camp David on
Friday.  I will be in New York, but will have a skypager with me.

                  President Proposes Plan to Reauthorize AmeriCorps and
                 Announces Grants for Service on Martin Luther King Day

President Releases Proposal to Reauthorize AmeriCorps
Today in his weekly radio address, President Clinton proposed legislation to improve and extend
the AmeriCorps program into the next century. The legislation would also reauthorize the other
national service programs run by the Corporation for National Service -- Learn and Serve
America and the National Senior Service Corps.

The proposal announced by the President would extend these programs for the next five years,
building on national service's successful track record and allowing millions more Americans to
serve. It will give states and local communities more flexibility to administer service programs
and strengthen partnerships with traditional volunteer organizations. The President urged
Congress to make passage of this legislation a priority next year.

The President came into office with a vision of a national service program that would offer young
people the opportunity to serve our nation in exchange for scholarship help. Today, that
program -- AmeriCorps -- is a reality, and a success. Since 1993, AmeriCorps has provided
educational opportunities for 70,000 people, providing a scholarship of $4,725 in exchange for a
year of service. Thousands of communities across America have learned that national service
helps them meet vital needs in education, public safety, health and human services, and the
environment. AmeriCorps also increases the reach of volunteers, since each AmeriCorps
member recruits and trains an average of 12 unpaid volunteers.

In addition to AmeriCorps, national service programs include young people and our seniors.
"Learn and Serve America" engages a million students of all ages in service-learning each year.
Young people participate in community service and reflect on that experience in school through
grants to states for service-learning. The National Senior Service Corps taps the experience of
more than half a million older Americans to help solve community problems through programs
like Foster Grandparents.

Grants to Communities for Day of Service on Martin Luther King Day
The President also announced that this week the Corporation for National Service awarded grants
to 70 communities totaling $225,000 to organize community service events on Martin Luther
King Day. Our newest holiday has a growing tradition of service, springing from Dr. King's
deep belief in service. As he said, "Anyone can be great because anyone can serve." In
1994(ck), Congress designated Martin Luther King Day as a day of service. Around the country,
more and more communities are helping to make MLK Day into a day of service -- "a day on, not
a day off' -- by organizing service activities for January 19. Over 200 communities applied for
these grants.

Update since Philadelphia service summit
The President also noted progress since April's Presidents' service summit in Philadelphia, when
corporations and others committed to service on behalf of children. The Administration has
followed up with more AmeriCorps scholarships, reading tutors for children through the America
                                                                        Hex-DiJmp Conve~ion .

Reads initiative, mentoring efforts by federal agencies, and the new $24 billion Children's Health
Insurance Program signed into law this summer. This program, the single largest investment in
health care for children since the passage of Medicaid in 1965, will give up to five million
children who are now without access to health insurance a healthy start.
