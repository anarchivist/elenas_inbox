TEXT:
As you may know, the Delaware trip is definitely off b/c of the lack of
travel funds.  Once the Alabama trip was scheduled for tomorrow, Sylvia
and John had to cut another trip.

Mike thinks we should still try confirm a class size event on May 8th here
in D.C.  I'll work wi scheduling on that. Please let me know if you have
other ideas.
