Chairman
Committee on Appropriations
U.S. House of Representatives
Washington, D. C. 20515

Dear Mr. Chairman:

       The purpose of this letter is to provide the Administration's views on HR 4569, the
Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Bill, FY 1999, as
passed by the House and by the Senate. As the conferees develop a final version of the bi 11, your
consideration of the Administration's views would be appreciated.

       The Administration appreciates efforts by the House and Senate to accommodate
certain of the President's priorities within the 302(b) allocation. In addition, the
Administration particularly appreciates the Senate's provision of full funding of our
request for the International Monetary Fund (IMF) at this time of acute international
monetary crisis. However, the allocation is simply insufficient to make the necessary
investments in programs funded by this bill. As a result, a number of key programs are
seriously under-funded in both the House and Senate versions of the bill.

        The only way to achieve the appropriate investment level for the programs funded
through this bill is to offset discretionary spending by using savings in other areas. The
President's FY 1999 Budget proposes levels of discretionary spending for FY 1999 that con fonn
to the Bipartisan Budget Agreement by making savings through user fees and certain mandatory
programs to help finance this spending. In the Transportation Equity Act, Congress -- on a
broad, bipartisan basis -- took similar action in approving funding for surface transportation
programs paid for with mandatory offsets. In addition, this year, as in the past, such mandatory
offsets have been approved by the House and Senate in other appropriations bills. We want to
work with the Congress on mutually-agreeable mandatory and other offsets that could be used to
increase funding for high-priority discretionary programs, including those funded by this bill.

       As discussed below, both the House- and Senate-passed bills are unacceptable in
their current forms. As previously communicated to the Congress, the President would
veto any bill that does not address the key concerns discussed below.




                                                            Automated Records Management System

President's request. As a consequence, several accounts, such as the assistance program to
the New Independent States, are inadequately funded. There are, in addition, an excessive
number of earmarks and directives that would hinder effective implementation of
American foreign policy.

        The House version of the bill also has several flaws. It provides even less funding --
$1.22 billion below the President's request -- than the Senate bill. Moreover, it includes
"Mexico City" family planning provisions, does not fully fund the IMF,', and deletes funding
for the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization (KEDO). In addition, the
House bill would also remove or reduce discretionary authorities that Presidents of both
parties have used in advancing American foreign policy for at least two decades.

International Monetary Fund

       While the Administration welcomes House and Senate efforts to provide funding for
the International Monetary Fund's New Arrangements to Borrow (NAB), we are extremely
concerned by the House's failure to include in its bill the requested appropriation for the
$14.5 billion U.S. share of the IMF's critically needed quota increase. Since February of
this year, the President has repeatedly called on Congress to approve the full amount of his
$17.9 billion budget request for the IMF. To reject or delay this funding not only would
undermine America's leadership in the world; it also would expose American workers,
investors, farmers, and businesses to unacceptable economic risks.

       The IMF's financial resources are nearing historic lows, necessitating the recent
activation of the IMF's emergency credit lines, the General Arrangements to Borrow
(GAB), for the first time in 20 years. Without the entire $17.9 billion in new funding,
composed of the quota increase and the U.S. share of the New Arrangements to Borrow
(NAB), the IMF -- and hence the United States and the world -- will remain vulnerable if
new, escalating, or spreading systemic crises occur. To protect America's economic
strength, Congress must act now to pass the full quota.

        The House bill proposes several conditions on IMF funding that, while directed at
objectives we share, are unworkable in their current form and, therefore, would have the
effect of delaying indefinitely the availability of these critical resources to the IMF. The
Senate bill includes provisions that are problematic as currently drafted but could serve as
the basis for useful discussion. We urge the conferees to respond to these concerns in
developing the final bill.




                                                       Automated Records Management System
                                                       Hex-Dump Conversion
                                              2

         The Administration strongly opposes the "Mexico City" restrictions that are'
included in the House bill, which would prohibit foreign non-governmental organizations
from receiving U.S. family planning funds if the organization uses any of its own funding
from non-U.S. Government sources for abortion-related services or advocacy. The House
bill's "Mexico City" language is even more restrictive than the provision contained in the
conference report on the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act. The
Administration continues to oppose these restrictions, which would deny funding to the
most experienced and qualified family planning and maternal-child health care providers.
As stated in past Administration communications, should this language be included in the
final bill presented to the President, the President would veto the bill.

Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization (KEDO)

        The Administration strongly objects to the House bill's deletion of U.S. funds for KEDO
and inclusion oflanguage prohibiting the President from exercising his authority to transfer funds
from other sources for this purpose. While limited in scope, the Agreed Framework reached
between the United States and the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea in 1994 is the
foundation we are using to engage the North on a range of issues of strategic concern, including
those not specifically covered by the Agreement, such as missile tests. The House bill would
allow North Korea to blame the United States for not fulfilling our commitment to the Agreed
Framework. In essence, it would give the North an "out" to begin reprocessing fissile material
currently monitored under international safeguards and allow them, not us and our allies, to
choose the time for any possible confrontation. Such an action would seriously destabilize
security on the Korean peninsula, place U.S. troops in greater danger, and exacerbate the Korean
qnancial crisis.

New Independent States

         As recent events have indicated, the incomplete, peaceful transition of the New
Independent States (NIS) to stable, market democracies is vital to the U.S. national
security. The Congress has shared this view and provided considerable support for this
program in the past. The current politicaVeconomic situation in Russia highlights how
great the stakes are for the United States to continue to help Russia achieve this peaceful
transition. The enormous economic potential of the Caspian Basin represents one of the
great opportunities to advance our mutual goals. Therefore, the cuts embodied in the both
the House and Senate bills' funding level for USAID assistance programs to the NIS are'
especially unfortunate. These cuts, which are significantly more severe in the case of the House
bill, would make it extremely difficult to push for the completion of market refornls and support
democratic forces across the region.


                                                           Automated Records Management System

-- in Russia, pending certification oftermination of all nuclear reactor and ballistic missile
technology cooperation with Iran, is so rigid as to impede the Administration's ability to ensure
that termination. This prohibition would hold programs designed to foster the private sector
across Russia hostage to central Government policy in Moscow. In addition, the numerous
country earmarks would make it more difficult for the Administration to shift assistance to take
advantage of new opportunities such as the election of reform-minded governments, peace
agreements settling ethnic disputes, or helping leverage reforms by coordination of our assistance
with international financial institutions.

         The Administration welcomed and strongly supported the House Appropriations
Committee's action to repeal restrictions on U.S. assistance to Azerbaijan. The final House bill.
unfortunately, overturned the Committee's responsible action, and, like the Senate bill, included
restrictions that have been a disincentive for securing peace in the Caucasus. This action does
not serve U.S. national interests. Of the two sets of provisions, the Administration prefers the
Senate language.

Foreign Assistance Act Authorities

         The Administration strongly opposes the elimination of Foreign Assistance Act (FAA)
section 451 authority -- which allows the US to respond to unanticipated contingencies -- and the
 per country reduction of FAA section 614 authority. Both sections provide the President with
critical authorities to address urgent and complex foreign policy issues. Further diminution of
these already limited authorities would unacceptably constrain the ability of the United States to
respond to evolving global events.

Global Environment Facility

        The Administration is concerned with the refusal of the House and Senate to fund the
President's request for the Global Environment Facility (GEF), which is helping to reduce
long-term environmental risks that will affect all Americans. The $300 million request for GEF
(of which $192.5 million is arrears) is needed to assure that the GEF does not run out of
resources in FY 1999. Concerns that funding the GEF would prejudge debate on the Kyoto
Climate Protocol are misplaced: the new replenishment agreement is funded at the same level
as the prior one, and the GEF will continue with precisely the same broad work program that it
had prior to Kyoto. The GEF is among the best vehicles that the United States has to encourage
developing countries to shoulder greater responsibility for protecting both the local and global
environment. It is manifestly in our interests to clear our arrears and keep the GEF running, and
that is why the Administration strongly urges the conferees to restore funding for this critical
program.

                                                  4

         The Administration is concerned with the House and Senate cuts to the $216 million
request for NADR. This reduction would undermine the multi-prong effort that NADR supports
to reduce the proliferation threat to U.S. national and global security. Lack of funding for the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) Preparatory Commission would harm U.S. national
security interests as it would eliminate planned improvements in our ability to monitor nuclear
testing worldwide. The recent Indian and Pakistani tests are a stark reminder of the importance
of this monitoring. At the levels proposed by the House and Senate, we would also be forced to
reduce support for NlS science centers, demining efforts, and other non-proliferation related
activities, possibly endangering our national security.

Middle East Assistance

       The Administration welcomes the efforts of the House and Senate to work with us in
encouraging changes in traditional levels of assistance to countries in the Middle East. We
believe that Israel's initiative to reduce Economic Support Fund (ESF) assistance provides an
important basis on which to build future assistance programs that meet our needs in the Middle
East and beyond.

        We are very concerned about the deletion in the Senate bill of current authority to allow
the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) to maintain an office in Washington, D.C. This
would severely undermine our ability to facilitate dialogue between Israel and the Palestinians at
what is an extremely sensitive juncture of the peace process.

Economic Support Fund

       The Administration is concerned with the overall funding level for the Economic Support
Fund (ESF) account. At the levels in both the House and Senate bills, the account would not
have sufficient resources to continue supporting economic and political stability in Latin
America, and in other emerging democracies in Africa and Asia. We strongly encourage
Congress to support a higher funding level for the ESF account as the bill moves forward. In
addition, the House and Senate restrictions on assistance to Haiti need to be balanced with
a national interest waiver to ensure that the President has sufficient flexibility to pursue
our national interests.

Bosnia and Kosovo

       The Administration prefers the House version of the bill on Balkans issues and strongly
opposes three provisions of the Senate version that would codify the "outer wall of sanctions" on
Serbia-Montenegro, prohibit lifting sanctions on Serbia-Montenegro unless certain conditions are
met with respect to Kosovo, and tighten sanctions on entities harboring war criminals. Though

                                                            Hex-Dump Conversion
would unnecessarily prohibit us from using, or require cumbersome steps to use assistance in
constructive ways to further Kosovo negotiations and Dayton implementation.

Peacekeeping Operations

        Both the House and Senate bills reduce the $83 million request for Peacekeeping
Operations (PKO) by significant percentages. PKO provides vital assistance and support for
many important national security and foreign policy activities, including commitments in
Bosnia and Haiti, conflicts in Africa, and potential trouble spots such as in the Balkans. This
reduction would severely limit the President's ability to respond to these and other evolving
events.

Trade and Investment Financing

        The Administration appreciates House and Senate efforts to increase substantially the
funding for the Export-Import Bank and to support the Overseas Private Investment Corporation
and the Trade and Development Agency (TDA). However, Export-Import Bank funding still
falls short of the level needed to meet the expected demand of U.S. exporters in FY 1999.
Support for TDA is insufficient to allow the agency to remain engaged around the world,
especially given its growing program in the Caspian region.

U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)

        The Administration is concerned with the House and Senate cuts in the request for
USAID Operating Expenses. These reductions would not only make it impossible for
USAID to carry out Presidential initiatives in Africa and Latin America, but also would
interfere with the agency's ability to manage its ongoing programs effectively, including
congressional priorities in areas such as infectious diseases and child survival, as well as to
address management priQrities. In particular, these reductions, combined with the House
action striking the emergency fund in the Treasury/General Government appropriation bill,
would make it difficult for USAID to implement fully its Year 2000 conversion. Even if
USAID were to begin closing missions and eliminating additional positions immediately,
the associated fixed costs would prevent AID from achieving the savings necessary in FY
1999 to respond to this cut. For these reasons, we urge the conferees to restore funding
for USAID Operating Expenses.

        In light of the continuing needs created by both natural disasters and ongoing civil
conflicts, we urge the conferees to provide a higher level of funding for international
disaster assistance. The level in the House version of the bill would cripple our efforts to
respond expeditiously and effectively to countries in transition from crisis caused by
political and ethnic conflict and could undercut our ability to address man-made and natural
disasters.

million request for credit subsidy for the Urban Environment (UE) credit program, or
provided transfer authority for USAID's Development Credit Authority (DCA). As the
Congress and the Administration agreed in the FY 1998 appropriations legislation, USAID has
taken substantial steps towards developing the capacity to manage both its existing and future
credit portfolios. We urge the conferees to restore the transfer authority for the DCA and the
subsidy request for the DE program. Failure to do so would limit the ability of USAID to use
credit to promote development in urban areas and to encourage the development of needed
private sector financial mechanisms.

       The House prohibition on the use of funds from the Child Survival and Disease Programs
Fund for non-project assistance, which is specifically authorized in the Foreign Assistance Act,
would weaken USAID's current leadership position with bilateral and multilateral donors to
encourage and support policy reforms in sub-Saharan African countries.

        If the Senate's disproportionate earmarks for the Asian region were adopted, US AID
would be required to terminate or significantly reduce funding for programs in all non-earmarked
development assistance countries in Asia, such as the Philippines, and Bangladesh. The
Administration is also concerned about the earmark for alternative crop programs. This type of
activity is more appropriately funded by the International Narcotic Control account, not the
already pressed agricultural development section. Finally, the Administration is concerned
about new, onerous language related to climate change, including additional procedural
requirements. The Administration appreciates the Senate's action to improve the provision that
provides "notwithstanding" authority for activities intended to reduce global greenhouse gas
admissions.

Exchange Stabilization Fund

        The House bill contains a provision that would limit the President's flexibility to utilize
the Exchange Stabilization Fund as necessary to protect America's economic and security
interests. For this reason, and because the Exchange Stabilization Fund is not germane to the
purposes of this appropriations bill, the Administration opposes this provision.

Treasury International Affairs Technical Assistance Program

       The Administration appreciates the provision in the Senate bill that provides a
substantial portion of the Administration request for this program, which will significantly
enhance the transition to stronger private sector-led growth and more efficient,
transparent, and better supervised financial institutions in emerging economies, including
reforming countries in Africa and financial crisis countries in Asia We are disappointed,
likewise, that the House has not funded any of the $5 million request for this program.
Given the large potential benefits and modest cost of this program, which provides



                                                 8            Automated Records Management System
                                                              HeX-Dump Conversion
privatization of state enterprises, we urge the conferees to fund the request.
International Organizations and Programs

        The House and Senate bills reduce the request for International Organizations and
Programs by $55 million and $44 million, respectively. The House bill also eliminates funding
for the U.N. Population Fund (UNFPA), which provides support for women in family planning
matters in a number of countries not served by U.S. assistance programs. UNFPA does not fund
abortions. The overall reduction in IO&P would limit U.S. ability to participate and support a
number of international organizations.

Peace Corps

       The Administration regrets that the bipartisan Peace Corps initiative to fund 10,000
volunteers by the year 2000 has not received the full request of $270 million from the
Committee. However, we are heartened by House report language stating that it is prepared to
approve a further increase should there be a reallocation of funds later in the appropriations
process.

Community Adjustment and Investment Program (CAIP)

        The Administration is concerned with the failure of both the House and Senate to fund
the Community Adjustment and Investment Program, a program initially funded through the
North American Development Bank, a multilateral development bank. The CAIP was
established to help communities affected by adverse trade patterns associated with
implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement. To date, the program has
assisted in more than 120 loans in 20 states, leveraging private sector financing of over $70
million. The $37 million requested would significantly bolster the CAIP's ability to continue
this work, as well as to support technical assistance, grants, and micro-lending. The
Administration urges the conferees to restore funding for this innovative program.

Year 2000 Conversion

         In the FY 1999 Budget, the President requested more than $1 billion for Year 2000
(Y2K) computer conversion, including specific amounts in the requests for the agencies
funded in this bill. In addition, the budget anticipated that additional requirements would
emerge over the course of the year and included an allowance for emergencies and other
unanticipated needs. On September 2nd, the President transmitted to the Congress a
request for $3.25 billion in FY 1998 contingent emergency funding for Y2K computer
conversion activities. This supplemental request would create a funding mechanism that
is consistent with both the needs anticipated in the President's budget and the Senate's
action creating a $3.25 billion contingent emergency reserve to provide the resources and
the flexibility necessary to respond to critical unanticipated Y2K-related requirements. It

the base requests of a number of agencies for Y2K conversion. We urge Congress to leave
as much as possible of the reserve unalloc.ated so that funds are available to address
emerging needs.

Infringement on Executive Authority

        Several sections of the House and Senate bills would require the United States to use its
"voice and vote" to take particular positions in international organizations. The Constitution,
however, commits to the President the responsibility for formulating the position of the United
States in international fora. Therefore, these sections, if enacted, would be construed as
advisory.

       We look forward to working with the conferees to address our mutual concerns.
