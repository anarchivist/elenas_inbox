TEXT:
Back in December DOJ requested clearance on a letter regarding S.
136 - dealing with the effect and application of legislation
 (i.e., legislation would be prosepective and would not pre-empt
State law unless the Act specifically provided otherwise) .
I would like to clear this letter this week, if possible.
Please provide comments on the Justice letter by 3pmtomorrow,
January 19th.
Thanks
