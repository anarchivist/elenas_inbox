TEXT:
You will receive shortly a draft DoJ letter on HR 2592, the Private
Trustee Reform Act., which the Department had previously opposed.   The
letter transmits compromise language worked out with Congressional staff
and private trustees.

DoJ has been asked to send this letter for tomorrow's markup of HR 2592 by
the full Judiciary Committee.

If I do not hear from you by 5:00 PM today, I will assume you have no


objection to the proposed letter.
