                DISCUSSION DRAFT ·· DO NOT CITE OR RELEASE

EXECUTIVE ORDER NO.

Protection of Children from Environmental Health and Safety Hazards

       By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and laws of the
United States of America, including the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C.
4321 et seq.) and other federal laws for the protection of the public from environmental
health and safety hazards, I hereby order as follows:

      Section 1. Policy.


       1-101. Each Federal agency shall make it a high priority to identify and assess
environmental health and safety risks that may disproportionately affect children.

        1-102. Each Federal agency shall ensure that it considers, and that its policies,
programs, activities, and standards address, disproportionate risks to children that
result from environmental health or safety hazards, to the fullest extent appropriate and
consistent with the agency's mission and applicable law.

       1-103. Each Federal agency should recognize, and contribute to the
development of, the growing body of scientific knowledge demonstrating that children
may suffer disproportionate risk from environmental health and safety hazards. These
risks arise because: children's neurological, immunological, digestive and other bodily
systems are still developing; children eat more food, drink more fluids, and breathe
more air in proportion to their body weight than adults; children have activity and
exposure patterns that are significantly different from those assumed for adults (e.g.,
greater hand-to-mouth contact, more frequent ingestion of non-food items); children's
size and weight may diminish their protection from standard safety features; and
children are less able to respond to warnings or otherwise protect themselves from risk.

      1-104. Each independent regulatory agency is encouraged to participate in the
implementation of this Executive order and comply with its provisions.

      Section 2. Definitions. The following definitions shall apply to this order.

       2-201. Federal agency means any authority of the United States that is an
agency under 44 U.S.C. 3502(1). For purposes of this order, military departments, as
defined in 5 U.S.C. 102, are covered under the auspices of the Department of Defense.

      2-202.   Independent regulatory agency means an agency defined as an

independent regulatory agencies as defined in 44 U.S.C. 3502(10).

        2-203. Covered regulatory action means any substantive regulatory action
initiated after the date of this Executive order that is likely to result in a rule that may:

       (a)    Have an annual effect on ~he economy of $100 million or more or
              adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy,
              productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
              State, local, or tribal governments or communities; and
       (b)    Concern an environmental health or safety hazard or risk that may
              disproportionately affect children.

        2-204. Environmental health and safety risks means a risk to health or safety
that is attributable to: industrial or agricultural chemicals; physical agents (e.g. heat,
radiation); by-products of combustion or industrial processes; foods and nutrients;
prescription drugs; activity patterns; lifestyle choices and substance abuse; and social
and economic factors.

       Section 3. Task Force on Environmental Health and Safety Risks to Children

      3-301. There is hereby established the Task Force on Environmental Health
and Safety Risks to Children, to further the purposes of this Executive order.
