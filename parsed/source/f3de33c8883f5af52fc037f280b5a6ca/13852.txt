TEXT:
FYI - The Department of Labor opposes clearing the Justice letter
on H.R. 1227 (Portal-to-Portal Act).  Labor believes that we
should not try to "fix" a bill that the Administration strongly
opposes.
Reminder -- please send your comments (and reactions to Labor's
views) on LRM 4923 to me by 4 p.m. today.  Thanks.
