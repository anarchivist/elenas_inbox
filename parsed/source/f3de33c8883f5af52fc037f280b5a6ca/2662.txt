TEXT:
Folks--While I was not able to stay for the entire meeting last, I know
that there are things we all have to follow up on. You'll recall that
this was the meeting re 245(i) and potential administrative and
legislative fixes and there is extreme time urgency.  Who has the lead on
coordinating a quick but thoughtful response from DOJ and INS--we'll help
in whatever way we can. Thanks.
