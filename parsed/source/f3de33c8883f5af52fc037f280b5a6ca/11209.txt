TEXT:
Here's a Q&A on ed-flex for the POTUS press briefing on Friday:

Q.         will you support an Ed-Flex bill when it comes to the Senate
floor?

A.       I would strongly prefer to see Congress consider Ed-Flex as part of the
overall reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.
This would ensure that Ed-Flex is designed to fit the federal education
programs of the next five years, rather than the last five years.   If,
however, I am presented with an individual bill it should be consistent
with our ESEA proposal, sunsetting upon enactment of ESEA and including
tough accountability measures.   It is essential that an Ed-Flex provision
strike the right balance between flexibility and accountability for
results.   Moreoever, we shouldn't let this distract us from our braod
education agenda, namely, providing small classes and well-prepared
teachers,turning around low-performing schools, ending social promotion
and strengthening accountability in all our public schols.
