     Here are my only suggested changes.

     In this context, I am heartened that the House approved narrowly defeated
     amendments to strike or limit Congresswoman LoweyD,s amendment proposal to
     require health plans participating in the Federal Employees Health
     Benefits Program to cover all'FDA approved prescription contraceptives.
     The Lowey proposal will improve basic health care coverage for many women
     and help reduce unwanted pregnancies and the need for abortion. A
     bipartisan majority of the House acted in the interests of womenD,s health
     when it beat back efforts to undermine this important proposal and passed
     this amendment.

                                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion

              I am writing to express my concern over the Congress's unprecedented effort in recent
     weeks to restrict safe reproductive choices for women. It is regrettable that some Members of
     Congress have chosen to pursue a series of initiatives designed to create a political issue at the
     risk of increasing unintended pregnancies and abortions and of compromising women's health
     and safety.

             I have long said that I believe abortion should be safe, legal, and rare. All of the
     proposals being offered would restrict safe medical choices. Some would actually restrict access
     to family planning information and services and could have the perverse effect of increasing the
     number of unintended pregnancies and abortions. I urge the Congress to put partisan politics
     aside and instead put women's health and safety first.

             In this context, I am heartened that the House narrowly defeated amendments to strike or
     limit Congresswoman Lowey's proposal to require health plans participating in the Federal
     Employees Health Benefits Program to cover all FDA approved prescription contraceptives.
     The Lowey proposal will improve basic health care coverage for many women and help reduce
     unwanted pregnancies and the need for abortion. A bipartisan majority ofthe House acted in the
     interests of women's health when it beat back efforts to undermine this important proposal.

             Congress unfortunately has not adopted this reasonable, health-oriented approach on
     other issues. First, I strongly object to the amendment to impose restrictions on international
     family planning programs. By prohibiting foreign non-governmental organizations from
     receiving United States funds if the organization uses any non-US government funds for
     abortion-related services or even advocates changes in abortion laws, the amendment jeopardizes
     funding to health care providers who are working to meet the growing demand for family
     planning and other critical health services in developing countries. The result of this
     amendment's provisions could be an increase in unintended pregnancies, abortions, and maternal
     and infant death.

             Second, I find it deeply disturbing that the House would take the unprecedented step of
     intervening in the Food and Drug Administration's drug approval process by banning funding for
     the approval or testing of drugs such as RU-486. For years, the FDA has used vigorous testing
     and the highest scientific standards to protect public health. This amendment substitutes
     political ideology for sound science. It would restrict scientific research that can protect
     women's lives and offer them safe medical choices.

             Third, I am disappointed that the House chose to reject the changes that I proposed to the
     Child Custody Protection Act. As my Administration conveyed to Congress, I would support
     properly crafted legislation that would make it illegal to transport minors across state lines for the
     purpose of avoiding parental involvement requirements. I have repeatedly stated that I would
     sign a bill ifit were amended to exclude close family members from criminal and civil liability
     and to ensure that individuals who provide only information, counseling, referral, or medical
     services to the minor cannot be subject to liability. As amended in this way, the legislation
     would prevent the circumvention of state parental involvement laws while ensuring healthy
     family communications. Unfortunately, the Congress has ignored these proposed changes, as
                                                         Automated Records Management System
                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion

      well as those designed to address certain constitutional infinnities. In doing so, this Congress
      has demonstrated that it is not truly interested in passing legislation, but only in creating another
      partisan political issue.

               Finally, Congress is again signaling that it will tum the difficult debate over so-called
      partial birth abortions into an opportunity to score political points, rather than to pass legislation
      restricting this procedure. I have long opposed late term abortions, and I believe that we
      generally should prohibit the use ofthis procedure. I have insisted, however, on exempting
      those few but tragic cases in which this procedure is necessary to save a woman's life or to
      protect her against serious injury to her health. I again call upon Congress to add such a narrow,
      tightly drawn exception to this bill, so that I can sign the legislation and put an end to all other
      uses of this procedure.

             I urge Congress to move beyond ideology and political maneuvering, to abandon
      extremism, and to protect women's lives and health while reducing the need for abortions.
      Congress's current course would remove appropriate reproductive choices for women, seriously
      jeopardize their health, and very possibly increase the frequency of abortions. I will strongly
      oppose these efforts.
