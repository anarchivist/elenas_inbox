DRAFT -- NOT FOR RELEASE

April 21, 1998
(House Rules)

H.R. 1252 - Judicial Reform Act of 1998
(Hyde (R) Illinois and 8 cosponsors)

The Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 1252 and, if
presented to the President in its current form, the Attorney General would
recommend that the bill be vetoed because it:

 Purports to restrict the remedial powers of Article III Federal courts to
enforce constitutional rights.  Under current law, Federal district courts
may compel State and local governments to levy taxes in excess of their
State law taxing powers when such a remedy would be required to enforce a
Federal constitutional right.  In addition, Federal courts have long been
held to possess the equitable authority to compel State and local
governments to exercise their existing taxing authority even when the
Constitution would not require imposition of such a remedy.  The bill's
proposed restrictions would curtail the equitable discretion of Federal
district courts, as well as deprive them of the power to remedy certain
constitutional rights.  The latter deprivation of power raises
constitutional concerns and would be subject to reasonable constitutional
challenge. (Section 5)

 Would give parties in civil cases the right to exercise preemptive
strikes against Article III judges, without even a requirement to show
cause.  Such a procedure threatens to undermine the independence of the
Federal Judiciary that Article III of the Constitution was intended to
secure, as well as undermine the public's confidence in life-tenured and
constitutionally appointed Federal judges as impartial adjudicators.
Litigants assuredly will engage in judge and forum shopping -- sometimes
with improper-- motives. Additionally, these peremptory strikes would add
further delay to the civil litigation system and erode the rule of law.
(Section 6)


       would require the use of a three-judge panel for certain injunctions and
      declaratory actions.  This provision would adversely affect the operation
      of several preemptive Federal statutes in situations where a State has
      passed a referendum that is contrary to Federal law. Lastly. this
      provision is objectionable because it would provide unprecedented direct
      and immediate access to the Supreme Court. even when the three-judge court
      denies injunctive relief. (Section 2)
