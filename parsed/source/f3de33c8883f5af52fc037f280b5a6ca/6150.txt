D?DIDDCLASS SIZE REDUCTION INITIATIVE:
@SMALL CLASSES WITH QUALIFIED TEACHERS

D?DDDTo have the best schools, we must have the best teachers ... we
        must do mor
e to help all our children read.
XX'             XXXhh#X(President Clinton, 1997 State of
the Union Address(#

D?DDSmall Classes with Qualified Teachers to Improve Reading in the
D?DEarly Gr
ades. DToday President Clinton proposed a $12.4 billion
initiative over 7 year
s ($7.3 billion over 5 years) to help local
schools provide small classes with
qualified teachers in the
early grades. This will help make sure that every ch
ild receives
personal attention, gets a solid foundation for further learning,
and learns to read independently. The new initiative will reduce
class size in
 grades 13 to a ~ationwide average of 18, by
providing funds to help local scho
01 districts hire and pay the
salaries of an additional 100,000 teachers.

To ensure that students have well prepared teachers in these
smaller classes, t
he President's initiative will provide funds to
states and school districts to
train teachers in effective
reading instruction practices. and in ways to teach
 most
effectively in small classes. To further ensure that teachers
are qualif


{ed, funds are also provided to test new teachers and
to develop more rigorous
teacher testing and certification
requirements.  School districts will be accou
ntable for
demonstrating gains in reading achievement. Together, these
steps w
ill help ensure that first through third grade students
are receiving highquali
ty reading instruction in smaller classes
from competent teachers.

O?DDSmall Classes Make a Difference.  DWell designed studies confirm
what paren
ts and teachers know from experiencesmall classes
promote effective teaching an
d learning.  In a landmark fouryear
experimental study of class size reduction
in grades kindergarten
through 3 funded by the Tennessee legislature, researche
rs found
that students in smaller classes (1517 students) made
significantly hi
gher scores on basic skills tests in all four
years and in all types of schools
   The effects of smaller
classes were largest for students in innercity classe
s.  Followup studies have shown that these achievement gains continued
after th
e students returned to regularsize classes after third
grade.

Teachers in the study reported that they preferred small classes
in order to be
tter identify student needs, provide more
individual attention, and cover more
material effectively.
Teachers also reported that smaller classes enabled them
 to teach
basic content in greater depth and more quickly, and make more
use of
 enrichment activities and effective instructional
practices, and more frequent
ly monitor student behavior andh)O*O*O*learning.

O?DDA Competent Teacher in Every Classroom. DSmaller classes make the
most dif              .
ference when they are staffed with competent, wellprepared teachers.  In order
to master the basics and learn to
read well, students need teachers who are qua
lified to teach,
trained in the use of effective instructional practices in
rea
ding, and able to individualize instruction, use effective
teaching practices,
and communicate effectively with parents as a
result of small classes.

President Clinton's class size reduction initiative will help
provide qualified


 teachers in grades 13 by:

D?
DXDProviding Funds for Teacher Training and Testing:   D10% of
the funds in this
 initiative can be used to promote high
quality teaching by (1) training teache
rs in proven
practices for teaching reading and in effective practices in
small
 classes; (2) providing mentors or other support for
newly hired teachers; (3)
providing incentives to recruit
qualified teachers to high poverty schools; and
  (4) testing
new teachers before they are hired and developing more
rigorous te·
sts for beginning teachers. (#

D?DDXRequiring Teachers to Meet State Certification Standards:
D?DDStates and
school districts would be required to ensure that
individuals hired to fill the
se new positions be either
fully certified, or making satisfactory progress tow
ard full
certification and able to meet certification requirements
within one y
ear.  school districts could use the funds
described above to provide teachers
with the additional
training needed to meet certification requirements. (#

D?DXDRequiring State Basic Skills Testing for New Teachers:
D?DDStates would b
e required to implement basic skills testing
for new teachers, to ensure parent
s that new teachers have
basic reading and math skills.  Each state would se1ec
t the
tests it determines is most appropriate for this purpose.
Nearly forty s
tates already require testing of new teachers
in the basic skills. (#

D? DXDEncouraging States to Adopt Rigorous Professional Tests and
D? DUpgrade T
eacher Certification Requirements. DTeachers should
be ~b1e to demonstrate tha
t they know the subject to be
taught and have the necessary knowledge and skill
s to help
their students reach challenging state academic standards.
States wo
uld be encouraged to use a portion of their funds
to toughen teacher certificat
ion requirements and to require
new teachers to demonstrate competence.  For ex
ample, states
could use these funds to develop rigorous tests of subject


matter
 expertise and professional knowledge that prospective
teachers would be requir
ed to pass before they start
teaching.  States could develop methods of assessi
ng whether
beginning teachers, in the first several years in theh)O*O*O*classro
om, can demonstrate that they have met rigorous
standards of classroom teaching
 before achieving full
certification.   (#



D?DDHolding Schools Accountable for Results.D School districts
receiving these
 funds would be required to show that each school
is making measurable progress
 in improving reading achievement
within 3 years, or take necessary corrective
actions such as
providing additional teacher training, revising the curriculum

or implementing proven practices for teaching reading.   School
districts coul
d lose funding if there is no subsequent
improvement in reading achievement in
those schools.  School
districts would also be required to publish an annual sc
hool
report card, providing parents and taxpayers with clear
information on stu
dent achievement, class size, and teacher
qualifications.

D?DDTargeting Funding. DFunds for the President's class size
reduction initiat
ive will be distributed to states on the basis
of the Title 1 formula.  Within
state, each highpoverty school
district would receive the same share of these f
unds as it
received under Title 1, and the remaining funds would be
distributed
 within the state based on class size. Matching funds
would be required from p
articipating school districts, on a
sliding scale ranging from 10%50%, with hig
hpoverty districts
contributing the least.  Once a state has reached an average

class size of 18 in grades 13, it could use these funds to
further reduce clas
s size in the early grades, or it could extend
its efforts to other grades.
D
 D?8DProviding Facilities for Additional Classrooms.  DIn order to help
'school s
 ystems meet the need for additional classroom space, the
 President has (1) prop
 osed a $10 billion school modernization


bond initiative to provide incentives f
or communities to invest
iri local school facilities; (2) made facilities change
s to
accommodate class size reduction an allowable use o·f
modernization bonds;
and (3) allowed for phasedin implementation
of the class size initiative to enh
ance state/local facilities
planning.

O? DOBuilding on Successful Reforms in Arkansas. OAs part of his
comprehensive
 education reforms while Governor of Arkansas, Bill
Clinton reduced class size
in Arkansas to 20 in kindergarten and
23 in grades I through 3. His 1983 educa
tion reform plan also
included a statewide intensive training program for eleme
ntary
teachers and principals to improve teaching of reading, as well
as basic
skills testing for new teachers and basic skills and
subject matter testing for
 experienced teachers.
