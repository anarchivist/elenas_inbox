 PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
RADIO ADDRESS ON RESPONSIBILITY
THE WHITE HOUSE
October 4, 1997

        Good morning. Today I want to talk to you about how we can each
take responsibility for raising our children and strengthening our
families.  And I want to focus especially on the responsibilities of men.

        That family is the cornerstone of our society unites all faiths.
This week, Jewish parents at Rosh Hashana services say a blessing for the
family and over their children. And the U.S. Catholic Conference has
noted, D&The most important work to help our children is done quietly
in our homes and neighborhoods, in our parishes and community
organizations. No government can love a child and no policy can
substitute for a familyD,s care, but clearly families can be helped or
hurtDB by the actions of government.

        We have worked hard to help parents take responsibility for their
children. We passed the family leave law, to allow parents take time off
to care for sick children or welcome new babies. We raised the minimum
wage and increased the Earned Income Tax Credit, so no American who works
full-time should have to raise their children in poverty. We cracked down
on D&deadbeat dads,DB increasing child support collection by 50% and
building a new system of welfare that reflects our values.  From improving


    schools, to expanding access to health care, to punishing domestic
    violence, families have always been our focus.  And, of course, the strong
    economy we have helped to build has created millions of high-paying jobs,
    bringing dignity, stability and opportunity to millions of families.

            But the most important work in support of families is done in the
    hearts and homes of individuals.  It'a clear that in recent decades, too
    many men have not taken seriously their responsibilities -- to their
    families, their children, and themselves. This has serious consequences:
    We know, for example, that failure to pay child support is one of the
    chief reasons women and children go on welfare. And this week, Vice
    President Gore and Education Secretary Riley released a report showing
    that when fathers take an active role, their children do better in school.

            The need for men to take responsibility for themselves and their
    families is something that unites Americans of all faiths and backgrounds
    and beliefs. Today, thousands of members of a Christian menD,s
    organization are meeting on the Mall in Washington. Their presence
    underscores the compelling national need to strengthen our families -- and
    there is nothing more important. When all of us -- men and women -- take
    responsibility for raising our children and passing on our values, our
    families are strengthened. And when American families are stronger,
    America is stronger.

            When I think of how my mother struggled and sacrificed, like so
    many other single parents -- when Hillary and I look with bittersweet
    pride at our own daughter now off in college -- I am more acutely aware
    than ever of the special responsibilities and wonderful rewards of
    parenthood.  For me, there has been no job thatD,s more important     and
    that should be true for all mothers, and all fathers.   The future of our
    children is truly in our hands.   Thanks for listening.
