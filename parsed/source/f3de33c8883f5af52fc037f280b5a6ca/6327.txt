TEXT:
FYI, you should know that CEA asked me for the backup to the analysis I
did last week on the number of states that would have trouble funding
workfare programs under various minimum wage increase scenarios, and then
they redid the analysis.   I don't know what they plan to do with it.
Their version comes up worse than mine did.

I had simply updated the HHS analysis we have been using for months, but
CEA went behind it and made more pessimistic food stamp assumptions.
Also, they calculated the size of the problem for both 20 and 30 hours of
work a week.  You'll recall that we used 20 hours because, even though the
work requirement grows from 20 to 30 hours over time, states can use "job
training directly related to employment" for the hours over 20, and we
made the somewhat aggressive assumption that they would do so to the maximu
m extent.

Here's the difference between my analysis and theirs (they only did
families of 3):

States with Problems -- 20 hrs a week     My
Analysis                         CEA Analysis
Current Minimum Wage                      No
states                   1 state
50 cent increase ($5.65)                        1
state                            2 states
$1 increase ($6.15)                       2
states                           7 states
$2 increase ($7.15)                       9
states                           13
states
For 30 hours of work a week, the numbers are pretty bad (I didn't do this
calculation) :

States with Problems -- 30 hours a week
Current Minimum Wage                    24 states
50 cent increase ($5.65)                        37 states
$1 increase ($6.15)                     42 states
$2 increase ($7.15)                     50 states
