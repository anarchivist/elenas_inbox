TEXT:
Mike and Elena--

I spoke with Dawn about this again today.   She is satisfied that the
analysis of ED and DOJ that the reducing/preventing/eliminating racial
isolation aspect of the program meets the compelling interests test under
Adarand is consistent with the way the Administration has approached
similar issues, in light of the Magnet Schools program's statutory
grounding and history. Therefore, she will be clearing this notice to go.
forward.

The issue of how this applies in the 5th Circuit is not directly addressed
by the notice and Dawn feels it isn't necessary to resolve that prior to
allowing the notice to go out.  She wants to let ED and DOJ sort this out
some more before we weigh in.

Thanks.

-- Bill

Art Coleman in OCR called the other night to give us a   heads-up about


this, which involves breaking some new legal ground.   Dawn Chirwa left me
a message Friday that she was reviewing the application.  Do you have any
gut reactions/concerns on this issue? Art's summary of the issues and
status follows.  Thanks.

     Bill, it was good to talk with you last night, and as we discussed,
     I'm forwarding a recap of the overview of where the Department is re
     the magnet school application process.

     WHAT'S NEW

     The federal register notice announcing this cycle of "grant
     applications (which occurs every three years) will for the first time
      include a discussion of strict scrutiny (compelling interest/narrow
     tailoring) standards that must be satisfied in the event that race is
     a factor in the admissions of the"proposed grantees. This
requirement
     sterns from the Adarand case. The last such notice, three years ago,
     pre-dated Adarand.

     In addition to the remedial and diversity interests that are
     identified as compelling, we are setting forth the interest of
     "reducing, prevent:lng, or eliminating" minority group isolation as a
     compelling interest.   Based on desegregation law as well as specific
     language from the authorizing legislation, this represents a new
     position by the federal government.

     PROCESS

    We have been in conversations with the Department of Justice for
    months regarding these issues, and have complete agreement regarding
    the standards and application of those standards with Civil Rights
