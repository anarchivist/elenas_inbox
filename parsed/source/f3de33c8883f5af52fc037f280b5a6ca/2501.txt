TEXT:
        Pauline told me of your inquiry about Newsweek printing the

Scholastic

        figure.     As I shared with her, the commitments being made to the

        Summit are not on the whole being shared with us nor any agency as

        best I can tell.     I am working hard to have a smooth working

operation

        with the Corporation on America Reads and feel success is in place on

        that front.     However, the Summit is not something we work on daily

        together.     I have suggested periodically with them we need to be kept

        abreast of what is happening with the Summit and quite frankly I get

        the impression at times that those at the Corporation itself aren't

        always aware of what commitments are being received.     If you have

        ideas about what I should do differently let me know.     I think it is

a

        bigger system problem than just America Reads being somewhat in the

        dark as I have heard other departments/agencies saying they are

        getting calls from folks with whom they work saying they are confused

        about the relationship of the Summit to ongoing relationships with

     various agencies and departments with which they work.==================== ATTA
