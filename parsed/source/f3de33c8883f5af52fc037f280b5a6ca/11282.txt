TEXT:
          Attached is a one page description of a feasible food safety
reorganization plan USDA supports and how we think the major players would
react. None of them think we can realistically go for a singl'e food
agency.  The advocates and USDA do think we have a shot at centralizing
the crucial inspection function.  The move would be a significant one,
there are thousands of meat inspectors in USDA, daily inspection of every
plant.  There are only a few hundred inspectors in FDA,   the average fruit
and veggie plant may not be inspected for many years.   The crucial
opposition is in HHS/FDA.  ==================== ATTACHMENT    1 ====================

                     DRAFT FOR DISCUSSION PURPOSES ONLY


I. Move food inspection and standard-setting/regulation for microbial, viral, and parasitic
pathogens to FSIS (USDA), including seafood, eggs, milk, fruits and vegetables as well as
FDA/State boards on milk, seafood, and the food code.

II.   CFSAN at FDA has responsibility over food additives, dietary supplements,
biotechnology, chemical/pesticide/drug residues/standards, and food labeling under NLEA
(?), including meat and poultry products. They are also given a budget increase.
Consideration is given to promoting preemption, as USDA has for meats, and processor
groups would prefer.

III. Inspection Resources--move small number of field personnel i.e. imports, otherwise all
inspection personnel remain for drugs, medical devices. Provide FSIS with base increase
of XX million to ensure successful transition.

IV. USDA becomes U.S. Department of Food and Agriculture (Under Secretary for
Public Health and Food Safety).

V. Underlying Statutes (FFDCA, FMIA etc) remain intact.           (Direct development of
proposal to unify any conflicts in underlying statutes?).

VI. Consider other measures to ensure independence from promotion, e.g. statutory
advisory board, statutory reaffirmations.

VII. Public Health and Ag. Committees share full jurisdiction over food safety.

Reactions of Interested Parties to Food Safety Reorganization


   USDA- USDA would support the move. Glickman has told his staff he would
        support then re-naming his agency the Department of Food and Agriculture.

   HHS-     Would strongly oppose. O'hara called me to protest when clumsily USDA
          suggested it in a meeting. On the other hand, FDA recognizes their hand is
          weak. The Hill is unlikely to give FDA the money they need to inspect
          adequately. FDA's attempt to delegate to the states is running into
          opposition from the advocates, who FDA knows they have alienated.

   Consumer groups-- The two leaders, Carol Tucker Foreman and Caroline Smith
        Dewall are strong advocates of a single food agency, and have each told me
        they support moving inspection to USDA. Caroline says she has now told
        this to FDA.

   Congress: USDA is generally favored on the Hill, FDA is not, and USDA believes it
         could build support. Currently, however, among most ago types there is a
         go slow attitude. For instance, while Harkin's staff confided that while they
         support a single food agency, they are satisfied there is enough on the plate
         right now and don't particularly want to go into the issue. Among food
         safety advocates, Durbin has been a leader in supporting a single food safety
         agency.

   Producer/Processor Groups:         Producer groups prefer USDA.          I had a
         wide-ranging conversation with the head of the fruits and veggies processors
         group in which he said they were not positive about any governmental moves
         -- they are pretty conservative-- but USDA believes they could be brought
         around given the association's distaste for FDA and the chance they might
         get preemption.

   Internal WH: OMB, OSTP and WH are all supportive. NEC has been supportive
          but we haven't talked to Sally about this recently. VP's office was originally
          charged with sounding out the agencies on a single food agency-- and backed
          off given HHS's negative reaction.
