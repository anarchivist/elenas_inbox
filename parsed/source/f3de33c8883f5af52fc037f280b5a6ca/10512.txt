         President Clinton will recommend a $72 million expansion of his National Food Safety
Initiative in his fiscal 2000 budget proposal. If enacted, the budget would result in a third year
of significant growth in government efforts to prevent potentially deadly foodbome illness
through a comprehensive, science-based inspection, surveillance, research and education
initiative. The new funds are to be shared by the Department of Agriculture (USDA), which
which would receive $32 million, and the Department of Health and Human Services which
would receive a total of $40 million, $30 million for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
and $10 million for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Improving Domestic and International Food Safety Inspections

       The President proposes to greatly expand inspections of domestic and imported food
products. The President's food safety budget would ensure that the FDA inspect, at least once
every year, every domestic high risk food manufacturer (manufacturers that produce
ready-to-eat foods that support bacterial growth such as raw and pre-cooked seafood
products). Currently, each of the 6200 domestic high risk food manufacturers are
inspected every 3-4 years.

        Imported food would also be subject to increased scrutiny. FDA would more than
double the number of inspections conducted of foreign food processors from 100 to more than
250. The FDA technical experts also will examine the food growing, processing, and
transportation systems in additional foreign countries to determine if they meet high standards for
safe production. The FDA has jurisdiction over all food products except meat, poultry, and egg
products, which are under USDA's jurisdiction. For USDA, which conducts daily inspections
of meat and poultry products, funds would be provided for continuing phase-in of Hazai-d
Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP), the Agriculture Department's science-based,
prevention-oriented meat and poultry inspection system, which has already helped to reduce
significantly dangerous pathogens levels. HACCP is currently in effect in the nation's
approximately 300 largest plants which account for 75 percent ofthe volume of meat and poultry
production in the United States. HACCP will be phased in at the over 2,700 smaller plants
(those employing 10 to 499 employees) starting in January 1999, with the result that a total of90
percent of meat and poultry production will be covered.

        The President's plan also envisions even greater coordination among federal and state
agencies handling food safety issues. For the first time, state and federal inspection results will
be shared by electronic connection, reducing overlapping efforts and enhancing the ability of
authorities to focus on public health improvements. Developing a nationally integrated food
safety system at the federal, state, and local levels will allow greater uniformity and the use of
common standards among the states and Federal government in ensuring food safety. USDA
will strengthen its 26 federal-state partnerships to facilitate the interstate shipment of
state-inspected meat and poultry products. Current law prohibits the mostly small plants that are

                                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion
constituent groups on a legislative proposal that would permit plants subject to state inspections
to ship interstate on the condition that they implement HACCP and are subject to enhanced
federal oversight.

Public Health Research and Surveillance

        The funding increase would also enable better surveillance offoodbome illness. CDC
would expand its foodbome illness monitoring system, called "FoodNet," and its computerized
database to identify unique illness "DNA fingerprints," called "PulseNet." The new funds will
allow PulseNet to expand its network oflaboratories in state health departments for subtyping
E.coli"(currently 29 labs) and Salmonella (currently 15 labs) to 40 labs for each, and will permit
FoodNet to expand the number offoodbome pathogens that it monitors. The expanded
surveillance network is the heart of our nation's foodbome disease early warning system and was
already helpful in identifying the recent Listeria monocytogenes outbreak.

       Finally, USDA and FDA's food safety research efforts would also benefit from the
President's budget proposal. Expanded research would focus on:

·      creating new detection tests for dangerous contaminants such as Salmonella in eggs,
       Cyclosopra in fresh produce, and test methods for E. Coli 0157:H7 in foods in which it
       cannot now be tested. Such tests would have been useful, for example, when the
       cyclospora outbreak occurred in 1996 and 1997 from tainted raspberries. In that case,
       scientists had no test to find the contaminant in the berries.

·      helping farmers better control potentially dangerous bacteria and fungi in fruits and
       vegetables.

·      combating antibiotic resistance in pathogens that colonize food-producing animals.

        The President's Joint Institute of Food Safety Research will continue developing a
strategic plan for conducting and coordinating all federal food safety research efforts and will
work closely with the private sector and academia in the process.

        The President's proposal builds on a strong record of food safety accomplishments,
ensuring that Americans eat the safest possible food. Last year, the President proposed a
$101 million increase in food safety funding, more than $80 million of which was ultimately
approved by Congress in the final budget. The Administration has put in place improved
safety standards for meat, poultry, and seafood product, and has begun the process of
developing enhanced standards for fruit and vegetable juices.
