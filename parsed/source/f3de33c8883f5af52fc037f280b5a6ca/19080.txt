TEXT:
I wanted to update the two of you on the Head Start quality set-aside.
HHS and OMB are still arguing, and HHS is under significant pressure to
brief the hill on our position on reauthori~ation.   (Olivia is also
testifying next week.)    After about seven weeks of OMB's thinking about
options, they have proposed: (1) removing the requirement that 50% of
quality funds be used for salary and benefit improvements; (2) requiring
HHS to do an evaluation of the quality set-aside; and (3) changing the
structure of the research reserve.   HHS is fine with 2 and 3, but
adamantly opposes 1.   I have been working with Barbara Chow and told her
(after our conversation at the staff meeting, Elena) that DPC (and NEC,
according to Chuck Marr) agrees with HHS because changing the salary and
benefit requirement would provoke an unbelievable uproar from labor and
children'S advocates as well disturb the delicate balance on the hill that
was reached during the last Head Start negotiations.

I have called Jack Lew to let him know that I think this really needs to
be resolved as soon as possible and that it needs to be resolved in HHS'
favor (although I haven't reached him yet).  Nicole will follow this
tomorrow.
