TEXT:
I sent a memo around last week from Dave Barram recommending that
the President come out promptly against the California securities
litigation initiative.  I am planning to forward this to the
President within the next day or two.  If you have any comment on
Barram's suggestion, please let me know.  If you need another
copy, my office can supply it.  tds
