TEXT:
According to Peter, Gingrich is now interested in the H-2A issue. Likely
b/c of calls that he has received from Georgia growers who were caught up
in last year's Vidalia onions battle. Because of this pres sue (and b/c
Lamar is doesn't like the Graham-Wyden bill), he has rejoined with Bob
Smith in an attempt to replace Graham-Wyden with the Smith guestworker
bill. As you recall,we have a Secy of Labor veto threat on that bill.
According to Linda Delgado, USDA heard that attempts to make this switch
have been unsuccessful.  She is going to check again with Dave Carlen and
let us know.
