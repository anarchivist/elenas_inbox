TEXT:
The woman's office wanted us to be more encouraging on the possibility of
doing comparable worth.   While I don't see the need to needlessly alienate
the pay equity groups, I also don't think we do any ourselves any favors
by setting up expectations that we are about to do comparable worth. As
I've mentioned, I'm concerned that we will get into a debate on whether to
do comparable worth with that endorsement being the benchmark of the
Administration's commitment. I'm also concerned that some in the Administ
ration wi'll send signals that instead of taking credit for what we've
done, now is the time'to push DPC (NEC) to do Compo Worth.   Politically, I
think now is the time to hold the high ground, push the popular Daschle
bill until the other side concedes, and then move to the next thing we
want to do on fair pay. As an aside, it seems that Shirley W. at OFCCP
wanted to collect wage data, the DOL solicitors office said no, Shirley
appealed to OMB and told the groups about her problem.   I thought that was
bad form.   DOL has now asked OMB to hold off reviewing for three months.
