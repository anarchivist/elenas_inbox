TEXT:
I hear that Communications may push to do the radio address on MLK Day and
service.  Since we have the service project on Monday, that may be
overkill, so I'm certainly not pushing it.  But, if it becomes the best
option, here are my best policy announcements (they're pretty small) :

1.  President's Youth Service Awards -- The Corporation is planning to
relaunch these; I sent you a note on this the other day.  But the First
Lady may be planning to announce this in her column, so we'd have to call
that off.

2. AmeriCorps has a study it hasn't formally released on diversity in
AmeriCorps.   It's pretty boring -- qualitative stuff about who benefits
from diversity and how to support diversity.   More interesting is a PC
how-to manual by the study authors with examples from successful service
programs.   The Corporation's conclusion from the study is that national
service gives participants a greater respect for others.

3.   The Presidential Memorandum asking agencies to report on how they
support employees to want to volunteer during the work day is about to go
out.

4. We could see if Harris is comfortable announcing a "Saturdays of
service" program for AmeriCorps NCCC, similar to CityYear's Young Heroes,
where AmeriCorps and JH students work together on Saturdays.
