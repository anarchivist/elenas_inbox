TEXT:
This morning's Senate hearing on free television apparently was uneventful.
Feingold expects to introduce the bill no later than next week, holding to his
May introduction pledge. Dole's retirement may mean that McCain will playa
more active role, without fear of putting Dole in an untenable position.
One interesting piece of news: McConnell put in the FY97 Budget Committee
Report some language that would effectively change the public financing system
from "checkoff" to "voluntary." It's non-binding, but is nonetheless a bad
precedent.
