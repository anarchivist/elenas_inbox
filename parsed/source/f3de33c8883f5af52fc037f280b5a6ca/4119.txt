     I am forwarding Ron's latest e-mail on VP events next week. It would be

     early tomorrow.  -- Jon Schnur

     As an update, here is where things stand.

     1.  I would like you to work on a small, non-press conference call for Wed
     aft. We would then sell this to reporters as part of our overall effort.

     2. We would do an event on Thurs.  Public.   Support before the vote.
     Site: TBD, but presumably at the WHo

     3. On Fri, we would do the planned event in NH, with this as the message;
     i.e., either celebrate the victory, or vow to fight on in Conference.
     Hopefully, Sec. Riley would join us.

Please coord with sched, commun, and leg aff on this. This is a great
idea and we can have a great run with this.  Thanks!!!
