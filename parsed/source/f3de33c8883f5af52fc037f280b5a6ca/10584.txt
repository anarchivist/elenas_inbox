                                        Questions and Answers
                                           January 7, 1999


    . Q:   Does the Administration support the Medicare Commission's desire to reform the
           Medicare program that looks more like the FEHBP?

     A:    This proposal, generally referred to as a premium support program, has potential and is
           worth considering. However, as with any health care initiative the devil is in the details.
           We believe that just as there is potential to design a positive premium support program
           there is great potential to develop a negative model. We cannot make any determinations
           about this concept, but as always our fundamental commitment is to ensuring that
           Medicare beneficiaries have a stronger program and are not exposed to excessive
           financial burdens; We look forward to learning about this program as the Commission
           develops the details over the next several weeks.

     Q:    The MediCare Commission today is discussing raising the Medicare eligibility age
           from 65 to 67 -- making it consistent with phase up for Social Security. What is the
           Administration's position on this?

     A:    As we have consistently stated, we would be seriously concerned about raising the
           Medicare eligibility age, particularly outside the context of developing a mechanism to
           assure this does not increase the number of uninsured Americans. Recent data reaffirms
           Americans between ages 55 and 65 are the most rapidly growing group of uninsured
           Americans and are some of the hardest-to-insure. There is no reason to believe that
           Americans ages 65 to 67 would not face similar problems. We look forward to any
           further analysis on this and other issues facing that Medicare program that are being
           discussed by the Commission.

     Q:    Will your Medicare buy-in proposal take care of that?

     A:    The President's plan is structured for those 55-65 who don't have access to insurance. It
           is paid for, in effect, by the purchasers of the insurance, and it is not subsidized. As you
           know, the 65-67 population currently has a part A benefit they've paid for through their
           work career and a subsidized part B for physician coverage. That would not be acceptable
           for the 65-67 population, particularly those with low to moderate incomes. Therefore, any
           move to increase the eligibility age would have to be combined with a policy that
           provided for additional assurances that currently insured beneficiaries would have access
           to affordable coverage.
                                                                           Automated Records Management System
                                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion

             Q:   Do you believe that additional revenues will be necessary to address the long term
                  financing challenges that face the Medicare program?

             A:   We have not reached any conclusions on this matter. Our record is clear -- no
                  President has done more to strengthen and modernize this program. Just a year and
                  a half ago, we signed into law the most significant reforms in the program since its
                  enactment over 30 years ago. These reforms improved beneficiary choice, increased
                  the emphasis on preventive benefits, constrained cost growth, and extended the life
                  of the trust fund to 2008.

                  The President's past actions well illustrate his commitment to work in a bipartisan
                  fashion to strengthen the Medicare program every time the opportunity arises, all
                  the while protecting beneficiaries from excessive out of pocket expenditures. We
                  look forward to receiving the recommendations of the Medicare Commission and
                  hope that this provides another opportunity to work together in a bipartisan fashion
                  to recommit ourselves to improving and strengthening the Medicare program.
