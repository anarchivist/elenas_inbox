TEXT:
I was in Baltimore with the Director, and so was unable to attend the
crime meeting. Here are highlights about ONDCP activity:

1. Reauthorization: The Hatch/Biden ONDCP reauthorization bill (which
closely tracks the Administration bill) passed the Senate Judiciary
Committee today.  We expect a full Senate vote as early as tonight (but
more likely tomorrow). We do not expect a conference before recess as
they will likely recess before the beginning of next week.  Critically,
the Senate bill includes no hard targets. Sen. Coverdale added some
reporting obligations that we (and Justice , OMB, etc) do not like, but
all in all the bill is a good one. OMB is working on the SAP that
strongly supports the bill, but notes several desired amendments.

2. Nominations:   The Senate Judiciary Committee is holding hearings this
afternoon on the nominations of Robert Warshaw for the State & Local
Associate Director position, and Tom Umberg for the Supply Deputy
position. All indications are that the nomination of Warshaw will be
easy. We expect Grassley to focus on the fact that Tom Umberg received
lots of Indian Tribe contributions when he ran for Attorney General of
California. The contributions were legal. I will report at the end of
the hearing.

3.   performanc~   Measures:
                                     P61 b 6
              I am told by John that we finally received comments from the
Department    Justice, which will be incorporated in the next version of
the performance measurement system. Again, John can give you the details
once he returns.

4.  Crack cocaine: Liz Fine of DoJ will revise the Strategy document to
conform with the suggestions made at our meeting at the OEOB.  the revised
document will then be presented to McCaffrey and the AG. We expect
agreement by both principals. Nick Gees from DoJ Inter-governmental
affairs and Dennis Greenhouse from our office have begun implementing the
plan's contact with law enforcement groups. Dennis and I will be meeting
with the National Association of Counties on Friday.  Dennis raised the
issue at the recent meetings of the International Association of chiefs of
Police and National Organization of Blacks in Law Enforcement (NOBLE), and
received surprisingly positive responses from both groups ..
