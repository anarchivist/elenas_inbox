TEXT:
folks did a very good job handling the meeting --- i   just dropped in for a
few. minutes

two things:

        i did speak w/ john awhile back about mirroring the organizing
neutrality language that is already in the heads tart law --- i did try our
expansion idea but he about threw me out of the room --is it possible for
you to get your staff to research the orginal head start language and see
what we'd be up against?

        2d -- it was clear from the part of the meeting i was in that
their report, worthy wage day and the treasury commission meeting will all
happen either within days or within a week of each other --- last week of
april/first week of may -- i'd like you to read their report --- they
will be sending another draft to us next week just so i can have another
check on whether there is anything in it that will give us some pain ---
it is clear that if the report gets coverage -- which it will--that we
will need an answer to the wage problem --- and the scholarship piece
leaves us a little vunerable since the normal calculation      improved
training and education = improved wages--does not work in this sector.
I just don't want us getting bruised before we start --

thanks, sorry to be so long winded
..
