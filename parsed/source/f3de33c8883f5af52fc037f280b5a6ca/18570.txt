TEXT:
1.      DoJ is scheduled to testify this Thursday before a House
Judiciary oversight hearing regarding the civil liability portions of the
proposed tobacco settlement. DoJ has alerted OMB that we probably won't
see the testimony until Wed.  I have alerted OMB that this is a sensitive
subject, and it would be helpful to know who is testifying and the lead in
their testimony by tomorrow.

2.      Sen. Jeffords in planning to introduce his tobacco bill on
Thursday with an FDA section that contains many of the problems the 6/20
deal had plus a lot of new problems that someone clever has thought up.
Jeffords is also on record saying he wants to. move tobacco legislation
that can be reported out of his committee 18-0. We should consider
whether we want to send a message directly to Jeffords (not his staff)
about the problems with his bill.   I believe it is important we do this
before he introduces the bill.   It will be a significant setback to
comprehensive tobacco legislation if Jeffords goes on record supporting
the approach to tobacco regulation outlined in his bill. Jeff Teitz on
Kennedy's staff has urged us to contact Jeffords.
