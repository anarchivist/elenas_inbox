TEXT:
Gomperts tells me he and Harris were surprised to hear the President say
this morning that we are going to "double the number of full-time
AmeriCorps participants" by the year 2000. Apparently the numbers work
when you factor in America Reads, but the Corporation didn't know about
it, nor did I. Assuming you guys knew about it, it's fine that I was out
of the loop. But it would have been nice for the Corporation to know in
advance.
