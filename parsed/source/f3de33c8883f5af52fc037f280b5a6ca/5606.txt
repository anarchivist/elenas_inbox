RE:            SUMMARY OF FORD, LUGAR, AND ROBB TOBACCO FARMER
       BILLS

DATE:          DECEMBER 12, 1997
---,--                         ,-""'-------------------------------
        The bills most basic difference is over whether there should be a tobacco buyout and a
continuation of the quota program. Ford does not have a buyout but compensates farmers for
loss of value in their quota. Lugar provides for a buyout, moving towards the freedom to farm
model of the 1996 farm bill. Robb phases out the quota system, but sets up in its place a
quasi-private licensing system to regulate production quantities.

        USDA is putting together a detailed side by side together, with some historical numbers
on the tobacco program. This note compares cost, quota buyout structures, and transitional
costs.

I.     FORD

       A.      Cost: $28.5 billion. Included as part of the $368.5 billion.

               * Payments for lost tobacco quota capped at $1.6 billion per year.

               * Administrative costs of program, including crop insurance, paid for from fund.
               Limited to $100 million annually.

               * Tobacco Community Development: $300-350 million annually. ' Half the
               money to states for direct compensation proportionate to county share of tobacco
               income, half to state generally.                                 '

               * Farmer Opportunity Grants: $1.4 billion total for higher education fund for
               farmers and dependants.

               *Tobacco Worker Transition Fund: $500 million worker retraining program.


       B.      Quota Buyout? No.

       C.      Payments for Lost Tobacco Quota: Sets a baseline based on the quota for
               1994-1996. Quota holders get $4 a pound per year for every pound below
               baseline. Payments subject to lifetime limit of$8 a pound times the farmer's
               baseline quota. Farmers who lease would be paid at a rate of$2 a pound below
                                                                        , iex-Dump Conversion


            baseline. The lessee has a lifetime limit of one-half the baseline time the $8 per
            pound.· Tenant fanners receive half the payment going to the lesee.

     D.     Future Changes to Program
            USDA can approve referendums in each state, enforces penalties against
            companies that don't meet purchase intentions. Payments for lost quota would.be
            accelerated and paid in full upon termination of the program or in the case of a
            greater than 50% cut in quota for three consecutive years.

II. LUGAR

     A.     Cost: Approximately $15 billion. Added on top of $368.5 billion.

            * Cost of buyout and transition payments.
            * Economic Assistance Program costing $300 million ($100 million for 3 years--
            block granted to states).


     B.     Quota Buyout: Yes. Quota program ends in 1999. Quota owners receive $8
            for every pound they own, either in lump sum or over three years. (There was
            roughly 1.5 billion pounds of tobacco quota last year.)

            Price support program is phased out over three years. (1999 price supports decline
            by 25%, 10% more in 2000 and 2001.

            Payments for transition for those who don't own quota payments are at 40 cents
            per pound over three consecutive years that they lease, rent or cash-rent or
            crop-share.

III. ROBB BILL

     A.     Total Cost:
            * $12 billion buy-out.
            * $250 million for economic diversification.
            * "Transition" costs.
     B.     Buyout?Yes. Five installments at $1.60 a pound based on a three-year average
            of their basic quota. Money can be put in tax-deferred plan .

    . C.    New Tobacco Program:
            Private licensing arrangement phased in to replace quota system. System will be
            run by Tobacco Production Control Corporation. Board consists of 21 people
            from industry and government. Justification is that there is no free market in
            tobacco, four companies dominate it. Also public policy goal to have high prices.
                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion
      Licenses would have no cost but could be obtained only by actual producers.
     Rights cannot be sold or leased. Suggests that the cost of operation will drop by
     40 cents a pound.

D.   Economic Development Fund: $250 million annually for economic
     diversification in tobacco-dependant communities. Generally given to counties.

E.   Transition: A minimum income protection system during the five-year buy-out
     period. Protection added in the event tobacco quota falls by more than 10% from
     1997 levels. Tobacco producers would then be eligible for a $1 per pound
     payment for lost quota from their 1997 level.
