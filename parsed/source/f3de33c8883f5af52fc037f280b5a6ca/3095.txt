TEXT:
While we're thinking about scheduling events for the summer, we should
think about what to submit on service. We have discussed whether to seek
a Presidential event highlighting our proposal to reauthorize AmeriCorps.
The proposed bill isn't cleared through OMB yet, but should be soon.  At
the same time, the Corporation has a few time-sensitive announcements that
we need to decide on.   We should probably decide whether we want to
package some or all of these ideas that are floating around and submit them
 as one idea to scheduling.  For those we don't want to pursue that are
time sensitive, it may be appropriate to let the Corporation announce them
with a.statement from us.

In addition to the idea of a reauthorization event, we have these:

1. The Corporation is now up to about 1,300-1,600 applications from high
schools/seniors who are eligible for and can receive $1,000 high school
service scholarships.  They can award these any time, but want to know
whether we want to announce them.  It seems bad to let this announcement
drift much further, in that these are scholarships for the fall.  We could
tell the individual schools/students, and then have an event later, I
guess.

If we decide the Corporation should just announce this, we could have the
President do a letter to principals and/or superintendents praising the
success of the kickoff year, and expressing the hope that next year
they'll all apply for the scholarships.  (Actually, we have match this
year for about 6,000 scholarships; I suspect applications are topping off
well short of that.)

2. We also talked about highlighting the Corporation's new "scholarship
only" awards that we announced at the Phila. summit.   The Corporation is
getting close to having a new round of these awards to announce. This
could be part of a reauthorization event if the timing is right.

Let me know what you think.
