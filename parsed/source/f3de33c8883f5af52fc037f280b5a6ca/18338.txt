TEXT:
Elena,

I just spoke with Bob Bach from INS reo the OMB chapter. OMB sent them a
recent version of the chapter language, and I let Bob know of the most
recent changes (that I e-mailed to you yesterday). According to Bob,
Doris is dissatisfied with two aspects.   First, they want the
Administration to sound more pro-active (continuing our reform efforts)
and less directly responsive to the CIR, and thus would like an
introductory sentence that reflects that.   Part of their concern is that
by opening with the CIR, it legitimizes their proposal beyond its merit,
particularly in light of the lack of staff support on the Hill. They
don't want members who are unfamiliar with the CIR report to think more of
it that it is worth.  Second, Doris may not want the document to include
language that specifically mentions that the separation within the agency
will occur "both in headquarters and the field" (though Bob initially
thought that this language would be o.k.). Because the latter was a
change that occurred after Bob had a chance to discuss it with Doris, he
is going to get back to me on whether this is o.k. with them.

OMB is moving very fast with this -- they have a Monday 9am deadline.
Mertens has faxed me their most recent version (that incorporates the
changes I e-mailed to you yesterday), and has stated that all comments
from us should go to Deich.

How would you like me to proceed with this?   Thanks.

Julie
