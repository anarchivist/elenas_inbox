MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:         Bruce Reed
              Elena Kagan

RE:           DPC Weekly Report




        Welfare: Rep. Shaw's FICAIWorkfare Plan Scuttled -- Because of opposition by labor
unions, Rep. Shaw's legislative proposal to exempt workfare participants from FICA taxes was
defeated last week. We supported his plan, which was a major improvement over earlier
proposals that would have endangered labor protections and weakened the work requirements.
However, the unions were concemed that the exemption was not limited to traditional workfare,
which could encourage states to classify subsidized private sector jobs as workfare in order to
avoid FICA taxes. We share this concem, but believe that we could have addressed it through
regulation. The Govemors remain very frustrated that this issue remains open, but Shaw is
apparently not planning to pursue it further. The IRS has still not ruled on whether workfare
actually is subject to FICA, and we don't know when they will do so.

        Crime: Child Safety Locks -- The deadline for federal agencies to comply with your
March 1997 directive on child safety locks was October 15. All of the agencies -- with the
exception the State Department-- have responded that they are in full compliance with your
directive to provide child safety locks for handguns issued to their federal law enforcement
officers. We are following up with the State Department.

        Immigration: Central Americans - Last week, the House Republicans unveiled a
proposal similar to our legislation to address problems created by the 1996 immigration law for
certain Central Americans. Their proposal would give amnesty to Nicaraguans in the coUntry
before December 1995; allow certain Guatemalans and Salvadorans to have their suspension of
deportation claims heard under more generous standards; and essentially eliminate the unskilled
workers category for legal immigrants. We are encouraged that their proposal adopts our bill's
fundamental approach to provide relief to most Central Americans.             However, we are
concerned about granting amnesty to Nicaraguans. The administration has never before
supported amnesty, and there does not appear to be a strong substantive argument to grant it in
this case. Further complicating matters, members from the Hispanic Caucus and CBC are now
                                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion

seeking to extend amnesty to Haitians and other Central Americans. Additional concerns may
be raised about the elimination of the unskilled workers category by those who strongly oppose
cuts to legal immigration. We are working with NSC, WH Legislative Affairs and INSIDOJ to
see if improvements can be made to the Republican proposal.

        Imnrlgration: Rand Study -- Last month, the Rand Corporation released a study
assessing the impact of immigration on California over the past 30 years. Among the study's
key findings were that lower labor costs stemming from immigration helped fuel California's
rapid economic growth from 1960 to 1990, and continues to benefit the state's economy.
However, high public service use by California's concentration of refugees and other low-income
immigrants has created a fiscal burden on the state. In addition, a decreased demand for
low-skill workers combined with a steady influx of low-skilled immigrants has increased
competition such jobs--negatively impacting wages for some workers, and further widening the
wage disparity between immigrants and native-borns. To address some of these concerns, the
study specifically recommends: (1) a more flexible system to allow for more frequent changes to
immigration quotas and entry criteria; (2) reducing annual immigration levels to somewhere
between current levels (approx. 800,000) and those in the 1960's (300,000); (3) placing greater
emphasis on educational levels of new immigrants; and (4) more proactive federal and state
policies to integrate immigrants. The study also notes the special relationship between the U.S.
and Mexico, and encourages increased bilateral cooperation on immigration.

        The Rand study is somewhat less optimistic than the National Academy of Sciences
(NAS) study released earlier this year. The NAS study concluded that immigration benefits the
U.S. ,economy overall by about $10 billion annually, with little negative impact on the income
and job opportunities of most native-born Americans. The disparity in findings can be attributed
in part to the demographics of California's immigrants (e.g., tend to be from Mexico, Central
America or Asia; have received less education; are more likely to be illegal, or a refugee),
which differ significantly from immigrants located in the rest of the country. Conversely, some
of the Rand study's recommendations are similar to those in the U.S. Commission on
Immigration Reform's final report released last month. The Commission recommended
lowering the level of legal immigration to about 550,000 annually, as well as promoting the
further integration of immigrants through their "Americanization" proposal (education,
orientation, and naturalization).

        Immigration: New Requirements on Sponsors - On Monday, the INS will announce
the release of guidelines that for the first time require sponsors of certain immigrants to meet a
minimum income threshold as well become financially responsible for the immigrants that they
bring into the country. An immigrant's sponsor will be required to demonstrate an income level
of at least 125% of the poverty level. The mechanism for establishing this will be a new
legally-binding affidavit of support that will be effective December 19, 1997. This new
requirement is mandated by the 1996 immigration law. The Administration supported making
the sponsorship requirement legally binding, while also working to reduce the income

requirement to the final 125% level (higher levels would have created significant barriers to legal
immigration for family reunification),

        Education: Suit Filed Challenging University of Michigan Admissions Policies -
This week the organization that successfully represented the plaintiffs in the Hopwood case filed
suit in Federal district court alleging that the University of Michigan's admissions policies
unconstitutionally discriminate against white students. The plaintiffs point to grids which
allegedly indicate that grades and standardized test scores are applied differently for making
admissions decisions for whites and nonwhites, University officials respond that the grids only
served as one among many sets of guidelines, rather than a rigid barrier. A diversity plan called
the Michigan Mandate has increased minority enrollment at the school from 12.7% in 1986 to
just over 25% this year.

        Education: National Test - DPC and the Education Department have developed a
series of possible compromises on the national test we are prepared to explore. They were
developed in response to suggestions made by Sen. Lott's staff, and reflect our understanding of
what might be necessary to gain the support of Congressional leadership and majority and
ranking members of the appropriations conference, The areas in which think it appropriate to
pursue a compromise include: (1) making it possible for states and school districts to statistically
link their own tests with the national standards and test, so they could provide information on
how individual students performed compared to national standards without having to administer
the national test; (2) treating 1999 as a "field test" and proceeding with full implementation in
2000; (3) capping participation in the field test to jurisdictions with no more than 50% of 4th and
8th grade students; and (4) evaluating the field test and reporting the results to Congress before
proceeding with implementation, While we believe we could live with all four of these
provisions if necessary, our intention is to pursue them one at a time, adding new components
only as needed.

        We will discuss these possibilities with Sen, Lott's staff next week, and develop a
strategy for focusing negotiations around these ideas depending upon what we learn in that
conversation,
