TEXT:
While the FCC didn't dislike the McCain bill, the VP's office said they
see it as an attack on the whole program and, as Bruce saw when I brought
it up with Gips, not enthused. On the other hand they don't seem to deny
the logic of that it will pass and it will be signed, so can't we make it
into something we will be for.  Kohlenberger makes several other points:
1. de facto libraries and schools will have smut blocks because Microsoft
browser does, and Netscape's browsers will, have them;  2.  the VP has
done a lot of parent control of the Internet events including the 'parents
Guide to the Internet'; 3. they aren't opposed to doing another
announcement -- we should look to Markey who is trying to get into the
issue.  I;m following up there.
