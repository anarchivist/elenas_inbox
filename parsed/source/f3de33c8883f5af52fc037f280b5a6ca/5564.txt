TEXT:
This Jobs With Justice study is a pretty big slam:

First, it's an organized effort by ACORN, AFSCME, and the United
Steelworkers and they did not have the courtsey to give us any heads up
on.   (I was the one who alerted Karen T. and DOL.)

Second, the thesis of both publications is to argue against the
President's statement from August that "We now know that welfare reform
works." That quote is the first line of one publication, and is
paraphrased in the second.

I'll bring you copies.   Here's a quick summary:

welfare Reform as We Know It: First Hand Accounts from the Front Lines has
one page case studies from New York, Milwaukee, Boston, Kentucky and
elsewhere, mainly slamming workfare for being unfair, unsafe, and
anti-labor. The introduction states that "Despite protective rhetoric and
directives from the Department of Labor and other federal agencies, abuses
still occur" and concludes: "We know enough to conclude that welfare
reform is not working."

welfare Reform: The Jobs Aren't There argues that there are twice as many
welfare recipients seeking work as there are low wage jobs.    CEA is now
examining this more closely, but they say the study greatly understates
the number of low-skilled jobs (estimating only 430,000 were created in al
1 of 1997 and 273,000 in 1998). It also radically overstates the number
of welfare recipients entering the workforce, saying 1.2 million adults
will need jobs in 1998.   (The study does not say how that number was
reached, but it equals one-third of the adult caseload -- a very large
number to expect to enter the workforce next year (and remember, many
welfare recipients are already in the workforce, combining work with
welfare) .
