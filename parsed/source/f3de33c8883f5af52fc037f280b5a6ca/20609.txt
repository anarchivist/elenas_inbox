TEXT:
Below is the draft Senate Committee letter for FY99 Transportation
Appropriations,  Please note the Secretarial veto recommendation regarding
project labor agreements,  Senate markup is tomorrow, Tuesday, at 9:30am.
Therefore, we need to send the letter tonight.  Please provide

The Honorable Ted Stevens
Chairman
Committee on Appropriations


United States Senate
Washington, D.C.  20510

Dear Mr. Chairman:

        The purpose of this letter is to provide the AdministrationO,s
views on the Department of Transportation and Related Agencies
Appropriations Bill, FY 1999, as reported by the Senate Subcommittee. As
the Committee develops its version of the bill, your consideration of the
AdministrationO,s views would be appreciated.

        The Administration appreciates the SubcommitteeO,s effort to
include in its bill many of the priorities recently agreed to by the
President and Congress in the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st
Century (TEA-21).  However, the Administration is concerned that the
SubcommitteeO,s bill could seriously disrupt air transportation safety,
and vital Federal Aviation Administration (~AA) and Coast Guard
modernization programs, and delay AmtrakO,s progress towards operating
self-sufficiency. The Committee could accommodate the funding increases
recommended below by adhering more closely to the PresidentO,s request for
the Airport Grants program, High Speed Rail, Coast Guard Alteration of
Bridges, and other programs. The bill also includes a number of
objectionable language provisions.  In particular, the Secretary of
Transportation has indicated he would recommend that the President veto
the bill if it includes section 322, which could severely limit the use of
project labor agreements. These concerns are discussed below.

Air Transportation and Highway Safety

        The Administration strongly urges the Committee to restore the
$50 million reduction to FAA Operations and eliminate the earmarks for
low-priority programs, such as subsidies for non-cost beneficial contract
towers.  These funds are necessary to ensure that the FAA can hire the
security personnel and safety inspectors needed to meet the demands from
increased air travel.  To adequately protect the safety of automobile
travelers, we ask that the Committee work with the authorizers and provide
an additional $12 million for high priority National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration (NHTSA) programs.

FAA and Coast Guard Modernization

        The Administration is concerned about language that is intended to
constrain outlays for FAA Facilities and Equipment in FY 1999. We
question whether this provision can be implemented and, if so, whether it
would lead to unintended and unfavorable programmatic effects. We look
forward to working with the Committee to address our concerns.  In
addition, we urge the Committee to fund fully the PresidentO,s request for
the Facilities and Equipment account -- funding at any lower level could
delay National Airspace System modernization.

         The Administration objects to the virtual elimination of funding
for the Flight 2000 program. This program is a key element of the FAAD,s
plans to make a transition to a more efficient, user involved,
satellite-based air traffic control system to meet the air traffic need
of the next century. The Committee is requested to provide the $100
million in the FAA Facilities and Equipment account to deploy explosive
detection systems. The SubcommitteeD,s decision to provide up to $100
million for this purpose in the Airport Grants account would preclude the
FAA from deploying these systems based on security requirements and may
result in fewer systems being deployed.



         The Administration opposes the SubcommitteeD,s reduction of $57
 million to the PresidentD,s request of $443 million for Coast Guard
 capital investments. These capital projects provide long-term operating
 savings and are necessary to ensure that the Coast Guard has the necessary
 infrastructure to fulfill its maritime safety, drug interdiction,
 environmental protection, and national security goals.

 Amtrak

        The Administration strongly urges the Committee to provide Amtrak
with the ability to invest its capital funds flexibly, as presently done
by Federal Transit Administration grantees, and to make the funds
available on October 1st.  In addition, as this bill moves forward, we
urge Congress to fund fully the PresidentD, s request for Amtrak so that' it
can carry through on the bipartisan five-year reform plan envisioned by
the Amtrak Reform and Accountability Act of 1997.

Access-to-Jobs

        The Administration requests that the Committee provide an
additional $50 million to fully fund the PresidentD,s request of $100
million for the Access-to-Jobs program. This program is a critical
component of the AdministrationD,s welfare reform effort. Without these
funds, many economically disadvantaged individuals will be unable to make
the transition from welfare to work.

Civil Rights and Office of the Secretary

        The Administration strongly urges the Committee to restore the
20-percent reduction made by the Subcommittee to the funding request for
the Office of Civil Rights. This reduction would significantly hamper the
DepartmentD,s ability to enforce laws that prohibit discrimination in
Federally operated or assisted transportation programs. We also urge the
Committee to provide the PresidentD,s requested $62 million for the Office
of the Secretary and to delete the SubcommitteeD,s recommended new account
structure and limitation on political appointees. These changes are
necessary to avoid a reduction-in-force and to allow the Secretary to
manage the department effectively.

 Earmarks

        The Subcommittee has earmarked almost 400 transit projects, as
well as many airport, Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) and rail,
and infrastructure credit projects.  The Administration believes that
projects should be funded based upon their merit and that funds should not
be directed to low-priority projects that cannot meet established
selection criteria.

Language Provisions

         Section 322 would preclude the Department of Transportation from
using project labor agreements (PLAs), which are a contract mechanism to
achieve efficiencies in construction projects.   Furthermore, the provision
is ambiguous, making its full impact difficult to assess and raising
questions as to its applicability to a host of laws and regulations
affecting workers. As noted above, the Secretary of Transportation would
recommend the President veto this bill if it includes section 322.
        The Administration strongly opposes section 342 of the bill, which
would allow helicopters to operate and land on Federally-owned lands in


 Alaska, including wilderness areas." This would be harmful to species and
 habitat and disrupt Congress' carefully crafted balance on this issue in
 the Alaska National Interest Land Conservation Act (ANILCA). Under
 ANILCA, helicopter landings are permitted for emergency reasons and, on a
 case-by-case basis, for non-emergency use in non-wilderness areas.   The
 Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture have previously recommended
 that bills containing similar provisions be vetoed.

        The Administration requests that the Committee delete the
provisions in both the Coast Guard and FAA operating expenses
appropriations language that would prohibit the Coast Guard and the FAA
from evaluating options for collecting fees for their services. User fees
may be a critical means in the future for ensuring that the Coast Guard
and the FAA have adequate resources to meet their operating and capital
needs without significantly reducing other vital transportation programs.


         We look forward to working with the Committee to address our mutual
 concerns.

                                                 Sincerely,




                                                Jacob J. Lew
                                                Acting Director




Identical Letter Sent to The Honorable Ted Stevens,
The Honorable Robert C. Byrd, The Honorable Richard C. Shelby,
and The Honorable Frank R. Lautenberg
